## Question

Do colony stimulating medications stimulate rbcs or just wbcs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether colony-stimulating medications stimulate red blood cells or just white blood cells, and how to distinguish which agents do what. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "colony-stimulating medications" typically refers to in clinical practice. Then, I should verify the hematopoietic lineages each agent targets and whether any have erythroid activity. Next, I will check authoritative sources like FDA labels and oncology guidelines to confirm the clinical effects on RBCs versus WBCs. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and note any exceptions or nuances that could cause confusion, such as stem cell mobilization or multilineage effects of GM-CSF.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't mislead us. In routine clinical usage, "colony-stimulating medications" generally means recombinant myeloid growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, e.g., filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, tbo-filgrastim) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, sargramostim), which are used to prevent or treat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and to mobilize stem cells, not to treat anemia [^115mrbLn] [^114MUvkV] [^1167zzYa].

> Now, I need to check the lineage specificity of G-CSF. G-CSF is lineage-specific for neutrophils; it stimulates proliferation, differentiation, survival, and function of neutrophil precursors and mature neutrophils, with minimal direct effects on other hematopoietic lineages, including erythroid cells, as repeatedly documented in FDA labeling and clinical reviews [^117WKeXs] [^116WTEvs] [^1116uPri]. Wait, let me verify the clinical correlate: in practice, G-CSF reliably increases the absolute neutrophil count and shortens the duration of severe neutropenia, without clinically meaningful increases in RBCs, which aligns with its mechanism and observed pharmacodynamics [^117WKeXs] [^116WTEvs].

> Next, I should review GM-CSF because it is often where confusion arises. GM-CSF supports proliferation of partially committed progenitors along the granulocyte and macrophage pathways and can promote proliferation of megakaryocytic and erythroid progenitors, but other factors are required for complete maturation of those lineages, so clinically meaningful RBC stimulation is not expected from GM-CSF alone [^115ZTYyk]. Hold on, I should verify that nuance: the label acknowledges multilineage progenitor effects, yet the therapeutic indication remains myeloid support, not correction of anemia, reinforcing that GM-CSF does not function as an RBC-stimulating agent in routine care [^115ZTYyk].

> I will now examine the agents that actually stimulate RBCs so I don't conflate categories. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) such as erythropoietin are the standard for treating anemia, including chemotherapy-associated anemia, and they act on the erythroid lineage to increase hemoglobin and reduce transfusion needs, which is a different therapeutic domain from myeloid CSFs [^113wFHDN] [^116CAf5a]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially almost lumped ESAs under "colony-stimulating factors", but that would be imprecise; ESAs are hematopoietic growth factors, yet they are not the CSFs used for neutropenia, and their clinical targets and safety profiles differ substantially [^116CAf5a] [^113wFHDN].

> Let me consider potential sources of confusion and double-check them. Some reviews broadly define "CSFs" to include multiple hematopoietic growth factors, and a few stroke studies list erythropoietin alongside G-CSF under the umbrella of "CSFs", which could imply RBC effects for CSFs in general; however, that broad categorization is misleading for oncology supportive care, where "CSF" in practice refers to G-CSF or GM-CSF for myeloid support, not RBC stimulation [^113uFMzM] [^116xYYZR] [^115mrbLn]. I should confirm that contemporary oncology guidelines and labels consistently restrict CSF use to myeloid indications, with no role in treating anemia, which they do [^114MUvkV] [^1167zzYa] [^117WKeXs].

> But wait, what if stem cell mobilization blurs the picture? G-CSF and GM-CSF mobilize hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells into the circulation, which includes multilineage progenitors, yet this mobilization effect is not equivalent to targeted erythroid stimulation and does not translate into clinically useful RBC augmentation without erythroid-specific support from ESAs, so I should not over-interpret mobilization as RBC stimulation [^114ehB5q] [^111qhA1R] [^115mrbLn]. Hold on, I should verify that this distinction is clear: mobilization increases progenitor availability, but lineage-committed erythropoiesis still requires EPO and appropriate iron support to yield mature RBCs, which is why ESAs remain the therapy for anemia rather than CSFs [^113wFHDN] [^116CAf5a].

> Synthesis and answer: Colony-stimulating medications in routine clinical oncology practice, namely G-CSF and GM-CSF, primarily stimulate white blood cells, particularly neutrophils, and are not used to stimulate red blood cell production. Clinically meaningful RBC stimulation requires erythropoiesis-stimulating agents such as erythropoietin, which are a separate class of hematopoietic growth factors used for anemia management [^115mrbLn] [^117WKeXs] [^115ZTYyk] [^113wFHDN].

Colony-stimulating medications **primarily stimulate white blood cells** (neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells) via G-CSF, GM-CSF, and M-CSF [^116WTEvs] [^115ZTYyk] [^112okbfV]. They do not directly stimulate red blood cell (RBC) production; RBC production is regulated by erythropoietin (EPO), a distinct hormone produced by the kidneys [^117WKeXs] [^113uFMzM]. While GM-CSF can indirectly support erythroid progenitors, **it does not replace EPO** for RBC production [^115ZTYyk].

## Types of colony-stimulating medications

Colony-stimulating medications include **three main types**, each with distinct hematopoietic effects:

| **Colony-stimulating factor** | **Primary target cells** | **Clinical use** |
|-|-|-|
| Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) | Neutrophils | - Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia <br/> - Stem cell mobilization [^114MUvkV] |
| Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) | - Neutrophils <br/> - Monocytes <br/> - Macrophages <br/> - Dendritic cells | - Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia <br/> - Immunomodulation [^11132PJK] |
| Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) | Macrophages | - Experimental <br/> - Limited clinical use [^112okbfV] |

---

## Mechanism of action of colony-stimulating medications

Colony-stimulating medications act by binding to specific receptors on hematopoietic progenitor cells, **initiating signaling cascades** that promote proliferation, differentiation, and survival of target cells [^115ZTYyk]. For example, G-CSF binds to the G-CSF receptor on neutrophil progenitors, stimulating their proliferation and differentiation into mature neutrophils [^117WKeXs].

---

## Effects on white blood cells

Colony-stimulating medications **primarily stimulate white blood cell production**, particularly neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. These cells are essential for immune defense, and their increased production helps prevent infections in patients undergoing chemotherapy or those with immunodeficiencies [^114oP5ce].

---

## Effects on red blood cells

Colony-stimulating medications **do not directly stimulate red blood cell production**. RBC production is primarily regulated by erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced by the kidneys. EPO stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells into mature RBCs. While GM-CSF may indirectly support erythroid progenitors, it **does not replace EPO** in RBC production [^115ZTYyk].

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding the distinction between colony-stimulating medications and erythropoietin is crucial in clinical practice. Colony-stimulating medications are used to manage neutropenia and related complications, whereas **erythropoietin is used to manage anemia** associated with chronic kidney disease, chemotherapy, or other conditions [^113wFHDN].

---

## Summary of key points

- Colony-stimulating medications primarily stimulate white blood cell production [^115mrbLn].
- They do not directly stimulate red blood cell production [^117WKeXs].
- Red blood cell production is regulated by erythropoietin, not colony-stimulating medications [^113wFHDN].
- GM-CSF may indirectly support erythroid progenitors but does not replace erythropoietin [^115ZTYyk].

Colony-stimulating medications **primarily stimulate white blood cell production** and do not directly stimulate red blood cell production. Red blood cell production is regulated by erythropoietin, a distinct hormone.

### Neutrophil biology and the next generation of myeloid growth factors [^113nged6]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2009). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are the body's critical phagocytic cells for defense against bacterial and fungal infections; bone marrow must produce approximately 10 x 10(9) neutrophils/kg/d to maintain normal blood neutrophil counts. Production of neutrophils depends on myeloid growth factors, particularly granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). After the original phase of development, researchers modified these growth factors to increase their size and delay renal clearance, increase their biologic potency, and create unique molecules for business purposes. Pegylated G-CSF is a successful product of these efforts. Researchers have also tried to identify small molecules to serve as oral agents that mimic the parent molecules, but these programs have been less successful. In 2006, the European Medicines Agency established guidelines for the introduction of new biologic medicinal products claimed to be similar to reference products that had previously been granted marketing authorization in the European community, called bio-similars. Globally, new and copied versions of G-CSF and other myeloid growth factors are now appearing. Some properties of the myeloid growth factors are similar to other agents, offering opportunities for the development of alternative drugs and treatments. For example, recent research shows that hematopoietic progenitor cells can be mobilized with a chemokine receptor antagonist, chemotherapy, G-CSF, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Advances in neutrophil biology coupled with better understanding and development of myeloid growth factors offer great promise for improving the care of patients with cancer and many other disorders.

### Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^113wFHDN]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are used in treating cancer- and chemotherapy-induced anemia with the aim of accelerating the recovery of red blood cells (RBCs), reduce the risks associated with RBC transfusions and improve quality of life.

Areas Covered

A systematic review has been conducted to examine the current evidence for the efficacy and safety of using ESAs in hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs).

Expert Opinion

Despite the international recommendations for the use of ESAs in treating different malignancies, there is a lack of guidelines for their use in patients undergoing HSCT. An evaluation of published clinical trials shows that there are no available powerful studies concerning the use of ESAs in this setting, with only heterogeneous and small numbers of patients reported so far. Nevertheless, the more robust and intriguing of these data suggest that the ESA's administration at an appropriate time after the infusion of stem cells may be effective both in autologous and allogeneic HSCTs. New guidelines are required, overseen by an expert in the in the field of stem cell transplantation.

### Biologic and molecular effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in healthy individuals: recent findings and current challenges [^111T9MEo]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) is widely used in healthy donors for collection of peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) for allogeneic transplantation and granulocytes for transfusion. The spectrum of its biologic and molecular activities in healthy individuals is coming into sharper focus, creating a unique set of challenges and clarifying the need to monitor and safeguard donor safety. Accumulating evidence indicates that rhG-CSF effects are not limited to the myeloid cell lineage. This may reflect the presence of functional G-CSF receptors on other cell types and tissues, as well as rhG-CSF-induced modulation of cytokine networks. While most rhG-CSF-induced effects are transient and self-limiting, preliminary, provocative data have suggested the possibility of a more durable effect on the chromosomal integrity of lymphocytes. While these reports have not been validated and have been subject to criticism, they are prompting prospective studies and monitoring efforts to determine whether there is a significant risk of long-term adverse events (eg, hematologic malignancies) in healthy PBPC and granulocyte donors. Based on the totality of information that is currently available, the administration of rhG-CSF to healthy donors for the purpose of PBPC donation continues to have a favorable risk-benefit profile.

### Colony-stimulating factors for chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia [^1164es3o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile neutropenia is a frequent adverse event experienced by people with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy, and is a potentially life-threatening situation. The current treatment is supportive care plus antibiotics. Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), such as granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), are cytokines that stimulate and accelerate the production of one or more cell lines in the bone marrow. Clinical trials have addressed the question of whether the addition of a CSF to antibiotics could improve outcomes in individuals diagnosed with febrile neutropenia. However, the results of these trials are conflicting.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of adding G-CSF or GM-CSF to standard treatment (antibiotics) when treating chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in individuals diagnosed with cancer.

Search Methods

We conducted the search in March 2014 and covered the major electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and SCI. We contacted experts in hematology and oncology and also scanned the citations from the relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared CSF plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia in adults and children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. We performed meta-analysis of the selected studies using Review Manager 5 software.

Main Results

Fourteen RCTs (15 comparisons) including a total of 1553 participants addressing the role of CSF plus antibiotics in febrile neutropenia were included. Overall mortality was not improved by the use of CSF plus antibiotics versus antibiotics alone (hazard ratio (HR) 0.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.16) P = 0.19; 13 RCTs; 1335 participants; low quality evidence). A similar finding was seen for infection-related mortality (HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.47 to 1.20) P = 0.23; 10 RCTs; 897 participants; low quality evidence). Individuals who received CSF plus antibiotics were less likely to be hospitalized for more than 10 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.65 (95% CI 0.44 to 0.95) P = 0.03; 8 RCTs; 1221 participants; low quality evidence) and had more number of participants with a more faster neutrophil recovery (RR 0.52 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.81) P = 0.004; 5 RCTs; 794 participants; moderate quality evidence) than those treated with antibiotics alone. Similarly, participants receiving CSF plus antibiotics had shorter duration of neutropenia (standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.70 (95% CI -2.65 to -0.76) P = 0.0004; 9 RCTs; 1135 participants; moderate quality evidence), faster recovery from fever (SMD -0.49 (95% CI -0.90 to -0.09) P value = 0.02; 9 RCTs; 966 participants; moderate quality evidence) and shorter duration of antibiotics use (SMD -1.50 (95% CI -2.83 to -0.18) P = 0.03; 3 RCTs; 457 participants; low quality evidence) compared with participants receiving antibiotics alone. We found no significant difference in the incidence of deep venous thromboembolism (RR 1.68 (95% CI 0.72 to 3.93) P = 0.23; 4 RCTs; 389 participants; low quality evidence) in individuals treated with CSF plus antibiotics compared with those treated with antibiotics alone. We found higher incidence of bone or joint pain or flu-like symptoms (RR 1.59 (95% CI 1.04 to 2.42) P = 0.03; 6 RCTs; 622 participants; low quality evidence) in individuals treated with CSF plus antibiotics compared with those treated with antibiotics alone. Overall, the methodological quality of studies was moderate to low across different outcomes. The main reasons to downgrade the quality of evidence were inconsistency across the included studies and imprecision of results.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of a CSF plus antibiotics in individuals with chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia had no effect on overall mortality, but reduced the amount of time participants spent in hospital and improved their ability to achieve neutrophil recovery. It was not clear whether CSF plus antibiotics had an effect on infection-related mortality. Participants receiving CSFs had shorter duration of neutropenia, faster recovery from fever and shorter duration of antibiotics use.

### Tbo-filgrastim (Granix) [^112TzMx7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tbo-filgrastim is a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) produced by recombinant DNA technology. Tbo-filgrastim binds to G-CSF receptors and stimulates proliferation of neutrophils. G-CSF is known to stimulate differentiation commitment and some end-cell functional activation, which increases neutrophil counts and activity.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The time to the maximum ANC level was between 3 to 5 days and returned to baseline by 21 days following completion of chemotherapy. Doubling the tbo-filgrastim subcutaneous dose from 5 mcg/kg to 10 mcg/kg resulted in a 16% to 19% increase in the maximum ANC level and a 33% to 36% increase in the area under the effect curve for ANC.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At an intravenous dose of 5 mcg/kg, tbo-filgrastim did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

### Effect of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for patients with COVID-19 and lymphopenia… [^116W2W6t]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Question Can treating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor increase their peripheral blood leukocyte and lymphocyte cell counts and lead to clinical improvement. Findings In this open-label, randomized clinical trial of 200 Chinese patients with COVID-19, lymphopenia, and no comorbidities, rhG-CSF treatment did not accelerate clinical improvement, but the number of patients progressing to critical illness or death may have been reduced, without an increased risk of serious adverse events. To determine whether a therapy that increases peripheral blood leukocyte and lymphocyte cell counts leads to clinical improvement in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting and Participants. Both groups were well matched for baseline variables. Systemic corticosteroids were administered for 25 patients in the rhG-CSF group and 32 patients in the usual care group.

Lopinavir-ritonavir, arbidol, and α-interferon inhalation were administered in 14%, 16%, and 8% of patients in the rhG-CSF group before enrollment, respectively. The therapeutic effects of rhG-CSF were inconsistent among the subgroups with different PBL cell counts and oxygen therapy. Because our main study assumption was that rhG-CSF modulated the trafficking of PBL and patients requiring high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy or noninvasive mechanical ventilation consistently had PBL cell counts of 400 per μL or less, we performed a post hoc subgroup analysis based on PBL cell counts. In these analyses, rhG-CSF was associated with accelerated clinical improvement and a decreased rate of progression to critical conditions or death in patients with a PBL cell count of 400 per μL or less.

In preliminary findings from a randomized clinical trial, treatment of patients with COVID-19 with lymphopenia and no comorbidities did not change the time to clinical improvement. However, rhG-CSF treatment led to rapid restoration of the lymphocyte and NK cell counts and appeared to decrease the frequency of patients progressing to critical illness or death.

Regarding preventative measures for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to G-CSFs, indications, ASCO 2015 guidelines recommend to initiate primary prophylaxis with a colony-stimulating factor starting in the first cycle and continuing through subsequent cycles of chemotherapy in patients with an approximately 20% or higher risk for FN based on patient-, disease-, and treatment-related factors. Administer primary colony-stimulating factor prophylaxis in patients receiving dose-dense chemotherapy when appropriate. Consider alternative, equally effective, and safe chemotherapy regimens not requiring colony-stimulating factor support when available.

### The ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely Campaign: 5 hematologic tests and treatments to question [^111BKdNp]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2021). High credibility.

ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely — granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in pediatric autoimmune neutropenia (AIN) — advises: "Avoid routine administration of G-CSF for prophylaxis in children with asymptomatic autoimmune neutropenia and no history of recurrent or severe infections". The page characterizes AIN as "affecting 1 in 100 000 children in the United States annually, with a median age at diagnosis of 8 to 11 months (range, 3–38 months)", and reports that "Almost all children with AIN normalize their absolute neutrophil counts within a median of 20 months (range, 6–54 months) with no risk of recurrence". Evidence for prophylaxis is limited: "Two recent studies report administering G-CSF in 7.5% to 16% of children with AIN", yet "there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of G-CSF as a prophylaxis strategy for improving health outcomes". Potential harms and stewardship are emphasized: "The unnecessary routine use of G-CSF could lead to intolerable adverse effects, such as bone pain from excess neutrophil pool expansion in the marrow, injection site pain or infection, and avoidable high health care costs", and use "should be guided by assessment of infection risks using the minimal effective dose to avoid unnecessary adverse effects".

### Characterisation of a novel Fc conjugate of macrophage colony-stimulating factor [^1111rZkh]. Molecular Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The mononuclear phagocyte system is a family of cells comprising progenitors in the bone marrow (BM), circulating monocytes, and tissue macrophages. The proliferation, differentiation, and survival of these cells depends upon macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF1). Mutations in the CSF1 locus produce pleiotropic effects on many tissues, reflecting many roles of macrophages in development and homeostasis. A subset of these effects can be mimicked by prolonged treatment with a blocking antibody against the CSF1 receptor (CSF1R). A Csf1r -enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgene provides a marker for macrophages in tissues, and enables monitoring of the impacts of treatments that may alter tissue macrophage numbers. The effects of the blocking antibody supported the concept that macrophage survival/replacement in most tissues, with possible exception of the lung, requires continuous CSF1R signaling.

Monocyte and macrophage numbers can be increased above the normal homeostatic levels by CSF1 treatment. Recombinant CSF1 has been tested in clinical trials for several indications, but has not yet found a clinical application. The original studies when the molecule was cloned focussed on cancer therapy as the indication. Further studies have been constrained by the cost of the agent. CSF1 has a very short half-life in the circulation of mice (1.6 hours), being cleared by CSF1R-mediated internalisation and degradation by Kupffer cells of the liver. Renal excretion becomes the major mechanism of clearance when the receptor-mediated clearance is saturated. The 150 amino acid active CSF1 protein produced in bacteria is well below the renal clearance threshold of around 68 kDa (the size of albumin), and consequently the majority of any injected bolus dose is rapidly removed by the kidney. Early studies of human CSF1 actions in mice by Hume et al.used the large glycoprotein form of the protein produced in mammalian cell culture. It was active with daily injections of 0.5–1 mg/kg. In subsequent studies using the smaller protein expressed in bacteria a 5–10-fold higher dose was required to achieve an increase in circulating monocyte numbers.

### Colony-stimulating factors in inflammation and autoimmunity [^114atTxr]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Although they were originally defined as haematopoietic-cell growth factors, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) have been shown to have additional functions by acting directly on mature myeloid cells. Recent data from animal models indicate that the depletion of CSFs has therapeutic benefit in many inflammatory and/or autoimmune conditions and as a result, early-phase clinical trials targeting granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage colony-stimulating factor have now commenced. The distinct biological features of CSFs offer opportunities for specific targeting, but with some associated risks. Here, I describe these biological features, discuss the probable specific outcomes of targeting CSFs in vivo and highlight outstanding questions that need to be addressed.

### Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors in cancer therapy [^112FYq1F]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Direct and indirect regulation of immune suppression or stimulation by tumor associated macrophage subtypes. Macrophage polarization within the tumor microenvironment is highly dependent on the local cytokine milieu which originates either from tumor cells, other stromal cells such as immune cells or fibroblasts, as well as macrophages themselves. The M2 TAM phenotype is a consequence of the continuous presence of growth factors such as colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) as well as CD4+ T cell-derived T h 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and IL-10 (5). Besides the direct tumor growth promoting abilities of M2 TAM (not illustrated here), these macrophages efficiently suppress immune effector functions that are able to contribute to tumor cell elimination (3,4). This silencing of immune effector cells is achieved by producing cytokines and enzymes that may directly suppress effector cells or indirectly via other immune cell types such as intratumoral dendritic cells (DC), T regulatory cells (Treg cells) and Type 2 helper T cells. In contrast, M1 TAM are attributed with tumoricidal functions and are generated in the presence of GM-CSF and pro-inflammatory stimuli like IFNγ, LPS or TNFα (5). Tumoricidal function can either be achieved through direct killing of tumor cells or by producing cytokines/chemokines that are activating/recruiting other immune stimulatory immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells like Treg cells. Eventually a predominant M1 TAM phenotype may result in an anti-tumor immune effector cell activation. Published data suggest that tumor promoting and immune suppressive M2 macrophages/TAM are dependent on CSF1R mediated signals (31) making this receptor an attractive target to eliminate or repolarize these cells

### Filgrastim (Neupogen) [^117WKeXs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and stimulating proliferation‚ differentiation commitment‚ and some end-cell functional activation.

Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes‚ fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation‚ differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability‚ priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst‚ antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies‚ NEUPOGEN administration resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether NEUPOGEN was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily)‚ subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)‚ or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of NEUPOGEN therapy‚ neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemoluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro.

The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving NEUPOGEN; however‚ the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of NEUPOGEN. Increases in lymphocyte counts following NEUPOGEN administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer.

White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift)‚ including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts‚ usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition‚ Dohle bodies‚ increased granulocyte granulation‚ and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection.

### Colony stimulating factors (including erythropoietin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor and analogues) for stroke [^116xYYZR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Colony stimulating factors (CSFs), also called haematopoietic growth factors, regulate bone marrow production of circulating red and white cells, and platelets. They have been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental stroke. Some CSFs also mobilise the release of bone marrow stem cells into the circulation.

Objectives

We systematically assessed the effects of CSFs on functional outcome and haematology measures in patients with acute or subacute stroke enrolled into randomised controlled trials.

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched February 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1985 to March 2006), EMBASE (1985 to November 2005), and Science Citation Index (1985 to November 2005). In an attempt to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we contacted manufacturers and principal investigators of trials (last contacted 2005). We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.

Selection Criteria

Unconfounded randomised controlled trials recruiting patients with acute or subacute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke were included. CSFs included stem cell factor (SCF), erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, CSF-1), and thrombopoietin (TPO), or analogues of these. The primary outcome was functional outcome (assessed as combined death or disability and dependency using scales such as the modified Rankin Scale or Barthel Index) at the end of the trial. Secondary outcomes included safety at the end of treatment (death, impairment, deterioration, extension or recurrence), death at the end of follow up, and haematology measures (blood counts at or around day seven after treatment commenced).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data on measures by intention to treat (where available) were collected and analysed as dichotomous or continuous outcomes, as relevant, using random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed.

Main Results

No large trials were identified. EPO therapy was associated with a non-significant reduction in neurological impairment in one small trial (n = 40 participants) but had no significant effect on haematological measures. Further small trials of EPO and G-CSF are ongoing.

Authors' Conclusions

No large trials of EPO, G-CSF or other colony stimulating factors have been performed and it is too early to know whether CSFs improve functional outcome.

### Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for sepsis: a meta-analysis [^114SddPG]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

To investigate the effects of G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy in non-neutropenic patients with sepsis.

Methods

A systematic literature search of Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted using specific search terms. A manual review of references was also performed. Eligible studies were randomized control trials (RCTs) that compared granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) therapy with placebo for the treatment of sepsis in adults. Main outcome measures were all-cause mortality at 14 days and 28 days after initiation of G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy, in-hospital mortality, reversal rate from infection, and adverse events.

Results

Twelve RCTs with 2,380 patients were identified. In regard to 14-day mortality, a total of 9 death events occurred among 71 patients (12.7%) in the treatment group compared with 13 events among 67 patients (19.4%) in the placebo groups. Meta-analysis showed there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality when G-CSF or GM-CSF were compared with placebo (relative risks (RR) = 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.79 to 1.11, P = 0.44; P for heterogeneity = 0.31, I² = 15%). Compared with placebo, G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy did not significantly reduce in-hospital mortality (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.36, P = 0.86; P for heterogeneity = 0.80, I² = 0%). However, G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy significantly increased the reversal rate from infection (RR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.62, P = 0.002; P for heterogeneity = 0.47, I² = 0%). No significant difference was observed in adverse events between groups (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.23, P = 0.62; P for heterogeneity = 0.03, I² = 58%). Sensitivity analysis by excluding one trial did not significantly change the results of adverse events (RR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.32, P = 0.44; P for heterogeneity = 0.17, I² = 36%).

Conclusions

There is no current evidence supporting the routine use of G-CSF or GM-CSF in patients with sepsis. Large prospective multicenter clinical trials investigating monocytic HLA-DR (mHLA-DR)-guided G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy in patients with sepsis-associated immunosuppression are warranted.

### Acute myeloid leukemia, version 3.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115WiEcc]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Growth factors (G-CSF or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) use in AML and APL — induction, consolidation, and postremission guidance: Growth factors are not recommended during induction for patients with APL. In AML (non-APL), growth factors may be considered during induction for patients who are septic and who have a life-threatening infection in an attempt to shorten the duration of neutropenia, and some regimens such as FLAG incorporate G-CSF into the regimen. Because the use of growth factors may complicate the interpretation of marrow results, there is a recommendation to discontinue colony-stimulating factors at least a week before a planned marrow sample to assess remission status. There is no evidence for whether growth factors have a positive or negative impact on long-term outcome if used during consolidation. For postremission therapy, growth factors may be considered as part of supportive care but are not routinely recommended, except in life-threatening infections or when signs and symptoms of sepsis are present and the leukemia is believed to be in remission.

### Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for sepsis: a meta-analysis [^116nqf5S]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Administration of G-CSF or GM-CSF theoretically may increase the prevalence of adverse events which include immunologically mediated organ dysfunction, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), to which patients with severe sepsis are particularly prone. However, Tanaka et al demonstrated that G-CSF caused leukocyte stiffness but attenuated inflammatory response without inducing lung injury in septic patients. Another two studies showed that administration of G-CSF appeared to be safe in patients with pneumonia and severe sepsis. Recently, Presneill et al. demonstrated that low-dose GM-CSF was associated with improved gas exchange without pulmonary neutrophil infiltration and was not associated with worsened acute respiratory distress syndrome or the multiple organ dysfunction syndromes in patients with sepsis-associated respiratory dysfunction. Consistent with these studies, our meta-analysis suggested that G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy did not significantly increase the rate of adverse events (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.70 to 1.23, P = 0.62; P for heterogeneity = 0.03, I² = 58%). Definitions of adverse events in included studies were heterogeneous and sometimes absent, which might bring about heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis did not significantly change the results of adverse events (RR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.84 to 1.32, P = 0.44; P for heterogeneity = 0.17, I² = 36%).

There are several limitations that need to be considered in the present study. First, the geographic regions covered in this meta-analysis included North America (United States, Mexico and Canada), Europe (Belgium, Germany and Spain), Asia (Japan and Thailand) and Oceania (Australia). Therefore, our results limited generalizability to other regions (for example, Africa and Latin America). Second, considerable heterogeneity existed in the type and dosage of G-CSF and GM-CSF. Different baseline characteristics such as age and APACHE II score might have affected the outcome of patients' response to medical management and might have produced possible clinical heterogeneity. Finally, the sample sizes were highly variable across trials and the trial enrolling the maximum number of patients contained 42 times as many subjects as the two trials enrolling the minimum number of patients.

Regarding preventative measures for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to G-CSFs, indications, ASCO 2015 guidelines recommend to consider administering colony-stimulating factors alone, after chemotherapy, or in combination with plerixafor, as an adjunct to progenitor-cell transplantation to mobilize peripheral-blood progenitor cells. Recognize that the choice of mobilization strategy depends in part on the type of cancer and type of transplantation.

### G-CSF and GM-CSF as therapeutic targets in rheumatoid arthritis [^112PvCSW]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are well-recognized regulators of hematopoiesis and have an established role as growth factors in clinical practice. G-CSF and GM-CSF regulate myeloid cell production, differentiation and activation, and might also be important for driving inflammatory responses. Inappropriate engagement of this pathway could be a critical amplification mechanism when maladaptive immune responses predispose to autoimmunity and sterile tissue inflammation. We postulate that antagonism of G-CSF or GM-CSF could represent a novel therapeutic approach for a variety of autoimmune-mediated inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis.

(v) 2006 Comment: Studies to confirm the risk/benefit ratio of the use of cytokines alone (e.g. granulocyte colony stimulating factor) or in conjunction with stem/progenitor cell therapy.

2016 Comment

A number of studies have been conducted over the last 10 years to understand the benefits of cytokine therapy alone or in combination with cell therapy. It appears that cytokine therapy alone does not lead to sustained beneficial effects whilst combination therapy may well bring synergistic benefits.

New recommendation

The paracrine theory is unlikely to yield clear candidate proteins given the complexity and likely interaction of many factors. Synergistic combinations of cytokine and autologous cell therapy should be explored based on promising early results. The paracrine hypothesis is likely to be superseded by new biological/small molecule strategies.

### Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: molecular mechanisms of action during steady state and' emergency' hematopoiesis [^111SrQGR]. Cytokine (2008). Low credibility.

Neutrophils are phagocytes whose principal function is to maintain anti-bacterial immunity. Neutrophils ingest and kill invading bacteria, releasing cytotoxic, chemotactic and inflammatory mediators at sites of infection. This serves to control the immediate host immune response and attract other cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, which are important for establishing long-term adaptive immunity. Neutrophils thus contribute to both the initiation and the maintenance of inflammation at sites of infection. Aberrant neutrophil activity is deleterious; suppressed responses can cause extreme susceptibility to infection while overactivation can lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage. This review will focus on neutrophil regulation by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), the principal cytokine controlling neutrophil development and function. The review will emphasize the molecular aspects of G-CSF-driven granulopoiesis in steady state (healthy) conditions and during demand-driven or 'emergency' conditions elicited by infection or clinical administration of G-CSF. Understanding the molecular control of granulopoiesis will aid in the development of new approaches designed to treat disorders of neutrophil production and function.

### Pegfilgrastim: a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor with sustained duration of action [^114Uh7i1]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim (Neupogen, Amgen, Inc.) and pegfilgrastim (Neulasta, Amgen, Inc.) are frequently used in clinical practice for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and its potentially life-threatening complications. Due to its unique neutrophil-mediated clearance, pegfilgrastim can be administered once per chemotherapy cycle. Clinical trials have shown that a single, fixed subcutaneous dose of pegfilgrastim 6 mg is comparable in safety and efficacy to daily injections of filgrastim for decreasing the incidence of infection following myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with cancer. Postregistrational trials have been conducted to evaluate the use of pegfilgrastim with emerging dose-dense regimens, in myeloid cancers and for mobilisation and engraftment of autologous stem cells. Ongoing clinical trials continue to explore further potential uses for pegfilgrastim.

### Anti-colony-stimulating factor therapies for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases [^114Fk1ca]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2016). Medium credibility.

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; also known as CSF1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) can each play a part in the host response to injury and infection, and there is burgeoning interest in targeting these CSFs in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, as well as in cancer. For success in clinical medicine, therapeutic targeting will need to be delineated from current strategies. The individual CSFs have unique biological roles, suggesting that they could be used to target specific conditions. This Review compares the CSFs, with a focus on how they could be targeted, discusses the relevant clinical trial data and summarizes the potential clinical applications of targeting each CSF. Importantly, we discuss the novelty of CSF biology and attempt to clarify some of the surrounding misconceptions and issues that can affect therapeutic decisions.

### Safety update on erythropoiesis-stimulating agents: trials within and outside the accepted indications [^11266LMM]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Certain studies in which erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have been given not with the aim of correcting anemia but to achieve higher target levels of hemoglobin have shown significantly poorer survival among treated patients. However, studies in which ESAs were administered with the aim of reducing the need for RBC transfusions in patients with chemotherapy-associated anemia demonstrate that the use of these agents is not associated with any adverse effect on survival when compared with placebo controls. We can therefore be reassured that using ESAs within the labeled indications will not adversely affect patient outcome.

Materials and methods

We followed the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for reporting our meta-analysis and results.

Search strategy

We searched Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (to 25 October 2010) to identify potentially relevant trials. We restricted the search to trials on adults and used the search terms "granulocyte colony-stimulating factor", "granulocyte colony stimulating factor, recombinant", "GCSF", "filgrastim", "lenograstim", "sargramostim", "pegfilgrastim", "granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor", "granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, recombinant", "GMCSF", "molgramostim", AND "sepsis", "septicemia", "septicaemia", "septic shock". We restricted the findings of this search with a highly sensitive search strategy recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration for identifying all randomized controlled trials. In addition, we checked the reference lists of identified trials and previous relevant meta-analyses identified by the electronic search to find other potentially eligible trials. There was no language restriction for the search. Authors of papers were contacted when results were unclear or when relevant data were not reported.

Study selection

We considered trials that investigated the therapeutic effects of G-CSF or GM-CSF administered intravenously or subcutaneously in adults with sepsis. Sepsis was defined according to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine consensus criteria or was extrapolated to these criteria if not provided. Trials that allowed concurrent use of other therapies, including antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, steroids, bronchodilators and so on were included if they allowed equal access to such medications for patients in both arms of the trial. Randomized controlled trials specifically involving neutropenic patients or patients following chemotherapy were excluded. Agreement between reviewers regarding trial inclusion was assessed using the Cohen К statistic.

### Not all hematopoietic growth factors are created equal: should we gain information for their use with immunotherapy? [^115YigU3]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Myeloid growth factors, either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage CSF, are widely used to reduce the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia by prophylactic or therapeutic administration. However, their activity in the novel therapeutic regimens, which often rely on the association between immunotherapy and chemotherapy, has not been thoroughly characterized yet. This paper presents some of the preclinical and clinical research regarding the putative interplay between myeloid growth factors and the immune system, advocating further studies to elucidate their potential positive or negative consequences on the outcomes when administered with immunotherapeutic agents.

All-cause mortality at 28 days

Data for 28-day mortality were extracted from nine trials (n = 2,133). There were 177/1,067 (16.6%) deaths in the treatment group compared with 188/1,066 (17.6%) in the placebo group. Among these trials, there was no significant difference in 28-day mortality between the treatment group and placebo group (RR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.11, P = 0.44; P for heterogeneity = 0.31, I² = 15%; Figure 3). Subgroup analysis of six trials (n = 2,044) showed that G-CSF therapy was not associated with a significant reduction in 28-day mortality (RR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.14, P = 0.60; P for heterogeneity = 0.13, I² = 41%). Meanwhile, subgroup analysis of the other three trials of GM-CSF (n = 89) did not show significant difference (RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.31 to 1.40, P = 0.28; P for heterogeneity = 0.91, I² = 0%).

### Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for sepsis: a meta-analysis [^11279WDw]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Data extraction

Full text versions of all eligible trials were obtained for quality assessment and data extraction independently by two reviewers. Extracted data were entered into Microsoft Excel 2007 and were checked by a third reviewer. Disagreement or doubt was resolved by discussion. Abstracted data included study design (for example, date of conduct and sample size), patient characteristics, study methodology (for example, eligibility criteria, method of randomization, and blinding), intervention (for example, G-CSF and GM-CSF dosage, duration and route of administration) and main outcomes. The quality of trials was assessed with the methods recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration for assessing risk of bias. The criteria used for quality assessment were sequence generation of allocation, allocation concealment, blinding, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. Each criterion was categorized as 'yes', 'no', or 'unclear', and the summary assessments of the risk of bias for each important outcome within and across studies was categorized as 'low risk of bias', 'unclear risk of bias' and 'high risk of bias'.

The primary outcomes of this meta-analysis were all-cause mortality at 14 days and 28 days after initiation of G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, reversal rate from infection, and adverse events. The definition of reversal of infection referred to resolution of all signs, symptoms and laboratory assessment of infection or recovery from sepsis, which varied among trials due to different origins of sepsis. Adverse events were defined as organ dysfunction that was life threatening, required treatment and prolongation hospitalization, or was associated with death of the patient.

Statistical analysis

Analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis. We calculated a weighted treatment effect across trials using fixed-effect model. The results were expressed as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes. We considered using random-effects model only in case of heterogeneity (P- value of χ 2 test less than 0.10 and I 2 greater than 50%). Potential sources of heterogeneity were identified by subgroup analysis on the basis of G-CSF and GM-CSF or/and by sensitivity analyses performed by omitting one study in each turn and investigating the influence of a single study on the overall meta-analysis estimate. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. A P- value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using Review Manager, version 5.0 (RevMan, The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK).

HSPC mobilization effects

To date several substances are approved for HSPC mobilization: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, and plerixafor (AMD3100). G-CSF and GM-CSF, acting via their respective receptors on monocytes/macrophages and neural cells in the niche, do not only stimulate granulopoiesis, but induce also signaling that leads to loss of osteoblasts and reduced expression of CXCL12, VCAM-1, and stem cell factor on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) which eventually results in the release of HSPCs from the niche into the peripheral blood. Plerixafor specifically blocks the interaction of CXCR4 on HSPCs with its ligand CXCL12 on MSC and osteoblasts hereby mobilizing the HSCs into the blood. Currently, G-CSF is most commonly used for HSPC mobilization (GM-CSF is no longer available in some countries). Besides other CXCR4 antagonists than plerixafor, further mobilization agent developments are underway targeting HSC-niche cell interactions such as inhibiting integrin α4β1 on HSCs, or stimulating chemokine receptor CXCR2 on neutrophils (mouse study, no erythroid cells reported). These mobilizing agents can enhance the HSPC frequency in the peripheral blood about 40 times allowing collections of more than 10 million CD34+ cells per kg of the recipient's body weight, where plerixafor acts faster and is more effective when combined with G-CSF. But are there individual effects of mobilization agents on HSC? Indeed, various studies in humans, nonhuman primates, and rodents reported different mobilization effects on distinct HSC populations. The combinatory application of plerixafor with G-CSF can not only increase the total yield of CD34+, but specifically immature CD34 + CD38low phenotpyes, and plerixafor is specifically potent to mobilize long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) and SRCs compared to G-CSF (Table 1). Additionally, HSPC mobilized with plerixafor feature different miRNA and cDNA expression signatures compared to HSPCs mobilized with G-CSF.

The four colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are glycoproteins that regulate the generation and some functions of infection-protective granulocytes and macrophages. Recombinant granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) have now been used to increase dangerously low white blood cell levels in many millions of cancer patients following chemotherapy. These CSFs also release haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood, and these cells have now largely replaced bone marrow as more effective populations for transplantation to cancer patients who have treatment-induced bone marrow damage.

### Interaction of colony-stimulating factors and fluorodeoxyglucose f (18) positron emission tomography [^114Smn59]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate reports of altered diagnostic images with fluorodeoxyglucose F(18) (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) after treatment with colony-stimulating factors (CSFs).

Data Sources

Literature was identified by a MEDLINE search (1966-December 2001). Key search terms included granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, fluorodeoxyglucose, and emission-computed tomography. English language literature was reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Reports have suggested altered FDG PET images following CSF treatment. Studies that assessed the effect of CSF administration on FDG PET imaging of the bone and bone marrow were reviewed.

Conclusions

Administration of CSFs may interfere with accurate FDG PET imaging. Separating FDG PET imaging from CSF therapy by ≥ 5 days may diminish this interference.

### Hematopoietic cytokines [^116CAf5a]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The production of hematopoietic cells is under the tight control of a group of hematopoietic cytokines. Each cytokine has multiple actions mediated by receptors whose cytoplasmic domains contain specialized regions initiating the various responses-survival, proliferation, differentiation commitment, maturation, and functional activation. Individual cytokines can be lineage specific or can regulate cells in multiple lineages, and for some cell types, such as stem cells or megakaryocyte progenitors, the simultaneous action of multiple cytokines is required for proliferative responses. The same cytokines control basal and emergency hematopoietic cell proliferation. Three cytokines, erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, have now been in routine clinical use to stimulate cell production and in total have been used in the management of many millions of patients. In this little review, discussion will be restricted to those cytokines well established as influencing the production of hematopoietic cells and will exclude newer candidate regulators and those active on lymphoid cells. As requested, this account will describe the cytokines in a historical manner, using a sequential format of discovery, understanding, validation, and puzzlement, a sequence that reflects the evolving views on these cytokines over the past 50 years.

### Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for sepsis: a meta-analysis [^116PbHE6]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

In-hospital mortality

In-hospital mortality for patients who were treated with G-CSF or GM-CSF was 54/501 (10.8%), and that for patients treated with placebo was 54/495 (10.9%), according to five trials with available data. Compared with placebo, G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy was not associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality, and no heterogeneity was detected across trials (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.36, P = 0.86; P for heterogeneity = 0.80, I² = 0%; Figure 4). Subgroup analysis of three trials (n = 945) showed that G-CSF therapy was not associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality (RR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.67 to 1.45, P = 0.95; P for heterogeneity = 0.67, I² = 0%). Meanwhile, subgroup analysis of the other two trials of GM-CSF (n = 51) did not show significant difference between the GM-CSF group and placebo group (RR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.47 to 1.75, P = 0.76; P for heterogeneity = 0.38, I² = 0%).

### Old drug, new use: recent advances for G-CSF [^115B7f4f]. Cytokine (2024). Medium credibility.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), also known as colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3), is a proinflammatory cytokine that primarily stimulates the survival, proliferation, differentiation and function of neutrophil granulocyte progenitor cells and mature neutrophils. Over the past years, G-CSF has mainly been used to cure patients with neutropenia and as a part of chemotherapy to induct the remission for refractory/relapse leukemia. Recent studies showed that C-CSF can been used as condition regimens and as a part of preventive methods after allogeneic transplantation to improve the survival of patients and also has immunoregulation, and has promote or inhibit the proliferation of solid tumors. Therefore, in this review, we firstly describe the structure for G-CSF. Then its functions and mechanism were reviewed including the neutrophil mobilization, differentiation, migration, and inhibiting apoptosis of neutrophils, and its immunoregulation. Finally, the clinical applications were further discussed.

### A novel neuroprotectant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [^114N1irD]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a growth factor that orchestrates the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells. It has been used for many years in clinical practice to accelerate the recovery of patients from neutropenia after cytotoxic therapy. However, there is a growing body of evidence from experimental studies suggesting that G-CSF also has important nonhematopoietic functions in the central nervous system.

Summary Of Review

The presence of the G-CSF/G-CSF-receptor system in the brain and its role in neuroprotection and neural tissue repair has been investigated in many recent studies. The neuroprotective actions of G-CSF have mainly been attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. Furthermore, it induces neurogenesis and angiogenesis and improves functional recovery. In this review, we summarize the role of G-CSF and the corresponding signal transduction pathways regulated by G-CSF in neuroprotection.

Conclusions

Much additional work is needed to better understand the precise mechanisms of G-CSF-induced neuroprotection. However, there is emerging data suggesting that G-CSF is a potential new agent for neuroprotection.

### Modulation of colony stimulating factor release and apoptosis in human colon cancer cells by anticancer drugs [^111gFvsu]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of cancer widely relies on the use of cytotoxic drugs. Anticancer drugs interfere with different steps involved in the processes of cell division and so damage cancerous cells. In many instances these drug effects are now known to be via influences on the apoptotic pathway. In addition, there is now an increasing interest in manipulating the body's immune response against cancer cells. Indeed, genetic therapies aimed at increasing the secretion of certain cytokines by cancer cells seem to have potential as a mode of increasing the host response against tumour progression. In particular, increasing the secretion of the colony stimulating factors (CSFs) granulocyte-macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) or granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) by colon adenocarcinoma, melanoma, lung or renal carcinoma, fibrosarcoma, B-cell lymphoma or acute myeloid leukemic cells prevents the formation of tumours by these cells and results in the elimination of pre-established cancer in mice.

In addition to their recently noted effects on cancer cells, CSFs such as G-CSF, GM-CSF or macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) have multiple biological activities. These biological activities include the ability to stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of multipotential bone marrow progenitor cells into mature granulocytes and macrophages. There is evidence that CSFs stimulate the phagocytic and cytocidal activity of macrophages and promote monocyte and neutrophil antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. They may also play a major role in the maturation of dendritic cells into potent activators of resting T cells. In fact, the beneficial effect of CSF secretion by cancer cells appears to be due to the increased recruitment and activity of phagocytic cells as well as to an enhancement of the antigen presentation activity and T-cell mediated cytotoxicity.

We have observed that human colon cancer cells are able to secrete G-CSF, M-CSF and GM-CSF. However, the mechanisms modulating these releases are incompletely understood. Moreover, the potential effects of anti-cancer drugs on CSF release by these cells have not been investigated. Thus, here we have assessed the influences of a number of different anticancer drugs on the release of G-CSF, M-CSF and GM-CSF. Additionally, we have evaluated whether the effects of these drugs on CSF secretion depend upon the induction of cell apoptosis.

### Prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors: where are we now? [^112YeAp4]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Are the G-CSFs different?

The non-PEGylated G-CSFs, standard G-CSF (filgrastim) and glycosylated G-CSF (lenograstim) appear to be broadly comparable in efficacy. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that pegfilgrastim — a PEGylated formulation of filgrastim with neutrophil-regulated pharmacokinetics that is given as a single dose once per cycle — is more effective than filgrastim. A meta-analysis of five studies in a total of 617 patients treated for breast cancer or lymphoma showed that a single dose of pegfilgrastim was significantly more effective than 10–14 days of filgrastim in reducing FN (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43–0.97). Data from the larger meta-analysis by Kuderer et al. also suggest that pegfilgrastim was more effective than either lenograstim or filgrastim, although it must be noted that the pegfilgrastim data came from a single study (Fig. 3). These findings might reflect the sustained stimulation of bone marrow by pegfilgrastim throughout the period of neutropenia.

Colony-Stimulating Factors

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) have been shown to act directly on the respective receptors on DRG neurons, causing sensitization. G-CSF is the primary driver of neutrophil differentiation. Binding of G-CSF to its receptor induces signal transduction through STAT3, PI3K, and ERK. Recombinant G-CSF filgrastim and lenograstim are clinically used for neutrophil regeneration after chemotherapy or myeloablation. Adverse effects include inflammation, swelling, pain, and stinging; the most common adverse effect of pegfilgrastim and lenograstim is bone pain. In addition, there seems to be a role for microglia in G-CSF-driven neuronal hyperexcitability. G-CSF monoclonal antibodies have entered clinical trials and show some promise for the treatment of persistent pain following inflammation resolution.

GM-CSF is principally expressed in myeloid precursors, mature monocytes, and granulocytes. The respective receptor is found on myeloid cells, in particular monocytes and granulocytes. GM-CSF signals through JAK2/STAT5a/b in addition to PI3K, RAS/MAPK, and NF-κB. Recombinant GM-CSF accelerates wound healing, with an obvious implication of inhibition of this mechanism. Studies using GM-CSF knockout mice and monoclonal antibodies against GM-CSF have shown that the cytokine is key in the development of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis–associated pain. Moreover, silencing GM-CSF signaling in a model of peripheral nerve ligation induced analgesia, supporting a role in neuropathic pain upon intrathecal and not peripheral delivery of anti-GM-CSF receptor antibodies. Clinical studies involving mavrilimumab were promising for targeting this pathway in rheumatoid arthritis and could be explored further as a tool for providing analgesia in inflammatory conditions.

Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF or CSF1) expression is increased in DRG neurons following peripheral nerve injury with the M-CSF receptor mRNA being induced in spinal microglia. Recombinant M-CSF given intrathecally led to mechanical allodynia, while blocking its receptor suppressed mechanical allodynia after SNI.

### Sargramostim (Leukine) [^115ZTYyk]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Sargramostim (GM-CSF) belongs to a group of growth factors termed colony-stimulating factors which support survival, clonal expansion, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells. GM-CSF induces partially committed progenitor cells to divide and differentiate in the granulocyte-macrophage pathways which include neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages and myeloid-derived dendritic cells.

GM-CSF is also capable of activating mature granulocytes and macrophages. GM-CSF is a multilineage factor and, in addition to dose-dependent effects on the myelomonocytic lineage, can promote the proliferation of megakaryocytic and erythroid progenitors. However, other factors are required to induce complete maturation in these two lineages. The various cellular responses (i.e., division, maturation, activation) are induced through GM-CSF binding to specific receptors expressed on the cell surface of target cells.

The biological activity of GM-CSF is species-specific. Consequently, in vitro studies have been performed on human cells to characterize the pharmacological activity of GM-CSF. In vitro exposure of human bone marrow cells to GM-CSF at concentrations ranging from 1–100 ng/mL results in the proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors and in the formation of pure granulocyte, pure macrophage, and mixed granulocyte macrophage colonies. Chemotactic, anti-fungal, and anti-parasitic activities of granulocytes and monocytes are increased by exposure to GM-CSF in vitro. GM-CSF increases the cytotoxicity of monocytes toward certain neoplastic cell lines and activates polymorphonuclear neutrophils to inhibit the growth of tumor cells.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

LEUKINE stimulates hematopoietic precursor cells and increases neutrophil, eosinophil, megakaryocyte, macrophage, and dendritic cell production. In AML adult patients undergoing induction chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.1)], LEUKINE at daily doses of 250 mcg/m2significantly shortened the median duration of ANC < 500/mm3by 4 days and < 1000/mm3by 7 days following induction; 75% of patients receiving sargramostim achieved ANC greater than 500/mm3by day 16 compared to day 25 for patients receiving placebo. Animal data and clinical data in humans suggest a correlation between sargramostim exposure and the duration of severe neutropenia as a predictor of efficacy. At doses of 250 mcg/m2(approximately 7 mcg/kg in a 70 kg human with a body surface area of 1.96), daily LEUKINE treatment reduced the duration of severe neutropenia.

### Stimulatory versus suppressive effects of GM-CSF on tumor progression in multiple cancer types [^11132PJK]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The hematopoietic growth factor granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) regulates hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor cell differentiation into dendritic cells (DCs), granulocytes, and macrophages in the bone marrow. In clinical oncology, immune responses against multiple infectious agents or cancer cells are activated by GM-CSF acting as an immune stimulant to increase various immune cell activities. These encouraging results have led to numerous clinical trials of GM-CSF to evaluate whether it can enhance antitumor immune responses against a number of cancer types by promoting the activation, maturation and migration of various immune cells that may result in successful tumor treatment. In addition, a growing body of evidence suggests that GM-CSF is produced and secreted by a wide variety of non-immune cell types, including fibroblasts, keratinocytes and endothelial cells in response to appropriate stimuli. GM-CSF promotes the growth and migration of tumor cells by enhancing the expression of MMPs, and it induces keratinocyte growth, thereby accelerating wound healing. Because of these effects, GM-CSF has been used in adjuvant tumor therapies. However, the value of GM-CSF is still highly controversial because of its different effects on tumor progression depending on the tumor type or cancer model. A large body of experimental evidence indicates that GM-CSF can act as a tumor-derived factor that may promote tumor growth and progression. In multiple cancer models, constitutive GM-CSF protein expression and secretion has been observed, frequently together with its conjugate receptors. An increased level of GM-CSF in serum is considered a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker indicating poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Enhanced GM-CSF protein levels, together with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor, were found to be significantly associated with invasion and poor prognosis in patients with head and neck cancers. Consistent with this finding, previous studies have suggested that GM-CSF promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration in a variety of solid tumors and cancer cell lines. These results suggest that in addition to its immune-stimulatory functions, GM-CSF may have direct effects on tumor progression and invasion. Therefore, in the current review, we provide an overview of the existing empirical findings and summarize both the advantages and disadvantages of the growing influence of GM-CSF on tumorigenesis to give directions for future research.

### G-CSF and GM-CSF for treating or preventing neonatal infections [^115LMYhM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The colony stimulating factors (CSFs), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), are naturally occurring cytokines that stimulate the production and antibacterial function of neutrophils and monocytes. Two strategies have been adopted for exploring whether CSFs can provide clinical benefit for preterm infants. The first has investigated their use as a treatment to improve outcome in established systemic infection, especially when complicated by a low neutrophil count. The alternative strategy has been to use CSFs prophylactically, to prevent sepsis prospectively through stimulation of neutrophil production and bactericidal function.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of the haemopoietic colony stimulating factors (G-CSF or GM-CSF) in newborn infants, when used for:a) treatment of suspected or proven systemic infection to reduce mortality, orb) prophylaxis, to prevent systemic infection in infants at high risk of nosocomial infection. To determine, in subgroup analysis, the influence of pre-existing or high risk of neutropenia on the outcome of therapy.

Search Strategy

PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2003) were searched in April 2003 using the keywords: G-CSF, GM-CSF, infant newborn, with and without the limit Clinical Trial. In addition, reference lists of identified RCTs, meta-analyses and personal files were searched.

Selection Criteria

The criteria used to select studies for inclusion were:

Design

RCT.

Subjects

Newborn infants in intensive care.

Interventions

G-CSF or GM-CSF given as treatment in conjunction with antibiotics for suspected or microbiologically proven systemic infection. G-CSF or GM-CSF given as prophylaxis with the aim of reducing the incidence of systemic infection.

Outcomes

Treatment studies reporting all cause mortality. Prophylaxis studies reporting subsequent incidence of sepsis and / or mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Relative risks (RR) and risk differences (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the fixed effect model are reported. Number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated for the outcomes that showed a statistically significant reduction in RR.

Main Results

Seven treatment studies of 257 infants with suspected systemic bacterial infection and three prophylaxis studies comprising 359 neonates are analysed. Treatment studies: There is no evidence that the addition of G-CSF or GM-CSF to antibiotic therapy in preterm infants with suspected systemic infection reduces immediate all cause mortality. No significant survival advantage was seen at 14 days from the start of therapy [typical RR 0.71 (95% CI 0.38,1.33); typical RD -0.05 (95% CI -0.14, 0.04)]. However all seven of the treatment studies were small, the largest recruiting only 60 infants. The subgroup analysis of 97 infants from three treatment studies who, in addition to systemic infection, had clinically significant neutropenia (< 1.7 x 10(9)/l) at trial entry, does show a significant reduction in mortality by day 14 [RR 0.34 (95% CI 0.12, 0.92); RD -0.18 (95% CI -0.33, -0.03); NNT 6 (95% CI 3–33)]. Prophylaxis studies have not demonstrated a significant reduction in mortality in neonates receiving GM-CSF [RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.24,1.44); RD -0.03 (95% CI -0.08,0.02)]. The identification of sepsis as the primary outcome of prophylaxis studies has been hampered by inadequately stringent definitions of systemic infection. However, data from one study suggest that prophylactic GM-CSF may provide protection against infection when given to preterm infants who are neutropenic or at high risk of developing postnatal neutropenia.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to support the introduction of either G-CSF or GM-CSF into neonatal practice, either as treatment of established systemic infection to reduce resulting mortality, or as prophylaxis to prevent systemic infection in high risk neonates. No toxicity of CSF use was reported in any systemic infection to reduce resulting mortality, or as prophylaxis to prevent systemic infection in high risk neonates. No toxicity of CSF use was reported in any study included in this review. The limited data suggesting that CSF treatment may reduce mortality when systemic infection is accompanied by severe neutropenia should be investigated further in adequately powered trials which recruit sufficient infants infected with organisms associated with a significant mortality risk.

### Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for sepsis: a meta-analysis [^117JzdVa]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite improvements in antimicrobial therapy and supportive care, the incidence of sepsis continues to rise and sepsis is now the third leading cause of infectious deaths in the United States, with a mortality rate ranging from 20% for sepsis to 50% for septic shock. During the past decades, many clinical trials testing anti-inflammatory therapies have been performed. However, the effects of these approaches on patient mortality were rather disappointing. It is now generally agreed that patients with sepsis are more prone to die in a state of sepsis-induced immunosuppression, including reduced monocytic phagocytotic activity, changes in monocytic cytokine expression, diminished monocytic antigen presentation, lymphocytic dysfunction and apoptosis-induced loss of circulating T-and B-lymphocytes. Consequently, immunostimulatory therapies constitute an innovative strategy that deserves to be assessed for the treatment of sepsis.

To date, one approach is the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), to augment myeloid cell functions in patients with sepsis. G-CSF, widely used in reducing the duration of febrile neutropenia following cytotoxic chemotherapy, has been shown to stimulate the production of neutrophils and modulate the function and activity of developing and mature neutrophils. Compared to G-CSF, GM-CSF exhibits broader effects and induces proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and myeloid-derived dendritic cells. GM-CSF has been demonstrated to increase monocytic HLA-DR (mHLA-DR) expression and endotoxin-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in ex vivo whole blood cultures of patients with severe sepsis.

So far, G-CSF and GM-CSF have shown promise in the treatment of infection in non-neutropenic hosts in many animal models. Additionally, several clinical trials have been conducted to investigate the effect of G-CSF or GM-CSF treatment in neonates and adults with infection. Recently, a meta-analysis investigating the effect of G-CSF and GM-CSF for treating neonatal infection showed no significant reduction in 14-day mortality. To our best knowledge, no previous systematic review had been conducted to define the efficacy and safety of G-CSF and GM-CSF in patients with sepsis. Therefore, we attempted to summarize the available randomized control trials (RCTs) to determine whether G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy significantly reduced all-cause mortality at 14 days and 28 days, in-hospital mortality and occurrence of adverse events, and increased reversal rate from infection in patients with sepsis.

### Therapeutic applications of macrophage colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) and antagonists of CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) signaling [^112okbfV]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Macrophage-colony stimulating factor (CSF-1) signaling through its receptor (CSF-1R) promotes the differentiation of myeloid progenitors into heterogeneous populations of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. In the periphery, CSF-1 regulates the migration, proliferation, function, and survival of macrophages, which function at multiple levels within the innate and adaptive immune systems. Macrophage populations elicited by CSF-1 are associated with, and exacerbate, a broad spectrum of pathologies, including cancer, inflammation, and bone disease. Conversely, macrophages can also contribute to immunosuppression, disease resolution, and tissue repair. Recombinant CSF-1, antibodies against the ligand and the receptor, and specific inhibitors of CSF-1R kinase activity have been each been tested in a range of animal models and in some cases, in patients. This review examines the potential clinical uses of modulators of the CSF-1/CSF-1R system. We conclude that CSF-1 promotes a resident-type macrophage phenotype. As a treatment, CSF-1 has therapeutic potential in tissue repair. Conversely, inhibition of CSF-1R is unlikely to be effective in inflammatory disease but may have utility in cancer.

Regarding preventative measures for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to G-CSFs, indications, ASCO 2015 guidelines recommend to initiate secondary prophylaxis with colony-stimulating factors for patients who experienced a neutropenic complication from a previous cycle of chemotherapy, for which primary prophylaxis was not received, and where a reduced dose or treatment delay may compromise disease-free or overall survival or treatment outcome. Consider dose reduction or delay as a reasonable alternative in many clinical situations.

Regarding preventative measures for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to G-CSFs, indications, ASCO 2015 guidelines recommend to use dose-dense regimens with colony-stimulating factor support only within an appropriately designed clinical trial or if supported by convincing efficacy data. Recognize that efficacy data support the use of colony-stimulating factors with dose-dense chemotherapy in the adjuvant treatment of high-risk breast cancer and with high-dose-intensity methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin in urothelial cancer. Recognize that there are limited and conflicting data on the value of dose-dense regimens with colony-stimulating factor support in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and its use is not routinely recommended.

### Prophylactic antibiotics or G (M)-CSF for the prevention of infections and improvement of survival in cancer patients receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy [^1163MRr5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Febrile neutropenia (FN) and other infectious complications are some of the most serious treatment-related toxicities of chemotherapy for cancer, with a mortality rate of 2% to 21%. The two main types of prophylactic regimens are granulocyte (macrophage) colony-stimulating factors (G(M)-CSF) and antibiotics, frequently quinolones or cotrimoxazole. Current guidelines recommend the use of colony-stimulating factors when the risk of febrile neutropenia is above 20%, but they do not mention the use of antibiotics. However, both regimens have been shown to reduce the incidence of infections. Since no systematic review has compared the two regimens, a systematic review was undertaken.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of G(M)-CSF compared to antibiotics in cancer patients receiving myelotoxic chemotherapy.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, databases of ongoing trials, and conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Hematology (1980 to December 2015). We planned to include both full-text and abstract publications. Two review authors independently screened search results.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing prophylaxis with G(M)-CSF versus antibiotics for the prevention of infection in cancer patients of all ages receiving chemotherapy. All study arms had to receive identical chemotherapy regimes and other supportive care. We included full-text, abstracts, and unpublished data if sufficient information on study design, participant characteristics, interventions and outcomes was available. We excluded cross-over trials, quasi-randomised trials and post-hoc retrospective trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the results of the search strategies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and analysed data according to standard Cochrane methods. We did final interpretation together with an experienced clinician.

Main Results

In this updated review, we included no new randomised controlled trials. We included two trials in the review, one with 40 breast cancer patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and G-CSF compared to antibiotics, a second one evaluating 155 patients with small-cell lung cancer receiving GM-CSF or antibiotics. We judge the overall risk of bias as high in the G-CSF trial, as neither patients nor physicians were blinded and not all included patients were analysed as randomised (7 out of 40 patients). We considered the overall risk of bias in the GM-CSF to be moderate, because of the risk of performance bias (neither patients nor personnel were blinded), but low risk of selection and attrition bias. For the trial comparing G-CSF to antibiotics, all cause mortality was not reported. There was no evidence of a difference for infection-related mortality, with zero events in each arm. Microbiologically or clinically documented infections, severe infections, quality of life, and adverse events were not reported. There was no evidence of a difference in frequency of febrile neutropenia (risk ratio (RR) 1.22; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 2.84). The quality of the evidence for the two reported outcomes, infection-related mortality and frequency of febrile neutropenia, was very low, due to the low number of patients evaluated (high imprecision) and the high risk of bias. There was no evidence of a difference in terms of median survival time in the trial comparing GM-CSF and antibiotics. Two-year survival times were 6% (0 to 12%) in both arms (high imprecision, low quality of evidence). There were four toxic deaths in the GM-CSF arm and three in the antibiotics arm (3.8%), without evidence of a difference (RR 1.32; 95% CI 0.30 to 5.69; P = 0.71; low quality of evidence). There were 28% grade III or IV infections in the GM-CSF arm and 18% in the antibiotics arm, without any evidence of a difference (RR 1.55; 95% CI 0.86 to 2.80; P = 0.15, low quality of evidence). There were 5 episodes out of 360 cycles of grade IV infections in the GM-CSF arm and 3 episodes out of 334 cycles in the cotrimoxazole arm (0.8%), with no evidence of a difference (RR 1.55; 95% CI 0.37 to 6.42; P = 0.55; low quality of evidence). There was no significant difference between the two arms for non-haematological toxicities like diarrhoea, stomatitis, infections, neurologic, respiratory, or cardiac adverse events. Grade III and IV thrombopenia occurred significantly more frequently in the GM-CSF arm (60.8%) compared to the antibiotics arm (28.9%); (RR 2.10; 95% CI 1.41 to 3.12; P = 0.0002; low quality of evidence). Neither infection-related mortality, incidence of febrile neutropenia, nor quality of life were reported in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

As we only found two small trials with 195 patients altogether, no conclusion for clinical practice is possible. More trials are necessary to assess the benefits and harms of G(M)-CSF compared to antibiotics for infection prevention in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

### Targeting GM-CSF in inflammatory diseases [^115wSdab]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a growth factor first identified as an inducer of differentiation and proliferation of granulocytes and macrophages derived from haematopoietic progenitor cells. Later studies have shown that GM-CSF is involved in a wide range of biological processes in both innate and adaptive immunity, with its production being tightly linked to the response to danger signals. Given that the functions of GM-CSF span multiple tissues and biological processes, this cytokine has shown potential as a new and important therapeutic target in several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders - particularly in rheumatoid arthritis. Indeed, GM-CSF was one of the first cytokines detected in human synovial fluid from inflamed joints. Therapies that target GM-CSF or its receptor have been tested in preclinical studies with promising results, further supporting the potential of targeting the GM-CSF pathway. In this Review, we discuss our expanding view of the biology of GM-CSF, outline what has been learnt about GM-CSF from studies of animal models and human diseases, and summarize the results of early phase clinical trials evaluating GM-CSF antagonism in inflammatory disorders.

### Modulation by colony stimulating factors of human epithelial colon cancer cell apoptosis [^111GgXjx]. Cytokine (2002). Low credibility.

Colony stimulating factors (CSF) promote leukocyte survival by reducing apoptotic cell death. However, their effects on non-leukocyte cell types are unclear. Reduced apoptosis in colon epithelial cells is thought to contribute to the initiation of cancer. Here, we report diminished spontaneous apoptosis of human colon epithelial HT-29 cells in the presence of macrophage-CSF or granulocyte macrophage-CSF. Moreover, reduced apoptosis induced by sulindac sulfide was also observed with macrophage-CSF. Granulocyte-CSF failed to modify spontaneous or sulindac sulfide induced apoptosis. It seems, therefore, that the action of CSFs on apoptosis is not confined to haematopoietic cells but may be extended to stromal cells.

### Modulation of colony stimulating factor release and apoptosis in human colon cancer cells by anticancer drugs [^116NCyku]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Modulation of the immune response against tumour cells is emerging as a valuable approach for cancer treatment. Some experimental studies have shown that secretion of colony stimulating factors by cancer cells reduces their tumorigenicity and increases their immunogenicity probably by promoting the cytolitic and antigen presenting activities of leukocytes. We have observed that human colon cancer cells (HT-29) are able to secrete granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and macrophage-colony stimulating factor when stimulated with cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α). In this study we assessed, for the first time, the effects of several anticancer drugs on colony stimulating factor release or apoptosis in HT-29 cells. Cytokine-induced release of granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and macrophage-colony stimulating factor was significantly increased by cisplatin and 6-mercaptopurine. Taxol only increased macrophage-colony stimulating factor release while reduced that of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor. No changes in colony stimulating factor secretion were observed after treatment with methotrexate. Only cisplatin and taxol induced apoptosis in these cells. Secretion of colony stimulating factors by colon cancer cells may contribute to the immune host response against them. Anticancer drugs such as cisplatin and 6-mercaptopurine increase colony stimulating factor secretion by cytokine stimulated cancer cells probably through mechanisms different to those leading to cell apoptosis, an effect that may contribute to their anti-neoplasic action.

### Colony stimulating factors (including erythropoietin, granulocyte colony stimulating factor and analogues) for stroke [^113uFMzM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Colony stimulating factors (CSFs), also called haematopoietic growth factors, regulate bone marrow production of circulating red and white cells, and platelets. Some CSFs also mobilise the release of bone marrow stem cells into the circulation. CSFs have been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental stroke.

Objectives

To assess (1) the safety and efficacy of CSFs in people with acute or subacute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, and (2) the effect of CSFs on circulating stem and blood cell counts.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched September 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1985 to September 2012), EMBASE (1985 to September 2012) and Science Citation Index (1985 to September 2012). In an attempt to identify further published, unpublished and ongoing trials we contacted manufacturers and principal investigators of trials (last contacted April 2012). We also searched reference lists of relevant articles and reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials recruiting people with acute or subacute ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. CSFs included stem cell factor (SCF), erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, CSF-1), thrombopoietin (TPO), or analogues of these. The primary outcome was functional outcome at the end of the trial. Secondary outcomes included safety at the end of treatment, death at the end of follow-up, infarct volume and haematology measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (TE and NS) independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

We included a total of 11 studies involving 1275 participants. In three trials (n = 782), EPO therapy was associated with a significant increase in death by the end of the trial (odds ratio (OR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 3.3, P = 0.009) and a non-significant increase in serious adverse events. EPO significantly increased the red cell count with no effect on platelet or white cell count, or infarct volume. Two small trials of carbamylated EPO have been completed but have yet to be reported. We included eight small trials (n = 548) of G-CSF. G-CSF was associated with a non-significant reduction in early impairment (mean difference (MD) -0.4, 95% CI -1.82 to 1.01, P = 0.58) but had no effect on functional outcome at the end of the trial. G-CSF significantly elevated the white cell count and the CD34+ cell count, but had no effect on infarct volume. Further trials of G-CSF are ongoing.

Authors' Conclusions

There are significant safety concerns regarding EPO therapy for stroke. It is too early to know whether other CSFs improve functional outcome.

### Colony stimulating factors and myeloid cell biology in health and disease [^115x28Jz]. Trends in Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

The colony stimulating factors (CSFs), granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), macrophage-CSF (M-CSF or CSF-1) and granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) were first identified as in vitro hematopoietic growth factors. They have since been shown to regulate myeloid cell numbers and function at steady state and during inflammation. Preclinical data suggest that targeting CSFs might be beneficial in autoimmune and inflammatory disease, and manipulation of CSF biology is now being tested in clinical trials. Here, we examine recent insights into CSF function, at steady state and during pathology, as provided by CSF or CSF receptor neutralization/deletion studies or from CSF administration. We discuss controversies regarding the role of CSFs in controlling specific myeloid cell populations and highlight how the newly identified M-CSF receptor ligand, interleukin (IL)-34, is necessitating a reassessment of the field.

### Stimulatory versus suppressive effects of GM-CSF on tumor progression in multiple cancer types [^114cJSQS]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF, also called CSF-2) is best known for its critical role in immune modulation and hematopoiesis. A large body of experimental evidence indicates that GM-CSF, which is frequently upregulated in multiple types of human cancers, effectively marks cancer cells with a 'danger flag' for the immune system. In this context, most studies have focused on its function as an immunomodulator, namely its ability to stimulate dendritic cell (DC) maturation and monocyte/macrophage activity. However, recent studies have suggested that GM-CSF also promotes immune-independent tumor progression by supporting tumor microenvironments and stimulating tumor growth and metastasis. Although some studies have suggested that GM-CSF has inhibitory effects on tumor growth and metastasis, an even greater number of studies show that GM-CSF exerts stimulatory effects on tumor progression. In this review, we summarize a number of findings to provide the currently available information regarding the anticancer immune response of GM-CSG. We then discuss the potential roles of GM-CSF in the progression of multiple types of cancer to provide insights into some of the complexities of its clinical applications.

### Macrophage-colony stimulating factor enhances MHC-restricted presentation of exogenous antigen in dendritic cells [^111tBLzh]. Cytokine (2005). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that dendritic cells (DCs) can phagocytize, process and present a microencapsulated form of ovalbumin (OVA) in the context of class I MHC as well as class II MHC. In the present study, we examined the effects of recombinant human macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) on the MHC-restricted presentation of microencapsulated OVA by DCs. Two types of DCs were generated from mouse bone marrow (BM) cells, one type with granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) alone, the other type with GM-CSF and interleukin (IL)-4. Pretreatment with M-CSF significantly enhanced both class I MHC and class II MHC-restricted presentation of exogenous OVA by both types of DCs. The enhancing activity of M-CSF on antigen presentation was more potent in DCs generated with GM-CSF alone compared to DCs generated with both GM-CSF and IL-4. Pretreatment of the DCs with M-CSF did not increase phagocytic activity or total level of expression of class I MHC (H-2K(b)) molecules, but increased expression of OVA peptide-H-2K(b) complexes upon phagocytosis of microencapsulated OVA. These results demonstrate that M-CSF increases intracellular processing events of phagocytized antigen in DCs.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112LUkuK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Adjunctive measures in invasive aspergillosis — immunosuppression management, colony-stimulating factors, and granulocyte transfusions: Reducing doses of, or eliminating altogether, immunosuppressive agents, when feasible, is advised as a component of anti-Aspergillus therapy (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Colony-stimulating factors may be considered in neutropenic patients with diagnosed or suspected IA (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence), and there is insufficient evidence regarding the value of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in this setting. Granulocyte transfusions can be considered for neutropenic patients with IA that is refractory or unlikely to respond to standard therapy, and for an anticipated duration of more than one week (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence).

### Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor as a mediator of autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis [^114dN6Be]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2018). Low credibility.

Autoreactive, myelin-specific, CD4 + T cells have a central role in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis; however the exact phenotype characteristics of these cells remain elusive. Recently, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) expression has emerged as the main pathological signature of the encephalogenicity in both T and B cell compartment. In this review we have summarized the current data supporting GM-CSF relevance in MS pathophysiology, in the context of both immunomodulatory and neuroinflammatory processes; as well as the potential cellular sources of this stimulating factor, including different T and B cell subsets.

### Colony-stimulating factors in the prevention and management of infectious diseases [^115V1sDg]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are attractive adjunctive anti-infective therapies. Used to enhance innate host defenses against microbial pathogens, the myeloid CSFs increase absolute numbers of circulating innate immune effector cells by accelerating bone marrow production and maturation, or augment the function of those cells through diverse effects on chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and microbicidal functions. This article summarizes the evidence supporting the accepted clinical uses of the myeloid CSFs in patients with congenital or chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, and presents an overview of proposed and emerging uses of the CSFs for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases in other immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patient populations.

Table 1
Characteristics of included randomised controlled trials

Randomized allocation sequence was adequately generated in six trials, for the other six trials it was judged to be unclear based on the available documents. Allocation sequences concealment was adequately reported in six trials and was judged to be unclear in the other six trials. It was clearly stated that blinded fashion was conducted in all but one trial and the outcome measurements were not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding. The numbers and reasons for withdrawal/dropout were detailed reported in all but one trial. None had stopped early due to data-dependent process or other problems, so free of other sources of bias were defined across trials. Therefore, five trials were determined as low risk of bias (plausible bias unlikely to seriously alter the results), and six trials were at unclear risk of bias (plausible bias that rises up to some doubt about the results), while one trial was at high risk of bias (plausible bias that seriously weakens confidence in the results). An overview of the quality appraisal was shown in Table 2. For the meta-analysis of G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy on 28-day mortality, there was evidence of significant funnel plot asymmetry (Figure 2).

Table 2
Assessing risk of bias

Figure 2
Funnel plot of the meta-analysis. Funnel plot for the outcome of 28-day mortality associated with G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy compared with placebo in patients with sepsis.

All-cause mortality at 14 days

In regard to 14-day mortality, only four trials consisting of a total of 138 patients evaluated the short-term outcome. The average sample size for one trial was 34 patients (sample sizes ranged from 18 to 58). Although one of the four trials had calculated sample size according to 14-day mortality in the protocol, fewer patients were enrolled due to lower mortality and recruitment frequency than anticipated eventually. Hence, the meta-analysis of these four trials might be inappropriate to reveal the mortality benefit due to the limited numbers of patients. Moreover, none of the four trials reported a significant benefit in 14-day mortality following GCSF or GM-CSF administration. A total of 9 death events occurred among 71 patients (12.7%) in the treatment group compared with 13 events among 67 patients (19.4%) in the placebo group.

### Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors in cancer therapy [^112MC34H]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

With several CSF1R-targeting therapies currently under evaluation in the clinic, we are still only beginning to understand which covariates impact on macrophage phenotypes and the respective role of CSF1R-mediated signaling in cancer. The aforementioned examples illustrate that the origin and the presence of a predominant macrophage phenotype in healthy tissue cannot alone predict pro- or anti-tumor effects of TAM during tumorigenesis. Furthermore, it is difficult to identify tumor types that might or might not benefit from CSF1R-targeted therapies without taking into account further sub-classification of tumors and their respective impact on the local TME. Both primary and disseminated tumor cells may induce a profound functional reprogramming of resident tissue macrophages by changing the local cytokine milieu. Only once the impact of organ-specific CSF1R blockade is better understood will a more precise selection of anti-CSF1R-containing treatment regimens and prediction of clinical benefit for patients be possible.

Results

Study identification

The comprehensive search yielded a total of 665 relevant publications, and the abstracts were obtained for all of these (Figure 1). Finally, there were 12 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria. The Cohen К statistic for agreement on study inclusion was 0.92.

Figure 1
Flow-chart of study selection.

Among the selected trials, three trials were conducted in North America, two in Europe, two in Asia and two in Australia. Five trials were multicenter studies. Seven trials of the included 12 trials presented the information of trial sample calculation of various clinical outcome indices based on statistical principle (14-day mortality: 1 trial; 28-day mortality: 2 trials; in-hospital mortality: 1 trial; reverse rate from infection: 2 trials; others: 1 trial). Trial samples ranged widely (18 to 756 patients) with six trials enrolling fewer than 50 patients. Of the 2,380 participants included, 1,188 were randomized to receive G-CSF or GM-CSF (1,113 received G-CSF and 75 received GM-CSF) and 1,192 were randomized to receive placebos. Mean age of patients ranged from 43.2 to 64.5 years. Among the included 12 trials, 8 trials were designed to compare G-CSF with placebo and 4 trials compared GM-CSF with placebo. G-CSF administration included two regimens (Lenograstim, 263 μg/day; Filgrastim, 300 μg/day) and three of four trials investigating GM-CSF versus placebo administered GM-CSF with the regimen of 3 μg/kg/day, the remaining trial 4 μg/kg/day. Patients' baseline characteristics in comparative groups were well balanced, such as the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score. Only one trial investigating GM-CSF versus placebo had discrepant baseline characteristics, in which the mean ages were 62 and 46.5 years old, respectively. Details of the included studies are summarized in Table 1.

### Filgrastim-sndz (Zarxio) [^116WTEvs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and stimulating proliferation‚ differentiation commitment‚ and some end-cell functional activation.

Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes‚ fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation‚ differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability‚ priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst‚ antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies‚ administration of filgrastim resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily)‚ subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)‚ or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy‚ neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemiluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl‑phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro.

The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however‚ the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer.

White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift)‚ including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts‚ usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition‚ Dohle bodies‚ increased granulocyte granulation‚ and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection.

Regarding preventative measures for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to G-CSFs, indications, ASCO 2015 guidelines recommend to avoid administering colony-stimulating factors in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, particularly involving the mediastinum.

### Dimethyl fumarate suppresses granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-producing Th1 cells in CNS neuroinflammation [^112i7MWk]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

MS, the leading cause of disability in young adults, is an inflammatory demyelinating disease with axonal injury in the CNS. The rapidly growing number of diagnosed cases and available immune-modifying therapies in recent years is motivating scientists and clinicians to further study the mechanism of action of currently approved medications to discover novel underlying pathways that can be targeted to develop new and more efficient treatments for MS.

Patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients are treated with oral dimethyl fumarate (DF) since 2013 in the United States, and DF is added to the armamentarium of disease-modifying therapies for MS. In terms of an underlying mechanism of action, DF inhibits interleukin (IL)-12p35 and IL-23p19 transcription in dendritic cells. This leads to the generation of type-2 dendritic cells, which indirectly increases IL-4 + Th2 cells in both experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and human cells and ameliorates inflammatory responses. In addition, EAE mice treated with DF show a significant reduction in the total number of interferon (IFN)-γ–, IL-17–, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)–producing CD4 + T cells among CNS-infiltrating cells. These findings add to the role of DF in decreasing the inflammatory profile of T cells indirectly by changing the phenotype of antigen presenting cells, but the direct effect of DF on pathogenic T-cell subtypes has not been adequately studied.

Among the various types of immune cells involved in the pathogenesis of EAE, T cells have been the main focus of research because of their pathogenic role in animal models of demyelination and the abundance of T cells in active demyelinating brain lesions in patients with MS.

Th1 and Th17 cells are considered the main culprits in EAE pathogenicity, and their signature cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-17, play a role in disease pathogenesis. Lack of IFN-γ leads to more severe EAE, and the absence of IL-17 does not affect EAE development. Given that neither Th1 (IFN-γ) nor Th17 (IL-17) signature cytokines are required for the development of EAE, we and others have shown that GM-CSF is an essential cytokine for EAE induction. GM-CSF–producing CD4 + T cells can effectively induce EAE by passive transfer, and lack of GM-CSF in Th1 or Th17 cells abrogates their encephalitogenicity. In addition, GM-CSF–deficient mice are resistant to EAE induction.

### The colony-stimulating factors: use to prevent and treat neutropenia and its complications [^115XxVUU]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

The colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) represent the only biological response modifiers used in clinical practice to treat or prevent neutropenia. These pleiotropic cytokines are available in clinical practice as granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and pegylated G-CSF. Neutropenia and its complications, most importantly febrile neutropenia (FN), remain major and serious side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Several studies and meta-analyses have addressed the clinical applications of CSFs to treat or prevent neutropenia. Guidelines have been developed to foster the appropriate use of CSFs. This article reviews the nature and use of the CSFs, and summarises the critical studies and guidelines. A historical perspective briefly describes the discovery, synthesis and clinical use of CSFs. The major biological and pharmacological characteristics are highlighted. The clinical applications of the CSFs are reviewed, including primary FN prophylaxis, secondary FN prophylaxis, treatment of FN, support of dose-dense chemotherapy regimens, use in leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, utility in stem cell transplantation, and use in elderly and paediatric patients. Finally, clinical efficacy data, as well as the economic impact of the CSFs, are discussed.

### Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for sepsis: a meta-analysis [^115agm2U]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The literature shows that G-CSF or GM-CSF result in no differential effectiveness in treating sepsis, in terms of all-cause mortality at 14 days or 28 days, in-hospital mortality or adverse events. However, G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy significantly increased the reversal rate from infection in patients with sepsis.

- There was a lack of consensus in the literature in regard to the effect of G-CSF or GM-CSF versus placebo in treating sepsis in adults.

- Larger prospective randomized controlled trials investigating monocytic HLA-DR (mHLA-DR)-guided G-CSF or GM-CSF therapy in sepsis are warranted.

### Mechanisms of G-CSF-mediated hematopoietic stem and progenitor mobilization [^114ehB5q]. Leukemia (2011). Low credibility.

Under normal conditions, the great majority of hematopoietic stem/progenitors cells (HSPCs) reside in the bone marrow. The number of HSPCs in the circulation can be markedly increased in response to a number of stimuli, including hematopoietic growth factors, myeloablative agents and environmental stresses such as infection. The ability to 'mobilize' HSPCs from the bone marrow to the blood has been exploited clinically to obtain HSPCs for stem cell transplantation and, more recently, to stimulate therapeutic angiogenesis at sites of tissue ischemia. Moreover, there is recent interest in the use of mobilizing agents to sensitize leukemia and other hematopoietic malignancies to cytotoxic agents. Key to optimizing clinical mobilizing regimens is an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of HSPC mobilization. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms by which granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), the prototypical mobilizing agent, induces HSPC mobilization.

### Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors in cancer therapy [^112Qk7Ln]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

CSF1R inhibitors represent an exciting new class of immune-modulatory drugs. Scientific understanding of macrophage and CSF1R biology is evolving rapidly, and more data from clinical trials investigating CSF1R-directed therapies will become available shortly. Whereas clinical tolerability seems to have been established for this group of agents, it is increasingly clear that the organ site and tumor-type specifics of TAM will need to be considered for the selection of both the right patients population and the appropriate combination partner to achieve a meaningful clinical benefit for cancer patients.

### Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor… [^1116uPri]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Brender E, Lynm C, Glass RM. Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor. JAMA. 2006; 295:

1088. doi:
10. 1001/jama.
295. 9. 1088 Granulocyte colony-stimulating. factor is a blood growth factor that stimulates the bone marrow to produce more infection-fighting white blood cells called neutrophils. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor causes cells from the bone marrow to become mature and activated. These cells then circulate into the bloodstream. Other types of growth factors called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors affect the growth of other types of white blood cells along with neutrophils. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is produced naturally by the body and is also available as an injection for patients with low white blood cell counts at risk of infection. The March 1, 2006, issue of JAMA includes an article about the experimental use of G-CSF in patients who have had a myocardial infarction.

Chemotherapy can damage rapidly dividing normal cells, such as the hair follicle cells that grow hair and the bone marrow cells that produce white blood cells, in addition to killing cancer cells. This causes low white blood cell counts. When patients have low white blood cell counts, they are at risk of infection. A low neutrophil count is called neutropenia. Doctors carefully monitor the blood counts of patients receiving chemotherapy and also watch for signs of infection, including fevers. They may prescribe G-CSF to increase the number of neutrophils and reduce the risk of infection. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is also used for patients who are receiving a bone marrow transplant and for some blood cell cancers. Not all chemotherapy requires G-CSF treatment. Generally G-CSF is well tolerated although some patients experience bone pain or slight redness at the injection site.

These side effects are usually mild and go away once the injections are stopped. A patient receiving G-CSF injections should seek medical attention if any serious adverse effects occur, especially any signs of an allergic reaction such as swelling, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, or rash. Patients should have regular follow-up with their doctors as well as monitoring of blood counts.

*Only significant treatment difference (p values < 0.05) are indicated with asterisks. Comparisons between treatment arms were based on Fisher's exact test.

As expected, analgesics were the most commonly used concomitant medications among both the ITT population (> 45%) and aggressive disease subgroups (> 40%) (Table 5). The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs/GM-CSFs) tended to be higher in the ramucirumab arm among the ITT population (41.8% vs. 36.6%, p = 0.063), while usage rates were similar between treatment arms for aggressive disease subgroups. Antihypertensive medications were used more frequently overall and in the ramucirumab arm among the ITT population (25.4 vs. 17.6, p < 0.001) and the HSB subgroup (27.5% vs. 17.8%, p = 0.012). The use of antihypertensive medications was numerically lower in the ramucirumab arm than in the control arm for RDP (14.7% vs 19.6%, p = 0.360) and PRD (14.6% vs 16.7%, p = 0.663) subgroups. The use of antibiotics followed a similar pattern. Specifically, antibiotic usage rates were 39.4% in the ramucirumab arm and 31.9% in the control arm among the overall ITT population (p = 0.006), 26.6% and 34.0% in patients with RDP (p = 0.288), 30.3% and 29.4% in patients with PRD (p = 0.908), and 41.0% and 33.3% in patients with HSB (p = 0.092). Antifungals tended to be used more frequently in the ramucirumab arm among the ITT population (p < 0.001) and aggressive disease subgroups (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the use of antivirals or antiemetics between treatment arms across the ITT population or aggressive disease subgroups (Table 5).

### Distinct assemblies of heterodimeric cytokine receptors govern stemness programs in leukemia [^112hmbtD]. Cancer Discovery (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Normal and malignant hematopoiesis are organized in a cellular hierarchy with rare stem cells at the apex that both self-renew and differentiate into all mature blood lineages. This balance between stemness and commitment is regulated by interleukin (IL) 3 and other pleiotropic cytokines; however, how they determine cell fate remains a mystery. Cytokine-mediated dimerization of receptor subunits provides one mechanism that explains pleiotropy arising through the combined effects of binding affinities and kinetics, and stability and topology of complex formation. These concepts led to the development of newly engineered ligands of erythropoietin (EPO; ref.), stem cell factor (SCF; ref.), IL2, and interferon (IFN; ref.) to stimulate differential qualitative signaling, with engineered IL2 partial agonists recently entering phase Ia/Ib clinical trials for treatment of advanced solid tumors (NCT05098132; ref.). However, some type I cytokine receptors such as those for growth hormone and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can exist in different oligomerization states, pointing to variation in oligomerization as an unappreciated alternative possibility for functional pleiotropism.

### Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors in cancer therapy [^112LuY6e]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Local tissue macrophage and disease specificity impacting CSF1R-directed treatment strategies

CSF1R-targeting agents exhibit a rather benign safety profile; however, to date, only modest clinical activity as monotherapy has been reported outside of CSF1-driven dt-GCT. Currently, important patient data sets for solid and hematological malignancies, especially those from ongoing combination trials, are still pending. The complex phenotypic and functional properties of macrophages are heavily influenced by a continuum of survival, differentiation, recruitment, and polarization signals within their specific tissue environment. Therefore, a key question remaining to be answered in clinical studies is whether these agents provide benefit to all cancer patients by depleting CSF1R + TAM, or whether certain patients and/or tumor types are more likely to respond to CSF1R inhibition. Evidence is increasing that the individual underlying tumor histology as well as organ site-specific features of CSF1R + cells need to be considered.

### Transforming healthcare through regenerative medicine [^114gQeTN]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical trials in regenerative medicine

The expansion of regenerative medicine as a scientific discipline, with its core principles of rejuvenation, regeneration and replacement (the 3R's), is shifting the paradigm in healthcare from symptomatic treatment in the 20th century to curative treatment in the 21st century. This is evidenced by the rapid increase in regenerative medicine clinical trials in each specialty, which can be broadly classified as using either cell- or tissue-based products (Table 1). The Food and Drug Administration in the US and the European Medicines Agency have more complex classification systems of regenerative medicine products, including cellular therapy, gene therapy, stimulators of endogenous repair, biologic-device combination products, and human tissue and xenotransplantation. Broadly, the regulatory requirements can be based on the pillars of sterility, stability and potency, and these need to be addressed prior to successful clinical translation in the future (Table 2).

Table 2
Overview of testing of regenerative medicine products to validate sterility, stability and potency

Cell-based therapies work either via stimulation of endogenous repair through extracellular factors or differentiation and functional replacement of endogenous cell types; they include stem cell implantation or infusion to treat hematopoietic diseases, cardiac conditions and Parkinson's disease. Most of the pioneering work has been performed using haematopoietic stem cells due to the early bone marrow transplant work, making them the most well-studied stem cell type. In particular, adult mesenchymal stem cells have gained interest as they avoid the ethical concerns of using embryonic stem cells, can be rapidly expanded in vitro and avoid immunogenicity. Studies have shown contradictory results on the efficacy of the transplanted cells, with patient variability with regards to response (Table 1); further work is needed to elucidate cell identity and health to ensure patient safety (Table 2).

### Use of cytokines in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients: colony-stimulating factors, erythropoietin, and interleukin-2 [^1153gsWe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The recombinant human cytokines granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), erythropoietin, and interleukin-2 (IL-2) have been manufactured and licensed. Studies have been carried out that investigate the use of G-CSF and GM-CSF to reverse leukopenia, as adjunctive therapy for HIV-associated infections and for novel approaches to treat HIV infection, including stem cell mobilization. In addition, studies that identified the role of erythropoietin in the management of anemia have been performed. Furthermore, the abilities of G-CSF and erythropoietin to permit the continued use of marrow suppressive agents that are key in managing HIV infection have been assessed. The aim of this review is to summarize these studies and to describe the reports that evaluate the use of IL-2 to enhance elevation of CD4 cell counts mediated by highly active antiretroviral therapy. This summary is important to the treating clinician in that it identifies the optimal use of these cytokines in current clinical practice as well as their potential future roles.

### Prevention of febrile neutropenia: use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors [^11198Ctd]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines on prevention of FN

Chemotherapy dose reduction/delay is not the only strategy available for reducing FN-related morbidity and mortality. Another option is FN prevention through prophylactic treatment with G-CSF, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factors (GM–CSF) and/or antibiotics.

Haematopoietic cell growth factors stimulate the proliferation and survival of neutrophils and their precursors, and thereby reduce the severity and duration of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and FN.

Indications for the primary prevention of FN through the use of G-CSFs for patients undergoing chemotherapy have been issued by three well-respected oncology organisations – the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. They all broadly agree that any patient with an FN risk greater than 20% should receive primary prophylaxis with G-CSF with each cycle of chemotherapy (Figure 1). In some instances, the chemotherapy regimen itself carries an FN risk that exceeds this threshold. If the FN risk associated with the regimen is 10–20%, the physician should consider whether patient factors such as age, advanced disease or comorbidities take the overall risk beyond 20%. If the chemotherapy regimen is considered to present an FN risk of less than 10%, primary prophylaxis with G-CSF should not be offered routinely – unless there is thought to be a huge risk of serious FN complications, such as death. However, it is highly likely that G-CSF primary prophylaxis is not always used routinely in clinical practice, despite these clear, evidence-based guidelines.

### Future investigations in stem cell activation with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor after myocardial infarction [^116WUYDh]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Medium credibility.

Experimental data indicate that stem cell mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) might have potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for acute myocardial infarction. The prospective beneficial effects of G-CSF can be attributed mainly to a direct action on injured myocardium rather than on differentiation of mobilized bone marrow stem cells into cardiac myocytes. This article reviews the evidence for the potential cardioprotective effects of G-CSF and discusses future investigations regarding pharmacologic stem cell activation and mobilization with G-CSF in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.

### Granulocyte and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factors for newly diagnosed patients with myelodysplastic syndromes [^1112HVXu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of haematological diseases which are characterised by a uni- or multilineage dysplasia of haematological stem cells. Standard treatment is supportive care of the arising symptoms including red blood cell transfusions or the administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in the case of anaemia or the treatment with granulocyte (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factors (GM-CSF) in cases of neutropenia.

Objectives

The objective of this review is to assess the evidence for the treatment of patients with MDS with G-CSF and GM-CSF in addition to standard therapy in comparison to the same standard therapy or the same standard therapy and placebo.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE (from 1950 to 3 December 2015) and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until 3 December 2015), as well as conference proceedings (American Society of Hematology, American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Hematology Association, European Society of Medical Oncology) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Two review authors independently screened search results.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs examining G-CSF or GM-CSF in addition to standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed MDS.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used hazard ratios (HR) as effect measure for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and time to progression, and risk ratios for response rates, adverse events, antibiotic use and hospitalisation. Two independent review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Investigators of two trials were contacted for subgroup information, however, no further data were provided. G-CSF and GM-CSF were analysed separately.

Main Results

We screened a total of 566 records. Seven RCTs involving 486 patients were identified, but we could only meta-analyse the two evaluating GM-CSF. We judged the potential risk of bias of these trials as unclear, mostly due to missing information. All trials were randomised and open-label studies. However, three trials were published as abstracts only, therefore we were not able to assess the potential risk of bias for these trials in detail. Overall, data were not reported in a comparable way and patient-related outcomes like survival, time to progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or the incidence of infections was reported in two trials only. Five RCTs (N = 337) assessed the efficacy of G-CSF in combination with standard therapy (supportive care, chemotherapy or erythropoietin). We were not able to perform meta-analyses for any of the pre-planned outcomes due to inconsistent and insufficient reporting of data. There is no evidence for a difference for overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.47), progression-free survival (only P value provided), progression to AML, incidence of infections and number of red blood transfusions (average number of 12 red blood cell transfusions in each arm). We judged the quality of evidence for all these outcomes as very low, due to very high imprecision and potential publication bias, as three trials were published as abstracts only. Data about quality of life and serious adverse events were not reported in any of the included trials. Two RCTs (N = 149) evaluated GM-CSF in addition to standard therapy (chemotherapy). For mortality (two RCTs; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.26), we found no evidence for a difference (low-quality evidence). Data for progression-free survival and serious adverse events were not comparable across both studies, without evidence for a difference between both arms (low-quality evidence). For infections, red blood cell and platelet transfusions, we found no evidence for a difference, however, these outcomes were reported by one trial only (low-quality evidence). Time to progression to AML and quality of life were not reported at all. Moreover, we identified two cross-over trials, including 244 patients and evaluating GM-CSF versus placebo, without publishing results for each arm before crossing over. In addition, we identified two ongoing studies, one of which was discontinued due to withdrawal of pharmaceutical support, the other was terminated early, both without publishing results.

Authors' Conclusions

Although we identified seven trials with a total number of 486 patients, and two unpublished, prematurely finished studies, this systematic review mainly shows that there is a substantial lack of data, which might inform the use of G-CSF and GM-CSF for the prevention of infections, prolonging of survival and improvement of quality of life. The impact on progression to AML remains unclear.

### Recommendations for the use of WBC growth factors: American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update [^115XTygk]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for febrile neutropenia, more specifically with respect to G-CSFs, ASCO 2015 guidelines recommend to do not use colony-stimulating factors routinely as adjunctive treatment with antibiotic therapy in patients with fever and neutropenia. Consider administering colony-stimulating factors in patients with fever and neutropenia who are at high risk for infection-associated complications or who have prognostic factors predictive of poor clinical outcomes. High-risk features include expected prolonged (≥ 10 days) and profound neutropenia (≤ 0.1×10⁹/L), age > 65 years, uncontrolled primary disease, pneumonia, hypotension and multiorgan dysfunction (sepsis syndrome), invasive fungal infection, or hospitalization at the time of fever development.

### Colony stimulating factors (CSFs): complex roles in atherosclerosis [^112PQv6r]. Cytokine (2019). Medium credibility.

Colony stimulating factors (CSFs) play a central role in the development and functional maturation of immune cells besides having pleiotropic effects on cells of the vascular wall. The production of CSFs is induced by multiple atherogenic and inflammatory stimuli and their expression levels are often correlated positively with advanced atherosclerotic plaques and adverse cardiovascular events in humans suggesting that CSFs play a critical role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis progression. Interestingly, recombinant CSFs as well as anti-CSFs are being increasingly used for diverse clinical indications. However, the effect of these novel therapeutics on atherosclerotic plaque progression is not well understood. Herein, we summarize the currently available literature on the complex role of CSFs in various stages of atherosclerosis and emphasize the necessity for conducting further mechanistic studies in animal models of atherosclerosis as well as the need for evaluating the cardiovascular safety of CSF-based therapies in humans.
