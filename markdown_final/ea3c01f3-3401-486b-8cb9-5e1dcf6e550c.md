## Question

radiation induced dermatitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about radiation-induced dermatitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining radiation-induced dermatitis and its pathophysiology. Then, I should appraise epidemiology and risk stratification. Next, I will lay out universal prevention strategies, followed by grade-specific management. After that, I need to consider special situations like infection, technology effects, and concurrent therapies. Finally, I should address measurement issues, patient-reported outcomes, skin tone considerations, and the strength of evidence with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I do not miss key mechanisms driving clinical decisions. Acute radiation dermatitis is an inflammatory skin reaction from ionizing radiation that disrupts basal keratinocyte cycling, impairs barrier renewal, and triggers a cytokine-driven inflammatory cascade, leading to erythema, tenderness, desquamation, and, at higher doses, moist desquamation; chronic changes can include fibrosis, pigment alteration, and vascular injury, with clinical erythema varying by skin tone due to melanin and vascular interplay [^116JnPJz] [^113LWRTr].

> I should double-check the epidemiologic burden to frame prevention intensity. Radiation dermatitis affects up to 95% of patients receiving external beam radiotherapy, and roughly one third develop moderate-to-severe reactions with moist desquamation; higher-risk sites include breast, head and neck, anal, and vulvar fields, and more homogeneous dose delivery with IMRT can reduce moist desquamation compared with standard plans, supporting a systems-level mitigation approach [^113LWRTr] [^116JnPJz] [^115m9nVn].

> Next, I will examine risk stratification because baseline factors should guide prophylaxis. ESTRO 2025 recommends stratifying intrinsic and extrinsic risks at baseline, including dose, volume, bolus use, concurrent chemotherapy, positioning, BMI, smoking, anatomic site, prior surgery, and skin type such as Fitzpatrick classification, acknowledging that both treatment- and patient-related factors shape severity probability and should inform anticipatory care [^1169Cdc4] [^113LWRTr] [^115A35SG].

> Now, I need to ensure universal prevention measures are clear and evidence-based. Foundational care includes early and continued moisturization beginning pre-treatment and throughout radiotherapy, daily washing with lukewarm water with gentle drying, minimizing mechanical irritation with loose natural fabrics and avoiding friction or adhesives, and post-treatment sun protection with clothing and high SPF or sunblock, each of which is recommended in modern guidance and aligns with barrier support principles [^111Xt5kZ] [^117KQ6XS] [^112CGvVu] [^113Rei6u] [^1158MGck].

> Wait, let me verify the role of washing because older dogma discouraged it. Multiple randomized trials synthesized in a meta-analysis show washing with or without soap significantly reduces severe dermatitis and moist desquamation without worsening pain, indicating that hygienic cleansing is protective; moreover, preclinical and dosimetric work suggests that applying common topical agents before treatment does not meaningfully increase skin dose with contemporary techniques, challenging legacy restrictions on pre-RT topicals [^116oK5hw] [^113h7CAb].

> I will now examine prophylactic interventions with supportive evidence, but hold on, I should note heterogeneity across trials before overcommitting. MASCC consensus recommends prophylactic topical corticosteroids such as mometasone or betamethasone when skin is intact, barrier films like Mepitel or Hydrofilm, photobiomodulation therapy in selected settings, and even olive oil, whereas ESTRO endorses considering barrier films and photobiomodulation for prevention; nonetheless, evidence remains variable across categories in systematic syntheses, so shared decision-making and local expertise matter [^116LT4NP] [^116toVfn] [^114Yychm] [^114241fh] [^114EbbzM] [^112ezXTU] [^112xKUjd].

> Let me think about grade 1 management next and confirm it aligns with prevention. For mild erythema or dry desquamation, continue general measures, reinforce adherence to hygiene and moisturization, and consider topical corticosteroids only on intact skin, prioritizing symptom relief and barrier support without occluding broken areas [^111Utr7x] [^112ezXTU].

> For grade 2, I should review specifics and not miss infection surveillance. Moderate erythema and patchy moist desquamation warrant engaging a skin or wound care specialist, using self-adhesive soft silicone dressings on irradiated skin, applying hydrogel with absorbent dressings for open areas secured with bandages, initiating topical antiseptics or antibiotics at the earliest sign of infection, optimizing pain control, and increasing cleansing frequency to daily or twice daily as tolerated [^114khBrG] [^112sqzro] [^116B7PRo] [^116crW8k] [^1158zvM9].

> For grade 3 with confluent moist desquamation or bleeding, I need to ensure a multidisciplinary escalation pathway. Care should activate a multidisciplinary team including radiation oncology, dermatology, plastic surgery, and wound care, with soft silicone or other appropriate dressings on broken skin, absorbent layers to manage exudate, prompt topical antiseptics or antibiotics at the first sign of infection, and adequate systemic analgesia, with individualized deliberation about any necessary modifications to radiotherapy; let me be cautious here and note that while grade 4 guidance explicitly discusses treatment interruption, grade 3 decisions should be personalized with close oncologic coordination [^113xtEY1] [^115bF66D] [^112q3FBX] [^115XzRce] [^113VnhMp] [^1152169k].

> But wait, what if severe inflammation is amplified by bacterial superinfection. Severe cases are often complicated by Staphylococcus aureus, where cultures and targeted therapy can be decisive; when infection is confirmed, combining topical and oral antibiotics with topical corticosteroids can rapidly quell inflammation and restore barrier repair, so I should not overlook microbiologic evaluation [^112Wkiw4].

> For grade 4 with necrosis or deep ulceration, I should confirm that oncologic therapy modification and surgical input are prioritized. Guidance recommends considering interruption or discontinuation of systemic and radiation therapy and evaluating for surgical intervention such as debridement or reconstruction, while continuing comprehensive wound care and infection control measures implemented for grade 3 [^1152169k] [^113ccwrK].

> I need to check whether clinician grading reflects patient experience because undertreatment can arise from discordance. Patient-reported outcomes often report worse symptoms than clinician ratings with poor concordance across domains like pigmentation changes, blistering, and pain, which supports routine use of validated PRO tools such as Skindex-16 along with clinician scales like CTCAE and RISRAS, as also emphasized by expert consensus on outcomes and tools for ARD severity assessment [^111c4Ew9] [^111KqL1U] [^112FERit] [^111LQY8A].

> Skin tone considerations are crucial, and I should double-check how to improve reliability of erythema assessment. Erythema may appear differently or be less apparent in darker skin tones, and illustrated photonumeric scales designed for breast RT enhance cross-tone consistency; hmm, wait a minute, the earlier draft's RISRAS citation was truncated, let me correct that by pointing to the development of an illustrated scale for ARD in breast cancer and Delphi recommendations that include RISRAS for standardized assessment across skin types [^116JnPJz] [^115v6N6U] [^112FERit].

> Let me consider supportive skincare formulation choices and the role of dermocosmetics without drifting into non-evidence claims. Fragrance-free, irritant-minimized dermocosmetics with skin-appropriate pH near 5 can support the barrier and microbiome, potentially reducing symptom exacerbations, and broader supportive care literature emphasizes proactive skincare and sun protection during RT, though I should remember that product-specific claims require cautious interpretation pending rigorous trials [^114pHzfg] [^1111xaMf] [^117DGnq7].

> Hold on, I should verify guidance for concurrent targeted therapy, especially EGFR inhibitors that can add acneiform eruptions. In head and neck RT combined with EGFR inhibitors, when acneiform rash coexists with dermatitis, management should be based on the dermatitis grade within the field, adjusting topical and systemic measures accordingly and coordinating across oncology and dermatology teams [^115EKpFN].

> I should also review technique and planning because prevention is not just topical. A randomized trial demonstrated that breast IMRT reduced moist desquamation compared with standard techniques, underscoring the importance of dose homogeneity and planning metrics in mitigating RD, even as practice surveys continue to show variability in topical regimens and dressings due to heterogeneous evidence and training gaps [^115m9nVn] [^115fjxBJ].

> Next, I will examine the strength and consistency of evidence to avoid overstatement. Comprehensive systematic reviews for MASCC identified many interventions but with variable quality, and while items like Mepitel film, Hydrofilm, mometasone, betamethasone, photobiomodulation, olive oil, and Mepilex Lite achieved consensus recommendations in defined contexts, heterogeneity and methodological limitations persist, and products like StrataXRT show suggestive benefit yet require adequately powered RCTs; more supportive care trials with PRO endpoints are still needed [^112xKUjd] [^116toVfn] [^113FDrnj] [^114Ngb2h].

Radiation-induced dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin reaction from radiotherapy, with **up to 95% of patients** affected [^116JnPJz] [^113LWRTr] [^115PsEnB]. It presents as erythema, dryness, desquamation, and pruritus [^113LWRTr], and **can progress to moist desquamation or ulceration** [^116JnPJz], impacting quality of life and potentially interrupting cancer treatment [^115m9nVn] [^114jt8TG]. Management includes gentle cleansing [^112CGvVu], regular moisturization [^111Xt5kZ], and **topical corticosteroids** for inflammation [^112ezXTU]; barrier films [^114Yychm], silicone dressings, and photobiomodulation are recommended for prevention and management [^114241fh] [^116toVfn]. Severe cases may require systemic antibiotics [^112Wkiw4] [^115XzRce], multidisciplinary care [^113xtEY1], or treatment interruption [^1152169k]. Prevention focuses on skin hygiene [^112CGvVu] [^116oK5hw], moisturization [^111Xt5kZ], sun protection [^1158MGck], and minimizing friction [^113Rei6u].

---

## Pathophysiology

Radiation dermatitis arises from **radiation-induced cellular injury** [^115PsEnB], impaired epidermal regeneration [^116JnPJz], and inflammatory signaling [^113LWRTr]. Ionizing radiation damages basal keratinocytes, causing cell cycle arrest, reduced epidermal renewal, and barrier disruption [^115PsEnB], which leads to erythema, desquamation, and pruritus [^116JnPJz]. Inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β, IL-23) and IL-17–expressing γδ T cells drive the inflammatory response and keratinocyte hyperproliferation [^116i7az6] [^1176oR7F]. Chronic changes include fibrosis, pigment alteration, and vascular damage from **persistent cytokine activity** [^116JnPJz] [^114wrQzq].

---

## Clinical presentation and grading

Radiation dermatitis **presents acutely within weeks** of radiotherapy and, chronically, months to years later [^115PsEnB] [^116JnPJz]. Acute features include erythema, dryness, desquamation, pruritus, and pain [^113LWRTr]; severe cases show moist desquamation or ulceration [^116JnPJz]. Chronic changes include fibrosis, atrophy, telangiectasia, and pigment alteration [^116JnPJz] [^114wrQzq]. Severity is **graded using standardized tools** [^112FERit] [^111LQY8A]:

| **Grade** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|
| Grade 1 | Mild erythema, dryness, slight desquamation |
| Grade 2 | Moderate erythema, dry desquamation, mild edema |
| Grade 3 | Severe erythema, moist desquamation, significant edema |
| Grade 4 | Ulceration, necrosis, severe pain, potential infection |

---

## Risk factors

Several factors **increase the risk and severity** of radiation dermatitis:

- **Radiation dose and fractionation** [^113LWRTr] [^115m9nVn]: Higher doses and conventional fractionation increase risk.
- **Treatment area**: Breast, head and neck, anal, and vulvar sites are higher risk [^116JnPJz] [^113LWRTr].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, smoking, diabetes, and darker skin tones increase susceptibility [^113LWRTr] [^1169Cdc4].
- **Concurrent therapies**: Chemotherapy or targeted agents (e.g. EGFR inhibitors) [^115EKpFN] exacerbate reactions [^113LWRTr].

---

## Prevention strategies

Effective prevention focuses on **skin care and protective measures**:

- **Skin hygiene**: Daily gentle cleansing with lukewarm water and mild soap reduces severity [^112CGvVu] [^116oK5hw].
- **Moisturization**: Regular use of basic moisturizers from pretreatment maintains barrier function [^111Xt5kZ] [^117DGnq7].
- **Sun protection**: High SPF (≥ 50) and protective clothing are recommended [^1158MGck] [^117DGnq7].
- **Friction avoidance**: Loose-fitting clothing and minimal rubbing reduce irritation [^113Rei6u].
- **Topical corticosteroids**: Prophylactic mometasone or betamethasone reduce severity [^112ezXTU] [^116toVfn].
- **Barrier films**: Polyurethane or silicone-based films prevent higher-grade reactions [^114Yychm] [^116toVfn].
- **Photobiomodulation**: Low-level laser therapy prevents severe dermatitis [^114241fh] [^114EbbzM] [^116toVfn].

---

## Management strategies

Management **depends on severity** and patient factors:

- **General measures**: Continue gentle cleansing, moisturization, and friction avoidance [^112CGvVu] [^116oK5hw].
- **Topical corticosteroids**: Use on intact skin to reduce inflammation and pruritus [^112ezXTU] [^116LT4NP].
- **Dressings**: Silicone or hydrogel dressings for moist desquamation or open areas [^112sqzro] [^116toVfn].
- **Analgesia**: Adequate pain control as needed [^116crW8k].
- **Infection control**: Topical or systemic antibiotics for suspected infection [^112qBua8] [^112Wkiw4].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Dermatology, wound care, and oncology input for severe cases [^113xtEY1] [^111rqp4e].
- **Treatment interruption**: Consider for grade 4 reactions [^1152169k].

---

## Impact on quality of life

Radiation dermatitis **significantly impairs quality of life**, causing pain, pruritus, sleep disturbance, and psychological distress, which may lead to treatment interruptions [^113LWRTr] [^114jt8TG]. Patient-reported outcomes often indicate greater severity than clinician assessments, underscoring the need for **patient-centered care** [^111c4Ew9] [^111LQY8A].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Emerging approaches include photobiomodulation, novel barrier films, and topical agents (e.g. StrataXRT), but **high-quality evidence remains limited** [^113FDrnj] [^116toVfn] [^115A35SG]. Ongoing research aims to standardize assessment tools and develop effective interventions [^112FERit] [^111KqL1U] [^112xKUjd].

The following constitutes key background information on radiation dermatitis:

- **Definition**: Acute radiation dermatitis is an inflammatory skin reaction caused by exposure to ionizing radiation, most commonly occurring as an acute adverse effect of radiotherapy in cancer patients.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of radiation dermatitis involves radiation-induced cellular injury, impaired epidermal regeneration, and inflammatory signaling. Early skin reactions result from cell cycle arrest in basal keratinocytes, which limits the replacement of cells shed from the stratum corneum. This adaptive response reduces stem cell vulnerability to radiation but contributes to epidermal thinning and desquamation. Inflammatory cytokines cause tenderness, swelling, and erythema, though erythema may be less apparent or appear differently in darker skin tones. With increasing dose or prolonged exposure, complete loss of the stratum corneum can lead to moist desquamation. Regeneration begins from follicular stem cells in the bulge region, forming islands of new epidermis that expand and merge. Chronic radiation dermatitis may occur when pro-inflammatory and profibrotic cytokine activity remains unbalanced, resulting in fibrosis, pigmentary changes, and vascular damage.

- **Epidemiology**: Radiation dermatitis is one of the most common side effects of radiotherapy, affecting up to 95% of patients receiving treatment involving the skin surface. It is especially prevalent in individuals undergoing radiotherapy for breast, head and neck, anal, or vulvar cancers, where treatment fields are subjected to high doses of radiation.

### MASCC clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis: part 1) systematic review [^113LWRTr]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) has long been recognized as a common adverse effect of external beam radiotherapy (RT), developing in up to 95% of cancer patients. The pathophysiology of ARD is complex and involves radiation-induced damage to both the epidermis and dermis, altered proliferation and differentiation of basal and epidermal keratinocytes, barrier disruption, and a trigger of proinflammatory markers that contribute to ARD-associated symptoms. ARD, arising within 90 days from the initiation of treatment, is often characterized by changes in skin pigmentation, pain, pruritus, edema, and desquamation (dry and/or moist), with ulceration in severe cases. The severity of ARD varies depending on treatment-related factors (e.g. radiation dose, irradiated volume, bolus, concurrent chemotherapy, treatment positioning) and intrinsic factors (e.g. body mass index, irradiation site, smoking status, and skin pigmentation). Approximately 36% of patients develop moderate to severe acute reactions characterized by moist desquamation, which are postulated to be associated with an increased risk of irreversible late side effects developing in the months to years following RT, such as telangiectasia and fibrosis.

### Randomized, prospective, open-label phase III trial comparing Mebo ointment with Biafine cream for the management of acute dermatitis during radiotherapy for breast cancer [^115eQJDJ]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Acute radiation dermatitis is a common side-effect of radiotherapy in breast cancer and significantly impacts patients' quality of life due to pain and discomfort. This study aims to compare the effect of β-sitosterol (Mebo) ointment with trolamine (Biafine) cream for the prevention and treatment of radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiation therapy.

This prospective open-label randomized phase III study was developed to assess the efficacy of two topical agents for managing acute radiation dermatitis. Female breast cancer patients requiring a course of radiation therapy at our institution were enrolled and randomized into two groups: one with Mebo ointment and one with Biafine cream. Both medications were applied twice per day during the entire treatment period, and skin reactions along with related symptoms were assessed weekly. Grading of skin reactions followed the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading system.

Between September 2015 and May 2017, a total of 161 patients were recruited for this trial. The mean age was similar for both groups (50.19 ± 12.57 vs. 51.73 ± 11.23, respectively, P = 0.41). All other patient and treatment characteristics were similar in both groups, except for the use of boost (82.7% in the Biafine group vs. 36.7% in the Mebo group, P = 0.012). Analysis was conducted for reactions recorded before the beginning of the boost and for the entire course, including the boost. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed no significant differences.

### A multicenter randomized trial of breast intensity-modulated radiation therapy to reduce acute radiation dermatitis [^115m9nVn]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2008). High credibility.

Dermatitis is a frequent adverse effect of adjuvant breast radiotherapy. It is more likely to occur in full-breasted women and when the radiation is distributed non-homogeneously across the breast. Breast intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a technique that ensures a more homogeneous dose distribution.

A multicenter, double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate if breast IMRT would reduce the rate of acute skin reactions (notably moist desquamation), decrease pain, and improve quality of life compared with standard radiotherapy using wedges. Patients were assessed weekly during and up to six weeks after radiotherapy.

A total of 358 patients were randomly assigned between July 2003 and March 2005 in two Canadian centers, with 331 included in the analysis. Breast IMRT significantly improved the dose distribution compared with standard radiation. This improvement was reflected in a lower proportion of patients experiencing moist desquamation during or up to six weeks after their radiation treatment: 31.2% with IMRT compared with 47.8% with standard treatment (P = 0.002). A multivariate analysis showed that the use of breast IMRT (P = 0.003) and smaller breast size (P < .001) were significantly associated with a decreased risk of moist desquamation. Although the use of IMRT did not correlate with pain and quality of life, the presence of moist desquamation significantly correlated with pain (P = 0.002) and a reduced quality of life (P = 0.003).

In conclusion, breast IMRT significantly reduced the occurrence of moist desquamation compared with standard radiotherapy.

### MASCC clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis: part 1) systematic review [^114yWgvF]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive and up-to-date systematic review compiling all published clinical trials investigating methods for ARD care. A systematic review was conducted in 2013 by Wong et al. in the development of previous MASCC clinical practice guidelines for ARD, identifying 56 relevant RCTs. To develop clinically relevant recommendations on the use of various interventions for ARD, we aimed to include all study types through a systematic approach and identified dozens of different interventions evaluated for ARD prevention and management. A total of 235 original studies were included in this review, including 149 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Most interventions could not be recommended due to a low quality of evidence, lack of supporting evidence, or conflicting findings across multiple trials. Overall, photobiomodulation therapy, Mepitel® film, mometasone furoate, betamethasone, olive oil, and oral enzyme mixtures showed promising results across multiple RCTs mainly as ARD prevention methods.

Several reviews have been conducted to summarize the evidence on ARD prevention and management methods. A review by Chan et al. (2014) identified 47 RCTs on interventions for ARD care and recognized six intervention types: oral systemic medications, skin care practices, steroidal topical therapies, non-steroidal topical therapies, dressings, and others. An oral enzyme mixture was found to be effective in preventing ARD and minimizing ARD severity, which was similarly found in our review through studies by Dale et al. (2001) and Gujr.

### Practice patterns for the prophylaxis and treatment of acute radiation dermatitis in the United States [^115fjxBJ]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Due to the inconclusive evidence for available treatment options, management of radiation dermatitis (RD) varies among practitioners. This study defines and reviews the treatment patterns for RD in the United States, providing guidance for practicing physicians as well as directions for future research.

- **Methods**: An online survey of 21 questions was emailed to all 5,626 members of the 2013 American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) directory, which included radiation oncologists, residents, fellows, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and other care providers. The questions were designed to evaluate the demographics of responders, their training and comfort in the management of RD, and their patterns of care regarding prophylaxis and treatment of RD. Data was analyzed using simple summary and descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: Out of the 5,626 emails sent, we were left with 709 physician respondents for our analysis, yielding a response rate of 12.9%. Although 84.7% of physicians felt that RD had a moderate or large impact on patients' quality of life during cancer treatment, only 30.1% received special training or specific instructional courses in treating RD during their medical training in residency or fellowship. Eighty-nine percent of surveyed physicians rely on observational and/or anecdotal findings to guide treatment decisions, and 51.4% reported using evidence-based treatments.

- **Conclusion**: The results of our study show that there is great variability in the topical agents and dressings used in practice by radiation oncologists to prevent and treat RD.

### Acute skin toxicity and self-management ability among Chinese breast cancer radiotherapy patients: a qualitative study [^112xEdus]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

Radiation dermatitis is the most common reaction to radiotherapy; almost all breast cancer patients receive radiotherapy on an outpatient basis. Currently, there are no studies on the experience of radiation dermatitis and the ability to self-manage it. Therefore, we aimed to use qualitative approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the actual experiences and self-management ability in order to provide a reference for further improving the effectiveness of self-management and to optimize symptom management strategies.

A descriptive qualitative study was conducted using purposive sampling to select 17 breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted from September to November 2023. The Colaizzi seven-step analysis method was used to classify the data into summarized themes.

- **Multiple self-reported skin symptoms**: Breast cancer patients with radiation dermatitis reported various symptoms.

- **Impact on quality of life**: Patients experienced a multidimensional impact on their quality of life, especially due to pruritus and ulceration.

- **Ability to self-manage radiation dermatitis**: Participants demonstrated strong mental toughness, a positive response, and also experienced self-doubt.

- **Challenges faced**: Patients expressed concerns about radiotherapy side effects and recurrence, the need for targeted symptom management, and continuity of care after radiotherapy.

Healthcare professionals should consider patients' self-reported symptoms when assessing radiation dermatitis. For pruritus and pain, enhancing precision symptom management can improve patients' quality of life.

Four themes were identified from the interview responses:

- **Multiple self-reported skin symptoms**: Breast cancer patients with radiation dermatitis often experience various symptoms.
- **Impact on quality of life**: There is a multidimensional impact on the patient's quality of life, especially related to pruritus and ulceration.
- **Self-management ability**: Patients demonstrate strong mental toughness, a positive response, and sometimes self-doubt in managing radiation dermatitis.
- **Challenges faced**: Concerns about radiotherapy side effects and recurrence, targeted symptom management, and continuity of care after radiotherapy are significant challenges.

Healthcare professionals should consider patients' self-reported symptoms when assessing radiation dermatitis. For pruritus and pain, we can enhance precision symptom management to improve patients' quality of life.

### Shedding light on the management of acute radiation dermatitis: Insight from the MASCC Oncodermatology study group [^115aNbXY]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). High credibility.

This paper highlights a collection of eleven recently published manuscripts on the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis. These meta-analyses provide additional evidence for the updated clinical practice guidelines by the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) Oncodermatology study group for the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis. The collection of papers elucidates the currently available evidence on acute radiation dermatitis, highlighting consolidated knowledge, effective treatments, and proposed areas for future clinical trials. Overall, a total of 51 randomized controlled trials were retrieved and included for quantitative analysis from an initial systematic review of the literature from 1946 to January 2023.

- **Discussion of the clinical impact**: Various therapeutic interventions include antiperspirant and deodorant use, barrier films and dressings, natural and miscellaneous agents, photobiomodulation therapy, topical corticosteroids, topical non-steroidal agents, skin hygiene and washing, as well as StrataXRT and Mepitel film in breast cancer patients.

The comprehensive nature of the meta-analyses and their related findings may help reduce discrepancies in the treatment of acute radiation dermatitis and facilitate consistency of therapeutic interventions employed in clinical practice worldwide.

### Severe radiation dermatitis is related to Staphylococcus aureus [^112Wkiw4]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute radiation dermatitis commonly occurs following local radiation therapy for various cancers and, when severe, may necessitate disruption of treatment. An intense inflammatory reaction may result in a breakdown of the skin's barrier function and accompanying bacterial colonization. Bacterial superantigens may exacerbate inflammation through the activation of T-cells and subsequent cytokine release.

We report six cases of severe radiation dermatitis in cancer patients. Four of the six grew pathogenic bacteria, and three had psoriasiform or eczematous reactions at distant sites. Both the radiation dermatitis and the distant cutaneous reactions resolved rapidly on a combination of topical steroids and oral plus topical antibiotic therapy. We suggest that staphylococcal superinfection of acute radiodermatitis intensifies the inflammatory process and hinders repair of the epidermal barrier.

Patients with acute radiation dermatitis should be investigated for secondary infection. We emphasize the importance of including topical and oral antibiotic therapy in conjunction with topical corticosteroids to eradicate infection and hasten repair of the skin's barrier function. These cases are presented to call attention to the role of Staphylococcus aureus in the pathogenesis of severe radiation dermatitis and the need to include appropriate antibiotic therapy based on culture in the management of acute radiation dermatitis.

Regarding medical management for radiation dermatitis, more specifically with respect to general principles, MASCC 2023 guidelines recommend offering the following for the prevention of radiation dermatitis:

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Such as mometasone and betamethasone.

- **Polyurethane film**.

- **Silicone-based polyurethane**: Recommended for patients with breast cancer.

- **Photobiomodulation or low-level laser therapy**: Recommended for patients with breast cancer.

- **Olive oil**.

### United States cutaneous oncodermatology management (USCOM) II: A multidisciplinary-guided algorithm for the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis in cancer patients [^116CaYxE]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Among the 1,918,030 patients in the United States estimated to be diagnosed with cancer in 2022, approximately 50% will require radiation therapy (RT) as part of their treatment plan. Radiation dermatitis (RD) is the most common side effect of RT, particularly in patients with breast, head, neck, and anal cancers, with a wide spectrum in the severity and degree of RD that develops in an individual and considerable heterogeneity in the management of RD. In addition, few contemporaneous treatment algorithms exist for the prevention and treatment of RD, underscoring the need to develop uniform, evidence-directed guidelines.

- **Materials and methods**: A modified Delphi process was used to develop a treatment algorithm (USCOM II) that expanded upon a previous algorithm (USCOM I) for the management of RD. A panel of multidisciplinary advisors was selected, and a systematic literature search with key terms was conducted to identify publications on RD. Subsequently, the literature was graded according to the strength of evidence for the recommendation. The advisors convened to review the results and assemble the algorithm. Further iterations on the algorithm were obtained until 100% group consensus was achieved.

- **Results**: An algorithm that tailors the management of RD, based on the CTCAE v.5 grading of RD and the presence of moist desquamation, was developed. Unique features include photographs illustrating the clinical spectrum of RD to supplement the algorithm and the integration of medically based recommendations with over-the-counter (OTC) skincare regimens.

### Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis: International Delphi consensus-based recommendations [^116toVfn]. The Lancet Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Acute radiation dermatitis is a frequent adverse effect of radiotherapy, but standardization of care for this condition is lacking. Due to conflicting evidence and variability in guidelines, a four-round Delphi consensus process was employed to gather opinions from 42 international experts on the care for individuals with acute radiation dermatitis, based on existing medical literature. Interventions for the prevention or management of acute radiation dermatitis that achieved at least 75% consensus were recommended for clinical use.

- **Recommendations for prevention**: Six interventions are recommended for the prevention of acute radiation dermatitis: photobiomodulation therapy and Mepitel film for individuals with breast cancer, Hydrofilm, mometasone, betamethasone, and olive oil.

- **Recommendations for management**: Mepilex Lite dressings are recommended for the management of acute radiation dermatitis.

Most interventions were not recommended due to insufficient evidence, conflicting evidence, or a lack of consensus supporting their use. This indicates a need for further research. Clinicians can consider implementing the recommended interventions in their practice to prevent and manage acute radiation dermatitis until additional evidence is available.

### Evaluation of clinical trials addressing supportive care measures for management of acute and chronic radiation toxicities [^114Ngb2h]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). High credibility.

Radiation therapy can cause acute and long-term side effects despite advances in treatment delivery techniques. While significant research has been conducted to prevent the occurrence of toxicity, there is a need for evidence-based supportive care measures to manage radiation side effects. This analysis aims to examine the state of supportive care trials in radiation oncology and identify areas that require further study.

- **Methods**: A ClinicalTrials.gov search was conducted using the term "radiation toxicity" to identify registered trials with a primary endpoint of toxicity management. These studies were further classified as supportive care interventions or toxicity prevention. Study details were evaluated for all supportive care trials.

- **Results**: Of the thirty-eight supportive care trials identified, most were observational/uncategorized (50%), in phase III (28.9%), or phase II (13.2%). Head and neck (42.1%), genitourinary (18.4%), and breast (13.2%) were the most studied disease sites. Xerostomia (23.7%), mucositis (18.4%), and dermatitis (18.4%) were the most evaluated toxicities. Medication-based (28.9%), procedures (28.9%), and topical agents (21.1%) were the most common interventions. Thirty-two studies included patient-reported outcomes (PROs; 84.2%), of which seventeen trials (53.1%) had PROs as a primary endpoint.

- **Conclusions**: Only a small portion of supportive care trials generate high-level evidence to evaluate interventions with patient-reported endpoints. More supportive care trials are needed to effectively manage radiation toxicities.

### The role of dermocosmetics in the management of cancer-related skin toxicities: International expert consensus [^114pHzfg]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Low credibility.

While management approaches may be individualized in accordance with the specific oncologic treatment and patient risk profile, there are general daily skin care approaches that should be used for the majority of cancer patients from the initiation of therapy. Prevention is a key element of managing skin toxicities, although it is perhaps not as widely used as we could hope. We recommend that the oncology multidisciplinary team familiarize themselves with skin care basics and develop a standard protocol for implementing cleansers and moisturizers for cancer patients, along with sunscreen during appropriate times of the year and in specific regions. Some dermocosmetics are formulated specifically for — and tested on — skin that is fragile, pathological, and sensitive. These formulations should be free of additives, irritants such as fragrances or perfumes, sensitizing agents, and herbal extracts (as much as possible) and may be more appropriate for prevention and management of skin toxicities.

- **Appropriate skin care**: Supports and maintains the epidermal skin barrier and skin microbiota. It is crucial to maintain the diversity of microbiota since this affects innate immunity. Skin hydration relieves symptoms and, if skin toxicity does occur, can reduce exacerbations that may lead to secondary infections. Cleansers should have a pH close to that of skin (~5), and basic and neutral pH cleansers should be avoided.

Emollients may include ingredients beneficial to maintaining skin health.

### Photobiomodulation therapy for the prevention of acute radiation dermatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114EbbzM]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Low credibility.

Approximately 95% of patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) experience radiation dermatitis (RD). Evidence has suggested that photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) can stimulate skin renewal and minimize RD. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the efficacy of PBMT in RD prevention through a comprehensive literature review.

- **Methods**: A literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases was conducted from 1980 to March 2021 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of PBMT for RD prevention. Forest plots were developed using RevMan software to quantitatively compare data between studies.

- **Results**: Five papers were identified: four in breast and one in head and neck cancer patients. Patients receiving PBMT experienced less severe RD than the control groups after 40 Gray (Gy) of RT (grade 3 toxicity: Odds Ratio (OR): 0.57, 95% CI 0.14–2.22, p = 0.42) and at the end of RT (grade 0+1 vs. 2+3 toxicity: OR: 0.28, 95% CI 0.15–0.53, p < 0.0001). RT interruptions due to RD severity were more frequent in the control group (OR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.10–6.58, p = 0.85).

- **Conclusion**: Preventive PBMT may be protective against the development of severe grades of RD and reduce the frequency of RT interruptions. Larger sample sizes and other cancer sites at risk of RD should be evaluated in future studies to confirm the true efficacy of PBMT, also in preventing the onset of RD and to finalize a standardized protocol to optimize the technique. At present, starting PBMT when RT starts is recommendable, as well as performing 2 to 3 laser sessions weekly.

### Medical management of radiation injuries: Current approaches [^111mJwto]. Occupational Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The approach to the medical management of irradiated patients begins with early diagnosis of radiation injury. Medical assessment of radiation dose is based on event history, symptomatology, and laboratory results, with emphasis on time to emesis and lymphocyte depletion kinetics. Dose assessment provides a basis for early use of hematopoietic growth factors that can shorten the period of neutropenia for patients with acute radiation syndrome. Assessments of hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous syndromes have improved in recent years, but treatment options remain limited. Selected examples of developments are presented.

### Referral practices to dermatologists for the treatment of radiation dermatitis in the United States: A call for a multidisciplinary approach [^111rqp4e]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Low credibility.

Acute radiation dermatitis (RD) is a disfiguring and painful rash that occurs in up to 95% of patients receiving radiation therapy (RT) for cancer. Treatment for RD varies among practitioners, with no evidence-based gold standard for management. While a multidisciplinary approach has been utilized to manage other cancer-related toxicities, RD is most often managed by the treating radiation oncologist. This study evaluated the referral practices of radiation oncologists to dermatologists for the management of RD utilizing a survey of radiation oncologists across the United States. The goal was to identify the referral practices of radiation oncologists for RD and any barriers to a multidisciplinary approach.

Of the 705 respondents, 15% reported ever referring patients to dermatology. Private practitioners referred significantly less than providers in academic or oncology centers (p < 0.01). Practitioners in urban settings were more likely to refer (p < 0.01), and radiation oncologists in the Southeastern USA were less likely to refer (p < 0.01).

Lack of timely access to dermatologists in various geographic areas, in addition to radiation oncologists' preference to treat RD, are barriers to multidisciplinary management of RD. Inclusion of dermatologists and wound care specialists in cancer treatment teams could improve patient care and stimulate needed research into strategies for treatment and prevention of RD.

### Radiation-induced dermatitis is mediated by IL17-expressing γδ T cells [^116i7az6]. Radiation Research (2017). Low credibility.

Radiation dermatitis is a serious cutaneous injury caused by radiation therapy or accidental nuclear exposure. The pathogenic immune mechanisms underlying this injury are still poorly understood. We aim to discover how the dysregulated immune response after irradiation orchestrates skin inflammation.

The skin on the left flank of C57BL/6J wild-type and C57BL/6J Tcrd -/- mice, which are deficient in γδ T cells, was exposed to a single X-ray dose of 25 Gy. The right-flank skin was used as a sham-irradiated control. At 4 weeks post-irradiation, the wild-type skin exhibited signs of depilation, erythema, and desquamation. Histological analysis showed hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and acanthosis. There was a dramatic elevation of IL17-expressing T cells identified from the irradiated skin, mainly contributed by γδ T cells and innate lymphoid cells, rather than Th17 cells.

Furthermore, protein levels of critical cytokines for IL17-expressing γδ T cell activation, such as IL1β and IL23, were found to be markedly upregulated. Radiation-induced dermatitis was significantly attenuated in γδ T cell knockout mice. In vitro, normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) could be initiator cells of inflammation by providing numerous pro-inflammatory mediators upon radiation. They could also act as effector cells of epidermal hyperplasia in response to exogenous IL17 and/or IL22 treatment. Our findings implicate a novel role of IL17-expressing γδ T cells in mediating radiation-induced skin inflammation. This study reveals the innate immune response pathway as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

### Comparison of clinical practice guidelines on radiation dermatitis: A narrative review [^114ZftpR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Low credibility.

Radiation dermatitis (RD) is a common side effect of radiation therapy (RT). While many different treatment strategies are currently used to address RD, there is a lack of consensus, and RD prophylaxis and management guidelines have remained largely unchanged over the last 10 years. This review aims to formulate unambiguous supportive care interventions by comparing RD clinical practice guidelines published between 2010 and 2021 by several organizations: Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC), British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA), Cancer Care Manitoba (CCMB), Oncology Nursing Society (ONS), Society and College of Radiographers (SCoR), and International Society of Nurses in Cancer Care (ISNCC).

- **Methods**: Areas of agreement and discordance were assessed among the MASCC, BCCA, CCMB, ONS, SCoR, and ISNCC guidelines.

- **Results**: Treatment recommendations across guidelines for acute RD and chronic RT-induced skin toxicities have been summarized. The strongest agreement among the guidelines exists for the use of topical corticosteroids, silver sulfadiazine, washing, and deodorant. All guidelines recommend the use of topical corticosteroids, and washing with water and soap is consistently supported. There is minimal consensus on an optimal dressing or barrier film for RD prophylaxis or management. MASCC weakly recommends the prophylactic use of silver sulfadiazine to reduce RD, while BCCA, CCMB, and SCoR recommend its use upon signs of infection. MASCC and CCMB recommend the use of a long-pulsed dye laser to manage telangiectasia, a late effect of RT.

### Development of an illustrated scale for acute radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients [^115v6N6U]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Scales for rating acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) have not been validated despite decades of clinical use. Little is known regarding the relationship between toxicity scores and patient-reported symptoms. Skin tone also complicates the assessment of ARD; consequently, we sought to design an illustrated scale to consistently describe ARD across various skin tone types in breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT).

Patients undergoing RT for breast cancer were enrolled in a prospective study with photographs obtained at 2-week intervals. Photographs were clustered according to the apparent severity of acute radiation dermatitis, and a descriptive photonumeric scale was developed. Four clinically experienced raters used both the illustrated photonumeric scale and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events to independently score the collection of photographs in two independent sessions.

Among 80 unique patients with 192 photographs, 47 patients (59%) completed questionnaires about their symptoms during RT. Physicians completed toxicity forms at the point-of-care for 52 patients (65%). Photonumeric ratings compared against patient reports of dry and moist desquamation demonstrated high specificity (95% and 93%, respectively) and negative predictive value (84% and 92%), indicating the correct identification of patients who did not report dry or moist desquamation. The sensitivity and positive predictive value for separate measures of dry and moist desquamation were considerably lower. A combined measure of any desquamation (dry or moist) remains an essential aspect of understanding the clinical impact.

### Radiodermatitis: A review of our current understanding [^115PsEnB]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Radiodermatitis (also known as radiation dermatitis, radiation-induced skin reactions, or radiation injury) is a significant side effect of ionizing radiation delivered to the skin during cancer treatment, as well as a result of nuclear attacks and disasters, such as the Fukushima incident in 2011. Specifically, 95% of cancer patients receiving radiation therapy will develop some form of radiodermatitis, including erythema, dry desquamation, and moist desquamation. These radiation skin reactions result in myriad complications, including delays in treatment, diminished aesthetic appeal, and reduced quality of life.

Recent technological advancements and novel treatment regimens have only been partly successful in ameliorating these adverse side effects. This article examines the knowledge surrounding the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, differential diagnoses, prevention, and management of radiodermatitis. Future research should examine therapies that incorporate the understanding of the pathophysiology of radiodermatitis while measuring effectiveness using objective and universal outcome measures.

### Quantification of patient-reported outcome measures of radiation-induced skin reactions for use in clinical trial design [^115LnfM1]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Skin toxicity is a common effect from radiotherapy, although difficult to predict on an individual basis, and there is little evidence-based management. This study aimed to quantify inter-patient variation in patient-reported outcome measures for radiation-induced skin reactions (RISR) to enable the determination of the number of patients required for adequate power in a comparative trial of RISR management strategies.

The study included 154 patients scheduled to receive breast cancer radiotherapy. Patients filled in a weekly questionnaire during and up to 4 weeks following the end of radiotherapy, scoring five aspects of their experience of RISR: skin redness, and bother from redness like itching, burning sensation, and tenderness/pain.

Assessment of patients' reported experience of their RISR was shown to be feasible, with 91% of patients returning at least two questionnaires. The mean score increase between weeks 1 and 4 was 25 points (p value < 0.0001, 95% CI 21–29), and the estimated standard deviation at 4 weeks was 18 (95% CI 16–21).

Patients' assessment of their reaction was not predicted on the basis of treatment and patient-related characteristics. Based on the observed variance in scores at 4 weeks, we could calculate that the sample size required for a comparative study of two RISR management policies would be 200 patients to have statistical power to detect a clinically significant difference in patient-rated scores of their skin reactions. A trial employing this tool would help provide an evidence base to guide policy in a comprehensive manner.

### Assessing the validity of clinician advice that patients avoid use of topical agents before daily radiotherapy treatments [^113h7CAb]. JAMA Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Importance**: Radiation dermatitis is common and often treated with topical therapy. Patients are typically advised to avoid topical agents for several hours before daily radiotherapy (RT) out of concern that topical agents might increase the radiation dose to the skin. With modern RT's improved skin-sparing properties, this recommendation may be irrelevant.

- **Objective**: To assess whether applying either metallic or nonmetallic topical agents before radiation treatment alters the skin dose.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A 24-question online survey of patients and clinicians was conducted from January 15, 2015, to March 15, 2017, to determine practices regarding topical therapy use. In preclinical studies, the dosimetric effect of the topical agents was evaluated by delivering 200 monitor units and measuring the dose at the surface and at 2-cm depth in a tissue-equivalent phantom with or without two common topical agents: a petroleum-based ointment (Aquaphor, petrolatum 41%) and silver sulfadiazine cream, 1%. Skin doses associated with various photon and electron energies, topical agent thicknesses, and beam incidence were assessed. Whether topical agents altered the skin dose was also evaluated in 24 C57BL/6 mice by using phosphorylated histone (γ-H2AX) immunofluorescent staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Preclinical studies took place at the University of Pennsylvania.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Patient and clinician survey responses; surface radiation dose readings in tissue-equivalent phantom; and γ-H2AX and TU.

### Management of acute radiation dermatitis: A review of the literature and proposal for treatment algorithm [^117Q2XXG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Radiation dermatitis is a common sequela of radiation therapy; up to 95% of patients will develop moderate-to-severe skin reactions. No criterion standard currently exists for the treatment of acute radiation-induced skin toxicity. It is therefore imperative to develop a greater understanding of management options available to allow clinicians to make informed decisions when managing radiation oncology patients. This literature review discusses the topical agents that have been studied for the treatment of acute radiation dermatitis, reviews their mechanisms of action, and presents a treatment algorithm for clinicians managing patients experiencing radiation dermatitis.

### Radiation-induced skin fibrosis: Pathogenesis, current treatment options, and emerging therapeutics [^114wrQzq]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Radiotherapy (RT) has become an indispensable part of oncologic treatment protocols for a range of malignancies. However, a serious adverse effect of RT is radiodermatitis; almost 95% of patients develop moderate to severe skin reactions following radiation treatment.

In the acute setting, these can manifest as erythema, desquamation, ulceration, and pain. Chronically, soft tissue atrophy, alopecia, and stiffness can be noted. Radiodermatitis can delay oncologic treatment protocols and significantly impair quality of life. There is currently a paucity of effective treatment options and prevention strategies for radiodermatitis.

Importantly, recent preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that fat grafting may be of therapeutic benefit, reversing detrimental changes to soft tissue following RT. This review outlines the damaging effects of RT on the skin and soft tissue and discusses available treatment options for radiodermatitis. Emerging strategies to mitigate detrimental, chronic radiation-induced changes are also presented.

### Radiation dermatitis assessment tools used in breast cancer: A systematic review of measurement properties [^111LQY8A]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Low credibility.

This review aimed to assess the quality and efficacy of tools currently used in breast cancer patients to score radiation dermatitis (RD), a common debilitating side effect of radiotherapy (RT).

A search was conducted through Ovid Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases on February 14, 2020. English articles that evaluated an instrument's use in assessing RD among breast cancer patients receiving external beam RT were included. Studies reporting on the reliability, validity, or concordance of items between assessment tools were included in accordance with the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) criteria.

Twelve studies were included in this review, discussing a total of 13 skin toxicity assessment tools.

- **Clinician-reported outcomes (CROs)**: These tools mostly reported moderate correlation with biophysical parameter (BP) measurements and low correlation with patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Traditionally used CRO scoring tools demonstrated moderate inter-rater reliability between clinicians, likely due to the subjective nature of items on the grading scales. Most commonly used tools were found to be either insufficient or indeterminate in their measurement properties.

Standardized tools that measure CROs are subject to clinician interpretation and fail to represent the patient experience.

- **Patient-reported outcomes (PROs)**: Tools designed to assess PROs are promising in their assessments of the impact of RT on patient quality of life; however, most PRO tools fail to capture the full extent of the patient's experience.

### MASCC clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis: Part 1) Systematic review [^114jt8TG]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

This is the first in a series of two papers on MASCC clinical practice guidelines, with the second paper appearing in The Lancet Oncology. Despite technological advancements such as intensity modulated RT (IMRT) and skin-sparing techniques designed to improve skin dose homogeneity and reduce reaction severity, acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) remains a prominent adverse reaction. ARD can negatively impact patient quality of life (QoL), diminish cosmesis, cause infection or sepsis, and result in treatment interruptions. Common QoL issues reported in patients with ARD include decreased self-esteem, embarrassment, increased financial burden associated with treatment, pain, and an impaired ability to complete daily activities.

Currently, clinical care for ARD is highly variable due to a lack of standardization in approaches to prevent and manage skin reactions, hampering the homogeneity of clinical practice recommendations worldwide. In 2013, the Skin Toxicity Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) released a clinical practice guideline to standardize the care of ARD. While this guideline was valuable to care providers at the time, it lacked definitive recommendations on ARD care due to a lack of high-quality evidence and therefore received limited uptake in clinical settings. Other guidelines have also been published by institutions but suffer from similar issues. Therapeutic interventions recommended by these guidelines for both prevention and management include aqueous creams, corticosteroids, and dressings.

### Prevention of radiation dermatitis with skin hygiene and washing: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116oK5hw]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). High credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effects of washing in patients receiving radiotherapy (RT) on radiation dermatitis (RD) severity.

- **Methods**: A literature search was performed using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases between January 1, 1946, and January 31, 2023. Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying the effects of washing with or without soap on RD were identified. A meta-analysis was conducted for clinician-reported outcomes using RevMan 5.4, and a narrative synthesis for patient-reported outcomes was used due to a lack of reported data amenable to quantitative comparison, in accordance with the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) guidelines. The Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB2) and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) criteria were used to assess the risk of bias and certainty of evidence, respectively.

- **Results**: Two RCTs met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Washing with or without soap significantly reduced the incidence of severe RD (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.19–0.55, p < 0.01) and moist desquamation (OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.12–0.52, p < 0.01). Two of four trials found an association between washing and a reduced itching score (p = 0.38). Pain score was not found to be significantly different with or without washing in any of the four studies (p = 0.07). The two studies that assessed burn scores did not detect any difference between the washing group versus the non-washing group (p = 0.25). Washing was associated with improved quality of life (QoL) measures in one study.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis on interventions for radiation dermatitis prevention and management: An overview of the methods [^113pFmKR]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). High credibility.

Over several decades, research on the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis (RD) has continued to emerge, yet there remains no "gold standard" treatment for RD care. Recent guidelines on RD prevention and management were published in 2022 by the Oncodermatology Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC). As part of this guideline process, a collaborative effort was undertaken by international RD experts to quantitatively compare commonly studied RD skin interventions through meta-analyses and discern the superiority of interventional treatments over another intervention, standard-of-care, or placebo in RD prevention and management. This paper summarizes the materials and methodology used in a set of meta-analysis studies that supplement the 2022 MASCC Clinical Practice Guidelines on RD Prevention and Management.

### MASCC clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis: part 1) systematic review [^114p6cbd]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

In addition to common challenges across the field of ARD research, several other limitations were found in our methodology. First, while the 1996 Hadorn criteria for evaluating the quality of research studies has been beneficial in other settings, such as the development of the MASCC Mucositis Clinical Practice Guidelines, it may not have been suitable for the purpose of this review due to the overly generalized assessment criteria. For example, a study was automatically deemed to be of "poor" QoE for using an open-label approach, despite restrictions against blinding with certain interventions. As such, some studies may have been designated a "doubtful" QoE for the sole reason that the intervention could not be blinded. The use of the Hadorn criteria likely overemphasized certain flaws because it was not designed to assess QoE in dermatological trials, thus highlighting the need for a QoE assessment tool tailored specifically to dermatology trials.

### StrataXRT for the prevention and treatment of radiation dermatitis: A critical review [^113FDrnj]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). High credibility.

The primary objective is to systematically review primary studies, such as randomized control trials (RCTs), feasibility, exploratory, and case studies. The secondary objective is to evaluate all secondary articles, such as reviews, guidelines, and editorials, relevant to the use of StrataXRT for the prevention and/or management of radiation dermatitis (RD) in cancer patients.

A literature search was conducted up to February 26, 2023, for articles investigating the use of StrataXRT for the prevention and treatment of RD in the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Google Scholar. The keywords "StrataXRT", "dermatitis", "radiotherapy", and "radiation" were used to identify relevant articles.

Twenty-seven articles from 2018 to 2022 were identified to fulfill the inclusion criteria of this review, of which nine are primary studies and 18 are secondary papers. Significant heterogeneity was observed in the literature studying the effects of StrataXRT, making it difficult to make cross-trial comparisons. There is a suggestion of the efficacy of StrataXRT in the prevention and treatment of RD.

The findings of this review recommend further adequately powered RCTs with robust methodology, including patient and clinician assessments, to determine the efficacy of StrataXRT in preventing and treating RD. This is essential to improve the quality of life of patients and identify which groups of patients would benefit most from StrataXRT.

### MASCC clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis: part 1) systematic review [^111iTuaz]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

In spite of the significant amount of available literature, the evidence supporting interventions for ARD prevention and management is highly variable, most likely due to the differences in study design, outcomes assessed, intervention type, and patient population between studies. Further trials should be conducted on interventions that have shown promising results thus far, such as photobiomodulation therapy, Mepitel film, Hydrofilm, olive oil, oral enzyme mixtures, mometasone furoate, and betamethasone, to confirm efficacy in larger, diverse cohorts of patients. Additional work should also be undertaken to investigate the use of advanced RT modalities in minimizing severe skin toxicity. It is essential that clinical practice guidelines on ARD care not only reflect the evidence but the clinical, real-world experience of healthcare providers as well. Expansion of research to include real-world evidence will assist in overcoming the issues in ARD management in resource-limited environments unable to use any of the potential interventions discussed. As such, to inform evidence-based skin care recommendations on behalf of MASCC, a Delphi consensus process will be reported in a separate publication to reflect the opinions of a panel of experts in treating ARD.

### The role of dermocosmetics in the management of cancer-related skin toxicities: International expert consensus [^1111xaMf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). Low credibility.

In addition to the evidence discussed in the introduction about how dermatology involvement can reduce skin toxicities and improve patient outcomes, there are also emerging data about the use of dermocosmetics in this setting, as illustrated in the following examples. Prophylactic use of a niacinamide-based emollient maintained the quality of life in women being treated for breast cancer (n = 73). In addition, preemptive skin care reduced the incidence of severe skin toxicities by 50% compared to reactive skin care. Luftner et al. studied the use of a supportive and barrier-protective skincare regimen (a kit including 12 products) in the prevention and treatment of skin toxicities during chemotherapy (n = 147). Skin toxicities were reported more frequently in casual users of the regimen compared to those who used it daily (p = 0.029). Erythema and desquamation were also more common in those who used skincare less frequently (p < 0.05).

In addition, a mobile application for the daily use of skincare was associated with a trend toward reduced cases of radiation dermatitis above grade 2. Daily use of an emollient containing an extract of Aquaphilus dolomiae reduced xerosis severity and improved quality of life scores in an observational study of 319 cancer patients with xerosis.

Skin care has an important supportive role for patients with cancer. Skin toxicities are primarily associated with skin barrier dysfunction and dysbiosis, and maintaining good skin barrier function can reduce the occurrence and severity of symptoms. The literature is clear that the use of emollients and mild soaps contributes positively to managing these conditions.

### Radiation-induced dermatitis is mediated by IL17-expressing γδ T cells [^1176oR7F]. Radiation Research (2017). Low credibility.

Radiation dermatitis is a serious cutaneous injury caused by radiation therapy or accidental nuclear exposure. However, the pathogenic immune mechanisms underlying this injury are still poorly understood. We aim to discover how the dysregulated immune response after irradiation orchestrates skin inflammation. The skin on the left flank of C57BL/6J wild-type and C57BL/6J Tcrd -/- mice, which lack γδ T cells, was exposed to a single X-ray dose of 25 Gy, and the right-flank skin was used as a sham-irradiated control. At 4 weeks postirradiation, the wild-type skin exhibited signs of depilation, erythema, and desquamation.

Histological analysis showed hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and acanthosis. A dramatic elevation of IL17-expressing T cells was identified in the irradiated skin, mainly contributed by γδ T cells and innate lymphoid cells, rather than Th17 cells. Furthermore, protein levels of critical cytokines for IL17-expressing γδ T cell activation, such as IL1β and IL23, were markedly upregulated. Lastly, radiation-induced dermatitis was significantly attenuated in γδ T cell knockout mice.

In vitro, normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs) could be initiator cells of inflammation by providing a significant number of pro-inflammatory mediators upon radiation, as well as effector cells of epidermal hyperplasia in response to exogenous IL17 and/or IL22 treatment. Our findings implicate a novel role of IL17-expressing γδ T cells in mediating radiation-induced skin inflammation. This study reveals the innate immune response pathway as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

### Consensus guidelines for the management of radiation dermatitis and coexisting acne-like rash in patients receiving radiotherapy plus EGFR inhibitors for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [^115EKpFN]. Annals of Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Radiation dermatitis occurs to some degree in most patients receiving radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) who receive radiotherapy in combination with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, such as cetuximab, may develop a characteristic acne-like rash in addition to dermatitis.

- **Design**: An advisory board of 11 experienced radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, and dermatologists discussed the management options for skin reactions in patients receiving EGFR inhibitors and radiotherapy for SCCHN. Skin toxicity was categorized according to the National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3) grading.

- **Results**: Both general and grade-specific approaches for the management of dermatitis in this patient group are presented. It was concluded that where EGFR inhibitor-related acne-like rash and dermatitis coexist within irradiated fields, management should be based on the grade of dermatitis: for grade 1 (or no dermatitis), treatment recommendations for EGFR-related acne-like rash outside irradiated fields should be followed; for grades 2 and above, treatment recommendations for dermatitis were proposed.

- **Conclusions**: This paper presents comprehensive consensus guidelines for the treatment of dermatitis in patients with SCCHN receiving EGFR inhibitors in combination with radiotherapy.

### Delphi consensus-based recommendations of tools and outcomes for the assessment of radiation dermatitis severity [^112FERit]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Acute radiation dermatitis (ARD) is a common side effect experienced during radiation therapy (RT) for cancer. Published clinical trials for ARD utilize a myriad of assessment tools and outcomes to measure ARD severity, which limits the comparability of clinical trial results. Our study utilized a modified Delphi consensus survey to gather expert opinions on commonly used tools for ARD severity.

- **Materials and methods**: Thirty experts were invited to participate in a two-round Delphi consensus survey. Of these, 80% (24/30) completed the first round, and 92% (22/24) completed the second round. The Delphi process was conducted using the REDCap platform to systematically collect expert opinions on 32 assessment tools and 11 key outcomes pertinent to the severity of ARD. Assessment tools and outcomes that achieved a consensus of ≥ 70% among the experts were subsequently recommended.

- **Results**: Expert recommendations included four tools (RTOG, CTCAE, RISRAS, and Skindex-16) and eight relevant outcomes (moist desquamation, pain, QoL, erythema, dry desquamation, pruritus/itching, necrosis/ulceration, and burning) for ARD severity assessment. Due to limited evidence, no biophysical parameters reached consensus. Further, experts suggested modifications to existing tools to improve measurement of ARD severity across all skin types.

- **Conclusion**: Our study was the first step in standardizing ARD severity assessment with expert consensus recommending four tools and eight relevant outcomes. However, modifications to existing tools are necessary to promote validation.

### The role of dermocosmetics in the management of cancer-related skin toxicities: International expert consensus [^117DGnq7]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2023). High credibility.

Acute radiation dermatitis is among the most common side effects of radiotherapy. It can manifest in a range from erythema and discomfort to severe confluent moist desquamation. Up to 90% of patients with cancer develop acute skin toxicities during radiation therapy. Skin damage typically occurs in the area treated with radiation and can be exacerbated by systemic therapies. The use of radiation therapy in conjunction with systemic therapy can worsen skin reactions, causing severe xerosis, skin thinning, and even necrosis of the upper skin layers. It has been theorized that the composition of the human microbiome is associated with the severity of radiation dermatitis. Skin microbiome analysis and appropriate management with personal care products to balance the microbiome could be future tools to prevent or decrease the severity of radiodermatitis symptoms.

Acute radiation dermatitis usually occurs within 1 to 4 weeks of treatment and may lead to dose reduction or discontinuation of anticancer therapy. "Chronic radiation dermatitis" is typically defined as effects occurring after radiation therapy has been completed.

Proactive skin care can safely minimize skin reactions and help support epidermal barrier function for patients undergoing radiotherapy. Berger et al. reported that a kit of five commercially available skin care products was associated with more than 92% good to excellent tolerability of irradiation. Furthermore, heavy product users experienced fewer skin toxicities compared to low users. Sun protection is also essential, depending on the location of treatment.

### MASCC clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis: Part 1) Systematic review [^116sdtVs]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted in consultation with a medical librarian through Ovid MEDLINE®, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. This systematic review aimed to update the findings of the 2013 MASCC skin care guidelines on ARD, with a new expanded search to include all study types from 1946 to September 2020. All original studies from the 2013 guidelines were included in this analysis, in addition to any non-randomized studies and relevant publications identified during the search time frame. The search strategy is summarized in Appendix A. In January 2023, an updated search was conducted from September 22, 2020, to January 21, 2023, to identify any new articles.

All works published in the English language (either full-text articles or abstracts) were included in the analysis if they answered the research question defined according to the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) method: Patients undergoing external beam RT for cancer; any intervention; standard of care, placebo, any other intervention, or no intervention; and prevention or management of ARD and ARD-associated symptoms. The research question was kept broad to capture all existing literature that included a study population who received RT and were treated with a therapeutic intervention to either prevent or manage ARD. By definition, preventative modalities were considered those administered prior to the start of RT or the onset of any grade ARD and continued throughout the course.

### MASCC clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis: part 1) systematic review [^112xKUjd]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

- **Results**

Through the initial database searches, a total of 6,478 articles were identified (Fig. 1). After duplicates were removed, 5,173 articles remained. Following screening by abstracts/titles and full texts, a total of 235 articles were identified for inclusion in the analysis, with 149 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 87 non-randomized studies. The majority of studies evaluated an intervention for the prevention of ARD but had methodological challenges, resulting in a doubtful quality of evidence. Interventions were categorized according to the following treatment types: topical non-steroidal agents, topical corticosteroids, barrier films and dressings, laser therapy, natural and miscellaneous agents, growth factors and oral agents, and alternative and multi-component therapies. A summary of key findings according to the treatment category has been included in Tables 1 (for prevention modalities) and 2 (for management modalities). Individual characteristics and primary findings of all RCTs have been described in Appendix C (Tables 1–12).

- **ARD prevention methods**

- **Topical non-steroidal agents**: A total of 42 studies assessed topical non-steroidal agents for the prevention of ARD, including 12 non-randomized studies and 28 RCTs (Appendix C, Table 1). The majority of these studies were included in the analysis.

Please note: Figures, tables, and appendices referenced in the text above are not included here.

### Validation of the Skindex-16 questionnaire for assessing patient-reported outcomes in radiation dermatitis among breast cancer patients [^111KqL1U]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2025). High credibility.

Radiation dermatitis (RD) is often experienced by cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT) and can negatively impact the quality of life of patients. The Skindex-16 questionnaire is an instrument that measures the impact of skin conditions on patient quality of life. The Skindex-16 has been validated for use in assessing many benign conditions; however, it has not yet been validated for the assessment of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for patients experiencing RD.

- **Materials and methods**: A group of 42 breast cancer patients enrolled in a StrataXRT study for RD were analyzed. Increases in Skindex-16 scores indicate worsening symptoms. To validate the Skindex-16, scores were compared at baseline, 2 weeks, and 3 months post-RT. Skindex-16 scores were also compared to scores from the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) for RD and the Radiation-Induced Skin Reaction Assessment Scale (RISRAS) using various statistical analyses at baseline, 2 weeks, and 3 months post-RT.

- **Results**: Skindex-16 scores were found to be low at baseline and 3 months post-RT but peaked at 2 weeks post-RT. Significant worsening scores from baseline to 2 weeks post-RT were found in a longitudinal assessment of Skindex-16 items for several items on the patient portion of the RISRAS, but only two items on the healthcare professional RISRAS component. Skindex-16 scores showed no significant relationship to CTCAE scores.

- **Conclusion**: This validation of the Skindex-16 questionnaire indicates that it is reliable to be used for the assessment of PROs for cancer.

### Navigating trial design in radiation dermatitis research: Paths to improvement [^115A35SG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Low credibility.

The recently published Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) clinical practice guideline aimed to summarize the evidence regarding the prevention and management of acute radiation dermatitis (RD). Following a four-round Delphi consensus process among 42 international experts, based on a comprehensive and systematic review of all evidence in the existing medical literature until September 2020 (235 original publications, of which 149 were randomized trials), a recommendation — defined as at least 75% consensus — could only be reached for seven interventions: photobiomodulation therapy, Mepitel film, Hydrofilm, mometasone, betamethasone, olive oil, and Mepilex Lite (management only).

Despite the abundance of trials showing promising initial results, only a few RD interventions prove useful in adequately powered and well-designed trials. For the majority of tested interventions, evidence is either lacking, insufficient, or even conflicting, leading to a very limited number reaching a high level of evidence. Reasons for this discrepancy are manifold but mostly related to methodological limitations of the individual trials. Some ways to improve clinical trial design in radiation dermatitis research have been identified and are discussed below:

- **Aim for a homogeneous patient collective**: Consider patient characteristics such as treatment site and type of surgery, as well as treatment characteristics like prescribed dose, fractionation, and concomitant therapies, and report these data appropriately.
- **Consider established risk factors for RD development**: Stratify patients accordingly, based on factors such as skin type (e.g. Fitzpatrick scale).

### Concordance of patient- and clinician-reported outcomes of acute radiation dermatitis in breast cancer [^111c4Ew9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). High credibility.

The study evaluated the concordance between patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported outcomes (CRO) of acute radiation dermatitis (RD) symptoms following adjuvant radiotherapy for early-stage and locally advanced breast cancer.

- **Material and methods**: This is a secondary analysis of a multi-center randomized phase 3 trial (376 patients). Ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to compare the Skin Symptom Assessment (SSA) independently reported by both patients and clinicians. Concordance between patient- and clinician-reported SSAs for RD symptoms was measured by percent concordance, concordance index (C-statistic), and Cohen's Kappa. Analyses were performed across all patients in the original modified intention-to-treat analysis and those with only grade 2–3 (CTCAE) RD.

- **Results**: PROs were significantly more severe than CROs across all RD symptoms (Odds Ratio [OR] > 1; p < 0.0001). Pigmentation (OR 5.4), blistering/peeling (OR 4.0), and pain/soreness (OR 3.9) were the most differentially reported symptoms. Poor-to-low concordance was noted between patient- and clinician-reported SSAs for all RD symptoms for the entire cohort (percent concordance < 50%, C-statistic 0.52–0.63, Cohen's Kappa 13.9–23.4%) and those with grade 2–3 RD (percent concordance < 50%, C-statistic 0.56–0.66, Cohen's Kappa 2.0–24.5%). Similarly, poor-to-low concordance was noted in both Mepitel film and standard-of-care arms.

- **Conclusion**: PROs and CROs have poor concordance in breast RD, and patients report worse outcomes than clinicians, regardless of RD severity.
