## Question

What is the prognostic value of bnp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the prognostic value of BNP across clinical contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where BNP prognostication matters most. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence by study design and guideline endorsement. Next, I will quantify effect sizes and consider serial measurements. After that, I need to check confounders and special populations. Finally, I will integrate practical thresholds and synthesize a bottom-line clinical message with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where BNP prognostication is most impactful: heart failure (acute and chronic), acute coronary syndromes, pulmonary embolism, and non–heart failure cardiovascular populations. I should also consider sepsis and perioperative settings, but I need to be cautious about heterogeneity and confounding in those latter domains [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d] [^ab72421e] [^12f244d1] [^4bb40e11] [^1f13ee6a] [^1420972f].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy to avoid overinterpreting lower-quality data. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and contemporary guidelines carry the most weight, followed by large prospective cohorts and randomized trials, with case series and expert opinion as supportive but weaker evidence. I need to ensure I anchor conclusions to the highest-quality sources first [^0c255775] [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d].

> In heart failure, I will now examine the magnitude of prognostic association. A high-quality systematic review found that each 100 pg/mL increase in BNP was associated with a 35% higher relative risk of death, and BNP frequently carried independent prognostic value beyond other variables, including LVEF in some models. This aligns with guideline Class I recommendations to use BNP/NT-proBNP for risk stratification in chronic HF and for establishing prognosis in hospitalized HF, underscoring robust, reproducible prognostic utility [^0c255775] [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single static value. I should confirm whether serial measurements add prognostic value. Multiple studies and meta-analyses show that both absolute discharge or follow-up BNP/NT-proBNP and the magnitude of in-hospital reduction independently predict death and HF hospitalization; for example, percentage BNP reduction during hospitalization outperformed weight change for predicting 1-year mortality, and serial NT-proBNP in outpatients with HFrEF increased the hazard for events compared with a single baseline value. Guidelines also endorse predischarge natriuretic peptide measurement to inform post-discharge risk, which reinforces the value of trends over isolated values [^9f66871b] [^3b05784b] [^7340bbfb] [^6af6ae6a].

> I need to check whether BNP prognostication holds across HF phenotypes. In HFpEF, absolute BNP levels are lower than in HFrEF, but for a given BNP concentration, prognosis is comparably poor, indicating that risk interpretation should be phenotype-aware rather than assuming uniform thresholds. This is supported by both observational data and scientific statements emphasizing prognostic value irrespective of EF [^1eaaa5f3] [^4b9630be] [^362f6f2d].

> Let me consider acute coronary syndromes next. Elevated BNP or NT-proBNP at presentation and during follow-up independently predicts mortality and new heart failure after ACS, with serial measurements strengthening risk discrimination. A large prospective ACS cohort showed that BNP levels at discharge, 4 months, and 12 months tracked with death or new CHF, and meta-analytic data support incremental prognostic value beyond troponin and clinical factors, which is clinically actionable for longitudinal risk stratification [^fff8d60d] [^ab72421e].

> For pulmonary embolism, I should double-check whether BNP adds practical prognostic information. Meta-analyses indicate that elevated BNP or NT-proBNP identifies patients at higher short-term risk of death and adverse outcomes, with a high negative predictive value for a benign course when levels are normal, supporting its use for risk stratification alongside clinical scores and imaging, though positive predictive value is modest and should be interpreted in context [^12f244d1] [^17db7156].

> Now, in patients without diagnosed heart failure, I need to verify whether BNP still predicts outcomes. Large cohorts and meta-analyses show that higher BNP associates with increased all-cause mortality even in non-HF cardiovascular populations, and sex-specific thresholds around the 29th percentile (for example, BNP approximately 10–30 pg/mL depending on sex) identify a roughly 2.5-fold higher mortality risk. This supports BNP as a risk enhancer in secondary prevention settings, though general-population screening remains investigational [^4bb40e11] [^2c355eb3] [^72d7cd63].

> But wait, what if confounders obscure interpretation? I should review key modifiers. Renal dysfunction, obesity, age, and atrial fibrillation can elevate or suppress natriuretic peptide levels, so I need to interpret values in clinical context; importantly, despite these modifiers, the prognostic association generally persists, and in obesity, lower diagnostic thresholds are often used while prognostic value remains intact, which I should keep in mind when counseling patients [^4edf2eb6] [^08489dd6] [^362f6f2d].

> Next, I should review special populations and edge cases. In sepsis, elevated BNP/NT-proBNP correlates with mortality and may reflect myocardial strain, but heterogeneity and lack of standardized cutoffs limit routine use. In perioperative care, elevated preoperative BNP predicts postoperative cardiac events and is incorporated into some guidelines for risk stratification. In congenital heart disease, baseline NT-proBNP independently predicts adverse outcomes, extending the applicability of natriuretic peptides beyond acquired HF [^1f13ee6a] [^1420972f] [^acff773e].

> I will now examine practical thresholds and how to apply them. While hard targets are not universally established, guideline-framed ranges are useful: in chronic HF, NT-proBNP less than about 1,000 pg/mL is associated with better outcomes, and in acute HF, achieving substantial BNP reduction (for example, greater than 25–46%) plus a discharge BNP less than about 300 pg/mL portends lower event risk. In non-HF cohorts, sex-specific BNP thresholds around 10–30 pg/mL flag higher mortality, though these should be validated locally and interpreted with comorbidity context [^c4f455e0] [^ab574760] [^2c355eb3].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of biomarker-guided therapy itself, because prognostic value does not automatically translate into improved outcomes when used to titrate therapy. Randomized trials and meta-analyses show mixed results for NP-guided therapy reducing mortality, with more consistent signals for reducing HF hospitalizations in some analyses, and contemporary guidance issues cautious recommendations pending stronger trial data. Thus, I should frame serial NP use as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, careful clinical assessment and guideline-directed medical therapy [^da133555] [^b4e5bdbe] [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. BNP and NT-proBNP are consistently strong, independent predictors of death, HF hospitalization, and major adverse cardiovascular events across HF, ACS, PE, and many non-HF cardiovascular populations, with the most robust evidence in HF and ACS. Serial measurements outperform single values for risk stratification, and while absolute thresholds vary by context and phenotype, higher levels signal worse prognosis and should prompt closer follow-up, optimization of GDMT, and consideration of disease-specific interventions, always interpreted alongside renal function, BMI, age, and rhythm status [^0c255775] [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d] [^fff8d60d] [^12f244d1] [^4bb40e11].

---

BNP is a **strong, independent predictor of mortality and heart failure hospitalization** across acute and chronic heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, and pulmonary embolism, with risk rising continuously as BNP increases [^0c255775] [^ab72421e] [^12f244d1]. In heart failure, each 100 pg/mL rise in BNP is associated with a **35% higher risk of death**, and serial BNP measurements improve prognostic accuracy over single values [^0c255775] [^3b05784b]. BNP also predicts outcomes in patients without heart failure, including those with coronary artery disease and the general population, though levels are lower and thresholds differ [^3d18cba9] [^696ed309]. BNP is recommended for risk stratification in heart failure and acute coronary syndromes, and serial monitoring can guide therapy and detect deterioration early [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d].

## Prognostic value in heart failure

### Acute heart failure (AHF)

- **Mortality prediction**: Elevated BNP at admission independently predicts in-hospital and long-term mortality in AHF, with risk increasing continuously across the BNP spectrum [^0c255775] [^3548ace5].
- **Readmission risk**: Higher discharge BNP predicts early readmission and poor outcomes, and a BNP reduction < 30% during hospitalization signals higher risk [^518fc231] [^9f66871b].
- **Serial measurements**: Serial BNP tracking during hospitalization improves prognostic accuracy and can guide discharge decisions and follow-up intensity [^518fc231] [^ab574760].

---

### Chronic heart failure (CHF)

- **Mortality and hospitalization**: Baseline BNP strongly predicts death, HF hospitalization, and cardiovascular events in CHF, independent of traditional risk factors [^0c255775] [^08489dd6].
- **Serial monitoring**: Repeated BNP measurements add prognostic value beyond a single value, helping detect clinical deterioration and guide therapy intensification [^082c98392] [^3b05784b].
- **Therapy guidance**: BNP-guided therapy reduces HF hospitalizations and may improve outcomes, though mortality benefits are less consistent [^da133555] [^b4e5bdbe].

---

## Prognostic value in acute coronary syndromes (ACS)

In ACS, **elevated BNP at presentation independently predicts mortality, heart failure, and stroke**, and provides incremental prognostic value beyond troponin and clinical factors [^ab72421e] [^3d18cba9]. Serial BNP measurements during follow-up further refine risk stratification and identify patients at highest risk of adverse outcomes [^fff8d60d].

---

## Prognostic value in pulmonary embolism (PE)

In pulmonary embolism, **elevated BNP correlates with right ventricular strain** and predicts short-term mortality and adverse outcomes, with a high negative predictive value when BNP is normal [^12f244d1] [^17db7156]. BNP is particularly useful for identifying low-risk patients suitable for outpatient management [^12f244d1].

---

## Prognostic value in patients without heart failure

In coronary artery disease, **BNP predicts cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, and stroke** even in patients with preserved LV function, adding incremental value to traditional risk factors [^3d18cba9]. In the general population, higher BNP associates with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, supporting its role as a risk enhancer [^696ed309] [^4bb40e11].

---

## Factors influencing prognostic interpretation

Several factors **modulate BNP levels and must be considered** when interpreting prognostic data:

| **Factor** | **Effect on bnp levels** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Age | Increases with age | Adjust interpretation in elderly patients [^6ea56998] |
| Renal function | Elevated in CKD | Use caution; consider NT-proBNP or adjust thresholds [^08489dd6] |
| Obesity | Lower levels | May mask elevation; interpret cautiously [^4edf2eb6] |
| Atrial fibrillation | Elevated | Consider rhythm context in interpretation [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines endorse BNP for **risk stratification in HF and ACS** and recommend serial measurements to inform prognosis and guide therapy [^7340bbfb] [^362f6f2d]. In HF, BNP is recommended at admission, discharge, and during follow-up to assess disease severity and trajectory [^7340bbfb] [^6af6ae6a].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Variability**: Biological and analytical variability can affect BNP levels; serial measurements and clinical context improve interpretation [^1002fbde].
- **Non-specificity**: BNP can be elevated in non-HF conditions (e.g. sepsis, pulmonary hypertension), so results must be interpreted in the clinical context [^923e13df].
- **Thresholds**: Absolute BNP thresholds vary by population and assay; trend analysis is often more informative than single values [^c4f455e0].

---

BNP is a **robust, independent prognostic biomarker** across cardiovascular conditions, with the strongest evidence in heart failure and acute coronary syndromes. Serial BNP measurements improve risk stratification and can guide therapy, but results must be interpreted in clinical context and with awareness of confounders.

### How well does B-type natriuretic peptide predict death and cardiac events in patients with heart failure: systematic review [^0c255775]. BMJ (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To assess how well B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) predicts prognosis in patients with heart failure.

Design

Systematic review of studies assessing BNP for prognosis in patients with heart failure or asymptomatic patients.

Data Sources

Electronic searches of Medline and Embase from January 1994 to March 2004 and reference lists of included studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

We included all studies that estimated the relation between BNP measurement and the risk of death, cardiac death, sudden death, or cardiovascular event in patients with heart failure or asymptomatic patients, including initial values and changes in values in response to treatment. Multivariable models that included both BNP and left ventricular ejection fraction as predictors were used to compare the prognostic value of each variable. Two reviewers independently selected studies and extracted data.

Data Synthesis

19 studies used BNP to estimate the relative risk of death or cardiovascular events in heart failure patients and five studies in asymptomatic patients. In heart failure patients, each 100 pg/ml increase was associated with a 35% increase in the relative risk of death. BNP was used in 35 multivariable models of prognosis. In nine of the models, it was the only variable to reach significance-that is, other variables contained no prognostic information beyond that of BNP. Even allowing for the scale of the variables, it seems to be a strong indicator of risk.

Conclusion

Although systematic reviews of prognostic studies have inherent difficulties, including the possibility of publication bias, the results of the studies in this review show that BNP is a strong prognostic indicator for both asymptomatic patients and for patients with heart failure at all stages of disease.

### Natriuretic peptides in heart failure: should therapy be guided by BNP levels? [^3fca4ed9]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2010). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Testing for natriuretic peptide markers, such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP), has emerged as an important tool for the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with HF. However, questions remain regarding the potential role for natriuretic peptides to guide therapy in patients with HF. In this Review, we address the underlying assumptions and the existing evidence supporting a natriuretic-peptide-guided approach to the outpatient management of HF.

### Predicting stroke mortality: BNP could it be? [^648fe1cc]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Physicians, patients, and families rely on clinical factors associated with stroke mortality to guide decisions of care and set goals of medical therapy. However, these factors, including age and baseline neurologic impairment, are at best imperfect predictors and additional prognostic tools are needed. Biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) have potential. However, for a biomarker to be of clinical utility, it needs to add information beyond what clinical predictors can provide. BNP is produced by myocardial tissue in response to strain and acts to reduce systolic blood pressure through vasodilation and natriuresis. In stroke, BNP has been associated with increased mortality.

### Natriuretic peptides for risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndromes [^ab72421e]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Natriuretic peptides (BNP and NT-proBNP) have been shown to be useful tools for risk stratification of patients with acute myocardial ischemia encompassing the whole spectrum of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), particularly for prediction of mortality. Both BNP and NT-proBNP possess several characteristics of the ideal biomarker, showing independent and incremental prognostic value above traditional clinical, electrocardiographic, and biochemical (particularly troponin) risk indicators. Specifically, in ACS patients, BNP and NT-proBNP have powerful prognostic value both in patients without a history of previous heart failure or without clinical or instrumental signs of left ventricular dysfunction on admission or during hospital stay. They can also be easily and rapidly measured in an emergency context. We have performed a meta-analysis of available studies concerning the prognostic value of natriuretic peptides. Our results show that the prognostic value of natriuretic peptides is similar: (1) both at short- and long-term; (2) when natriuretic peptides are measured at first patient contact or during hospital stay; (3) for BNP or NT-proBNP; and (4) in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction or no ST elevation ACS. These data suggest that natriuretic peptide measurement should be integrated into routine evaluation of patients with an ACS.

### Prognostic value of brain natriuretic peptide in acute pulmonary embolism [^12f244d1]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis indicates that elevated BNP levels can identify patients with acute PE at high risk of short-term death and adverse outcome events. However, while BNP measurements might become part of the risk stratification in PE, its positive predictive value alone remains low and its high negative predictive value is certainly more useful to identify patients with a likely favorable outcome. Whether serial BNP level assessment within the first 24 hours will facilitate risk stratification of patients with PE and subsequently patient management through less aggressive treatment of those with normal BNP levels would need to be tested in future studies.

### B-type natriuretic peptide and prognosis in heart failure patients with preserved and reduced ejection fraction [^1eaaa5f3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the prognostic value of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF), in comparison to data in HF patients with reduced left ventricular (LV) EF (≤ 40%).

Background

Management of patients with HFPEF is difficult. BNP is a useful biomarker in patients with reduced LVEF, but data in HFPEF are scarce.

Methods

In this study, 615 patients with mild to moderate HF (mean age 70 years, LVEF 33%) were followed for 18 months. BNP concentrations were measured at baseline and were related to the primary outcome, that is, a composite of all-cause mortality and HF hospitalization, and to mortality alone. The population was divided in quintiles, according to LVEF, and patients with reduced LVEF were compared with those with HFPEF.

Results

There were 257 patients (42%) who had a primary endpoint and 171 (28%) who died. BNP levels were significantly higher in patients with reduced LVEF than in those with HFPEF (p < 0.001). BNP was a strong predictor of outcome, but LVEF was not. Importantly, if similar levels of BNP were compared across the whole spectrum of LVEF, and for different cutoff levels of LVEF, the associated risk of adverse outcome was similar in HFPEF patients as in those with reduced LVEF.

Conclusions

BNP levels are lower in patients with HFPEF than in patients with HF with reduced LVEF, but for a given BNP level, the prognosis in patients with HFPEF is as poor as in those with reduced LVEF.

### Prognostic value of brain natriuretic peptide vs history of heart failure hospitalization in a large real-world population [^db4e4340]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In heart failure patients, both brain natriuretic peptide and previous HF hospitalization predict prognosis. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 However, this association has not been reported over a wide range of BNP levels and analyzed in patients with and without prior HFH for both HFH and all‐cause mortality in a large, real‐world population. Data from the current study support several clinically relevant findings. Over a very wide range of BNP, subdivided into seven ranges, the risk of HFH increased nearly 26% for every doubling of the BNP value. These differences persisted over time, with risk in 6 to 12 months 20% higher. The same findings were true for all‐cause mortality. The risk of all‐cause mortality increased nearly 31% for every doubling of the BNP value. When a history of a previous HF hospitalization was added to the risk model, there was an important added value in predicting future HFH, but less added value in predicting all‐cause mortality. These finding were consistent across HF phenotypes defined by EF and age. The risk of HFH and the risk of all‐cause mortality increased in both HFrEF and HFpEF patients and at every age bracket as a function of increasing BNP. It is important to note that, these findings were obtained in a large, completely "unselected" (real‐world) population with no exclusions for co‐morbidities or any other factors that would routinely be done in RCTs.

This study represents the largest cohort report showing the association of natriuretic peptides (NP) and heart failure hospitalizations (HFH) as predictors of outcomes in HF patients. Very specifically, this study showed that higher BNP levels were associated with increased risk for both HFH and mortality. The unique observation from this study is at any given level of BNP, previous HF hospitalization added greater prognostic value for prediction of future HFH than for mortality. Similarly, regardless of whether the patient had HFH in previous year, the knowledge of BNP added greater prognostic value about future HF hospitalization and, most importantly, about mortality.

### Are serial BNP measurements useful in heart failure management? Serial natriuretic peptide measurements are useful in heart failure management [^e6dc4217]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

To deny the fact that standard HF care has substantial opportunity for improvement is at the peril of even worse outcomes in our patients affected by the disorder. We have presented a strong rationale for the value of BNP- and NTproBNP–guided HF management. Experience gained in biomarker-guided HF trials suggests that the approach results in improvement in the quality of care without an excess of adverse events related to more aggressive management. This alone is difficult to ignore given the gaps in care that exist between RCTs and real-world practice. Beyond this fact, studies examining the strategy of biomarker-guided HF care have shown substantial improvement in outcome compared with well-managed control arms, benefits that are confirmed in meta-analysis and pooled data analyses, and justifies the imminent launch of the pivotal RCT that will lead to more widespread adoption of the approach. Compared with standard management, biomarker-guided care appears cost effective, may improve patient quality of life, and may promote reverse ventricular remodeling. Although certain subgroups such as the elderly may respond in a less vigorous manner to the approach, this may reflect the effects of age on HF therapy and how the strategy is deployed in elders rather than a weakness of the approach in older patients. A fair-minded assessment of the available data suggests that care supported by BNP/NT-proBNP–guided HF treatment — as an adjunct to standard clinical acumen — is superior to standard care. The limitation of standard care strategies is evident from the suboptimal uptake and application of proven therapies documented in HF registries. Far from being a crutch to support what we should already be doing (namely, optimally evaluating and managing our patients solely with clinical means), the inclusion of NP measurement within the HF management strategy augments the quality of monitoring and treatment. Denial of the benefits of NP monitoring potentially retards advances in the care of a high-risk population of patients that continues to grow in size and importance every day.

### Measuring plasma B-type natriuretic peptide in heart failure: good to go in 2004? [^f96f4f91]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Elevated plasma brain natriuretic (BNP) concentrations correlate with increased cardiac filling pressures. Therefore, increased BNP has been proposed as a marker for asymptomatic ventricular dysfunction, as an aid in the diagnosis of cardiac dyspnea, as an end point to assess the efficacy of heart failure therapy, and as a prognostic marker in heart failure. An understanding of the utility of BNP requires an appreciation of the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of BNP in each of these clinical situations. At this time, there is strong evidence for the value of BNP in the evaluation of dyspnea of uncertain cause. Further population studies will need to be performed to refine the application of BNP to community cohorts and to determine its clinical value and cost-effectiveness as a screening tool in the early diagnosis of ventricular dysfunction. To make optimal use of BNP for the assessment of heart failure therapy and prognosis in individual patients, physicians will require additional information on the biological variability of BNP. Studies comparing the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of the available BNP and N-terminal pro-BNP assays need to be conducted in each of these clinical settings.

### NT-proBNP and BNP: biomarkers for heart failure management [^df437df3]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of heart failure (HF) are based on results from large clinical trials demonstrating benefit. State of the art pharmacological management of HF assumes that target doses should be the same as those used in trials. Thus equal doses are recommended for all in practical guidelines, but this strategy might not fit individual needs. NT-proBNP and BNP emerged as potential biomarkers of clinical interest in HF management. NT-proBNP and BNP are related to HF severity and to clinical status. NT-proBNP and BNP are strongly associated with prognosis across the whole spectrum of HF patients. A pilot study has shown that NT-proBNP-guided therapy is associated with improved outcome in HF. Although at present there are still few data to make firm recommendations on the use of NT-proBNP or BNP levels as biomarkers for HF management, future studies will provide further insight on this issue.

### BNP and NT-proBNP thresholds for the assessment of prognosis in patients without heart Failure [^4bb40e11]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In a large cohort of patients with cardiovascular diseases but without heart failure, elevated natriuretic peptides levels were associated with increased long-term all-cause mortality. The majority of included patients had diagnosed coronary artery disease or other cardiac conditions. These data suggest the utilization of novel sex-specific BNP/NT-proBNP thresholds, which may qualify for the detection of patients with impaired long-term prognosis.

PERSPECTIVES

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Natriuretic peptides may qualify for the detection of patients with impaired long-term prognosis also in patient cohorts without heart failure.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: General population cohorts are needed to confirm, whether the here described thresholds also apply for asymptomatic and primary prevention cohorts.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^c80a0445]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Heart failure diagnostics and prognosis — natriuretic peptides: Natriuretic peptides play a central role in both the diagnosis of heart failure (HF) and the assessment of short- and long-term prognosis, and their plasma measurement (BNP and NT-proBNP) constitutes a marker of disease severity and a predictor of prognosis. Given HF is a clinical syndrome with recognizable signs and symptoms where additional diagnostics are valuable, abundant data support natriuretic peptides for establishing the diagnosis of HF in many clinical settings, including initial diagnosis in ambulatory patients with undifferentiated symptoms such as fatigue or dyspnea on exertion.

### Heart failure (HF) guideline (2017) [^e95be59c]. AND (2017). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers — hospitalized/acute, Class I: Measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP is useful to support clinical judgment for the diagnosis of acutely decompensated HF, especially in the setting of uncertainty for the diagnosis (Level of Evidence: A), and measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP or cardiac troponin is useful for establishing prognosis or disease severity in acutely decompensated HF (Level of Evidence: A).

### The prognostic value of N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide [^b3861fc2]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

The heart is not only a pump, but also it is an endocrine organ. Cardiac stretch and overload stimulate the secretion of natriuretic peptides, which have a variety of beneficial actions, such as vasodilation and natriuresis. Cardiac-derived natriuretic peptides, especially B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), have emerged as useful biomarkers for the diagnosis, and potentially the treatment, of heart failure patients. The inactive amino-terminal fragment of the BNP prohormone (NT-proBNP), which is more stable than mature BNP, has also been recognized as an aid in the diagnosis of left-ventricular systolic dysfunction. Furthermore, elevated NT-proBNP concentrations have been shown to be predictive of poor prognosis in a variety of cardiovascular diseases, suggesting that it could be useful for risk stratification of patients. This review summarizes current literature that has addressed the issue of NT-proBNP as a prognostic tool in heart failure, acute coronary syndromes and other conditions.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided heart failure management [^b4cca195]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

The natriuretic peptides are important tools to establish diagnosis and prognosis in heart failure (HF). With application of therapies for HF, changes in both B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its amino terminal cleavage fragment (NT-proBNP) parallel the benefits of the HF therapy applied. This dynamic nature of BNP and NT-proBNP relative to therapeutic intervention in HF has led to the concept of using the biomarkers as a 'guide' for intensification of HF care with a goal of not only achieving guideline-directed medical therapy goals accompanied by targeted natriuretic peptide suppression below prognostic thresholds. In studies achieving this combination of therapy optimization and BNP/NT-proBNP suppression, superior outcomes have been observed, and the approach was well tolerated. Natriuretic peptide-guided HF therapy has recently been given a recommendation in US HF guidelines to achieve guideline-directed medical therapy (Class IIa) and possibly improve outcome (Class IIb), while other clinical practice guidelines (including those from the European Society of Cardiology) await results from emerging clinical trial data. We will review lessons learned in the past regarding this novel concept of biomarker guided HF care, and discuss future directions for the approach.

### Prognosis and NT-proBNP in heart failure patients with preserved versus reduced ejection fraction [^4b9630be]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

The suggestion that a single baseline or discharge measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP may be equally useful in risk-stratifying patients with ADHF irrespective of the type of heart failure confronts us with the difficulty of explaining why prognosis is similar between the two groups, first of all because natriuretic peptide plasma levels are almost half in HFpEF compared with HFrEF. Second, absolute levels of NT-proBNP at admission or at discharge are interpreted as single values, but the assumption may then be that the reduction in NT-proBNP during hospitalisation would be equal in both types of heart failure. A third issue is that the risk assessment of hospitalised heart failure patients with the use of natriuretic peptides is done with relative risks, leaving unexplained that lower discharge natriuretic peptides in patients with HFpEF are associated with similar outcomes as in patients with HFrEF who have higher discharge levels. Finally, even if it can be shown that single values of NT-proBNP are predictive of outcome without distinction between HFpEF and HFrEF, the attainability of these levels may become the factor that determines whether HFpEF or HFrEF have a similar prognosis on a population level.

Therefore, we assessed the prognostic contribution of absolute levels of NT-proBNP and percentage change in NT-proBNP levels in patients with HFpEF and HFrEF hospitalised for ADHF. In addition, we assessed the attainability of several (absolute and relative) discharge NT-proBNP targets in patients with HFpEF and HFrEF. Finally, we assessed the frequencies of prognostically relevant comorbidities in patients with HFpEF and HFrEF for low and high discharge NT-proBNP categories.

### BNP and NT-proBNP thresholds for the assessment of prognosis in patients without heart Failure [^3615e973]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Natriuretic peptides are secreted in the atrium and ventricle due to mechanic wall stress and neurohormonal stimulation. They play an important role in electrolyte and water homeostasis as well as lipolysis and blood pressure. Concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are predominantly measured in patients with acute and chronic heart failure and predetermined cut-off values are specified in current heart failure guidelines for diagnosing, risk stratification, and therapy monitoring in heart failure cohorts. Diverse data document a potential value of BNP/NT-proBNP serum levels also in the general population and nonheart failure patient cohorts as a predictor of cardiovascular disease manifestation and long-term prognosis in the absence of heart failure. In a large meta-analysis of 66 prospective studies including over 89,000 patients, we demonstrate a similar association of BNP/NT-proBNP levels and incident cardiovascular events in patients with and without heart failure. In this meta-analysis the predictive value of BNP/NT-proBNP was found to be independent of the cut-off level used in the included studies. For patients without heart failure, no thresholds are established for BNP/NT-proBNP in clinical routine to assess the patient's individual risk. Therefore, in the present large database of consecutive patients without heart failure, we aimed to determine the association of BNP/NT-proBNP with incident mortality an establish cut-off levels, applicable for routine risk stratification.

### BNP and congestive heart failure [^0b45d233]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a peptide hormone secreted chiefly by ventricular myocytes, plays a key role in volume homeostasis. The plasma concentration of BNP is raised in various pathological states, especially heart failure. Many studies suggest that measurement of plasma BNP has clinical utility for excluding a diagnosis of heart failure in patients with dyspnea or fluid retention and for providing prognostic information in those with heart failure or other cardiac disease. It may also be of value in identifying patients after myocardial infarction in whom further assessment of cardiac function is likely to be worthwhile. Preliminary evidence suggests that measuring the plasma concentration of BNP may be useful in fine tuning therapy for heart failure. Artificially raising the circulating levels of BNP shows considerable promise as a treatment for heart failure. With simpler assay methods now available, it is likely that many physicians will measure plasma BNP to aid them in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring of their patients with heart failure or other cardiac dysfunction.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic approach using natriuretic peptides in heart failure — It is easy to understand the logic for measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP as a support of clinical judgement, and both are unmistakably prognostic in acute and chronic heart failure; however, ambiguity and ambivalence remain regarding how to alter treatment based on abnormal concentrations. In acute heart failure, post-treatment natriuretic peptide values may inform alternative treatment strategies, but such strategies have not been validated. In chronic heart failure, lower NT-proBNP concentrations are linked to superior outcomes and reversal of cardiac remodeling, yet an algorithmic biomarker-based outpatient treatment approach remains elusive. Addition of other biomarkers such as ANP, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, or soluble ST2 to NT-proBNP or BNP may help to better understand underlying pathophysiology and risk in chronic heart failure.

Natriuretic peptides in HFrEF — BNP and NT-proBNP are the most studied biomarkers in heart failure and inform diagnosis and prognostication, with higher concentrations in ambulatory HFrEF indicating high risk, particularly when rising. Current clinical practice guidelines give a Class 1 recommendation to measure BNP or NT-proBNP to support diagnosis, assess disease severity, or establish prognosis. Trends in concentrations inform prognosis, congestion severity, and the trajectory of left ventricular remodeling and track with health status; thus, measuring BNP or NT-proBNP at each clinical evaluation may inform clinical decisions, with more frequent measurement appropriate during rapid medication titration or when symptoms are unstable.

2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline — use of biomarkers for prevention, initial diagnosis, and risk stratification states the following recommendations: In patients presenting with dyspnea, measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is useful to support a diagnosis or exclusion of heart failure (HF) (1 A). In patients with chronic HF, measurements of BNP or NT-proBNP levels are recommended for risk stratification (1 A). In patients hospitalized for HF, measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP levels at admission is recommended to establish prognosis (1 A). In patients at risk of developing HF, BNP or NT-proBNP–based screening followed by team-based care, including a cardiovascular specialist, can be useful to prevent the development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or new-onset HF (2a B-R). In patients hospitalized for HF, a predischarge BNP or NT-proBNP level can be useful to inform the trajectory of the patient and establish a postdischarge prognosis (2a B-NR).

### Clinical adoption of prognostic biomarkers: the case for heart failure [^72b59ee8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The recent explosion of scientific knowledge and technological progress has led to the discovery of a large array of circulating molecules commonly referred to as biomarkers. Biomarkers in heart failure (HF) research have been used to provide pathophysiologic insights, aid in establishing the diagnosis, refine prognosis, guide management, and target treatment. However, beyond diagnostic applications of natriuretic peptides, there are currently few widely recognized applications for biomarkers in HF. This represents a remarkable discordance considering the number of molecules that have been shown to correlate with outcomes, refine risk prediction, or track disease severity in HF in the past decade. In this article, we use a broad framework proposed for cardiovascular risk markers to summarize the current state of biomarker development for patients with HF. We use this framework to identify the challenges of biomarker adoption for risk prediction, disease management, and treatment selection for HF and suggest considerations for future research.

### BNP and NT-proBNP thresholds for the assessment of prognosis in patients without heart Failure [^b17fb019]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Natriuretic peptides are well established in clinical routine for diagnosis and prognosis estimation as well as guiding therapy in heart failure. It has been described that hypertensive patients have higher natriuretic peptides. To evaluate, whether the presence of hypertension may have impacted our results, we performed a sensitivity analysis in patients with vs without elevated systolic blood pressure as well as with vs without hypertension, demonstrating that the association of elevated natriuretic peptides with impaired prognosis is independent of the presence of hypertension. In addition, previous data suggest that BNP/NT-proBNP may also be associated with increased cardiovascular risk and all-cause mortality in patients with coronary artery disease, being in particular predictive of cardiac events in symptomatic patientsas well as in general population cohorts and nonheart failure patients. In a healthy reference sample of a large European population-based study, the 90th percentile was described as a threshold, stratifying patients with and without future cardiovascular events. While effect sizes using this approach were comparable to our findings, it led to slightly higher cut-off values for both BNP and NT-proBNP as compared to the present analysis. However, a validation of these thresholds has not been performed so far. In contrast, we stratified our cohort into a derivation and validation group, establishing the thresholds based on actual event rate in the derivation cohort. Subsequently we validated the thresholds in the validation cohort, observing similar predictive ability. In a recently performed meta-analysis on 66 studies with over 89,000 patients, we demonstrated that BNP/NT-proBNP levels are of prognostic value in patients with and without known heart failure as well as in the general population. We found that the effect sizes for the association of natriuretic peptides with MACE were independent of the predetermined cut-off values. This meta-analysis underlined the need for validated cut-off values in nonheart failure patient cohorts that qualify for risk stratification. The present analysis provides such sex-specific thresholds that are associated with an increase in all-cause mortality and may qualify for the improving the risk assessment in clinical routine.

### BNP and NT-proBNP thresholds for the assessment of prognosis in patients without heart Failure [^2c355eb3]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP) enable risk stratification, diagnosing, and monitoring of heart failure patients. An additional prognostic value for BNP/NT-proBNP in nonheart failure patients and general population cohorts is described in the literature, but specific cut-off levels are only described for heart failure patients.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine thresholds for risk stratification in nonheart failure patients.

Methods

Based on the Essen Coronary Artery Disease registry we excluded patients with known heart failure or elevated BNP/NT-pro BNP levels. The resulting cohort was divided into a derivation and validation cohort using random sampling. The prognostic value of BNP/NT-proBNP of incident mortality was evaluated in the derivation cohort using univariate and multivariable cox regression analysis. In receiver operating characteristic analysis and corresponding area under the curve the optimal threshold was determined using Youdens J index. The findings were verified in the validation cohort.

Results

A total of 3,690 patients (age 62.9 ± 12.5 years, 71% male, 68% patients with coronary artery disease) were included. During a mean follow-up of 2.6 ± 3.4 years (median 1.2 [IQR: 0.4–2.88]), 169 deaths of any cause occurred. Based on Youden's J index, BNP-thresholds of 9.6 and 29pg/ml and NT-proBNP thresholds of 65 and 77pg/ml for men and women, respectively, were determined. BNP/NT-proBNP levels above these thresholds were associated with increased mortality in the derivation cohort (HR: 2.44 [95% CI: 1.32–4.53], P = 0.005). The predictive value was confirmed in the validation cohort (HR: 2.78 [95% CI: 1.26–6.14], P = 0.01).

Conclusions

We here describe sex-specific BNP/NT-proBNP thresholds that allow prediction of impaired survival in patients without heart failure, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^c4f455e0]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Mechanistic and prognostic insights across heart failure stages — determinants of natriuretic peptide release and outcome thresholds. A common misconception is that concentrations of BNP or NT-proBNP mainly reflect congestion in all domains; during stabilized disease, the main determinant of BNP or NT-proBNP concentrations is transmural wall stress, helping explain prognostication in stage A or B HF and strong associations with cardiac remodeling in stage C HF. Among acute HF presentations, following diuretic therapy, robust NT-proBNP reduction is strongly linked to subsequent favorable courses, whereas in stage C HFrEF without exaggerated congestion, early decrease in NT-proBNP to < 1000 pg/mL following adjustment by guideline-directed medical therapy was linked to a 74% reduction in subsequent cardiovascular death/HF hospitalization and greater improvement in LVEF by 1 year with larger NT-proBNP reductions.

Chronic heart failure — prognostic use and diagnostic rule-out cutoffs indicate that natriuretic peptides are recommended for use in establishing prognosis in chronic HF by major society guidelines with the highest level of evidence, and 2021 ESC Guidelines proposed that BNP < 35 pg/mL, NT-proBNP < 125 pg/mL, or MR-proANP < 40 pmol/L make a diagnosis of HF unlikely; BNP and NT-proBNP generally provide similar information but may diverge after initiating sacubitril/valsartan while both provide prognostic value during longitudinal treatment.

### Prognosis of stage A or B heart failure patients with elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels [^5c885f5c]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) patients have a poor prognosis, yet outcomes might be improved by early identification of risk. We investigated the prognostic value of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in patients at risk for HF (American College of Cardiology [ACC]/American Heart Association [AHA] HF Stages A and B), and compared prognosis with Stage C/D patients.

Methods and Results

Outpatients referred for echocardiogram (n = 829) were stratified by ACC/AHA HF stage and BNP levels (cutpoint of 100pg/mL). Primary outcome was death or cardiac hospitalization at 1 year. BNP levels increased with increasing numbers of cardiovascular risk factors and with HF stage. Stage A/B patients with high BNP had a similar or worse prognosis than Stage C/D patients with low BNP. In fact, the prognosis of Stage C/D patients with low BNP did not significantly differ from the prognosis of Stage A/B patients with low BNP (adjusted HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.62–2.37), whereas Stage A/B patients with high BNP did have a significantly worse prognosis (adjusted HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.11–3.28).

Conclusions

Individuals without any history of HF but with BNP ≥ 100pg/mL are at equal or higher risk than those with a HF history whose BNP is < 100pg/mL. BNP may be useful to identify asymptomatic individuals at high risk for future cardiovascular events.

### BNP and NT-proBNP thresholds for the assessment of prognosis in patients without heart Failure [^8931435e]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Association of BNP/NT-proBNP levels and all-cause mortality

During a mean follow-up of 2.6 ± 3.4 years (median 1.2 [IQR: 0.4–2.88]), 169 deaths of any cause occurred. Patients without fatal events had lower BNP/NT-proBNP rank compared to patients who died (48.4 ± 28.8 vs 58.4 ± 27.5, P < 0.0001). Table 2 shows univariate and multivariate analyses of all-cause mortality based on the BNP/NT-proBNP rank in the derivation cohort. In fully adjusted multivariable analyses, 1 SD increase in BNP/NT-proBNP was associated with 37% increased risk of mortality (Table 2).

Table 2
Cox-regression Analysis for the Association of BNP/NT-proBNP With Incident All-cause Mortality in the Derivation Cohort

Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine if similar associations were evident in several groups of interest. When excluding patients with impaired renal function, the prognostic value of natriuretic peptides was altered (HR: 1.6 [95% CI: 1.34–1.92], P < 0.0001). Likewise, effect size for the association of elevated natriuretic peptides with all-cause mortality was similar in patients without diuretic medication at baseline (HR: 1.39 [95% CI: 1.18–1.66], P = 0.0001). Testing the robustness of the association of BNP/NT-proBNP with incident mortality, we further used different BNP/NT-proBNP thresholds, confirming the association of higher natriuretic peptides with increased mortality risk in nonheart failure cohorts (Supplemental Table 1). Effect sizes decreased with higher BNP/NT-proBNP thresholds.

### Prognostic value of BNP reduction during hospitalization in patients with acute heart failure [^9f66871b]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Prognostication of patients discharged after acute heart failure (AHF) hospitalization remains challenging. Body weight (BW) reduction is often used as a surrogate marker of decongestion despite the paucity of evidence. We thought to test the hypothesis that B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) reduction during hospitalization has independent prognostic value in AHF.

Methods and Results

We studied the prognostic predictability of percentage BNP reduction achieved during hospitalization in patients from the REALITY-AHF study. Percentage BNP reduction was defined as (BNP on admission - BNP at discharge) / BNP on admission × 100. The primary endpoint was 1-year all-cause death. In 1028 patients (age, 77 ± 13 years; 57% male; left ventricular ejection fraction, 47 ± 16%) with AHF, median BNP level at admission was 747 ng/L (interquartile range, 439–1367 ng/L) and median percentage BNP reduction was 62.5% (interquartile range, 36.5–78.5%). The smallest percentage BNP reduction quartile had more than 2-fold higher risk of all-cause death than the greatest quartile (23.0% vs 9.7%, P < .001). After adjusting for covariates including BNP at discharge, the percentage BNP reduction was significantly associated with all-cause death (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.93–0.99, P = 0.032), whereas percentage BW reduction was not. Percentage BNP reduction was more predictive in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction than in those with preserved ejection fraction.

Conclusions

The prognostic value of percentage BNP reduction during hospitalization was superior to that of percentage BW reduction and was independent of other risk markers, including BNP at discharge.

### BNP as discharge criteria for heart failure [^5b26d997]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is a significant clinical and economic burden in the industrialized world. Advances in pharmaceutical compounds and various medical device technologies along with the use of sophisticated HF clinics have enhanced HF treatment and improved morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. However, hospital readmission rates remain stubbornly high. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels provide valuable information about a patient's chance of readmission within 30 days of discharge, making BNP a potentially useful tool for making discharge decisions and possibly reducing readmissions.

Methods

This review examines the strength and level of evidence in key areas to determine if BNP levels could be used as a guide for discharge of HF patients. Although most of the literature describes nonrandomized studies, there is general agreement that BNP levels can be measured accurately and precisely, that BNP levels reflect varying physiologic states, and that they predict outcomes.

Conclusions

More studies are needed to determine extent of biologic variability. The further use of BNP as a potential discharge marker is promising but awaits additional randomized study that reflects use in a broad-based population.

### Elecsys NT-proBNP and BNP assays: are there analytically and clinically relevant differences? [^61547f32]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2005). Low credibility.

Background

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; 77–108 amino acids) and its N-terminal (1–76 amino acids) counterpart, NT-proBNP, are cardiac biomarkers that have been established for the assessment of left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure and provide prognostic and risk stratification information for patients with acute coronary syndrome. Various automated immunoassays currently are available for the measurement of these natriuretic peptides, but there are significant analytical differences, especially between BNP and NT-proBNP.

Methods and Results

Recently published methods and results were reviewed.

Conclusion

Although there are significant pre-analytical and analytical differences between the Triage BNP and Elecsys NT-proBNP and other BNP methods, they do not translate to clinically significant differences in their diagnostic and prognostic application in the assessment of systolic heart failure and risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndrome. However, there appears to be some evidence that suggests that NT-proBNP may have an advantage in the detection of patients with mild or asymptomatic heart disease.

### BNP / NT-proBNP levels are sensitive markers of impaired prognosis in patients Without heart Failure [^c61074f2]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the last decades, extraordinary progress has deeply modified and improved the management of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) based on the availability of new technologies and innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. However, besides the effective control of conventional cardiovascular risk factors, the screening and prevention of CVD still present several gaps to fill, and consequently, CVD continues to represent a major issue for health care systems around the world.

Since their discovery in the early 80s and their identification and characterization in the human heart natriuretic peptides (NPs) have been regarded as potential biomarkers of cardiac function and of the severity of CVD, especially in view of the regulated expression and secretion from myocytes.

Hence, NPs have progressively become a cornerstone of integrated strategies aimed to predict the development and progression of heart failure (HF). Subsequently, the potential diagnostic and prognostic role of NPs has been investigated in the general population and in a wide variety of CVD patients including asymptomatic subjects and high-risk patients.

### B-type natriuretic peptides in acute coronary syndromes: implications in an aging population [^6ea56998]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal-proBNP (NT-proBNP) are increasingly recognized as prognostic markers in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The need for novel and more effective tools for risk assessment cannot be more emphasized than in older patients with ACS given their atypical presentation, multiple comorbidities, and higher risk for mortality and morbidity. Accurate interpretation of B-type NP values in older patients with ACS, however, may be confounded by several aging-related physiologic changes. Advanced age, reduction in body mass, and kidney function and anemia have been associated with higher BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations, and may create challenges with interpreting NP levels in the elderly. This review highlights the need to better understand the physiology of BNP and NT-proBNP in older individuals and their prognostic value in older patients with ACS.

### B-type natriuretic peptide levels and Mortality in patients with and without heart failure [^696ed309]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Circulating B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations strongly predict mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). Both cardiac and extracardiac stimuli influence BNP levels, suggesting that BNP might have similar prognostic value in patients without HF.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the prognostic value of BNP between patients with and those without HF.

Methods

Using the Vanderbilt University Medical Center electronic health record, 30,487 patients (median age 63 years, 50% men, 17% black, 38% with HF) who had a first plasma BNP measurement between 2002 and 2013, with follow-up through 2015, were studied. The risk for death according to BNP level was quantified using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

BNP levels were lower in patients without HF (median 89 pg/ml; interquartile range: 34 to 238 pg/ml) compared with those with HF (median 388 pg/ml; interquartile range: 150 to 940 pg/ml) (p < 0.0001). Over 90,898 person-years of follow-up, 5,903 patients without HF (31%) and 6,181 patients with HF (53%) died. In multivariate models including demographic and clinical characteristics, BNP and age were the strongest predictors of death in both patients with and those without HF. In acute care settings and even among outpatients with modestly elevated BNP, the risk for death according to BNP was similar between patients with and those without HF. For instance, a BNP level of 400 pg/ml was associated with a 3-year risk for death of 21% (95% confidence interval: 20% to 23%) and 19% (95% confidence interval: 17% to 20%) in patients with and those without HF, respectively.

Conclusions

Among patients without HF, plasma BNP level is a stronger predictor of death than traditional risk factors. The risk for death associated with any given BNP level is similar between patients with and those without HF, particularly in the acute care setting.

### Prognostic value of high plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentrations in very elderly persons [^ea566373]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Many elderly persons without heart failure have high plasma concentrations of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). We investigated the prognostic implications and potential causes of these increased levels.

Methods

We enrolled 111 persons aged 80 years or older who had no history of hospitalization for cardiac disease, a cardiothoracic ratio ≤ 55% on chest radiographs, and a serum creatinine level ≤ 2.0 mg/mL. All subjects had participated in a regular health screening program at our hospital, and were followed for up to 24 months. We studied the correlation of plasma BNP concentration with age, nutritional state, and activities of daily living. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association between BNP levels and clinical outcomes (cardiac hospitalizations, mortality), adjusted for other risk factors.

Results

During follow-up, 8 subjects (7%) were hospitalized with cardiac disorders, and 21 (19%) died. Each 50-pg/mL increase in the plasma BNP concentration was associated with a 1.6-fold increase in the risk of cardiac events (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2 to 2.1) and a 1.4-fold increase in total mortality (95% CI: 1.2 to 1.6). Plasma BNP concentration correlated positively with age (r = 0.31, P = 0.001), serum creatinine level (r = 0.23, P = 0.02), and the activities of daily living (r = 0.36, P = 0.0001).

Conclusion

In very elderly persons, the plasma BNP concentration may be a biochemical marker of an increased risk of cardiac morbidity and total mortality.

Natriuretic peptide testing in heart failure — guideline-directed uses and evidence are as follows: 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA states that in patients presenting with dyspnea, measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is useful to support a diagnosis or exclusion of heart failure (HF) (Class I, Evidence A), in patients with chronic HF, measurements of BNP or NT-proBNP levels are recommended for risk stratification (Class I, Evidence A), and in patients hospitalized for HF, measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP levels at admission is recommended to establish prognosis (Class I, Evidence A); it also notes that in patients at risk of developing HF, BNP or NT-proBNP-based screening followed by team-based care, including a cardiovascular specialist, can be useful to prevent the development of LV dysfunction or new-onset HF (Class IIa, Evidence B-R), and in patients hospitalized for HF, a predischarge BNP or NT-proBNP level can be useful to inform the trajectory of the patient and establish a postdischarge prognosis (Class IIa, Evidence B-NR). 2021 ESC recommends that plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides are recommended as initial diagnostic tests in patients with symptoms suggestive of HF to rule out the diagnosis, with elevated concentrations supporting a diagnosis of HF, being useful for prognostication, and potentially guiding further cardiac investigation (Class I, Evidence B). 2017 JCS/JHFS indicates use to confirm the diagnosis of HF (Class I, Evidence A), assess the severity of HF (Class I, Evidence A), assess the prognosis of HF (Class I, Evidence A), monitor the efficacy of HF treatment (Class I, Evidence B), and screen patients susceptible to HF (Class IIa, Evidence C).

Screening and prognostication using natriuretic peptides — STOP-HF and predischarge use show that in the STOP-HF study, participants in the intervention group with BNP levels ≥ 50 pg/mL underwent echocardiography and referral to a cardiovascular specialist and BNP-based screening reduced the composite endpoint of incident asymptomatic LV dysfunction or overt HF; additionally, predischarge BNP and NT-proBNP levels are strong predictors of the risk of death or hospital readmission for HF, and although decreases during treatment are associated with better outcomes than no change or a rise, targeting a certain threshold, value, or relative change during hospitalization has not been shown to be consistently effective in improving outcomes.

Our findings also underscore several recommendations for future research. First, prospective multicenter studies with larger and more homogeneous patient populations are needed to confirm the prognostic value of NT‐proBNP and to establish standardized cut-off values. Future studies should aim to pre-specify NT‐proBNP thresholds based on rigorous validation cohorts to reduce bias introduced by data-driven cut-off selection. Second, research should investigate the additive value of NT‐proBNP in combination with other biomarkers and clinical scoring systems, which could yield more robust predictive models. Exploring the temporal dynamics of NT‐proBNP by conducting serial measurements could also provide insights into how changes in this biomarker correlate with evolving clinical status and long-term outcomes. Finally, randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of NT‐proBNP-guided interventions on clinical outcomes could determine whether this biomarker not only predicts risk but also informs therapeutic decision-making that improves patient prognosis.

### NT-proBNP in heart failure: therapy decisions and monitoring [^fa96c702]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2004). Low credibility.

With increasing cardiac dysfunction, a complex neurohormonal response results in increasing circulating levels of an array of plasma hormones. Increments in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and their amino-terminal congeners are more closely related to cardiac structure and function and to cardiovascular prognosis than changes in other plasma neurohormones. Reports suggest that changes in plasma BNP levels in the course of treatment of acutely decompensated heart failure provide a more powerful prognostic indicator of the likelihood of survival or recurrent decompensation than symptomatic assessment. This observation requires a randomised controlled trial in which changes in peptide levels determine aggression and duration of in-patient therapy in order to establish whether this indicator can improve results from management of acute in-patient heart failure. Plasma BNP or NT-proBNP is a powerful independent predictor of mortality and morbidity in long-term follow-up of heart failure cohorts. In addition, it appears likely to be a good predictor of beneficial response to the addition of beta blockade to anti-heart failure pharmacotherapy. Finally, adjustment of therapy for heart failure according to serial measurements of NT-proBNP promises to improve outcomes in comparison with adjusting therapy according to unassisted clinical acumen.

Key messages

- B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are good and nearly equivalent predictors of death in patients admitted with acute decompensated heart failure.

- Prognostic ability of BNP and NT-proBNP increases during the course of hospitalization.

- BNP declines more rapidly than NT-proBNP during the first 24 hours, suggesting a better suitability for early risk stratification.

- BNP and NT-proBNP could not reliably predict heart failure readmission.

### Role of brain natriuretic peptide in risk stratification of patients with congestive heart failure [^a115258f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

Using a prospective study design, we assessed the value of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to identify patients with heart failure who have an increased risk of deterioration of their functional status. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between BNP and various clinical characteristics incorporated into an established survival model used for risk stratification.

Background

Prediction of the clinical course is a crucial part of the decision-making process about the adequate treatment strategy for patients with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF). Although laborious, multivariable indexes have been established for risk stratification, simple plasma BNP measurements may be as useful as prognostic indicators.

Methods

In 78 patients referred to our heart failure clinic, plasma BNP levels were compared with the results of a multivariable prognostic model. To assess the prognostic power of BNP, the clinical course of this cohort was monitored for a median follow-up period of 398 days.

Results

At study entry, plasma BNP and the heart failure survival score (HFSS) showed a significant correlation (r = -0.706). During follow-up, Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from clinical events differed significantly for patients above and below the 75th percentile concentrations of plasma BNP (p < 0.0001). Changes in plasma BNP were significantly related to changes in limitations of physical activity, as demonstrated by logistic regression analysis (chi-square statistic = 24.9, p < 0.0001). Proportional hazards analysis confirmed BNP as a powerful predictor of functional status deterioration (p < 0.0001). This prognostic information was as powerful as that derived from the multivariable HFSS.

Conclusions

Measurement of plasma BNP concentrations might provide a useful and cost-effective screening tool that helps reduce the need and frequency for more expensive cardiac tests.

### Brain natriuretic peptide as a predictive marker of mortality in sepsis: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1f13ee6a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early identification of patients with sepsis at high risk of death remains a challenge, and whether brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) has a prognostic effect on patients with sepsis is controversial. Here, we clarified the prognostic value of BNP and NT-proBNP and sought to establish suitable cutoff values and intervals.

Methods

We searched five databases to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. The primary outcomes were the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), area under the curve (AUC), and corresponding 95% credible interval (95% CI) of BNP and NT-proBNP. The secondary outcomes were the sensitivity and specificity of BNP or NT-proBNP in subgroup analyses.

Results

Forty-seven studies were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity of NT-proBNP (0.77 [0.68, 0.84]) was weaker than that of BNP (0.82 [0.76, 0.87]), the pooled specificity of NT-proBNP (0.70 [0.60, 0.77]) was less than that of BNP (0.77 [0.71, 0.82]), and the AUC of BNP (0.87 [0.83–0.89]) was greater than that of NT-proBNP (0.80 (0.76–0.83]). The results of the subgroup analysis showed that the cutoff range of 400–800 pg/mL for BNP had high sensitivity (0.86 [0.74–0.98]) and specificity (0.87 [0.81–0.93]) and was probably the most appropriate cutoff range.

Conclusions

Elevated levels of BNP and NT-proBNP were significantly related to the mortality of patients with sepsis and had a moderate prognostic value in predicting the mortality of patients with sepsis. In addition, our meta-analysis preliminarily established appropriate cutoff values for BNP and NT-proBNP.

### Serum pro-N-cadherin is a marker of subclinical heart failure in the general population [^198fc2a9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Studies consistently report the prognostic value of NT‐proBNP for patients with heart failure; by contrast, studies showing the prognostic value of NT‐proBNP in individuals with subclinical heart failure in the general population are inconsistent. NT‐proBNP is a poor diagnostic tool for screening of subclinical heart failure in the general population in 2 recent studies of large cohorts.NT‐proBNP was evaluated as a means to predict those with stage B heart failure defined by 12‐lead ECG and Doppler transthoracic echocardiogram from a healthy population and was found ineffective (AUC, 0.566). In addition, NT‐proBNP was found to have no prognostic value in predicting overall survival in a long‐term follow‐up study with a large cohort of healthy participants. In part, this lack of prognostic value can be attributed to a common single nucleotide polymorphism found within the promotor region of BNP that results in elevated BNP products in the blood. However, this does not fully explain the complexity of NT‐pro/BNP as a biomarker.

Another challenge for clinicians when considering NT‐pro/BNP as part of heart failure diagnosis is the lack of standardization. While 100 pg/mL is a widely agreed‐upon rule‐out concentration for BNP, there is otherwise considerable variability and a large gray zone. This is further complicated by lack of standardization between assays currently in use for clinical applications. Despite this, in one of the most cited studies describing NT‐proBNP, the age‐dependent rule‐in consensus values of 450, 900, and 1800 pg/mL for ages < 50, 50 to 75, and > 75, respectively, yielded 90% sensitivity and 84% specificity for acute heart failure. The consensus < 300 pg/mL had a negative predictive value of 98% in the same study. While this is helpful, there is a clear unmet need for a biomarker to identify patients at risk for developing heart failure before onset of symptoms.

### Diagnostic and prognostic value of microRNA423-5p in patients with heart failure [^308725fa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) represents the final stage in the progression of several severe cardiovascular conditions. Globally, there are over 15 million new cases of HF annually, with a one-year all-cause mortality rate of 25.7% following disease onset. Given its high rates of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality, early detection and prognostic assessment of HF are essential for informing treatment strategies and enhancing patient survival rates. HF markers, including plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are currently important for the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of HF. BNP has great diagnostic value in acute HF, but its concentration in nonacute HF patients is often lower than the critical value, significantly reducing its diagnostic performance. Although NT-proBNP is recommended as an exclusion indicator for nonacute HF, it is difficult to classify subtypes such as HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), limiting its clinical guiding role. Hence, the identification of new biomarkers with enhanced diagnostic utility for the prompt detection, management, and prognostic assessment of individuals with HF has emerged as a significant focus of research.

### Prognostic value of brain natriuretic peptide vs history of heart failure hospitalization in a large real-world population [^9de99aa5]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

In heart failure (HF) patients, both natriuretic peptides (NP) and previous HF hospitalization (pHFH) have been used to predict prognosis.

Hypothesis

In a large real‐world population, both NP levels and pHFH have independent and interdependent predictive value for clinical outcomes of HFH and all‐cause mortality.

Methods

Linked electronic health records and insurance claims data from Decision Resource Group were used to identify HF patients that had a BNP or NT‐proBNP result between January 2012 and December 2016. NT‐proBNP was converted into BNP equivalents by dividing by 4. Index event was defined as most recent NP on or after 1 January 2012. Patients with incomplete records or age < 18 years were excluded. During one‐year follow up, HFH and mortality rates stratified by index BNP levels and pHFH are reported.

Results

Of 64 355 patients (74 ± 12 years old, 49% female) with available values, median BNP was 259 [IQR 101‐642] pg/ml. The risk of both HFH and mortality was higher with increasing BNP levels. At each level of BNP, mortality was only slightly higher in patients with pHFH vs those without pHFH (RR 1.2 [95%CI 1.2,1.3], P < .001); however, at each BNP, HFH was markedly increased in patients with pHFH vs those without pHFH (RR 2.0 [95%CI 1.9,2.1], P < .001).

Conclusion

In this large real‐world heart failure population, higher BNP levels were associated with increased risk for both HFH and mortality. At any given level of BNP, pHFH added greater prognostic value for prediction of future HFH than for mortality.

### Brain natriuretic peptide as a predictive marker of mortality in sepsis: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^d9d4c3f6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Over the years, great progress has been made in understanding the complex pathophysiology of sepsis; however, it remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Indeed, it is estimated that more than 30 million people worldwide are diagnosed with sepsis annually, resulting in approximately 6 million deaths.

Early identification of patients with sepsis at high risk of death remains a challenge. Several severity scoring systems have been developed, including Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Assessment (APACHE) and its revisions (APACHE II, III, and IV), Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) and SAP II, and Mortality Probability Model (MPM). In addition, the third international consensus definition of sepsis and septic shock (Sepsis-3) suggests using the SOFA score to predict the in-hospital mortality of patients with sepsis. However, these scoring systems are often complicated and contain too many evaluation parameters, which leads to an untimely evaluation. Therefore, it is essential to identify reliable biomarkers as a valuable tool to predict the prognosis of patients with sepsis in a timely manner. Biomarkers can also assist with monitoring the progress of the disease and identify patients with an increased risk of complications, thereby representing important prognostic indicators for patients with sepsis. At present, C-reactive protein (CRP), calcitonin (PCT), and other inflammatory markers (e.g. white blood cells) are widely used to aid in the diagnosis of sepsis and predict its progress. However, although these markers have certain clinical diagnostic value for sepsis, their prognostic ability is relatively limited. Recently, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a cardiac neurohormone synthesized by ventricular myocytes, has been suggested as a more useful laboratory parameter in aiding in the prognosis of sepsis. The N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide precursor (NT-pro-BNP) is an inactive polypeptide of pro-hormone BNP; both are synthesized in myocardial cells to respond to hemodynamic pressure or inflammatory state, and as prognostic markers of inflammatory state in critical patients, they have diagnostic value for patients with heart failure. Two meta-analyses have been conducted on the efficacy of BNP and NT-proBNP in the prognosis of sepsis. However, only a few studies were included, and no potential confounding factors that might affect the prognostic value of BNP were investigated, limiting the universality of the results. In addition, neither of the two published meta-analyses conducted subgroup analysis of BNP and NT-proBNP according to the severity of sepsis, but simply considered the utility of these biomarkers in the whole spectrum of sepsis. Therefore, the efficacy of BNP and NT-proBNP in predicting mortality may be different in patients with sepsis with different severities. In addition, the best cutoff values of two biomarkers have not yet been proposed.

### Prognostic value of natriuretic peptide levels in heart failure with recovered ejection fraction [^fc0b56b3]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are currently no robust clinical markers for assessing prognosis in patients with heart failure (HF) with recovered left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). This study sought to investigate whether NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) measured at the time of LVEF recovery is an independent predictor of prognosis among patients with HF with recovered LVEF.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study (2009–2024) included 3935 patients with HF with recovered LVEF (previous LVEF of ≤ 40% with subsequent improvement to ≥ 50%) and available NT-proBNP data at the time of LVEF recovery. Patients were categorized into 7 different NT-proBNP groups, which were compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable Cox regression to evaluate the outcome of LVEF relapse (decrease in LVEF by ≥ 10% to < 50%) and the composite outcome of HF hospitalization or all-cause death.

Results

The median value of NT-proBNP at the time of LVEF recovery was 1341 pg/mL (interquartile range, 400–4207). The probability of remaining free from LVEF relapse and the composite outcome decreased across NT-proBNP groups. After multivariable adjustment, NT-proBNP was an independent predictor of both LVEF relapse and the composite outcome, with higher NT-proBNP levels associated with higher risk of both outcomes in a dose-response manner. Even near-normal NT-proBNP levels (125–299 pg/mL) were associated with poorer prognosis relative to normal levels (< 125 pg/mL), with a 46% higher risk of LVEF relapse and 82% higher risk of the composite outcome. This relationship was consistent and similar across age, sex, atrial fibrillation status, and renal function, but was modified by body mass index, with higher body mass index associated with higher risk. Notably, NT-proBNP was predictive of the composite outcome even when patients sustained LVEF recovery without experiencing LVEF relapse.

Conclusions

NT-proBNP is an independent and robust predictor of prognosis in patients with HF with recovered LVEF and may therefore be used to guide further optimization of pharmacotherapy.

### Differences in NT-proBNP response and prognosis in men and women with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^4b169996]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

NT‐proBNP (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide) is a prognostic biomarker in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction. However, it is unclear whether there is a sex difference in NT‐proBNP response and whether the therapeutic goal of NT‐proBNP ≤ 1000 pg/mL has equivalent prognostic value in men and women with HF with reduced ejection fraction.

Methods and Results

In a secondary analysis of the GUIDE‐IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment) trial we analyzed trends in NT‐proBNP and goal attainment by sex. Differences in clinical characteristics, HF treatment, and time to all‐cause death or HF hospitalization were compared. Landmark analysis at 3 months determined the prognostic value of early NT‐proBNP goal achievement in men and women. Of the 286 (32%) women and 608 (68%) men in the GUIDE‐IT trial, women were more likely to have a nonischemic cause and shorter duration of HF. Guideline‐directed medical therapy was less intense over time in women. The absolute NT‐proBNP values were consistently lower in women; however, the change in NT‐proBNP and clinical outcomes were similar. After adjustment, women achieving the NT‐proBNP goal had an 82% reduction in death or HF hospitalization compared with a 59% reduction in men.

Conclusions

Men and women with HF with reduced ejection fraction had a similar NT‐proBNP response despite less intensive HF treatment among women. However, compared with men, the early NT‐proBNP goal of ≤ 1000 pg/mL had greater prognostic value in women. Future efforts should be aimed at intensifying guideline‐directed medical therapy in women, which may result in greater NT‐proBNP reductions and improved outcomes in women with HF with reduced ejection fraction.

### Prognostic value of changes in N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide in val-HeFT (valsartan heart failure trial) [^82c98392]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the association between changes over time of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) expressed in different ways and outcome in patients with stable and chronic heart failure (HF).

Background

Although previous studies examined the prognostic value of repeated determinations of BNP in HF, there are only limited data on the clinical utility of serial measurements of the inactive peptide NT-proBNP in a large population of ambulatory patients with chronic HF with sufficient follow-up time.

Methods

The NT-proBNP was measured at randomization and after 4 months in 1,742 patients enrolled in the placebo arm of Val-HeFT (Valsartan Heart Failure Trial). Changes in NT-proBNP concentrations over 4 months were expressed as absolute change from baseline, percent relative changes, or categorical changes across a threshold value and related to subsequent mortality.

Results

A single determination of NT-proBNP (area under the curve at 4 months: 0.702, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.669 to 0.735) showed a higher prognostic discrimination than continuous changes of concentrations, expressed either as absolute (0.592, 95% CI: 0.549 to 0.634) or relative changes (0.602, 95% CI: 0.566 to 0.639). A Cox proportional hazards model showed that stratification of patients into 4 categories according to NT-proBNP levels at 2 time points 4 months apart with respect to a threshold concentration provided prognostic information in patients with chronic HF beyond that of a single determination.

Conclusions

Serial determinations of NT-proBNP concentration and classification into few categories of changes according to threshold levels may be a superior strategy for risk stratification of patients with chronic and stable HF.

### Ejection fraction, B-type natriuretic peptide and risk of stroke and acute myocardial infarction among patients with heart failure [^e7bcd743]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a peptide hormone that is now the gold standard diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for HF. 17 Indeed, a systematic review of 19 studies reported that, for every 100 pg/mL rise in BNP concentration, there is a corresponding 35% increase in the risk of death, and recent updates of the ACC/AHA/HFSA and ESC guidelines recommend using BNP levels in the risk stratification of HF. 1, 9

The use of BNP levels in stratifying HF patients is supported by three prospective studies, which collectively demonstrate that BNP levels correlate with EF, 18 and that the prognostic value of BNP is equal or even higher than that of EF. 19, 20 However, to the best of our knowledge, the clinical outcomes of HF patients stratified using EF or BNP levels have not been studied in a real‐world setting. Furthermore, there are limited data pertaining to the use of BNP to predict events, such as AMI and ischemic stroke in patients with HF. In order to fill this knowledge gap, this US retrospective claims study was conducted to evaluate the association of cardiovascular events (ie, ischemic stroke, AMI) with EF levels and to assess the prognostic value of BNP in a real‐world setting.

### Prognostic value of B-type natriuretic peptides in patients with stable coronary artery disease: the PEACE trial [^3d18cba9]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the association between B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and the incidence of specific cardiovascular events in low-risk patients with stable coronary disease, the incremental prognostic information obtained from these two biomarkers compared with traditional risk factors, and their ability to identify patients who may benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition.

Background

The prognostic value of BNPs in low-risk patients with stable coronary artery disease remains unclear.

Methods

Baseline plasma BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations were measured in 3,761 patients with stable coronary artery disease and preserved left ventricular function participating in the PEACE (Prevention of Events With Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibition) study, a placebo-controlled trial of trandolapril. Multivariable Cox regression was used to assess the association between natriuretic peptide concentrations and the incidence of cardiovascular mortality, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke.

Results

The BNP and NT-proBNP levels were strongly related to the incidence of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, and stroke but not to myocardial infarction. In multivariable models, BNP remained associated with increased risk of heart failure, whereas NT-proBNP remained associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, and stroke. By C-statistic calculations, BNP and NT-proBNP significantly improved the predictive accuracy of the best available model for incident heart failure, and NT-proBNP also improved the model for cardiovascular death. The magnitude of effect of ACE inhibition on the likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular end points was similar, regardless of either BNP or NT-proBNP baseline concentrations.

Conclusions

In low-risk patients with stable coronary artery disease and preserved ventricular function, BNPs provide strong and incremental prognostic information to traditional risk factors.

Hypothesis

In a large real-world population, both NP levels and pHFH have independent and interdependent predictive value for clinical outcomes of HFH and all-cause mortality.

Methods

NT-proBNP was converted into BNP equivalents by dividing by 4. Index event was defined as most recent NP on or after 1 January 2012. Patients with incomplete records or age < 18years were excluded. During one-year follow up, HFH and mortality rates stratified by index BNP levels and pHFH are reported.

Results

Of 64355 patients (74 ± 12years old, 49% female) with available values, median BNP was 259 [IQR 101–642] pg/ml. The risk of both HFH and mortality was higher with increasing BNP levels. At each level of BNP, mortality was only slightly higher in patients with pHFH vs those without pHFH (RR 1.2 [95%CI 1.2,1.3], P < .001); however, at each BNP, HFH was markedly increased in patients with pHFH vs those without pHFH (RR 2.0 [95%CI 1.9,2.1], P < .001).

Conclusion

In this large real-world heart failure population, higher BNP levels were associated with increased risk for both HFH and mortality. At any given level of BNP, pHFH added greater prognostic value for prediction of future HFH than for mortality.

### Low BNP predicts better outcomes in patients with PE… [^b98d89ea]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question: Does an elevated level of brain natriuretic peptide predict an adverse outcome in patients with pulmonary embolism. Setting: Inpatient Study Design: Cohort Synopsis: Large PEs can cause right ventricular dysfunction, which is, in turn, associated with an increase in the levels of BNP and other cardiac enzymes. This small study examines the ability of BNP levels to serve as an aid in the prognosis of patients with PE. Consecutive patients with acute PE admitted to a tertiary care center had their BNP levels measured on admission and were followed prospectively. Adverse outcomes were defined as death; cardiopulmonary resuscitation; mechanical ventilation; or the need to use pressors, thrombolysis, catheter fragmentation, or surgical embolectomy. We are not told whether the researchers who judged the outcomes were blinded to the BNP levels of the participants, but we must assume they were not.

Of 73 patients in the study, 20 had an adverse outcome. A BNP level of less than 90 pg per mL was 85 percent sensitive and 75 percent specific for the prediction of a benign course. Three patients with symptoms for fewer than 12 hours had a false-negative BNP, and five patients with chronic cardiac or lung disease had a false-positive BNP. The authors argue that they would get better results with a cutoff level of 50 pg per mL, but this requires prospective confirmation. Another option would be to wait 12 hours before drawing the BNP. To its credit, BNP was a stronger independent predictor of adverse events than was troponin-T. Bottom Line: This study provides preliminary evidence that measurement of BNP is a useful prognostic tool in patients with PE; 93 percent of patients with a BNP value of less than 90 pg per mL had a benign course.

The small size of this study, failure to blind observers, and questions about the best time to draw blood and the best cutoff level mean we need more information before making this a routine part of our practice. BNP may eventually have a role, if validated, in identifying patients for outpatient therapy.

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure [^da133555]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart does not pump enough blood to meet all the needs of the body. Symptoms of heart failure include breathlessness, fatigue and fluid retention. Outcomes for patients with heart failure are highly variable; however on average, these patients have a poor prognosis. Prognosis can be improved with early diagnosis and appropriate use of medical treatment, use of devices and transplantation. Patients with heart failure are high users of healthcare resources, not only due to drug and device treatments, but due to high costs of hospitalisation care. B-type natriuretic peptide levels are already used as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of heart failure, but could offer to clinicians a possible tool to guide drug treatment. This could optimise drug management in heart failure patients whilst allaying concerns over potential side effects due to drug intolerance.

Objectives

To assess whether treatment guided by serial BNP or NT-proBNP (collectively referred to as NP) monitoring improves outcomes compared with treatment guided by clinical assessment alone.

Search Methods

Searches were conducted up to 15 March 2016 in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OVID), Embase (OVID), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database in the Cochrane Library. Searches were also conducted in the Science Citation Index Expanded, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of NP-guided treatment of heart failure versus treatment guided by clinical assessment alone with no restriction on follow-up. Adults treated for heart failure, in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings, and trials reporting a clinical outcome were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated for continuous data. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, we assessed the quality of the evidence and GRADE profiler (GRADEPRO) was used to import data from Review Manager to create a 'Summary of findings' table.

Main Results

We included 18 randomised controlled trials with 3660 participants (range of mean age: 57 to 80 years) comparing NP-guided treatment with clinical assessment alone. The evidence for all-cause mortality using NP-guided treatment showed uncertainty (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01; patients = 3169; studies = 15; low quality of the evidence), and for heart failure mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.30; patients = 853; studies = 6; low quality of evidence). The evidence suggested heart failure admission was reduced by NP-guided treatment (38% versus 26%, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.80; patients = 1928; studies = 10; low quality of evidence), but the evidence showed uncertainty for all-cause admission (57% versus 53%, RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03; patients = 1142; studies = 6; low quality of evidence). Six studies reported on adverse events, however the results could not be pooled (patients = 1144; low quality of evidence). Only four studies provided cost of treatment results, three of these studies reported a lower cost for NP-guided treatment, whilst one reported a higher cost (results were not pooled; patients = 931, low quality of evidence). The evidence showed uncertainty for quality of life data (MD -0.03, 95% CI -1.18 to 1.13; patients = 1812; studies = 8; very low quality of evidence). We completed a 'Risk of bias' assessment for all studies. The impact of risk of bias from lack of blinding of outcome assessment and high attrition levels was examined by restricting analyses to only low 'Risk of bias' studies.

Authors' Conclusions

In patients with heart failure low-quality evidence showed a reduction in heart failure admission with NP-guided treatment while low-quality evidence showed uncertainty in the effect of NP-guided treatment for all-cause mortality, heart failure mortality, and all-cause admission. Uncertainty in the effect was further shown by very low-quality evidence for patient's quality of life. The evidence for adverse events and cost of treatment was low quality and we were unable to pool results.

### Amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptides and prognosis in chronic heart failure [^08489dd6]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

In patients with chronic heart failure (HF), amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels are among the strongest independent predictors of hazard, and their measurement is useful for prognostication across the entire spectrum of HF disease severity. In patients with chronic HF, repeated determinations of NT-proBNP levels appear to convey additional prognostic value for relevant adverse outcomes, including death or HF hospitalization. Although "hard targets" for NT-proBNP values are not entirely defined, morbidity and mortality in chronic HF appear to increase markedly with an NT-proBNP concentration > 1,000 ng/L. Confounding factors (such as renal function or obesity) should be kept in mind when prognostically evaluating patients using NT-proBNP measurements; however, the value of NT-proBNP is retained in these patients. Thus, serial assessment of NT-proBNP is valuable for prognostication in chronic HF in outpatients, and, as such, a measurement at each patient visit or the following of changes in clinical stability is recommended.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^b4e5bdbe]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of 9 RCTs involving 3992 patients with decompensated HF, comparing NP‐guided therapy with standard care. Our main findings indicate no statistically significant differences between the NP‐guided therapy group and the usual care group in terms of all‐cause mortality, CV death, HF‐related death, composite outcomes, adverse effects, or quality of life.

NPs play a critical role in the diagnosis and prognosis of HF. These biomarkers are powerful predictors of mortality and HF‐related hospitalizations, regardless of ejection fraction or the underlying cause of HF. Despite their strong prognostic value, there is limited evidence and ongoing debate regarding the routine use of serial BNP and NT‐proBNP measurements to guide acute HF therapy versus standard care.

In the early 2000s, Troughton and colleagues provided the first evidence that NP‐guided therapy could improve outcomes in HF patients compared to standard clinically guided therapy. Since then, numerous studies have produced conflicting results. McLellan and colleagues conducted a meta‐analysis with 4063 patients with HF, summarizing the available evidence and concluding in favor of NP‐guided therapy over standard care. However, our updated systematic review and meta‐analysis, including the STRONG‐HF trial, suggests no significant advantage of NP‐guided therapy. The variability in HF populations across studies, characterized by different NYHA stages and both preserved and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, likely contributes to these discrepancies and impacts the generalizability of the findings. HF admissions and all‐cause mortality are primary outcomes that we aimed to improve with GDMT. However, our pooled analysis revealed no significant difference compared to usual care.

### Short-term serial sampling of natriuretic peptides in patients presenting with chest pain [^96d472c6]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to characterize the diagnostic and prognostic utility of short-term dynamic changes in natriuretic peptides in patients presenting with chest pain.

Background

Although single levels of natriuretic peptides in patients admitted for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have important prognostic value, it is unclear whether serial sampling of natriuretic peptides might have both diagnostic and prognostic value in the setting of chest pain.

Methods

We followed 276 patients for 90 days who presented to the emergency department with chest pain. We sampled brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and amino-terminal (NT)-proBNP up to 5 times within 24 h of presentation and again at discharge. Follow-up data was collected at 30 and 90 days after admission. Adverse events included emergency department visits for chest pain, cardiac readmission, and death. We assessed the prognostic and diagnostic value of baseline natriuretic peptide measurements with receiver-operating characteristic analyses.

Results

Natriuretic peptides were diagnostic for congestive heart failure (CHF) and new-onset CHF but less so for ACS. The prognostic utility of serial sampling was evaluated through testing the statistical contribution of each future time point (as well as variability over time) over and above the baseline values in logistic regression models.

Conclusions

Baseline elevated BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations were predictive of adverse events at 30 and 90 days. Serial sampling did not improve the prognostic value of BNP or NT-proBNP.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^1002fbde]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptides across acute heart failure care — Natriuretic peptide (NP) levels fluctuate with left ventricular (LV) filling pressures during decompensation and improvement and exhibit intrinsic biological variability of 25–30% for NT-proBNP and 40% for BNP; in the emergency department (ED) NP use includes accuracy of diagnosis with high negative predictive value (NPV), stratification and triage, shortening decision time, and prognosis, in-hospital applications include correlation to LV filling pressure, monitoring response to intravenous (IV) therapies, assessing hemodynamic congestion, guiding discharge decisions and prognosis, and post-discharge uses include identification of residual congestion, prompting early interventions to reduce congestion, and prognosis at 1 week and 1 month; these biomarkers have the highest class of recommendation for exclusion of heart failure because of very high NPV (94%–97%), are helpful in judging whether reported worsening symptoms are related to increased left-sided cardiac filling pressures, but lack a prognostic effect in predominant right-sided HF such as severe tricuspid regurgitation.

### Differences in NT-proBNP response and prognosis in men and women with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^5abff93e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Background NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) is a prognostic biomarker in heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction. However, it is unclear whether there is a sex difference in NT-proBNP response and whether the therapeutic goal of NT-proBNP ≤ 1000 pg/mL has equivalent prognostic value in men and women with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Methods and Results In a secondary analysis of the GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment) trial we analyzed trends in NT-proBNP and goal attainment by sex. Differences in clinical characteristics, HF treatment, and time to all-cause death or HF hospitalization were compared. Landmark analysis at 3 months determined the prognostic value of early NT-proBNP goal achievement in men and women. Of the 286 (32%) women and 608 (68%) men in the GUIDE-IT trial, women were more likely to have a nonischemic cause and shorter duration of HF. Guideline-directed medical therapy was less intense over time in women. The absolute NT-proBNP values were consistently lower in women; however, the change in NT-proBNP and clinical outcomes were similar. After adjustment, women achieving the NT-proBNP goal had an 82% reduction in death or HF hospitalization compared with a 59% reduction in men. Conclusions Men and women with HF with reduced ejection fraction had a similar NT-proBNP response despite less intensive HF treatment among women. However, compared with men, the early NT-proBNP goal of ≤ 1000 pg/mL had greater prognostic value in women. Future efforts should be aimed at intensifying guideline-directed medical therapy in women, which may result in greater NT-proBNP reductions and improved outcomes in women with HF with reduced ejection fraction.

### In-hospital percentage BNP reduction is highly predictive for adverse events in patients admitted for acute heart failure: the Italian RED study [^ab574760]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Key messages

- In patients with ADHF, serial assessment of BNP at admission, 24 hours after admission, and at discharge time are useful to confirm clinical improvement obtained during hospitalization.

- A reduction of 25% or greater of BNP at 24 hours from hospitalization compared with admission levels has a strong negative prognostic value for future cardiovascular events.

- A reduction of 46% or greater of BNP at discharge coupled with BNP absolute value below 300 pg/ml demonstrate a strong negative prognostic value for future cardiovascular events.

### Natriuretic peptide-based screening and heart failure… [^e7d1ff16]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Refining risk prediction may be aided by the use of brain-type natriuretic peptide, which has been shown in large general and American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association stag A/B populations to identify those at highest risk of cardiovascular events and, more specifically, of newly diagnosed HF. 7, 8 Studies have shown advantages of using this peptide in this regard over conventional risk indicators. 8, 9 This may reflect the fact that BNP is a response to established cardiovascular damage whereas other conventional risk indicators reflect the potential for cardiovascular insult. At study termination, all control and intervention participants underwent clinical assessment by a cardiologist including Doppler echocardiography; the technician and reporting cardiologist were blinded to study group allocation.

In the group with BNP levels of 50 pg/mL or higher, the incidence rates of emergency hospitalization for major adverse cardiovascular events were 78 per 1000 patient-years in the control group and 40 per 1000 patient-years in the intervention group. STOP–HF is the first prospective, randomized study, to our knowledge, to demonstrate a reduction in newly diagnosed HF, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, and emergency cardiovascular hospitalizations using BNP-guided collaborative care in a broad community cohort. It confirms BNP as a risk identifier for HF and cardiovascular events and provides unique data on the potential benefit of using levels of this peptide as a guide for care. Several data sets indicate that BNP may be effective in refining risk prediction for HF and cardiovascular disease and that it adds predictive power to conventional risk factors.

8 Conventional risk indicators reflect potential for cardiovascular insult and later development of HF, whereas BNP responds to established cardiovascular damage. In addition to standard signals for BNP release, 20–22 other work has demonstrated that this peptide responds to fibroinflammation, 23 a fundamental pathophysiological signal present from the outset of many cardiovascular diseases. The independent association of baseline BNP level with outcome in this study suggests the potential value of this peptide in risk stratification of American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association stage A/B HF. The intervention strategy of referral for specialist cardiovascular review if BNP was 50 pg/mL or higher was based on an initial observation from our unit demonstrating a 3-fold increase in events in those with BNP levels of 50 pg/mL or higher, 24 a finding supported by other data sets.

### Measurement of troponin and natriuretic peptides shortly after admission in patients with heart failure-does it add useful prognostic information? An analysis of the value of endothelin receptor inhibition with tezosentan in acute heart failure studies (VERITAS) [^a3fde146]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Plasma concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin are often measured for diagnostic purposes when patients are admitted with heart failure, but their prognostic value when measured soon after admission is uncertain. We aimed to investigate the added prognostic value of admission measurements of BNP and troponins in patients with acute heart failure.

Methods and Results

Multivariable prognostic models for death or any worsening heart failure (WHF) or rehospitalization for WHF by 30 days, 30-day death or rehospitalization for WHF, and 90-day mortality were constructed using baseline data from the Value of Endothelin Receptor Inhibition with Tezosentan in Acute heart failure Studies (VERITAS) including BNP and troponin I. Of 1347 patients, the median (interquartile range) value of BNP was 422 (156–945) pg/mL and 855 (63%) had measurable troponin I. By 30 days, 432 patients had died or experienced WHF. Clinical variables had only moderate predictive performance that was not substantially improved by BNP or troponin I (c-indices 0.6528 and 0.6595, respectively). By 30 days, 150 patients died or were rehospitalized for WHF. The c-index using clinical variables (0.6855) was not improved by adding biomarkers. By 90 days, 135 patients had died. The c-index for mortality was somewhat better than for composite outcomes (0.7394) but improved little with biomarkers (0.7461).

Conclusion

Routine clinical data recorded at the time of admission in patients with acute heart failure are poor at predicting recurrent admissions but somewhat better at predicting mortality. Neither BNP nor troponin measured at admission improved predictions; measurement closer to discharge, or of other novel biomarkers, might perform differently.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ventricular arrhythmias, more specifically with respect to natriuretic peptides, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider measuring natriuretic peptides (BNP or NT-proBNP) to add prognostic information to standard risk factors for predicting SCD or sudden cardiac arrest in patients with structural heart disease.

### Prognostic value of brain natriuretic peptide vs history of heart failure hospitalization in a large real-world population [^59cdb1a3]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

3.2 Correlations betweenand heart failure hospitalization rate

The risk of HFH increased as the BNP level rose (Figure 1A. Patients with BNP ≥ 1500 pg/ml had highest risk of HFH (RR: 3.3; 95% CI 3.0‐3.5) followed by BNP 1000 to 1249, 1250 to 1499, 750 to 999, 500 to 749, 250 to 499 and 0 to 249 groups. Compared with BNP 0 to 249 pg/ml, the risk ratios incrementally increased with each subsequent BNP level, except group 1250 to 1499, which has non‐significant difference with group 1000 to 1249. For example, as shown in Figure 1A, the RR for HFH is 1.8 for BNP 250‐499 vs 2.4 for BNP 500‐749. The P ‐value corresponding to this comparison is < .001. The RR for HFH is 3.0 for BNP 1000‐1249 vs 2.8 for BNP 1250‐1499. The P ‐value corresponding to this comparison is.323. The statistical comparison of the risk of HFH between each incremental BNP group is listed in Table S2. The overall RR for HFH was 1.26 for every 2 times increase in BNP.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^2322b3dd]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — assessment of prognosis notes that the likelihood of survival can be determined reliably only in populations and not in individuals, yet prognostication may provide information for patients and identify those in whom cardiac transplantation or mechanical device therapy should be considered. Multivariate analyses have identified and validated prognostic models, and key prognostic parameters include decreasing left ventricular ejection fraction, worsening New York Heart Association functional status, hyponatremia, decreased peak exercise oxygen uptake, decreasing hematocrit, widened QRS, chronic hypotension, resting tachycardia, renal insufficiency, intolerance to conventional therapy, and refractory volume overload. Routine assessment of neurohormones such as norepinephrine or endothelin is neither feasible nor helpful in clinical management; elevated BNP levels predict higher risk and marked elevation during hospitalization may predict rehospitalization and death, yet BNP measurement has not been clearly shown to supplement careful clinical assessment. Routine use of ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, T‑wave alternans, heart rate variability, and signal‑averaged electrocardiography has not shown incremental prognostic value, although ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring can be useful in deciding on implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator placement.

### Prognostic value of serial B-type natriuretic peptide testing during follow-up of patients with unstable coronary artery disease [^fff8d60d]. JAMA (2005). Excellent credibility.

Context

Elevated concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) at presentation in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are associated with long-term mortality. Few data exist regarding serial assessment of BNP levels during follow-up.

Objective

To determine whether concentrations of BNP at study entry (prior to hospital discharge for ACS) and at outpatient follow-up at 4 months and 12 months are associated with subsequent clinical outcomes.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Prospective observational substudy of 4497 patients with non-ST-elevation or ST-elevation ACS who were enrolled in phase Z of the A to Z trial, which was conducted in 41 countries at 322 acute care hospitals between 1999 and 2003.

Main Outcome Measure

Death from any cause or new onset of congestive heart failure (CHF) through 2 years.

Results

Levels of BNP were available in 4266 patients at study entry (prior to hospital discharge), 3618 patients at 4 months, and 2966 patients at 12 months. During follow-up there were 230 deaths and 163 incident cases of CHF. Adjusting for age, sex, index event, renal function, hypertension, prior heart failure, and diabetes, elevated levels of BNP (> 80 pg/mL) were associated with subsequent death or new CHF when measured at study entry (111 [21%] vs 246 [7%]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–3.3), at 4 months (34 [19%] vs 125 [4%]; adjusted HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.6–6.0), and at 12 months (19 [11%] vs 37 [1%]; adjusted HR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.5–8.9). Patients with newly elevated levels of BNP at 4 months were at increased risk of death or new CHF (10 [15%] vs 105 [3%]); HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 2.3–8.6). Patients with elevated levels of BNP at study entry and with BNP levels lower than 80 pg/mL at 4 months tended to have only modestly increased risk (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0–2.9) compared with patients with BNP levels lower than 80 pg/mL at both visits.

Conclusions

Serial determinations of BNP levels during outpatient follow-up after ACS predict the risk of death or new CHF. Changes in BNP levels over time are associated with long-term clinical outcomes and may provide a basis for enhanced clinical decision making in patients after onset of ACS.

### What does high NT-proBNP mean in septic shock patients? A part of the puzzle [^3d820fa9]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and amino-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) plasma levels are commonly high at the early phase of septic shock and have been suggested to be prognostic markers for this condition. It is uncertain, however, whether this increase reflects sepsis related cardiac dysfunction. In a recent issue of Critical Care, Mokart and coworkers showed the accuracy of NT-proBNP in predicting intensive care unit mortality in cancer patients with septic shock, which could help in identifying high risk cancer patients. Results from repeated transthoracic echocardiographs show that NT-proBNP on day 2 after admission was higher in patients presenting with cardiac dysfunction, whereas NT-proBNP on day 1 did not predict cardiac dysfunction. These data suggest that after an initial overexpression of NT-proBNP in all septic patients, patients with cardiac dysfunction will present persistent high levels of NT-proBNP.

### Diagnostic and prognostic considerations for use of natriuretic peptides in obese patients with heart failure [^4edf2eb6]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Natriuretic peptides (NPs, B-type natriuretic peptide /BNP and NT-proBNP) are universally used biomarkers with established cut-points to aid in the diagnosis of heart failure (HF). It has been demonstrated that an inverse relationship exists between obesity, defined by the body mass index (BMI), and NPs, such that the application of NPs to diagnostic algorithms in HF remains challenging in overweight and obese patients. Some have advocated that lowering the cut-offs for NPs or using a correction for high BMI may improve the diagnostic accuracy in obese individuals. The inverse relationship of NPs with high BMI is present in both HF with reduced (HFrEF) and with preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, although levels tend to be higher in HFrEF. Nevertheless, data from several studies have shown that the prognostic value of NPs is preserved across BMI classes, and that increasing circulating levels of NPs correlate with adverse outcomes including all-cause mortality and HF hospitalizations. While NPs can still be used in diagnosis of HF in obese individuals, lower thresholds and the clinical context should be utilized in decision making. Additionally, given the validated prognostic value even in obesity, NPs can be employed in risk-stratification of individuals with obesity and HF, although there remains limited evidence about use in those with severe obesity (BMI > 40 kg/m 2).

### Effect of exercise therapy on established and emerging circulating biomarkers in patients with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^3091dde8]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to their diagnostic and prognostic utility, biomarker profiles may prove beneficial in guiding HF therapy and improving treatment strategies, including the identification of patients with HF that may respond to exercise training. A 2010 meta-analysissuggested that exercise training had a favourable effect on both BNP and NT-proBNP. The results of which were confirmed by a 2011 individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis, with a 37.4% and 28.3% reduction in NT-proBNP and BNP, respectively. Furthermore, BNP and NT-proBNP changes are correlated with changes in peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak).

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was first to update the previous reviews as a number of additional studies have investigated BNP and/or NT-proBNP after training interventions. Second, given the emergence of new biomarkers in HF trials, we intended to add to the current literature the inclusion of a selected number of emerging biomarkers. Furthermore, differing to previous analyses, we expanded our review to include additional modalities of exercise therapy due to their increasing utilisation in cardiac rehabilitation programmes and trials, which may provide alternatives for subgroups of patients with HF.

### Preoperative BNP: epidemiological patterns, management strategies and cost analysis of care… [^1420972f]. ClinicalTrials (2019). Medium credibility.

- Evaluation of the use of BNP as a preoperative screening biomarker; how often is it ordered in Anesthesia Preadmission Clinic and what is the incidence of a positive result
- Determine the incidence of myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery at 30 days and myocardial infarction at 1 year at a tertiary care center when BNP is used as a screening tool.
- **Myocardial infarction with at least one of**: symptoms of ischemia, new ST segment / T wave changes or new left bundle branch block, pathological Q waves, new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality on echocardiogram, intracoronary thrombus identified on angiogram. BNP is a protein released from ventricular cardiomyocytes. It is released in limited amounts during physiological conditions but this is increased significantly in ventricular failure, inflammation, fibrosis, ischemia and hypoxia. Rodseth et al.

conducted a systematic review of the prognostic value of preoperative BNP and postoperative BNP in noncardiac surgery and showed that elevated preoperative BNP carries a significant risk of 30-day mortality or nonfatal MI. This is a significantly lower BNP value compared to what is typically seen in congestive cardiac failure patients. This study has been used to support the most recent CCS guidelines which add preoperative BNP as an important preoperative cardiac risk stratification tool. According to the CCS guidelines, patients with an elevated preoperative BNP should have daily troponins measured for 48
- 72 hours after surgery.

In this study the objectives are to investigate:

- incidence of qualification for BNP measurement as determined by CCS guidelines
- incidence of patients with BNP ≥ 92 ng/L
- incidence of MINS at 30 days and incidence of myocardial infarction at 1 year after surgery
- evaluate the management of patients with positive troponin after surgery. In this study, elective patients deemed at risk of a postoperative cardiac event will be monitored, as determined by preoperative BNP measurement, up to 1 year postoperatively. BNP positive patients will be monitored for myocardial injury postoperatively by measuring troponin daily for 72 hours. The incidence of MINS in BNP positive patients will be determined.

### Prognostic value of serial B-type natriuretic peptide testing during follow-up of patients with unstable coronary artery disease… [^e7a8c368]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Patients with newly elevated levels of BNP at 4 months were at increased risk of death or new CHF; HR, 4. 5; 95% CI,
2. 3–8. 6). Patients with elevated levels of BNP at study entry and with BNP levels lower than 80 pg/mL at 4 months tended to have only modestly increased risk compared with patients with BNP levels lower than 80 pg/mL at both visits. Formal testing for an interaction with prior CHF revealed none. Among the 3493 patients with measurements at baseline and at 4 months, 473 had BNP concentrations higher than 80 pg/mL at baseline; of these 473 patients, 140 had levels that remained elevated at 4 months, while the remainder had levels that were lower than 80 pg/mL. After adjustment for other clinical predictors, a baseline BNP level higher than 80 pg/mL was associated with a 2-fold higher long-term risk of death and death or new CHF. When measured at 4 months, BNP level remained strongly associated with subsequent survival, as well as the risk of death or new CHF. Patients with a persistently elevated level of BNP were at highest risk of death or new CHF. Notably, compared with patients who had BNP levels that were lower than 80 pg/mL at both visits, patients who had a BNP level lower than 80 pg/mL at baseline but presented with an elevated BNP level at 4 months had a 4-fold higher risk of death or new CHF.

### Advances in congestive heart failure management in the intensive care unit: B-type natriuretic peptides in evaluation of acute heart failure [^923e13df]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Circulating concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and the aminoterminal fragment (NT-proBNP) of its prohormone (proBNP) are increased in congestive heart failure in proportion to the severity of symptoms, the degree of left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiac filling pressures. Following the introduction of rapid, automated assays for determination of BNP and NT-proBNP, these peptides are increasingly used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.

Objective

To review studies evaluating the diagnostic and prognostic value of BNP and NT-proBNP, with special emphasis on their performance as indicators of acute heart failure in the intensive care unit.

Results

In patients presenting with acute dyspnea, both BNP and NT-proBNP are accurate indicators of acute heart failure and provide prognostic information above and beyond conventional risk markers. Increased plasma levels of BNP and NT-proBNP are not specific for heart failure and may be influenced by a variety of cardiac and noncardiac conditions commonly seen in the intensive care unit, including myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias, sepsis, shock, anemia, renal failure, hypoxia, acute pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Conclusions

The diagnostic performance of BNP and NT-proBNP as indicators of acute heart failure depends on the clinical setting. In the intensive care unit, particular caution should be used in the interpretation of elevated BNP and NT-proBNP levels.

### Circulating heart failure biomarkers beyond natriuretic peptides: review from the biomarker study group of the heart failure association (HFA), European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^c5ef5285]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Physicians routinely use biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognosis and management of patients with heart failure (HF). Established biomarkers such as N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs‐cTn) are integrated into the current European (European Society of Cardiology, ESC) and American (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, ACC/AHA) guidelines. In the ESC guidelines, natriuretic peptides are advocated for their utility in diagnosis of HF, with particular value to exclude HF. However, most data regarding biomarkers in HF report on their prognostic utility, while recognizing these markers may not necessarily improve diagnosis or treatment. To improve performance, it has been advocated to use serial measurements or to implement biomarker guided‐therapies. Factors complicating clinical application of markers include fluctuation in biomarker levels at various time points in clinical decision‐making; for example, at the emergency department, prior to dischargeor in the outpatient clinic. Further, although biomarkers can both be used to assess high and low risk of adverse events, comorbidities and other patient characteristics including age, sex, coefficient of variation within an individual (biological variation), and kidney function potentially confound the biomarker result and its interpretation. Finally, few prospective trials have been conducted to test if biomarker‐based clinical decision‐making improves management or outcomes. As a result, the role of biomarkers in ongoing HF treatment decision‐making remains limited although it is universally accepted that lower peptide serum concentrations associate with a better prognosis. The role and best clinical use of established markers of renal function such as serum creatinine has recently been summarized elsewhere and is not discussed.

### Prognostic value of serial N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide measurements in adults with congenital heart disease [^acff773e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Prognostic Value of Baseline NT‐proBNP

Baseline NT‐proBNP was significantly associated with the primary end point (crude HR per 2‐fold higher value 1.55 [95% CI 1.43–1.68], P < 0.001) and with the secondary end point (crude HR per 2‐fold higher value 2.30 [95% CI 1.97–2.68], P < 0.001). The Kaplan‐Meier estimate of primary end point‐free survival at 4 years of follow‐up was 84.1% in patients with normal baseline NT‐proBNP (< 14 pmol/L) and 55.1% in patients with elevated baseline NT‐proBNP. Secondary end point‐free survival at 4 years of follow‐up was 99.3% in patients with normal baseline NT‐proBNP (< 14 pmol/L) and 83.2% in patients with elevated baseline NT‐proBNP. After complete adjustment for all covariates, the strength of the association was slightly attenuated but remained significant for both the primary end point (adjusted HR per 2‐fold higher value 1.39 [95% CI 1.23–1.57], P < 0.001) and the secondary end point (adjusted HR per 2‐fold higher value 1.80 [95% CI 1.42–2.28], P < 0.001). The prognostic value of baseline NT‐proBNP in this cohort has been previously published (using standardized HRs). 9 Of note, baseline eGFR measurements were not predictive of the primary and secondary end point in these multivariable models (adjusted HR per 2‐fold higher value 1.00 [95% CI 0.58–1.72], P = 0.993 and 2.49 [95% CI 0.78–7.89], P = 0.123, respectively).

### The role of natriuretic peptides as biomarkers for guiding the management of chronic heart failure [^56a4bc25]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

The current standard treatment of chronic heart failure (HF) is based on clinical judgment, with the goal of achieving the maximally tolerated therapeutic program. The complexity of this approach may contribute to the well-established treatment gaps that exist in HF management; consequently, the risks for morbidity and mortality in this population remain extremely high. Alternative means are needed to improve the outcomes of patients with HF. Natriuretic peptides are biological markers for HF disease — its presence, severity, and prognosis — and show unique interactions with therapeutics known to have benefit in HF. Accordingly, interest has recently developed in "biomarker-guided" care for HF. This approach involves applying these assays to identify patients in need of therapy intensification and to provide an objective "monitor" of disease status. This review examines the biology of natriuretic peptides, discusses the rationale for their use in HF, and details the aggregate experience gained thus far in biomarker-guided care.

### Reduction in BNP levels with treatment of decompensated heart failure and future clinical events [^518fc231]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels correlate with outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF). We sought to compare the relationship between absolute and relative changes in BNP with future clinical events, and whether serial BNP measurements add prognostic information in patients treated for decompensated HF.

Methods and Results

In 203 patients treated for HF, increasing tertiles of BNP levels after treatment had a hazard ratio of 1.4 (1.1–1.7, P < .01) and increasing tertiles of percent reduction in BNP, had a hazard ratio of 0.7 (0.6–0.9, P = 0.005), respectively, for the combined end point of total mortality or readmission for HF. Higher baseline BNP levels did not decrease to lower BNP levels as often as lower BNP levels (P < .001). Follow-up BNP performed better in a model, incorporating age, ejection fraction, prior HF hospitalization, New York Heart Association Class, race, use of beta-blockers and renin-angiotensin axis inhibitors and renal insufficiency, than did baseline BNP or percent reduction in BNP. More BNP measurements other than the follow-up BNP did not improve the fit of the model further.

Conclusions

These results suggest that both lower absolute BNP levels and greater percentage reduction in BNP with treatment of decompensated HF are associated with better event-free survival. Advocating a threshold BNP to which patients should be treated may not be possible given that high BNP levels tend not to decrease to levels associated with better outcomes during the short period of treatment. More BNP measurements do not add prognostic information beyond that provided by a single BNP level after treatment.

### Natriuretic peptide-guided therapy in acute decompensated heart failure: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^3c619bd5]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Heart failure (HF) is a complex syndrome with high mortality and hospitalization rates. The management of HF is generally based on signs and symptoms (conventional or usual care), but medication adjustments can also be guided by biomarkers, specifically natriuretic peptides (NPs) — a strategy known as "NP‐guided therapy".

NPs, such as B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N‐terminal pro‐BNP (NT‐proBNP), are invaluable for diagnosing and prognosticating HF. They are potent predictors of mortality and HF hospitalization, irrespective of ejection fraction and HF etiology. BNP is an active neurohormone that counteracts the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system and sympathetic nervous system overactivity in HF, while NT‐proBNP is an inactive prohormone released from cardiomyocytes under wall stress.

However, despite the strong prognostic value of NPs, there is insufficient evidence and a lack of consensus on the routine use of serial BNP and NT‐proBNP measurements for guiding HF therapy or optimizing guideline‐directed medical therapy (GDMT) in chronic HF. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta‐analyses have produced conflicting results regarding the direct benefits of NP‐guided HF treatment on mortality and hospitalization rates. Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a high‐risk condition requiring prompt treatment. Due to rapid volume changes and elevated event rates, NP‐guided strategies may be especially useful in this setting. Considering this controversy, we performed an updated meta‐analysis of RCTs evaluating the NP‐guided therapy compared to usual care in patients with ADHF.

### State of the art: using natriuretic peptide levels in clinical practice [^3548ace5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2008). Low credibility.

Natriuretic peptide (NP) levels (B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal proBNP) are now widely used in clinical practice and cardiovascular research throughout the world and have been incorporated into most national and international cardiovascular guidelines for heart failure. The role of NP levels in state-of-the-art clinical practice is evolving rapidly. This paper reviews and highlights ten key messages to clinicians: 1) NP levels are quantitative plasma biomarkers of heart failure (HF). 2) NP levels are accurate in the diagnosis of HF. 3) NP levels may help risk stratify emergency department (ED) patients with regard to the need for hospital admission or direct ED discharge. 4) NP levels help improve patient management and reduce total treatment costs in patients with acute dyspnoea. 5) NP levels at the time of admission are powerful predictors of outcome in predicting death and re-hospitalisation in HF patients. 6) NP levels at discharge aid in risk stratification of the HF patient. 7) NP-guided therapy may improve morbidity and/or mortality in chronic HF. 8) The combination of NP levels together with symptoms, signs and weight gain assists in the assessment of clinical decompensation in HF. 9) NP levels can accelerate accurate diagnosis of heart failure presenting in primary care. 10) NP levels may be helpful to screen for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction in high-risk patients.

### Prognostic impact of repeated NT-proBNP measurements in patients With heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction [^3b05784b]. JACC: Heart Failure (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Although clinical studies have demonstrated the association between a single N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurement and clinical outcomes in chronic heart failure, the biomarker is frequently measured serially in clinical practice.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the added prognostic value of repeated NT-proBNP measurements compared with single measurements alone for chronic heart failure patients.

Methods

In the GUIDE-IT (Guiding Evidence Based Therapy Using Biomarker Intensified Treatment in Heart Failure) study, 894 study participants with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction were enrolled at 45 outpatient sites in the United States and Canada. Repeated NT-proBNP levels were measured over a 2-year study period. Associations between repeated NT-proBNP measurements and trial endpoints were assessed using a joint longitudinal and survival model.

Results

After adjustment for baseline covariates, each doubling of the baseline NT-proBNP level was associated with a HR of 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08–1.28; P = 0.0003) for the primary trial endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. Serial measurements increased the adjusted HR for the primary trial endpoint to 1.66 (95% CI: 1.50–1.84; P < 0.0001), and a similar increased risk was observed across secondary trial endpoints. In joint modeling, an increase in NT-proBNP occurred weeks before the onset of adjudicated events.

Conclusions

Repeated NT-proBNP measurements are a strong predictor of outcomes in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with an increase in concentration occurring well before event onset. These results may support routine NT-proBNP monitoring to assist in clinical decision making.
