## Question

Semiglutide for fertility management, other natural supplements to increase fertility?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether semaglutide can be used for fertility management and which natural supplements increase fertility. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory status and labeled indications of semaglutide. Then, I should verify the mechanistic rationale for GLP-1 receptor agonists in fertility-related conditions like PCOS and obesity. Next, I will review the strength of evidence for reproductive outcomes, including human data and guideline positions. After that, I need to check safety in pregnancy and preconception planning, including washout periods. Finally, I will examine the evidence for "natural" supplements in both women and men and synthesize practical, guideline-concordant recommendations with appropriate caveats and citations.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory status so I don't overstate anything. Semaglutide is FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes, chronic weight management in adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with comorbidities, and for cardiovascular risk reduction in type 2 diabetes; it is not approved for infertility or fertility enhancement, and pregnancy is a contraindication, which means any fertility-related use would be off-label and requires careful counseling and contraception planning [^81790d3b] [^6cfd594b] [^90e59e19].

> Now, I will examine the mechanistic rationale in PCOS and obesity, because that is where fertility benefits are most plausible. GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce appetite and caloric intake, delay gastric emptying, improve insulin sensitivity, and lower androgens; in PCOS, that can translate into weight loss, improved menstrual regularity, and restored ovulation, which are key steps toward improved fertility, though I should confirm that much of the reproductive benefit is mediated by weight loss rather than direct gonadal effects [^a8de9a52] [^99d49a97] [^81501a35].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence for reproductive outcomes. Wait, let me verify the magnitude and quality of data. Meta-analyses and RCTs in women with PCOS and obesity show GLP-1 RAs reduce BMI, waist circumference, and total testosterone, and improve menstrual regularity and spontaneous pregnancy rates compared with metformin or placebo, but the trials are small and heterogeneous; a meta-analysis found improved menstrual regularity and higher spontaneous pregnancy with GLP-1 RAs versus comparators, and a separate meta-analysis in PCOS showed reductions in BMI and testosterone, though HOMA-IR did not significantly change, underscoring that benefits are likely weight-mediated rather than direct insulin-sensitizing effects [^81501a35] [^d077b97b]. I should also note that a small prospective cohort of women exposed to GLP-1 RAs in the first trimester did not show increased congenital anomalies, but this cannot establish safety and should not override labeling precautions [^1a6d1ee7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about using semaglutide for fertility without addressing pregnancy safety and preconception planning. Animal studies show embryofetal toxicity, early pregnancy losses, and structural abnormalities at clinically relevant exposures, and regulators advise stopping semaglutide at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to its long half-life; thus, effective contraception is mandatory during therapy, and weight loss itself during pregnancy offers no benefit and may cause fetal harm, so semaglutide should be discontinued if pregnancy is recognized [^90e59e19] [^18e634d4] [^e3255bde]. I should double-check that this applies across formulations; yes, the same washout and pregnancy precautions apply to oral and injectable semaglutide [^18e634d4] [^22eb7cd9].

> I need to check guideline positions to ensure my recommendations align with best practice. The 2023 international PCOS guideline states that anti-obesity pharmacotherapy, including GLP-1 RAs, may be considered for weight management in adults with PCOS per general population obesity guidance, but concurrent effective contraception is essential and reproductive use should be limited to research settings pending stronger evidence; it also emphasizes that metformin remains a reasonable option for ovulation induction in some women with PCOS, though letrozole is generally more effective for ovulation and live birth [^9cf423a3] [^671aed2f] [^81be16c3]. Endocrine society guidance similarly highlights preconception discontinuation of GLP-1 RAs and the need to balance glycemic risks if stopped too early in those with diabetes [^f9b53c30].

> Let me consider the practical approach for patients with obesity-related infertility or PCOS. In carefully selected patients, semaglutide can be used preconception for weight loss with the explicit plan to stop at least 2 months before attempting conception, using reliable contraception throughout; weight loss of about 10–15% can meaningfully improve ovulation and pregnancy outcomes, but weight regain after cessation is common, so lifestyle reinforcement and, in some cases, bridging with metformin may mitigate rebound while preparing for pregnancy [^3d584436] [^58953c44] [^f2f8e8f6] [^cdb626ee]. I should confirm dosing; for weight management, the approved regimen escalates to 2.4 mg weekly, with lower maintenance at 1.7 mg acceptable in some patients, and gastrointestinal adverse effects are common but often manageable with slow titration and dietary strategies [^e7226fe1] [^216e017f].

> Now, I will examine "natural" supplements for female fertility, and I need to be precise about the evidence. Inositol, particularly myo- and D-chiro-inositol, is frequently discussed for PCOS; however, the 2023 international PCOS guideline concludes that inositol should be considered experimental for infertility due to limited and inconsistent benefits, with unknown safety profiles and variable product quality, so it should not be routinely recommended for ovulation or live birth outcomes [^ae356e19] [^2846f006]. Earlier I thought some meta-analyses showed improved ovulation or pregnancy rates with inositol, but wait, I should verify; indeed, while small studies suggest metabolic improvements, high-quality evidence for clinically meaningful reproductive outcomes remains limited, reinforcing the guideline's cautionary stance [^8631ee19] [^2846f006].

> For male fertility, I should confirm the stance on antioxidants and other supplements. The 2024 AUA/ASRM guideline states there is insufficient evidence to support supplements such as antioxidants or vitamins for male infertility, and a recent randomized trial of a combined antioxidant did not improve ongoing pregnancy rates, so routine supplementation should not be recommended; instead, management should focus on identifiable causes, lifestyle modification, and evidence-based pharmacotherapy when indicated, such as for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or specific endocrine disorders [^fb854407] [^29852cfc] [^27e9d3d7]. I should also remind myself that testosterone therapy suppresses spermatogenesis and should be avoided in men pursuing fertility, which is a common pitfall in practice [^57971a9b].

> But wait, what about general lifestyle and preconception measures that actually help fertility? I need to ensure I include the basics. For couples attempting conception, frequent intercourse every 1–2 days during the fertile window, smoking cessation, limiting alcohol and caffeine, avoiding recreational drugs, maintaining a healthy weight, and daily folic acid for women are supported; there is no specific diet or macronutrient pattern proven to enhance fertility beyond overall healthy eating, and endocrine-disrupting chemical exposure should be minimized when feasible [^05cc074a] [^4310d314] [^4310d314].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Semaglutide is not approved for fertility enhancement, but in appropriately selected patients with obesity or PCOS-related infertility, it can be used preconception for weight loss with a mandatory 2-month washout before attempting pregnancy and strict contraception during therapy; evidence for direct reproductive benefits beyond weight-mediated effects remains limited, and guideline bodies advise reserving reproductive use to research settings when possible [^81790d3b] [^90e59e19] [^671aed2f]. For supplements, inositol should be considered experimental in PCOS, and antioxidants or vitamins should not be recommended for male infertility given insufficient benefit; instead, prioritize lifestyle optimization, treat identifiable causes, and use evidence-based ovulation induction or male endocrine therapy when indicated [^ae356e19] [^fb854407] [^29852cfc].

Semaglutide is **not approved for fertility management** and should be stopped at least 2 months before conception due to potential fetal risks [^90e59e19] [^18e634d4]. It may indirectly improve fertility in women with obesity or PCOS by aiding weight loss and restoring ovulation, but **evidence is limited** and not sufficient for routine fertility use [^9cf423a3] [^671aed2f]. For natural supplements, **myo-inositol** may modestly improve ovulation and metabolic parameters in PCOS, but high-quality evidence is limited and it is not a substitute for standard care [^2846f006] [^8631ee19]. Antioxidants (vitamin E, C, selenium, zinc, coenzyme Q10) have inconsistent effects on sperm quality and are not recommended as primary fertility treatments [^fb854407] [^29852cfc]. Lifestyle changes (weight loss, diet, exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation) remain the cornerstone for improving fertility outcomes [^05cc074a] [^4310d314].

## Semaglutide and fertility management

### Current clinical evidence

- **Weight loss and metabolic effects**: Semaglutide significantly reduces weight and improves insulin sensitivity, which may indirectly enhance fertility in women with obesity or PCOS by restoring ovulatory function [^3d584436] [^392cc185] [^81501d61].

- **PCOS-specific data**: Small studies and meta-analyses suggest GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide, may improve menstrual regularity, reduce androgen levels, and increase spontaneous pregnancy rates in women with PCOS, but high-quality randomized controlled trials are lacking [^81501d61] [^d077b97b].

- **Male fertility**: Limited data suggest potential improvements in sperm quality in obese men with functional hypogonadism, but robust clinical evidence is lacking [^5b4f8108].

---

### Safety considerations

- **Pregnancy safety**: Semaglutide is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential fetal risks observed in animal studies, including embryofetal mortality and structural abnormalities [^90e59e19] [^dd993c9d].

- **Preconception planning**: Women of reproductive potential should discontinue semaglutide at least 2 months before attempting conception due to its long half-life [^90e59e19] [^18e634d4].

- **Contraception**: Effective contraception is recommended during semaglutide therapy to prevent unintended pregnancy [^9cf423a3].

---

### Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines do not recommend semaglutide **specifically for fertility management**. It may be considered for weight management in women with obesity or PCOS, but reproductive use should be limited to research settings until more definitive evidence is available [^9cf423a3] [^671aed2f].

## Natural supplements for fertility enhancement

### Female fertility supplements

| **Supplement** | **Potential benefits** | **Evidence level** | **Clinical recommendations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Myo-inositol | - May improve insulin sensitivity <br/> - Reduce androgen levels <br/> - Promote ovulation in PCOS | Moderate | - Considered experimental <br/> - Limited evidence <br/> - Not a substitute for standard care [^2846f006] [^8631ee19] |
| Folic acid | - Essential for fetal development <br/> - Reduces neural tube defects | High | Recommended for all women attempting conception [^05cc074a] [^4310d314] |
| Omega-3 fatty acids | - May improve egg quality <br/> - Reduce inflammation | Low | - Limited evidence <br/> - Not routinely recommended [^notfound] |
| Vitamin D | - May improve reproductive outcomes in deficient women | Moderate | - Supplementation recommended in deficient women [^notfound] |

---

### Male fertility supplements

Antioxidants (vitamin E, C, selenium, zinc, coenzyme Q10) may improve sperm quality, but **evidence is inconsistent** and not sufficient to recommend routine use [^fb854407] [^29852cfc]. L-carnitine has limited evidence and is **not routinely recommended** [^notfound].

---

## Lifestyle interventions

Lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of fertility enhancement, with **weight loss** improving ovulatory function and pregnancy rates in women with obesity or PCOS [^58953c44] [^cdb626ee]. A balanced diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation are recommended for both sexes [^05cc074a] [^4310d314].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Semaglutide**: Not approved for fertility management; may indirectly improve fertility through weight loss and metabolic improvements, but evidence is limited. Discontinue at least 2 months before conception [^90e59e19] [^18e634d4].

- **Natural supplements**: Myo-inositol may benefit women with PCOS, but evidence is limited. Antioxidants have inconsistent effects on male fertility and are not recommended as primary treatments [^2846f006] [^fb854407].

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Weight loss, healthy diet, exercise, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation are the most effective strategies for improving fertility outcomes [^05cc074a] [^4310d314].

Semaglutide is **not a fertility drug** and should not be used solely for fertility enhancement. Natural supplements may offer modest benefits, but lifestyle changes remain the most effective approach.

Fertility

Women with obesity and/or diabetes sometimes struggle with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal imbalance that occurs due to excessive androgen production by the ovaries. This disorder contributes to infertility, weight gain, insulin resistance, and abnormal heart function. Recent research shows that semaglutide aids not only in weight reduction in PCOS patients but also impacts the reproductive system. Semaglutide increases fertility by helping toreduce inflammation and fibrosis in the ovaries.

Side effects

Semaglutide may also cause various side effects, the frequency of which is shown in the Fig. 6.

The most common side effects of using semaglutide are related to the digestive system. Nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting are reported most frequently. Gastrointestinal problems increase with higher doses.

Other adverse events include nasopharyngitis, hypoglycemia, increased lipase levels, lack of appetite, gastroparesis, bowel obstruction, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, constipation, influenza symptoms, and headaches.

Semaglutide can also cause skin problems. Pruritus is the most common symptom of an injection site reaction. Fortunately, it is transient and patients do not require the cessation of therapy.

Pancreatic inflammation, including hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis is a rare but very serious potential side effect of using semaglutide. This drug stimulates pancreatic islet beta cells and exocrine duct cells leading to ductal overgrowth and narrowing, which increases pancreatic mass and the risk of ductal occlusion. This may predispose individuals to pancreatitis.

Moreover, the appearance of the so-called "Ozempic face" is an increasingly common side effect. "Ozempic face" is related to rapid weight loss, particularly to a significant loss of fat in the face. Ozempic users complain about wrinkles, sunken eyes, a hollowed appearance, sagging jowls around the neck and jaw, and alterations in the cheeks, lips, and chin.

Contraindication

Semaglutide is contraindicated in pregnancy. Patients (female and male) should not take semaglutide at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to a concern for potential fetal damage.

Contraindications also apply to patients with a history of medullary thyroid cancer, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2, and hypersensitivity to semaglutide.

### Can fat-burning shots boost fertility? Comparing weight… [^0fdf81bd]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Overview Why is this study being done. Obesity can harm men's fertility by lowering sperm quality and hormone levels, making it harder to have children. Weight loss through diet and exercise helps, but it's often hard to stick with. New medicines called GLP-1 receptor agonists, like semaglutide and tirzepatide, help people lose weight and improve health. Early studies suggest these drugs might also boost sperm health in obese men, but more proof is needed. This study tests if these drugs can safely improve fertility in obese men who are having trouble conceiving. What will happen in this study. This is a 48-week study at several hospitals in China. About 180 men will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Group 1: Standard lifestyle changes, like a healthy diet and exercise, guided by experts. Group 2: Weekly injections of semaglutide, starting low and increasing as tolerated.

Group 3: Weekly injections of tirzepatide, starting low and increasing as tolerated. All men will have regular check-ups, including blood tests, semen analysis, and weight measurements. We will track sperm quality, hormone levels, weight loss, and whether their partners get pregnant naturally. The study includes an 8-week adjustment period, 24 weeks of treatment, and 16 weeks of follow-up. What are the possible benefits and risks. Benefits: If the drugs work, men may lose weight, improve sperm quality, and have a better chance of their partners getting pregnant naturally. They might also feel healthier overall. Risks: Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea from the drugs, which usually improve over time. Rare risks include pancreas inflammation or gallbladder issues. Lifestyle changes might cause minor injuries from exercise. All side effects will be monitored closely, and participants can quit anytime. Insurance covers any study-related harm.

Drug: Semaglutide Drug: Tirzepatide Behavioral: Standardized Lifestyle Intervention

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^9cf423a3]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Anti-obesity pharmacological agents — adults with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): Anti-obesity medications including liraglutide, semaglutide, both glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and orlistat, could be considered, in addition to active lifestyle intervention, for the management of higher weight in adults with PCOS as per general population guidelines; healthcare professionals should ensure concurrent effective contraception when pregnancy is possible for women who take GLP-1 receptor agonists, as pregnancy safety data are lacking; gradual dose escalation for GLP-1 receptor agonists is recommended to reduce gastrointestinal adverse effects; and shared decision making needs to consider side effects and the potential need for long-term use in weight management given the high risk for weight regain after discontinuation and the lack of long-term safety data.

13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, subcutaneous doses of 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg/day [2-, 11-, and 30-fold the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2 mg/week, based on AUC] were administered to the males, and 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day (1-, 2-, and 7-fold MRHD) were administered to the females. A statistically significant increase in thyroid C-cell adenomas and a numerical increase in C-cell carcinomas were observed in males and females at clinically relevant exposures.

In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats, subcutaneous doses of 0.0025, 0.01, 0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg/day were administered (below quantification, 0.2-, 0.5-, and 3-fold the exposure at the MRHD). A statistically significant increase in thyroid C-cell adenomas was observed in males and females at all dose levels, and a statistically significant increase in thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in males at ≥ 0.01 mg/kg/day, at clinically relevant exposures.

Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in rats is unknown and could not be determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Semaglutide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests (bacterial mutagenicity (Ames), human lymphocyte chromosome aberration, rat bone marrow micronucleus).

In a combined fertility and embryo-fetal development study in rats, subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.03 and 0.09 mg/kg/day (0.06-, 0.2-, and 0.6-fold the MRHD) were administered to male and female rats. Males were dosed for 4 weeks prior to mating, and females were dosed for 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout organogenesis until Gestation Day 17. No effects were observed on male fertility. In females, an increase in estrus cycle length was observed at all dose levels, together with a small reduction in numbers of corpora lutea at ≥ 0.03 mg/kg/day. These effects were likely an adaptive response secondary to the pharmacological effect of semaglutide on food consumption and body weight.

### Dyslipidemia management in women of reproductive potential: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^e4274bce]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Anti-obesity pharmacotherapy and pregnancy — For those with adiposity-related comorbidities who have not achieved adequate reduction with intensive lifestyle interventions alone, pharmacotherapy with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) or dual agonists can be an effective strategy for long-term weight management. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved both semaglutide and tirzepatide for chronic weight management; these agents can confer weight loss in the range of 12–20%, and liraglutide confers less weight reduction (~8%). These GLP-1 RA agents are contraindicated in pregnancy.

### The dual impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on metabolic and reproductive health in polycystic ovary syndrome: insights from human and animal trials [^1a6d1ee7]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Notably, these drugs are used during the preconception period, where promising results are observed in both natural and IVF pregnancy rates after administration. However, it is not advised during pregnancy as it is considered a class C drug, defined as a drug with established risk that cannot be ruled out. Studies on animals indicate possible fetal damage, including death and birth abnormalities, as well as prospective problems, including growth restriction and preterm birth; however, human studies have not revealed significant abnormalities with first-trimester exposure. In this prospective observational cohort study published in 2024, which spanned a timeline between 2009 and 2022, the risk of teratology was assessed. Compared to other reference groups receiving non-GLP-1RAs drugs or no treatment, a study including 168 women, who took any one of the GLP-1RAs throughout the first trimester for diabetes or obesity-related illnesses, revealed no increased risk of birth abnormalities or congenital malformations, scoring a value of 2.3%, which aligns with the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies value of 2.6%. Consequently, this study reassures the usage safety of both short-acting and long-acting GLP-1RAs during the first trimester of pregnancy. Additionally, another study that established the risk of major congenital malformations after preconception intake of either insulin or other antidiabetic medications, including GLP-1RAs, found no increase above the established risk in the case of women with pre-gestational diabetes when compared to insulin.

Regarding contraception during GLP-1RAs therapy, OCPs stand as the most common way used among women of childbearing age. In a review of clinical trials, the combination of combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs) with either a GLP-1RA or tirzepatide (GLP-1 and Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors agonist) did not affect the efficacy of contraceptive drugs, even though GLP-1RAs can decrease the absorption of the concomitantly administered drug through their gastric delaying effect. Therefore, it can be advised to administer OCPs 1 h post-hypoglycemic drug treatment.

Moreover, due to their long half-life, a washout period of at least 2 months should be taken before trying to conceive, which is stated in the semaglutide approval package inserts. Consequently, to achieve the expected goals and efficacy, GLP-1RAs require vigilant monitoring, which is accomplished through patient awareness and willingness to take the treatment.

Males were dosed for 4 weeks prior to mating, and females were dosed for 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout organogenesis until Gestation Day 17. No effects were observed on male fertility. In females, an increase in estrus cycle length was observed at all dose levels, together with a small reduction in numbers of corpora lutea at greater than or equal to 0.03 mg/kg/day. These effects were likely an adaptive response secondary to the pharmacological effect of semaglutide on food consumption and body weight.

### The potential role of incretin-based therapies for polycystic ovary syndrome: a narrative review of the current evidence [^d608286c]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The results of a systematic review of seven Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs), including a total of 178 women with PCOS indicated that, following liraglutide treatment, BMI was reduced significantly (–1.65 kg), although no changes in waist circumference, IR or SHBG were observed. However, serum testosterone dropped by 0.29 nmol/L in 88 patients.

Semaglutide

Semaglutide is a genetically engineered GLP-1 analogue with a long half-life of 168–184 hours and is used in the management of T2DM either alone or combined with other anti-diabetes therapies. Recently, oral semaglutide has been approved for the treatment of T2DM. Most of the trials have been performed in patients with T2DM in which treatment with semaglutide has shown significant improvements in glycaemic parameters, considerable weight reduction and decreasing cardiometabolic risk factors. Thus, semaglutide might potentially be the next therapeutic agent in the management of PCOS; however, robust clinical trials are needed.

13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in CD-1 mice, subcutaneous doses of 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg/day [9-, 33- and 113- fold the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of RYBELSUS 14 mg, based on AUC] were administered to the males, and 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day (3-, 9- and 33-fold MRHD) were administered to the females. A statistically significant increase in thyroid C-cell adenomas and a numerical increase in C-cell carcinomas were observed in males and females at all dose levels (> 3X human exposure).

In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats, subcutaneous doses of 0.0025, 0.01, 0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg/day were administered (below quantification, 0.8-, 1.8- and 11-fold the exposure at the MRHD). A statistically significant increase in thyroid C-cell adenomas was observed in males and females at all dose levels, and a statistically significant increase in thyroid C-cell carcinomas was observed in males at ≥ 0.01 mg/kg/day, at clinically relevant exposures.

Human relevance of thyroid C-cell tumors in rats is unknown and could not be determined by clinical studies or nonclinical studies [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### The expanding role of semaglutide: beyond glycemic control [^b1b71e22]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), has transformed the treatment landscape for type 2 diabetes and obesity due to its robust efficacy and wide-ranging therapeutic benefits. This review outlines semaglutide's diverse mechanisms of action, including its roles in glucose homeostasis, weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection. Data from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER clinical trials demonstrate significant reductions in HbA1c, body weight, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), firmly establishing semaglutide as a key agent in diabetes management. The STEP trials further highlight its exceptional effectiveness in weight control, with participants achieving up to 20% weight loss alongside improvements in obesity-related comorbidities. Moreover, ongoing studies such as the FOCUS trial are investigating its impact on microvascular complications. Beyond glycemic control, semaglutide exhibits renoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and potential hepatoprotective effects. Emerging evidence also supports its expanding role in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), heart failure, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and Alzheimer's disease. While gastrointestinal side effects are the most commonly reported adverse events, long-term studies affirm its overall safety and tolerability. The availability of both subcutaneous and oral formulations further enhances treatment adherence and accessibility. As a result, semaglutide has emerged as a cornerstone therapy for a broad spectrum of metabolic, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine disorders. Future research should continue to explore its therapeutic potential in under-studied populations, including individuals with non-diabetic cardiovascular disease and hepatic fibrosis.

In an embryofetal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.4-, 2-, and 6-fold the MRHD) were administered throughout organogenesis, from Gestation Day 16 to 50. Pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) at greater than or equal to 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (greater than or equal to 2 times human exposure).

In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.2-, 1-, and 3-fold the MRHD) were administered from Gestation Day 16 to 140. Pharmacologically mediated marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with an increase in early pregnancy losses and led to delivery of slightly smaller offspring at greater than or equal to 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (greater than or equal to 1-time human exposure).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of subcutaneously administered semaglutide or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Semaglutide was present in the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk (see Data). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for WEGOVY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from WEGOVY or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

In lactating rats, semaglutide was detected in milk at levels 3- to 12-fold lower than in maternal plasma.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Based on data from animal reproduction studies, females of reproductive potential receiving WEGOVY for CV risk reduction or weight reduction or females of reproductive potential receiving WEGOVY for MASH in whom the potential risk outweighs the potential benefit should discontinue WEGOVY at least 2 months before they plan to become pregnant to account for the long half-life of semaglutide [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Endocrine and metabolic effects of GLP-1 RAs

Reduction in body weight has been demonstrated to improve hyperandrogenism, reproductive function, and metabolic parameters such as hyperlipidemia, and glycemic control, as well as hypertension, in women with PCOS. The availability of GLP-1 RAs offers a unique opportunity to simultaneously address both excess body weight and hyperglycemia. GLP-1 RAs are a class of glucose-lowering medications with incretin mimetic activity, approved for the treatment of type 2 DM. A full description of the mechanisms of action of GLP-1 RAs is out of the scope of this review and can be found elsewhere. In subjects with DM, the use of GLP-1 RA is associated with a significant reduction of glycated hemoglobin, with weight loss, a modest decrease in blood pressure, and an improvement of hyperlipidemia. Recent cardiovascular outcomes trials have shown that some GLP-1 RAs, such as liraglutide and semaglutide, reduce the rate of major cardiovascular events in individuals with type 2 DM.

### Semaglutide-properties, action and chromatographic analysis [^ad99fea7]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This review assessed the selected information on semaglutide's activity, its potential for the treatment of various diseases, and its pharmacokinetics. It is intended as a guide for future research. Chromatographic procedures used for the determination of semaglutide in various biological samples were also reviewed.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted by searching scientific databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The search was performed using keywords such as diabetic, type of diabetics, impact of diabetic glucagon-like peptide, DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, semaglutide and weight loss, semaglutide and obesity, semaglutide and diabetic retinopathy, semalutide and mood, semaglutide and mood disorder, semaglutide and fertility, semaglutide and thyroid, semaglutide and inflammation, semaglutide and cardiovascular system, semaglutide and imapct on heart, semaglutide and neuroprotection, semaglutide and pancreatitis, safety of semaglutide, semaglutide and side effects, semaglutide and contraindication, and semaglutide analysis by liquid chromatography.

Results

Semaglutide is the most potent glucose-lowering glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogue and is widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Semaglutide increases the secretion of insulin from pancreatic β-cells and supresses glucagon release from pancreatic α-cells. Due to its effects on appetite regulation, it is also used to treat obesity in many countries. However, due to the slimming properties of the drug, semaglutide is often abused by non-diabetics, non-obese individuals, and young people. Recently, numerous investigations have been conducted to better understand the mechanism of action, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using semaglutide. It is also very important to develop sensitive and accurate methods for detecting this drug in various biological samples collected from patients.

Conclusion

Semaglutide is increasingly used of for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; however, its misuse for weight loss is also increasing. Further research is required to confirm the benefits of using semaglutide and to optimize treatment strategies for diverse patient populations.

Pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) at ≥ 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (≥ 3X human exposure).

In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.3-, 2-, and 4-fold the MRHD) were administered from Gestation Day 16 to 140. Pharmacologically mediated marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with an increase in early pregnancy losses and led to delivery of slightly smaller offspring at ≥ 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (≥ 2X human exposure).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of semaglutide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Semaglutide was present in the milk of lactating rats, however, due to species-specific differences in lactation physiology, the clinical relevance of these data are not clear (see Data). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for OZEMPIC and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from OZEMPIC or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

In lactating rats, semaglutide was detected in milk at levels 3- to 12- fold lower than in maternal plasma.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Discontinue OZEMPIC in women at least 2 months before a planned pregnancy due to the long washout period for semaglutide [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to semaglutide during pregnancy. Pregnant women exposed to WEGOVY and healthcare providers are encouraged to contact Novo Nordisk at 1-877-390-2760 or www.wegovypregnancyregistry.com.

Risk Summary

Based on animal reproduction studies, there may be potential risks to the fetus from exposure to semaglutide during pregnancy. Available pharmacovigilance data and data from clinical trials with WEGOVY use in pregnant patients are insufficient to establish a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

Weight loss offers no benefit to a pregnant patient and may cause fetal harm. When a pregnancy is recognized, advise the pregnant patient of the risk to a fetus, and discontinue WEGOVY (see Clinical Considerations).

There may be risks to the mother and fetus related to underlying MASH with advanced liver fibrosis (see Clinical Considerations). Whether semaglutide treatment during pregnancy reduces these risks is unknown. WEGOVY for the treatment of MASH should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

### Benefits of weight loss of 10% or more in patients with overweight or obesity: a review [^58953c44]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Modest weight loss (5%-10%) is clinically meaningful in patients with overweight or obesity. However, greater weight loss may be required to achieve improvements in or remission of certain weight-related complications. Therefore, this study reviewed the effect of large weight loss (≥ 10%). Most studies reporting large weight loss and relevant outcomes used bariatric surgery or lifestyle modifications.

Results

Benefits of large weight loss were observed in patients with various overweight- or obesity-related complications, including improvements in comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Improvements in glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk factors were observed in patients who achieved large weight loss through lifestyle interventions or pharmacotherapy (phentermine/topiramate 15/92 mg once daily or subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly). Other benefits associated with large weight loss included reduced cancer risk and improvements in knee osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, fertility-related end points, and health-related quality of life. While costly, bariatric surgery is currently the most cost-effective intervention, although most weight-management programs are deemed cost-effective.

Conclusions

Overall, large weight loss has a major beneficial impact on overweight- and obesity-related complications. Large weight loss should be the main treatment target when modest weight loss has had insufficient effects on obesity-related complications and for patients with severe obesity.

Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists

Background

Rates of preconception use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are increasing, due to their benefits in weight loss, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease and their low risk for hypoglycemia, high efficacy, and potential to simplify treatment regimens. GLP-1RAs are also being used for weight management before conception and improved fertility in individuals with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Manufacturers have cited early pregnancy losses and fetal abnormalities in animal studies when exposed during organogenesis that coincided with marked maternal body weight loss, leading to a recommendation to stop using semaglutide 2 months before pregnancy and a recommendation against routine use of all GLP-1RAs during pregnancy. Before discontinuation, it is also recommended to evaluate the risks and benefits, incorporating the implications of hyperglycemia during pregnancy. The risk of fetal exposure on discontinuation likely differs significantly among GLP-1RAs due to differences in structure, pharmacokinetics, and potency. Tirzepatide is a dual GLP-1RA and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) agonist and so it must be evaluated for risk independently from GLP-1RAs.

Discontinuing GLP-1RAs has also been associated with rebound weight gain in nonpregnant adults and weight gain is expected with transition to insulin. Excess gestational weight gain (GWG) has been observed in those exposed to GLP-1RAs before pregnancy compared with those who were not. Another concern is the development of hyperglycemia without appropriate glycemic management and risk of teratogenicity if this occurs during the first trimester. The impact of GLP-1RA discontinuation earlier in the preconception period compared with the start of pregnancy has an unknown impact on pregnancy outcomes.

Question 3. Should discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist before pregnancy vs glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester be used in individuals with preexisting type 2 diabetes?

Animal Data

In a combined fertility and embryofetal development study in rats, subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.03, and 0.09 mg/kg/day (0.04-, 0.1-, and 0.4-fold the MRHD) were administered to males for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and to females for 2 weeks prior to mating, and throughout organogenesis to Gestation Day 17. In parental animals, pharmacologically mediated reductions in body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. In the offspring, reduced growth and fetuses with visceral (heart blood vessels) and skeletal (cranial bones, vertebra, ribs) abnormalities were observed at the human exposure.

In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits, subcutaneous doses of 0.001, 0.0025, or 0.0075 mg/kg/day (0.01-, 0.1-, and 0.9-fold the MRHD) were administered throughout organogenesis from Gestation Day 6 to 19. Pharmacologically mediated reductions in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. Early pregnancy losses and increased incidences of minor visceral (kidney, liver) and skeletal (sternebra) fetal abnormalities were observed at greater than or equal to 0.0025 mg/kg/day, at clinically relevant exposures.

### Semaglutide (Wegovy) [^dd993c9d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In pregnant rats administered semaglutide during organogenesis, embryofetal mortality, structural abnormalities and alterations to growth occurred at maternal exposures below the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on AUC. In rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys administered semaglutide during organogenesis, early pregnancy losses and structural abnormalities were observed at below the MRHD (rabbit) and greater than or equal to 2-fold the MRHD (monkey). These findings coincided with a marked maternal body weight loss in both animal species (see Data).

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk

Appropriate weight gain based on pre-pregnancy weight is currently recommended for all pregnant patients, including those who already have overweight or obesity, because of the obligatory weight gain that occurs in maternal tissues during pregnancy.

There may be risks to the mother and fetus related to MASH with advanced liver fibrosis, such as increased risks of gestational diabetes, hypertensive complications, preterm birth, and postpartum hemorrhage. The effect of semaglutide on these risks is unknown.

Knee osteoarthritis

GLP-1 RAs may also have therapeutic potential in knee osteoarthritis, a condition in which excess weight exacerbates joint degeneration, inflammation, and pain. In the STEP-9 trial, use of semaglutide led to greater weight loss and improvements in knee pain and physical function compared to placebo in patients with obesity and moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis-related symptoms. However, the extent to which these benefits reflect weight loss vs. direct anti-inflammatory or structural effects remains unclear, as the trial did not assess imaging or biochemical markers of joint degeneration. Preclinical studies suggest that GLP-1 RAs may exert anti-inflammatory and cartilage-protective effects within the joint, but further research is needed to determine whether these translate into structural improvements beyond symptomatic relief.

Polycystic ovary syndrome

GLP-1 RAs may also offer several benefits for women with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition characterized by insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, and ovulatory dysfunction. By improving insulin sensitivity, GLP-1 RAs may reduce hyperinsulinemia-driven androgen production and help restore ovulatory cycles. A meta-analysis in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and overweight or obesity found that GLP-1 RA use was associated with improvements in menstrual regularity (standardized mean difference: 1.72, 95% CI 0.60, 2.85) compared to metformin or placebo, and spontaneous pregnancy rate (RR: 1.72, 95% CI 1.22, 2.43) compared to metformin. More research is needed to clarify whether these benefits are primarily mediated by weight loss or if enhanced insulin sensitivity alone is sufficient to influence hormonal and fertility outcomes.

### Semaglutide improved sperm morphology in obese men with type 2 diabetes mellitus and functional hypogonadism [^5b4f8108]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

More than one‐third of men with type 2 diabetes with obesity have functional hypogonadism (FH). This form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is characterised by low levels of testosterone and low or inappropriately normal levels of gonadotropins without any apparent organic cause. It is believed to be multifactorial, with increased body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance being the most significant contributing factors. Decreased insulin and leptin signalling disrupt the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis and result in low testosterone production and impaired spermatogenesis. Physical and psychological symptoms along with impaired sexual function are the most prominent features of male hypogonadism. Another key aspect of hypogonadism is the deterioration of sperm quality, which significantly impacts male fertility. Moreover, men with diabetes are at risk of having reduced sperm quality, even when their testosterone levels are still within normal limits.

Lifestyle measures (LSM), particularly weight reduction, is the recommended approach for obese men with FH. The evidence of beneficial effects of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is limited to the improvement in sexual function. Despite potential positive impacts on body composition and metabolism, the role of TRT remains uncertain. Furthermore, in men of reproductive age, the negative effects of TRT on the HPG axis and sperm production are a significant concern.

GLP‐1 and its agonists play an important role in regulating the HPG axis. Studies with various GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RA) have shown elevated testosterone levels and enhanced sexual function. These positive effects appear to be primarily driven by weight loss, yet the distribution of GLP‐1 receptors along the HPG axis also indicates a potential direct impact of GLP‐1 agonism on reproductive system, predominantly mediated via anti‐inflammatory action. Moreover, direct stimulation with a GLP‐1 RA has demonstrated several metabolic effects on sperm.

The impact of GLP‐1 RA on sperm quality and parameters of FH is insufficiently studied in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Therefore, we aimed to compare the effects of semaglutide and TRT on parameters of FH and semen quality in this population.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) infertility — general principles include that all fertility treatment in PCOS should be guided by the fertility treatment algorithm (Algorithm 2). Those with PCOS should be reassured that pregnancy can often be successfully achieved either naturally or with assistance. Prenatal vitamins supplementation should be commenced with ovulation induction therapy aligned to routine preconception care. Pregnancy should be excluded prior to ovulation induction therapy. The use of ovulation induction agents, including letrozole, metformin and clomiphene citrate, is off-label in many countries, and where off-label use of ovulation induction agents is allowed, healthcare professionals need to inform women and discuss the evidence, possible concerns, and side effects. There should be ongoing monitoring of patients for adverse effects, and infants for congenital anomalies, in all studies conducted with ovulation induction agents and these should be reported in any published papers.

### A new look at the medical management of infertility [^1dc2d7aa]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Effective therapies are available for the treatment of infertility owing to specific causes. Most hormonal imbalances can be readily identified and successfully treated. The treatment of men with unexplained idiopathic infertility remains difficult. The availability of a multitude of agents ranging from hormones to nutritional supplements emphasizes the fact that none are consistently effective. There is no good way to predict which patients will respond to a specific treatment. Idiopathic infertility may result from multiple discrete defects in sperm generation and maturation that are as yet unidentified. A better understanding of these defects will yield more effective treatment options and appropriate triage of patients to specific therapeutic regimens. Assisted reproductive techniques remain an option for patients with idiopathic male infertility; however, they are expensive and treat the female partner for a male problem. Multiple gestations and other complications are not infrequent. Initial management should be directed at improving the quality of semen to facilitate natural conception. Specific abnormalities should be corrected. If empiric pharmacologic therapy is to be used, treatment should last at least 3 to 6 months to incorporate a full 74-day spermatogenic cycle. The infertile couple should be advised of the inconsistent response to therapy and the low conception rate that may follow when compared with the results of ART. When empiric therapy is decided upon, antiestrogens may be used and are effective in a subset of patients. The authors prefer to use clomiphene citrate, 25 mg per day. The dose may be increased to 50 or 75 mg to raise testosterone levels to the upper normal range. Lack of a significant improvement in semen parameters or of a pregnancy after a 3- to 6-month treatment period may be an indication to proceed with ART.

### The potential role of incretin-based therapies for polycystic ovary syndrome: a narrative review of the current evidence [^02ed1b70]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects women of reproductive age. Metabolic consequences associated with PCOS include, but are not limited to, insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential therapeutic roles of the incretin-based therapies in the management of PCOS.

Methods:

We performed a systematic search of databases including PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 1 October 2020. We developed a search string of medical subject headings (MeSH) including the terms PCOS, incretin mimetics, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor antagonists (GLP-1 RAs), liraglutide, exenatide, semaglutide, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, combined with IR, testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).

Results:

We identified 854 relevant articles and, after the initial screening, eight interventional animal studies, one observational animal study, 14 interventional human studies, two case–control studies and one systematic review were included. These studies showed the potential significant roles of GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors in the management of PCOS, with significant improvements in the metabolic parameters, including substantial weight reduction and improved insulin sensitivity. These agents also improved the hormonal parameters through decreased free androgen and increased SHBG. Moreover, they improved menstrual regularity, increased fertility with enhanced ovulation and pregnancy in obese women with PCOS.

Conclusion:

GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors have a promising therapeutic role in PCOS; however, larger clinical trials are needed to establish the role of incretin-based therapies in the management of PCOS.

Clinical Considerations

Disease Associated Maternal and Fetal Risk: Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre- eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth and macrosomia related morbidity.

Data

Animal Data: In a combined fertility and embryofetal development study in rats, subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.03 and 0.09 mg/kg/day (0.2-, 0.7- and 2.1-fold the MRHD) were administered to males for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating and to females for 2 weeks prior to mating, and throughout organogenesis to Gestation Day 17. In parental animals, pharmacologically mediated reductions in body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. In the offspring, reduced growth and fetuses with visceral (heart blood vessels) and skeletal (cranial bones, vertebra, ribs) abnormalities were observed at the human exposure.

In an embryofetal development study in pregnant rabbits, subcutaneous doses of 0.0010, 0.0025 or 0.0075 mg/kg/day (0.06-, 0.6- and 4.4-fold the MRHD) were administered throughout organogenesis from Gestation Day 6 to 19. Pharmacologically mediated reductions in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were observed at all dose levels. Early pregnancy losses and increased incidences of minor visceral (kidney, liver) and skeletal (sternebra) fetal abnormalities were observed at ≥ 0.0025 mg/kg/day, at clinically relevant exposures.

### The dual impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on metabolic and reproductive health in polycystic ovary syndrome: insights from human and animal trials [^00515d61]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

GLP-1RAs, such as liraglutide and semaglutide, combined with lifestyle modifications, were approved for weight reduction for individuals with BMI ⩾30 kg/m² or BMI ⩾27 kg/m² with at least one comorbidity associated with obesity (e.g. elevated blood pressure (BP), T2DM, prediabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea) by both the United States FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Additionally, GLP-1RAs were proven to be beneficial in other metabolic comorbidities, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and osteoarthritis, where they are being used, although not yet approved. Both excess body weight and glycemic levels can be managed with one medicinal prescription of GLP-1RAs.

The importance of these medications lies in the superior weight reduction compared to metformin, besides the metabolic, reproductive, and cardiovascular benefits, as proven by most trials. Liu et al.showed higher weight reduction (4.29 ± 1.29 vs 2.28 ± 0.55 kg) and fat loss (4.67% ± 0.09% vs 1.11% ± 0.32%) after 12 weeks of exenatide, a GLP-1RA, compared to metformin. This weight loss effect is due to GLP-1RAs' role in regulating energy expenditure and delaying gastric emptying. In addition to their ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, the control of appetite and hunger gives the GLP-1RAs an important role in the management of PCOS. Additionally, aside from the 5.6% reduction in body weight, visceral adipose tissue was reduced by 18% in PCOS patients when treated with liraglutide for 26 weeks, in a trial of 72 women.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^05cc074a]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Optimizing natural fertility — conclusion recommendations: Time to conception increases with age, and for women over 35, consultation with a reproductive specialist should be considered after 6 months of unsuccessful efforts to conceive. Intercourse every 1 to 2 days during the fertile window can help maximize fecundability, and for couples unable to have regular frequent intercourse, fertility-awareness methods may help time frequent intercourse to the fertile window and decrease time to pregnancy. Smoking and recreational drugs should be discouraged in men and women attempting pregnancy, and alcohol and caffeine use should be limited to minimal to moderate use while trying to conceive. A healthy lifestyle and diet should be encouraged in men and women attempting to achieve pregnancy for their effects on general health. Women wishing to become pregnant should take a daily folic acid supplement (400 μg). Reproductive-aged men and women should be encouraged, to the extent possible, to limit their exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals in food, air, water, and personal care products, and to air pollution.

### The potential role of incretin-based therapies for polycystic ovary syndrome: a narrative review of the current evidence [^e18f396a]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects women of reproductive age. Metabolic consequences associated with PCOS include, but are not limited to, insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential therapeutic roles of the incretin-based therapies in the management of PCOS.

Methods

We performed a systematic search of databases including PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE up to 1 October 2020. We developed a search string of medical subject headings (MeSH) including the terms PCOS, incretin mimetics, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor antagonists (GLP-1 RAs), liraglutide, exenatide, semaglutide, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, combined with IR, testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).

Results

We identified 854 relevant articles and, after the initial screening, eight interventional animal studies, one observational animal study, 14 interventional human studies, two case-control studies and one systematic review were included. These studies showed the potential significant roles of GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors in the management of PCOS, with significant improvements in the metabolic parameters, including substantial weight reduction and improved insulin sensitivity. These agents also improved the hormonal parameters through decreased free androgen and increased SHBG. Moreover, they improved menstrual regularity, increased fertility with enhanced ovulation and pregnancy in obese women with PCOS.

Conclusion

GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors have a promising therapeutic role in PCOS; however, larger clinical trials are needed to establish the role of incretin-based therapies in the management of PCOS.

Regarding medical management for fertility preservation, more specifically with respect to fertility preservation in females, oocyte/embryo cryopreservation, ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend to take into account the possibility that fertility preservation interventions (such as ovarian stimulation regimens that increase estrogen levels) may increase the risk of cancer progression or recurrence in estrogen-sensitive breast and gynecologic malignancies. Consider using aromatase inhibitor-based stimulation protocols to alleviate these concerns, as there is no increased cancer recurrence risk as a result of aromatase inhibitor-supplemented ovarian stimulation.

AUA/ASRM medical and nutraceutical interventions for male infertility — core directives: Male infertility may be managed with assisted reproductive technology (ART). Clinicians may advise couples with a low total motile sperm count on repeated semen analysis (SA) that intrauterine insemination (IUI) success rates may be reduced, and treatment with ART (in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection [IVF/ICSI]) may be considered. The patient presenting with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) should be evaluated to determine the etiology and treated based on diagnosis. For infertile men with low serum testosterone, clinicians may use aromatase inhibitors (AIs), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), or a combination thereof (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For men interested in current or future fertility, testosterone monotherapy should not be prescribed. The infertile male with hyperprolactinemia should be evaluated for the etiology and treated accordingly. Clinicians should inform the man with idiopathic infertility that the use of SERMs has limited benefits relative to results of ART. Clinicians should counsel that supplements (e.g., antioxidants, vitamins) are of questionable clinical utility and that existing data are inadequate to recommend specific agents (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). For idiopathic infertility, a clinician may consider treatment using an Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) analogue to improve sperm concentration, pregnancy rate, and live birth rate (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) should be informed of the limited data supporting pharmacologic manipulation with SERMs, AIs, and gonadotropins prior to surgical intervention (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — inositol for infertility: Inositol in any form alone, or in combination with other therapies, should be considered experimental therapy in women with PCOS with infertility, with benefits and risks currently too uncertain to recommend the use of these agents as fertility therapies. There is limited evidence with uncertain results, on the effect of inositol on ovulation, clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. Side effects and safety are not known for inositol. Women need to be aware that these agents can have limited regulation with variable dose, quality, consistency, and combination with other agents. Women's personal goals and preferences should be considered when discussing complimentary therapies.

### The association of medications and supplements with human male reproductive health: a systematic review [^5738da93]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Some medications used to treat comorbidities and conditions in reproductive-aged individuals could have a negative impact on fertility. This may occur through hormonal disruption, toxicity to germ cells and spermatozoa, functional impact on the sperm, teratogenicity potential, or ejaculatory abnormalities. Having knowledge of these potential interactions between medications and reproductive potential is important for clinicians to be aware of and guide the patient, along with their treating clinicians, to reproductively favorable alternatives when available. This review aims to summarize the state of the literature regarding medication interactions with human male reproduction using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System of medications.

Prepregnancy counseling — review of current medications — advises that all prescription and nonprescription medications should be reviewed, including nutritional supplements and herbal products, with discussion of the pregnancy safety of each and detailed review of medications with potential teratogenicity and their specific risks. The importance of reliable contraception should be emphasized when a patient is taking potentially teratogenic medications, and for a patient who desires pregnancy such medication should be adjusted in collaboration with the prescribing health care provider before contraception is discontinued, using the lowest effective doses of the safest medications whenever medically reasonable. Male partners should be screened for the use of androgens, such as testosterone, because androgen use is associated with azoospermia and infertility in males, which may be reversible in some cases with cessation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part II [^57971a9b]. Fertility and Sterility (2021). High credibility.

Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) management and endocrine therapy considerations: Patients with HH present with deficient luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH secretion, and referral to an endocrinologist or male reproductive specialist is encouraged; spermatogenesis can be initiated and pregnancies achieved in many men with idiopathic HH when treated with exogenous gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH. With gonadotropin treatment for HH, hCG injections are typically initiated with serum testosterone monitored, and after normalization of testosterone, FSH or FSH analogues may be added to optimize sperm production. Exogenous testosterone administration provides negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary gland that can inhibit gonadotropins such that spermatogenesis may decrease or cease altogether, resulting in azoospermia, supporting avoidance of testosterone monotherapy in men desiring fertility. Although not currently FDA-approved for use in men, SERMs such as clomiphene or tamoxifen are often prescribed to attempt improvement in semen parameters and fertility outcomes. While exogenous FSH may be used as an adjunct for HH with good results, in idiopathic infertile men without HH its fertility benefits are measurable but limited; the cost-to-benefit ratio is questionable because men are typically treated for 3 months or more and the incremental increase in pregnancy rates is small. There are no clear, reliable data to support use of supplements (vitamins, antioxidants, nutritional formulations) for men attempting conception; current data suggest they are likely not harmful but of questionable value in improving fertility outcomes.

### Once-weekly semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity [^3d584436]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study STEP 1 was published by John P H Wilding and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the STEP 1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of once weekly semaglutide as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight or obesity? In the STEP 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the STEP 1 study, the population was: 1961 patients (1453 female, 508 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, self-reported change in body weight > 5 kg (11 lbs) within 90 days before screening, previous treatment with glucose-lowering agents or any antiobesity medications within the past 90 days before screening. In the STEP 1 study, the interventions were: n = 1306 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for the first 4 weeks and titrated every 4 weeks to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16, plus diet and physical activity counseling) n = 655 placebo (matching placebo once weekly plus diet and physical activity counseling). In the STEP 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in relative weight reduction at week 68 (14.9% vs. 2.4%; AD 12.4%, 95% CI 11.5 to 13.4). In the STEP 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a weight reduction of ≥ 10% at week 68 (69.1% vs. 12%; OR 14.7, 95% CI 11.1 to 19.4) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in weight by ≥ 15% at week 68 (50.5% vs. 4.9%; OR 19.3, 95% CI 12.9 to 28.8) Significant increase in absolute weight reduction from baseline to week 68 (15.3 kg vs. 2.6 kg; AD 12.7 kg, 95% CI 11.7 to 13.7). In the STEP 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in overall adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (9.8% vs. 6.4%), gastrointestinal disorders (74.2% vs. 47.9%), treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal events (4.5% vs. 0.8%). In the STEP 1 study, the conclusion was: in patients with a BMI of ≥ 30 (or ≥ 27 with ≥ 1 weight-related coexisting condition) who did not have diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to relative weight reduction at week 68.

### Advances in GLP-1 treatment: focus on oral semaglutide [^d736a740]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Development of oral semaglutide: a GLP-1 ra peptide

GLP-1 is an intestinal hormone of the incretin family responsible for amplifying insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon release, delaying gastric emptying, and decreasing insulin resistance. In the central nervous system, GLP-1 acts as a neurotransmitter responsible for signaling satiety via the brainstem-hypothalamus. Peripherally, GLP-1 reduces energy intake and affects all components of appetite regulation: increased satiety and fullness and decreased hunger and prospective food consumption. Together, these effects promote physiological satiety.

GLP-1 RA is an effective treatment option for T2D but was available only in parenteral formulations since peptide-based drugs, including GLP-1 RA, have very low bioavailability when administered orally. Semaglutide is a GLP-1 RA that can be used subcutaneously once a week as a treatment for T2D. This injectable molecule is a potent and long-acting GLP-1 analog with 94% homology with human native GLP-1. Three key structural differences provide the extended pharmacokinetics of this drug, namely, the substitution of Ala with Aib at position 8 that increases enzymatic (DPP4) stability, attachment of a linker and C18 di-acid chain at position 26 that provides strong binding to albumin and substitution of Lys with Arg at position 34 that prevents C18 fatty acid-binding at the wrong site. The phase 3 clinical trial program (SUSTAIN) compared subcutaneous semaglutide to placebo or other active standard-of-care medications in patients with T2D. These trials showed that the subcutaneous semaglutide group had a greater reduction in HbA1c and body weight loss rates and that the semaglutide had a well-characterized safety profile. However, T2D requires long-term treatment, and in general, an oral formulation is preferred by patients and could improve medication adherence. The oral formulation of semaglutide was approved on September 20th, 2019, by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and on October 20th, 2020, by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) to treat T2D based on the PIONEER program, a sequence of phase III clinical trials showing the efficacy and safety of oral semaglutide in comparison with placebo or other active standard-of-care medications.

3.8 Aggregated‐exposure during pregnancy

There were 32 598 females in the clinical development programmes of GLP1‐RAs, 164 of whom had unplanned pregnancies during their participation. At least 111 of the 21 987 females exposed to GLP1‐RAs became pregnant (0.51%), and at least 38 of the 10 611 females who received placebo or other non‐GLP1‐RA comparators became pregnant (0.36%). The exposure status of 15 additional pregnancies was not reported. In the placebo group, there were 13 healthy children (34%), two ongoing pregnancies (5.3%), two congenital abnormalities (5.3%), two stillbirths (5.3%), five spontaneous abortions (13%), three ectopic pregnancies (7.9%) and five elective terminations (13%). Four were lost to follow‐up, and two reported no outcomes. In the GLP1‐RA exposure group, there were 48 healthy children (43%), five ongoing pregnancies (4.5%), two congenital abnormalities (1.8%), one low birthweight (0.9%), one stillbirth (0.9%), 24 spontaneous abortions (22%), three ectopic pregnancies (2.7%), 14 elective terminations (13%) and two additional abortions, unknown whether spontaneous or elective.

Adverse effects of GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy in T2DM: Both classes of agents have notable side effects as well as associated adverse events. GLP-1 RA use is associated with significant gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) that often are mild, resolve over time, and can be modulated by appropriate patient selection (avoiding gastroparesis). A risk of cholelithiasis and acute cholecystitis increases slightly with dose and duration of treatment; no increased risk of pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, or hypoglycemia with GLP-1 RA use was noted. Injectable semaglutide is associated with a slightly increased risk of progression of diabetic eye complications, theorized to reflect rapid improvement in glycemic control. SGLT-2 inhibitor use has been associated with an increased risk of mycotic genital infections (typically mild and easily treated) and a slightly increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, which can largely be mitigated with education not to take when oral intake is diminished, the patient is feeling unwell, during acute illness, before surgery, or combinations of these.

SI and Suicidal Behavior as Assessed by C-SSRS

In STEP 1, 2, and 3, 30 participants (1.4%) receiving semaglutide, 2.4 mg, and 28 (2.2%) receiving placebo had a history of low- to moderate-risk SI as determined by the C-SSRS; corresponding numbers in STEP 5 were 4 (2.6%) and 2 participants (1.3%), respectively (Table 3). At baseline in STEP 1, 2, and 3, 1 participant receiving semaglutide, 2.4 mg, and 2 receiving placebo reported SI (low risk) (eResults in Supplement 5). No participants in STEP 5 reported SI at baseline.

Table 3.
Proportion of Participants With Suicidal Ideation During the Studies as Assessed by the Columbia Suicide-Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) a

From randomization through end of treatment in STEP 1, 2, and 3, 8 participants (0.4%) receiving semaglutide, 2.4 mg, and 7 (0.6%) receiving placebo reported incident SI; all but 1 case was characterized as low to moderate risk (Table 3). In STEP 5, 1 (0.7%) and 2 participants (1.4%) receiving semaglutide, 2.4 mg, and placebo, respectively, reported incident SI. Twelve of 18 SI cases (67%) had resolved by the end of the trial, spread evenly across groups; time of onset, nature, severity, and resolution are reported in eTable 7 in Supplement 5.

One participant who received semaglutide, 2.4 mg, and acknowledged incident SI (on the C-SSRS at week 36 and as a serious AE) also reported suicidal behavior (suicide attempt) at week 36 on the C-SSRS (STEP 1; eTable 7 in Supplement 5). Thereafter, the participant experienced low-risk SI at week 52. All reports of SI and suicidal behavior were resolved by the end of the trial. At baseline, the participant's PHQ-9 score suggested mild symptoms of depression (total score 6), increasing to moderately severe symptoms (total score 16) at week 36 and returning to 6 at the end of the trial.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents with obesity — management focuses on insulin resistance reduction, lifestyle change, and selective adjuncts: Treatment of adolescent PCOS in the setting of obesity focuses on both reducing insulin resistance to improve androgen levels and restore menstrual function and fertility, and there is no consensus regarding what treatment to first initiate and then add a second or third line of treatment. The 2018 guidelines for management of PCOS recommend a low-calorie diet to promote weight loss in women with PCOS and obesity, but there are no recommendations on which diet works best; in general, a diet that results in lower caloric intake and weight loss will improve insulin sensitivity and can improve biochemical and clinical parameters of PCOS. Micronutrients and supplements are often suggested, but there is not enough evidence to recommend supplements in the treatment of PCOS, whereas at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity at least 3 days a week have been suggested. Adjunctive weight loss options such as AOMs or MBS are considered to optimize weight loss and improve insulin resistance; GLP-1 agonists have been studied in women with obesity and PCOS and found to reduce body weight and improve hyperandrogenism and ovulatory function, and MBS as a treatment for PCOS has not been studied in adolescents, with adult studies indicating weight loss and improvement in ovarian function, insulin resistance, and menstrual regulation.

### The efficacy and safety of GLP-1 agonists in PCOS women living with obesity in promoting weight loss and hormonal regulation: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^d077b97b]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of GLP1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) in treating polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) remains unclear. While GLP1-RAs are known to promote weight loss in patients with diabetes and living with obesity, their impact on weight reduction and hormonal regulation in women with PCOS is understudied. Therefore, we aimed to assess the efficacy of GLP1-RAs in PCOS women living with obesity through a meta-analysis, comparing their effects to placebo.

Hypothesis

The use of GLP1-RAs in PCOS women living with obesity can reduce body mass index and waist circumference as well as improve hyperinsulinism, and hyperandrogenism as well as normalize total testosterone, total cholesterol and HOMA-IR markers in PCOS women living with obesity.

Methods

We systematically searched the PubMed, Cochrane Central, Scopus and Embase databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing GLP1-RAs versus placebo among women diagnosed with PCOS based on the Rotterdam Criteria. Our primary outcomes of interest included body mass index (BMI), triglycerides, waist circumference, total testosterone, total cholesterol, and HOMA-IR. We performed data extraction and quality assessment for studies that met the inclusion criteria. We pooled mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) with a random-effect model for continuous endpoints.

Results

We included 176 participants from four RCTs. Semaglutide and Liraglutide were used in 23 (13%) and 103 (58%) participants, respectively. GLP1-RAs use was associated with a significant reduction in waist circumference (MD: -5.16 cm; 95% CI: -6.11 to -4.21; p ˂ 0.00001), body mass index (BMI) (MD: -2.42; 95% CI: -3.10 to -1.74; p ˂ 0.00001), serum triglycerides (MD: -0.20; 95% CI: -0.30 to -0.11; p ˂ 0.00001) and total testosterone levels (MD: -1.33; 95% CI: -2.55 to -0.12; p = 0.03) when compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in total cholesterol (MD: -0.04; 95% CI: -0.10 to 0.01; p = 0.15) and HOMA-IR (MD: -0.30; 95% CI: -0.92 to 0.32; p = 0.35) levels. Adverse events information was available for 112 patients, where 49 had light side effects such as nausea and abdominal pain.

Conclusion

The use of GLP1-RAs demonstrates efficacy in reducing BMI, triglycerides, waist circumference and total testosterone. There was no significant difference in total cholesterol and HOMA-IR levels. These results signify its viability as a favourable treatment option for managing PCOS symptoms in women living with obesity.

### General approaches to medical management of menstrual suppression: ACOG clinical consensus no. 3 [^95864b91]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Drug interactions — medication review for hormonal methods for menstrual suppression requires proactive assessment. Gynecologists should conduct a thorough review of a patient's use of over-the-counter and prescribed medications to address any potential drug interactions with hormonal medications for menstrual suppression, and careful attention should be given to both over-the-counter and prescribed medications. When meeting with a patient, an obstetrician–gynecologist has an opportunity to review prescribed and non-prescription medications, nutritional supplements, and herbal products, and the U.S. MEC is a useful resource for potential drug interactions with hormonal methods.

### Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists' use during pregnancy: safety data from regulatory clinical trials [^2f9bbd95]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Dao conducted a cohort study using data from six centres affiliated with the European Network of Teratology Information Services. At such centres, risk assessments of a medication exposure during pregnancy are provided to women and their clinicians at an individual level. Extensive data regarding maternal characteristics, drug exposure and pregnancy outcomes are collected. There was no difference in birth defects or pregnancy loss of 168 pregnancies with first trimester exposure to GLP1‐RAs when compared to those of 156 pregnant women with diabetes and 163 pregnant women with a BMI > 27 kg/m² and no GLP1‐RA exposure. Preterm birth rate was lower in the GLP1‐RA cohort (8.0%) compared to cohorts with diabetes (15.1%) and obesity (14.5%). However, there were increased incidence of elective pregnancy termination compared to the diabetes and obesity cohorts.

Muller conducted a systematic review of the impact of GLP1‐RA exposure during pregnancy, and, in addition to the case reports discussed above, they found a study that demonstrated negligible transfer of exenatide through the human placenta. Maslin et al. performed a scoping review investigating reproductive outcomes of women without PCOS or diabetes taking GLP1‐RAs or orlistat periconceptionally or during pregnancy. They identified six narrative reviews, two systematic reviews and a protocol for a pregnancy registry for health outcomes of women exposed to semaglutide; they concluded that the lack of primary data necessitates further research.

Based on animal studies, GLP1‐RAs have not been classified as direct teratogens (Supporting Information). Thus, the current licensing status is based on the precautionary principle given the lack of supporting safety data in pregnant women. Primary data regarding incidental pregnancies occurring during the clinical development programmes for GLP1‐RAs evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have not been investigated previously.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^4310d314]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Optimizing natural fertility — intercourse timing, fertility-awareness methods, and lifestyle: The "fertile window" spans the 6-day interval ending on the day of ovulation, and frequent intercourse (every 1–2 days) during the fertile window yields the highest pregnancy rates, with results from less frequent intercourse (2–3 times per week) nearly equivalent; couples should not be advised to limit frequency when trying to conceive. Fertility-awareness methods, such as ovulation detection kits and cervical mucus monitoring, have been shown to increase the probability of conceiving in a given menstrual cycle. There is insufficient evidence that a specific diet or intake of particular macronutrients can improve natural fertility, although daily folic acid supplementation in women decreases the risk of neural tube defects in their children. Specific coital positions and postcoital routines have no impact on fertility. Alcohol abuse, recreational drugs, smoking, and high caffeine intake may all negatively impact fertility, and higher exposure to certain endocrine-disrupting chemicals and to air pollution may adversely impact fertility in women.

### Semaglutide (Wegovy) [^a8de9a52]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Semaglutide is a GLP-1 analogue with 94% sequence homology to human GLP-1. Semaglutide acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist that selectively binds to and activates the GLP-1 receptor, the target for native GLP-1.

GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and caloric intake, and the GLP-1 receptor is present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation. Animal studies show that semaglutide distributed to and activated neurons in brain regions involved in regulation of food intake.

The exact mechanism of CV risk reduction has not been established.

For treatment of MASH in humans, the precise mechanism of action of semaglutide is not fully understood and may involve multiple pathways mediated by weight loss and other factors. In a mouse model of diet-induced MASH, treatment with semaglutide resulted in histological improvements in steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in liver compared to baseline, which was associated with body weight loss, intermittent periods of reduced food intake, and improvements in relevant biomarkers. The relationship between the pathophysiology of MASH in animal models and humans has not been fully established.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Semaglutide lowers body weight with greater fat mass loss than lean mass loss. Semaglutide decreases calorie intake. The effects are likely mediated by affecting appetite.

Semaglutide stimulates insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. These effects can lead to a reduction of blood glucose.

Gastric Emptying

Semaglutide delays gastric emptying.

Cardiac Electrophysiology (QTc)

The effect of semaglutide on cardiac repolarization was tested in a thorough QTc trial. Semaglutide did not prolong QTc intervals at doses up to 1.5 mg at steady state.

Noninvasive Liver Disease Markers

Semaglutide decreases liver fat content measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF), liver stiffness assessed by transient elastography (TE), Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score, and the levels of the pro-peptide of type III collagen biomarker (Pro-C3). The clinical relevance of these changes is yet to be confirmed.

### Metformin use in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): opportunities, benefits, and clinical challenges [^1524d919]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Combinations with COCPs have shown mixed results. A large meta‐analysis of 36 RCTs comparing metformin versus COCP, and metformin + COCP versus COCP alone, reported that combination therapy improved biochemical hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and insulin levels more effectively than COCP alone, while COCP monotherapy was more effective for regulating cycles and reducing hirsutism. Earlier meta‐analyses– one in non‐obese women (14 RCTs)and another in the broader PCOS population (33 RCTs)– found that adding metformin to COCPs or anti‐androgens improved BMI and glucose tolerance compared with hormonal therapy alone.

For comparisons with nutraceuticals, two systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (each including 8 RCTs) found no significant differences between metformin and myo‐inositol in metabolic or hormonal outcomes, although myo‐inositol showed a better safety profile with fewer side effects. Another meta‐analysis of 9 RCTs (n = 638) reported that myo‐inositol improved fertility outcomes by modulating hyperandrogenism more effectively than metformin, although ovarian function and BMI were not significantly different between the groups.

### Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: a joint advisory from the American college of lifestyle medicine, the American society for nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the obesity society [^f2f8e8f6]. Obesity Pillars (2025). High credibility.

GLP-1 therapy efficacy magnitude and durability summarize trial and real-world effects and temporal patterns. In the original phase 3 randomized trials for obesity, average weight reduction compared to placebo has ranged from 5.3% to 17.8% after 56–72 weeks. In real-world practice, the efficacy for weight reduction is often lower: for example, about 8% for individuals with diabetes and 11% for individuals without diabetes at 60 weeks with semaglutide 2.4 mg/day. Generally, weight reduction is more rapid during the first 6 months and then slower thereafter, with relative plateauing at 18 months. When GLP-1 use is continued, weight reduction is sustained for at least 4 years, whereas when GLP-1s are stopped, weight regain is common — typically nearly to baseline within one year.

### A model-based approach to predict individual weight loss with semaglutide in people with overweight or obesity [^ddb5c569]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

To determine the relationship between exposure and weight-loss trajectories for the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue semaglutide for weight management.

Materials and Methods

Data from one 52-week, phase 2, dose-ranging trial (once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide 0.05–0.4mg) and two 68-week phase 3 trials (once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4mg) for weight management in people with overweight or obesity with or without type 2 diabetes were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model describing semaglutide exposure. An exposure-response model describing weight change was then developed using baseline demographics, glycated haemoglobin and PK data during treatment. The ability of the exposure-response model to predict 1-year weight loss based on weight data collected at baseline and after up to 28weeks of treatment, was assessed using three independent phase 3 trials.

Results

Based on population PK, exposure levels over time consistently explained the weight-loss trajectories across trials and dosing regimens. The exposure-response model had high precision and limited bias for predicting body weight loss at 1year in independent datasets, with increased precision when data from later time points were included in the prediction.

Conclusion

An exposure-response model has been established that quantitatively describes the relationship between systemic semaglutide exposure and weight loss and predicts weight-loss trajectories for people with overweight or obesity who are receiving semaglutide doses up to 2.4mg once weekly.

### Inositol for polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis to inform the 2023 update of the international evidence-based PCOS guidelines [^8631ee19]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to inform the 2023 update of the International Evidence-based Guideline on the Assessment and Management of PCOS and followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD 42022356057). The review informed the guideline recommendation for the question "In adolescents and adults with PCOS, is inositol alone or in combination with other therapies effective for management of hormonal and clinical PCOS features, weight, and reproductive outcomes?" The PROSPERO registration includes the reproductive outcomes of interest; the other outcomes were inadvertently left off the registration. However, all the outcomes including hormonal, clinical, anthropometric, and reproductive were determined a priori by the guideline evidence synthesis team.

Information Sources

We searched the following databases from inception until August 5, 2022: Medline (OVID), PsycInfo (EBSCO), EMBASE (OVID), All EBM (OVID), and CINAHL (EBSCO). A hand-search of reference lists of relevant recent systematic reviews was conducted to identify any trials that were not captured in our search. We asked experts in the field to identify any trials that were not identified in our search.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Anti-obesity medications targeting NuSH — liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide — are noted as the most effective among FDA-approved obesity medications and have robust long-term efficacy and safety data up to 4 years for managing obesity in those with and without cardiovascular disease. While all currently available medications were initially approved by the FDA to treat T2DM, they are also approved for obesity. These agents share a similar side effect profile of primarily gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation) that can be mitigated with dose reductions or behavioral modifications such as hydration. On maximal doses, average weight loss is 8.0% with liraglutide, 14.9% with semaglutide, and 20.9% with tirzepatide. Liraglutide and semaglutide are GLP-1 receptor agonists.

The study REDEFINE 1 was published by W Timothy Garvey and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Overweight and obesity. In the REDEFINE 1 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of cagrilintide/semaglutide in patients with overweight or obesity? In the REDEFINE 1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the REDEFINE 1 study, the population was: 2813 patients (1902 female, 911 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with overweight or obesity. The key exclusion criteria were diabetes; surgical treatment; treatment with a glucose-lowering agent; GLP-1 receptor agonist; antiobesity medication within 90 days before screening. In the REDEFINE 1 study, the interventions were: n = 2108 cagrilintide/semaglutide (cagrilintide/semaglutide 2.4/2.4 mg once weekly plus lifestyle intervention) n = 705 placebo (matching placebo plus lifestyle intervention). In the REDEFINE 1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in mean percent reduction in body weight at week 68 (20.4% vs. 3%; MD 17.3, 95% CI 16.6 to 18.1). In the REDEFINE 1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a body weight reduction of ≥ 5% (91.9% vs. 31.5%; AD 60.4%, 95% CI 56.4 to 64.5) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a body weight reduction of ≥ 20% (53.6% vs. 1.9%; AD 51.7%, 95% CI 49.3 to 54.1) Significant increase in the percentage of patients achieving a body weight reduction of ≥ 25% (34.7% vs. 1%; AD 33.7%, 95% CI 31.5 to 35.9). In the REDEFINE 1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse event. significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse events (79.6% vs. 39.9%). In the REDEFINE 1 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with overweight or obesity, cagrilintide/semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to mean percent reduction in body weight at week 68.

### How to manage weight loss in women with obesity and PCOS seeking fertility? [^cdb626ee]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

3 WEIGHT LOSS PHARMACOTHERAPY

Small numbers of RCTs and uncontrolled studies have assessed the impact of obesity pharmacotherapy on fertility outcomes in women with overweight or obesity (with or without PCOS; Table 1).

Table 1
Studies of pharmacotherapy in women seeking fertility

Rates of spontaneous conception and live birth, as well as response to ovulation induction and IVF, were all increased following weight loss pharmacotherapy.,

Weight loss was in the magnitude of 5–8 kg in the pharmacotherapy arms and the magnitude of weight loss was associated with fertility outcomes including live birth.

However, these trials were small in terms of number and sample size and washout periods without pharmacotherapy before attempting conception need to be considered, hence drugs with a shorter half‐life have an advantage in these cases. Weight regain following cessation of pharmacotherapy is also a consideration. Incretin based treatments are not considered safe in pregnancyand the advised washout periods are drug specific depending on the drug half‐life. One of the identified studies studied a period of metformin following GLP‐1‐based treatment, though the extent to which this could modulate weight regain and fertility is unclear. Hence, the half‐life (and as a result the washout period) is to be considered when choosing the antiobesity medication in women with obesity to PCOS seeking fertility. For drugs where the safety of pregnancy is unclear then making sure that the patient is on effective contraceptive is essential before starting weight loss pharmacotherapy.
