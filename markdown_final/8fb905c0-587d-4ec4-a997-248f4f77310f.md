## Question

Treatment for sinusitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of sinusitis, preserving the thinking process and self-verification along the way. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the condition into acute versus chronic and viral versus bacterial. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria that distinguish ABRS from viral rhinosinusitis. Next, I will review first-line management for uncomplicated ABRS, including watchful waiting, antibiotic selection, and duration. After that, I need to examine adjunctive therapies and when to escalate care. Finally, I should consider special populations, chronic disease, and a concise decision algorithm, while continuously checking the evidence base and correcting any missteps I notice along the way.

> Let me first confirm the classification framework, because everything downstream depends on it. Acute rhinosinusitis is typically defined as symptoms lasting less than 4 weeks, whereas chronic rhinosinusitis persists beyond 12 weeks; within acute disease, most cases are viral, and a minority meet criteria for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis based on persistence, severity, or "double-worsening", so I need to ensure I'm not conflating these entities before recommending antibiotics [^113CWCdx] [^115hCaj7].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria for ABRS before moving to treatment. ABRS is presumed when symptoms persist without improvement for at least 10 days, or worsen after initial improvement within 10 days ("double-worsening"), or when there is severe onset with fever of 39°C or higher plus purulent nasal discharge for at least 3 consecutive days; I should double-check that I'm not overcalling bacterial disease in patients with less than 10 days of symptoms, as that would be a mistake [^113CWCdx] [^111khKvo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics for everyone. I need to check the benefit–harm balance: high-quality evidence shows that in clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis, antibiotics confer only a modest benefit in symptom resolution while increasing adverse events, with an NNT around 18–19 and an NNH around 8; importantly, spontaneous improvement is common, with roughly 46% cured by 1 week and 64% by 2 weeks without antibiotics, so watchful waiting is appropriate for many adults with uncomplicated disease and reliable follow-up [^117LcnhV] [^1129kxFt] [^111rJgU6].

> I should confirm the default initial management for uncomplicated ABRS in adults. The updated guideline emphasizes watchful waiting without antibiotics as the initial strategy for most adults, with shared decision-making and a plan to reassess; if antibiotics are chosen, amoxicillin with or without clavulanate for 5–7 days is recommended, balancing efficacy and adverse effects, and I need to ensure I don't inadvertently extend therapy beyond 7 days unless the clinical course warrants it [^117BuRsZ] [^116tfRog] [^11618bS1].

> Let me think about antibiotic selection and dosing, and I should double-check the nuance here. For most previously healthy adults with mild to moderate symptoms, amoxicillin alone is reasonable because comparative data have not shown superiority of amoxicillin-clavulanate but have shown more adverse events with the combination; however, if local resistance risk is high, recent antibiotics were used, illness is severe, or there are risk factors for beta-lactamase–producing organisms, amoxicillin-clavulanate is preferred, and I need to tailor the decision to patient-specific modifiers [^112oTYQQ] [^116tfRog].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate might speed symptom relief based on earlier signals, but I should verify that with newer trials. A randomized trial stopped early for futility found no advantage of high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate over standard-dose for early symptom improvement, and combining datasets actually attenuated any apparent benefit; so I should correct that assumption and avoid routine high-dose strategies in the absence of specific resistance risk [^113pi1at] [^116vhhAF] [^1156yd7R].

> Next, I should review adjunctive therapies and be careful not to overstate their impact. Intranasal corticosteroids offer a modest but clinically meaningful improvement in symptom resolution and are reasonable to offer, with higher doses of mometasone showing a clearer signal in some analyses; saline irrigation is commonly used and guideline-supported for symptom relief, though high-quality pediatric evidence is sparse; systemic corticosteroids as monotherapy are ineffective, and as adjuncts to antibiotics show only small short-term benefits with uncertain durability, so I should reserve them for select severe cases after discussing trade-offs [^117NUSWb] [^111Nbh4u] [^113aH3P7] [^112U5ttG] [^115NKemo].

> I need to ensure I define treatment failure and the reassessment timeline correctly. Failure is typically defined as worsening at any time or lack of meaningful improvement after 3–5 days of appropriate therapy; if failure occurs, I should confirm the diagnosis, exclude alternative causes, assess adherence, and consider complications, then change the antibiotic class or broaden coverage if ABRS remains likely; this early window avoids prolonged ineffective therapy while acknowledging that fluctuations in the first 48–72 hours are not uncommon [^116uiYM7] [^1164iXc9] [^114GG5vK].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or has risk factors for complications? For children, I should confirm that antibiotics are indicated for severe onset or worsening course, while persistent symptoms can be managed with either antibiotics or close observation for an additional 3 days; amoxicillin remains first-line in most children, with high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate reserved for specific risk contexts, and I should reassess within 72 hours if not improving; in immunocompromised patients or those with suspected complications, I should not delay antibiotics and should pursue imaging and specialty input early [^115wU1kf] [^112hmkXY] [^115VLjBL] [^111oMZyr].

> I will now examine chronic rhinosinusitis, because the approach diverges substantially from acute disease. CRS is primarily an inflammatory condition rather than an infection, so routine antibiotics are not recommended in the absence of an acute bacterial exacerbation; first-line therapy is intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation, with evaluation for contributing conditions such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, and immunodeficiency, and surgery reserved for refractory cases after maximal medical therapy [^116qeL12] [^114NUEJG] [^113S6nN6].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision pathway to ensure internal consistency. Start by confirming duration and trajectory of symptoms to distinguish viral from bacterial, default to watchful waiting for uncomplicated adult ABRS with reliable follow-up, reserve antibiotics for those with severe onset, worsening course, or persistent symptoms beyond 10 days, choose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 5–7 days based on severity and risk factors, add intranasal steroids and saline for symptom relief, and reassess at 3–5 days to adjust therapy or evaluate for complications if not improving; this aligns with contemporary guidelines and the best available evidence [^113CWCdx] [^116tfRog] [^117BuRsZ] [^111rJgU6].

---

Treatment of sinusitis depends on duration and severity: **watchful waiting** is appropriate for mild acute cases [^117BuRsZ], while **antibiotics** are indicated for severe, worsening, or persistent symptoms [^111khKvo]. For acute bacterial sinusitis, **amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 5–7 days** is first-line [^116tfRog]; doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone is used for penicillin allergy or resistance risk [^111khKvo]. Chronic sinusitis is managed with intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation [^113S6nN6]; antibiotics are reserved for acute exacerbations or refractory cases [^112sLPyg]. Adjunctive therapies include analgesics, decongestants, and antihistamines for symptom relief [^111khKvo]; surgery is considered for refractory chronic disease or complications [^113S6nN6].

---

## Acute sinusitis

### Viral sinusitis

Most acute sinusitis is viral and self-limited; **supportive care** is the mainstay [^116sL2Da]. Supportive care includes analgesics (acetaminophen or NSAIDs) [^113aH3P7], intranasal corticosteroids, saline irrigation, and decongestants (short-term use only) [^113eDFe2]. Antibiotics are **not recommended** for uncomplicated viral sinusitis because of minimal benefit and potential harm [^117LcnhV].

---

### Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABRS)

ABRS is diagnosed by persistent symptoms ≥ 10 days without improvement, severe symptoms (fever ≥ 39°C, purulent discharge ≥ 3 days), or worsening symptoms after initial improvement ("double worsening") [^111k46fJ].

---

#### Antibiotic therapy

- **First-line therapy**: Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate for 5–7 days [^116tfRog] [^11618bS1].
- **Penicillin allergy**: Doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g. levofloxacin) [^111khKvo].
- **High-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate**: Consider if resistance risk factors are present (recent antibiotics, severe infection, immunocompromised) [^1141cYfL].

---

#### Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies include **intranasal corticosteroids** to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms [^117NUSWb], **saline irrigation** to relieve congestion and improve mucociliary clearance [^notfound], and **decongestants** for short-term relief of nasal congestion [^notfound].

---

#### Watchful waiting

Watchful waiting is appropriate for **mild, uncomplicated ABRS** with assured follow-up; initiate antibiotics if symptoms persist or worsen after 3–5 days [^117BuRsZ].

---

## Chronic sinusitis

Chronic sinusitis is defined as symptoms lasting ≥ 12 weeks; management focuses on **long-term control and symptom relief** [^113S6nN6].

---

### Medical management

- **Intranasal corticosteroids**: First-line therapy to reduce inflammation [^113S6nN6].
- **Saline irrigation**: Regular use to reduce symptoms and improve mucociliary clearance [^112sLPyg].
- **Antibiotics**: Reserved for acute bacterial exacerbations or refractory cases; routine use is not recommended [^116qeL12].

---

### Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **refractory chronic sinusitis**, anatomical abnormalities, or complications (e.g. orbital or intracranial extension) [^113S6nN6].

---

## Special considerations

### Pediatric sinusitis

Pediatric sinusitis is managed similarly to adult disease, with **amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate as first-line therapy** [^111oMZyr]. Watchful waiting is appropriate for **mild cases** with assured follow-up [^112hmkXY].

---

### Immunocompromised patients

Immunocompromised patients require **aggressive management**, including broad-spectrum antibiotics and early surgical consultation, due to higher risk of complications [^notfound].

---

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Condition** | **First-line therapy** | **Adjunctive therapy** | **Surgery** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Viral sinusitis | Supportive care | Analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, saline irrigation, decongestants | Not indicated |
| Acute bacterial sinusitis | Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate | Intranasal corticosteroids, saline irrigation, decongestants | Not indicated |
| Chronic sinusitis | Intranasal corticosteroids, saline irrigation | Antibiotics for exacerbations | Indicated for refractory cases |
| Pediatric sinusitis | Amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate | Intranasal corticosteroids, saline irrigation | Not indicated |
| Immunocompromised | Broad-spectrum antibiotics | Aggressive supportive care | Early surgical consultation |

---

Treatment of sinusitis is tailored to the **underlying cause, severity, and patient factors**, with supportive care for viral cases and antibiotics for bacterial infections. Chronic sinusitis relies on intranasal corticosteroids and saline irrigation, with surgery for refractory disease.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^117Mxw2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Expert opinions vary on the appropriate role of antibiotics for sinusitis, one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions among adults in ambulatory care.

Objectives

We examined whether antibiotics are effective in treating acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are the most effective.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1950 to May 2007) and EMBASE (1974 to June 2007).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography or bacterial culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and quality assessed trials. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for differences in the intervention and control groups to see whether or not the treatment was a failure. In meta-analysing the placebo-controlled studies, the data across antibiotic classes were combined. Primary outcomes were the clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow up.

Main Results

Fifty-seven studies were included in the review; six placebo-controlled studies and 51 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics. Five studies involving 631 participants provided data for comparison of antibiotics to placebo, when clinical failure was defined as a lack of cure or improvement at 7 to 15 days follow up. These studies found a slight statistical difference in favor of antibiotics, compared to placebo, with a pooled RR of 0.66 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.98). However, the clinical significance of the result is equivocal, also considering that cure or improvement rate was high in both the placebo group (80%) and the antibiotic group (90%). Based on six studies, when clinical failure was defined as a lack of total cure, there was significant difference in favor of antibiotics compared to placebo with a pooled RR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.84) at 7 to 15 days follow up. None of the antibiotic preparations was superior to each other.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics have a small treatment effect in patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis in a primary care setting with symptoms for more than seven days. However, 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improve within two weeks. Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population level.

### Antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^117LcnhV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute rhinosinusitis is an acute infection of the nasal passages and paranasal sinuses that lasts less than four weeks. Diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms in ambulatory care settings. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor are they recommended in most countries. Some trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear. We merged two Cochrane Reviews for this update, which comprised different approaches with overlapping populations, resulting in different conclusions. For this review update, we maintained the distinction between populations diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms, or imaging.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis in ambulatory care settings.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which contains the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2018), Embase (January 1974 to January 2018), and two trials registers (January 2018). We also checked references from identified trials, systematic reviews, and relevant guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment in people with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms or sinusitis confirmed by imaging.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data about cure and side effects and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information as required.

Main Results

We included 15 trials involving 3057 participants. Of the 15 included trials, 10 appeared in our 2012 review, and five (631 participants) are legacy trials from merging two reviews. No new studies were included from searches for this update. Overall, risk of bias was low. Without antibiotics, 46% of participants with rhinosinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography, were cured after 1 week and 64% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten time to cure, but only 5 to 11 more people per 100 will be cured faster if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment: clinical diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 1.54; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 19, 95% CI 10 to 205; I² = 0%; 8 trials; high-quality evidence) and diagnosis confirmed by radiography (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.39; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to 136; I² = 0%; 3 trials; moderate-quality evidence). Cure rates with antibiotics were higher when a fluid level or total opacification in any sinus was found on computed tomography (OR 4.89, 95% CI 1.75 to 13.72; NNTB 4, 95% CI 2 to 15; 1 trial; moderate-quality evidence). Purulent secretion resolved faster with antibiotics (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.22; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 35; I² = 0%; 3 trials; high-quality evidence). However, 13 more people experienced side effects with antibiotics compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.74 to 2.82; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) 8, 95% CI 6 to 12; I² = 16%; 10 trials; high-quality evidence). Five fewer people per 100 will experience clinical failure if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo or no treatment (Peto OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.63; NNTH 19, 95% CI 15 to 27; I² = 21%; 12 trials; high-quality evidence). A disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in one participant (of 3057) one week after receiving open antibiotic therapy (clinical failure, control group).

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics to treat acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed either clinically (low risk of bias, high-quality evidence) or confirmed by imaging (low to unclear risk of bias, moderate-quality evidence) is marginal and needs to be seen in the context of the risk of adverse effects. Considering antibiotic resistance, and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude there is no place for antibiotics for people with uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. We could not draw conclusions about children, people with suppressed immune systems, and those with severe sinusitis, because these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults [^117Dg7Rm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses among adults in ambulatory care, accounting for 15% to 21% of all adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. However, the role of antibiotics for sinusitis is controversial.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotics in adults with acute maxillary sinusitis by comparing antibiotics with placebo, antibiotics from different classes and the side effects of different treatments.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013), SIGLE (OpenSIGLE, later OpenGrey (accessed 15 January 2013)), reference lists of the identified trials and systematic reviews of placebo-controlled studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, confirmed or not by imaging or bacterial culture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for differences between intervention and control groups in whether the treatment failed or not. All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted the meta-analyses using either the fixed-effect or random-effects model. In meta-analyses of the placebo-controlled studies, we combined data across antibiotic classes. Primary outcomes were clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow-up. We used GRADEpro to assess the quality of the evidence.

Main Results

We included 63 studies in this updated review; nine placebo-controlled studies involving 1915 participants (seven of the studies clearly conducted in primary care settings) and 54 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics (10 different comparisons). Five studies at low risk of bias comparing penicillin or amoxicillin to placebo provided information on the main outcome: clinical failure rate at 7 to 15 days follow-up, defined as a lack of full recovery or improvement, for participants with symptoms lasting at least seven days. In these studies antibiotics decreased the risk of clinical failure (pooled RR of 0.66, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.94, 1084 participants randomised, 1058 evaluated, moderate quality evidence). However, the clinical benefit was small. Cure or improvement rates were high in both the placebo group (86%) and the antibiotic group (91%) in these five studies. When clinical failure was defined as a lack of full recovery (n = five studies), results were similar: antibiotics decreased the risk of failure (pooled RR of 0.73, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.85, high quality evidence) at 7 to 15 days follow-up. Adverse effects in seven of the nine placebo-controlled studies (comparing penicillin, amoxicillin, azithromycin or moxicillin to placebo) were more common in antibiotic than in placebo groups (median of difference between groups 10.5%, range 2% to 23%). However, drop-outs due to adverse effects were rare in both groups: 1.5% in antibiotic groups and 1% in control groups. In the 10 head-to-head comparisons, none of the antibiotic preparations were superior to another. However, amoxicillin-clavulanate had significantly more drop-outs due to adverse effects than cephalosporins and macrolides.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate evidence that antibiotics provide a small benefit for clinical outcomes in immunocompetent primary care patients with uncomplicated acute sinusitis. However, about 80% of participants treated without antibiotics improved within two weeks. Clinicians need to weigh the small benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects at both the individual and general population levels.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^113AApZc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

For adults seeking care in ambulatory medical practices, sinusitis is the most common diagnosis treated with antibiotics.

Objectives

We examined whether antibiotics are indicated for acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are most effective.

Search Strategy

Relevant studies were identified from searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE in December 2001, contacts with pharmaceutical companies and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials were eligible that compared antibiotic to control or antibiotics from different classes, for acute maxillary sinusitis. Additional criteria for inclusion were diagnostic confirmation by radiograph or sinus aspiration, outcomes that included clinical cure or improvement, and a sample size of 30 or more adults. Of 2058 potentially relevant studies, two or more reviewers identified 49 studies meeting selection criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by two persons and synthesized descriptively. Some data were analyzed quantitatively using a random effects model. Primary outcomes were: a) clinical cure, and b) clinical cure or improvement. Secondary outcomes were radiographic improvement, relapse rates, and dropouts due to adverse effects.

Main Results

Forty-nine trials, involving 13,660 participants, evaluated antibiotic treatment for acute maxillary sinusitis. Major comparisons were antibiotic versus control (n of 5); newer, non-penicillin antibiotic versus penicillin class (n of 10); and amoxicillin-clavulanate versus other extended spectrum antibiotics (n of 17), where n is the number of trials. Most trials were conducted in otolaryngology settings. Only 8 trials described adequate allocation and concealment procedures; 20 were double-blind. Compared to control, penicillin improved clinical cures [relative risk (RR) 1.72; 95% CI 1.00 to 2.96]. Treatment with amoxicillin did not significantly improve cure rates (RR 2.06; 95% CI 0.65 to 6.53) but there was significant variability between studies. Radiographic outcomes were improved by antibiotic treatment. Comparisons between classes of antibiotics showed no significant differences: newer non-penicillins versus penicillins (RR for cure 1.07; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.17); newer non-penicillins versus amoxicillin-clavulanate (RR for cure 1.03; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11). Compared to amoxicillin-clavulanate, dropouts due to adverse effects were significantly lower for cephalosporin antibiotics (RR 0.47; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.73). Relapse rates within one month of successful therapy were 7.7%.

Reviewer's Conclusions

For acute maxillary sinusitis confirmed radiographically or by aspiration, current evidence is limited but supports the use of penicillin or amoxicillin for 7 to 14 days. Clinicians should weigh the moderate benefits of antibiotic treatment against the potential for adverse effects.

### Systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute sinusitis [^115NKemo]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Are oral or parenteral corticosteroids associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with acute sinusitis compared with placebo or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)?

Bottom Line

Oral corticosteroids combined with antibiotics may be associated with modest benefit for short-term relief of symptoms in adults with severe symptoms of acute sinusitis compared with antibiotics alone. Oral corticosteroids as monotherapy are not associated with improved clinical outcomes in adults with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis.

### Acute sinusitis in children: do antibiotics have any role? [^112uxDW8]. The Journal of Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Bacteria can be recovered from paranasal sinuses in the majority of patients given the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS), and bacteriologic cure can be achieved with appropriate antibiotic treatment. The critical question is whether bacteriologic cure correlates with meaningful clinical endpoints such as clinical improvement, reduction in recurrent disease, or prevention of complications. Of the 4 pediatric placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (PCRCTs), 2 suggest superiority of antibiotic treatment and 2 suggest lack of superiority. PCRCTs in adults are mixed as to clinical benefit. Pediatric and adult meta-analyses demonstrate modest benefit of antibiotic therapy and rates of spontaneous recovery without antibiotics of 60–65%. Although retrospective studies indicate that some patients who develop orbital or neurologic complications of sinusitis were pre-treated with antibiotic therapy, a low rate of complications precludes determination of whether antibiotic treatment prevents complications in some proportion of patients. Like the literature evidence, expert guideline recommendations are mixed. Although the evidence base is incomplete and conflicting, the limited data suggest that antibiotics probably do have a role in the treatment of pediatric ABS. The most compelling rationale is prevention of serious complications, but proof for this rationale is lacking.

### Sinusitis (acute) [^113eDFe2]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is defined pathologically, by transient inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses lasting less than 4 weeks. Clinically, it is characterised by nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, facial pain, hyposmia, sneezing, and, if more severe, additional malaise and fever. It affects 1% to 5% of the adult population each year in Europe.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments in people with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, and in people with radiologically or bacteriologically confirmed acute sinusitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 19 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid [co-amoxiclav], doxycycline, cephalosporins, macrolides; different doses, long-course regimens), antihistamines, decongestants (xylometazoline, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), saline nasal washes, steam inhalation, and topical corticosteroids (intranasal).

### Strategies for diagnosing and treating suspected acute bacterial sinusitis: a cost-effectiveness analysis [^111djKtt]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Symptoms suggestive of acute bacterial sinusitis are common. Available diagnostic and treatment options generate substantial costs with uncertain benefits. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies to identify the optimal approach.

Design

For such patients, we created a Markov model to examine four strategies: 1) no antibiotic treatment; 2) empirical antibiotic treatment; 3) clinical criteria-guided treatment; and 4) radiography-guided treatment. The model simulated a 14-day course of illness, included sinusitis prevalence, antibiotic side effects, sinusitis complications, direct and indirect costs, and symptom severity. Strategies costing less than 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained were considered "cost-effective".

Measurements and Main Results

For mild or moderate disease, basing antibiotic treatment on clinical criteria was cost-effective in clinical settings where sinusitis prevalence is within the range of 15% to 93% or 3% to 63%, respectively. For severe disease, or to prevent sinusitis or antibiotic side effect symptoms, use of clinical criteria was cost-effective in settings with lower prevalence (below 51% or 44%, respectively); empirical antibiotics was cost-effective with higher prevalence. Sinus radiography-guided treatment was never cost-effective for initial treatment.

Conclusions

Use of a simple set of clinical criteria to guide treatment is a cost-effective strategy in most clinical settings. Empirical antibiotics are cost-effective in certain settings; however, their use results in many unnecessary prescriptions. If this resulted in increased antibiotic resistance, costs would substantially rise and efficacy would fall. Newer, expensive antibiotics are of limited value. Additional testing is not cost-effective. Further studies are needed to find an accurate, low-cost diagnostic test for acute bacterial sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: management of sinusitis [^114rNTrA]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical practice guideline formulates recommendations for health care providers regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of children, ages 1 to 21 years, with uncomplicated acute, subacute, and recurrent acute bacterial sinusitis. It was developed through a comprehensive search and analysis of the medical literature. Expert consensus opinion was used to enhance or formulate recommendations where data were insufficient. A subcommittee, composed of pediatricians with expertise in infectious disease, allergy, epidemiology, family practice, and pediatric practice, supplemented with an otolaryngologist and radiologist, were selected to formulate the practice parameter. Several other groups (including members of the American College of Emergency Physicians, American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, American Academy of Asthma, Allergy and Immunology, as well as numerous national committees and sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics) have reviewed and revised the guideline. Three specific issues were considered: 1) evidence for the efficacy of various antibiotics in children; 2) evidence for the efficacy of various ancillary, nonantibiotic regimens; and 3) the diagnostic accuracy and concordance of clinical symptoms, radiography (and other imaging methods), and sinus aspiration. It is recommended that the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis be based on clinical criteria in children ≤ 6 years of age who present with upper respiratory symptoms that are either persistent or severe. Although controversial, imaging studies may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis in children > 6 years of age. Computed tomography scans of the paranasal sinuses should be reserved for children who present with complications of acute bacterial sinusitis or who have very persistent or recurrent infections and are not responsive to medical management. There were only 5 controlled randomized trials and 8 case series on antimicrobial therapy for acute bacterial sinusitis in children. However, these data, plus data derived from the study of adults with acute bacterial sinusitis, support the recommendation that acute bacterial sinusitis be treated with antimicrobial therapy to achieve a more rapid clinical cure. Children with complications or suspected complications of acute bacterial sinusitis should be treated promptly and aggressively with antibiotics and, when appropriate, drainage. Based on controversial and limited data, no recommendations are made about the use of prophylactic antimicrobials, ancillary therapies, or complementary/alternative medicine for prevention and treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance in the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children. It is designed to assist pediatricians by providing an analytic framework for evaluation and treatment. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all patients with this condition.

### Clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis [^1119WNTr]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

This executive summary will alert clinicians to key evidence-based statements in a multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline on adult sinusitis developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. Included in the guideline are 17 boldfaced action statements: 3 on viral rhinosinusitis, 7 on acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, and 7 on chronic rhinosinusitis and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis. Evidence profiles that accompany each statement are summarized to show why it was made and how it can be implemented. Guideline statements regarding acute rhinosinusitis focus on diagnosing presumed bacterial illness and using antibiotics appropriately. Guideline statements regarding chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis focus on appropriate use of diagnostic tests. Surgical therapy is not discussed.

### Comparison of antibiotics with placebo for treatment of acute sinusitis: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^111LaJcG]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2008). Medium credibility.

We did a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the therapeutic role of antibiotics for acute sinusitis compared with placebo. Eligible studies were retrieved from PubMed and Scopus. 17 double-blind RCTs were included (three involving children). Acute sinusitis was diagnosed with clinical criteria in nine RCTs, imaging studies in six RCTs, and microbiological or laboratory methods in two RCTs. Amoxicillin was used in ten of 23 antibiotic treatment groups. To account for potential statistical heterogeneity between studies, a random-effects model was used for all analyses. Compared with placebo, antibiotics were associated with a higher rate of cure or improvement (2648 patients, odds ratio [OR] 1.64 [95% CI 1.35–2.00], data from 16 RCTs), or cure alone (1813 patients, OR 1.82 [1.34–2.46], 12 RCTs), but also with more adverse events (1963 patients, OR 1.87 [1.21–2.90], 12 RCTs). The rate of symptom resolution was faster with antibiotics in most RCTs. Disease complications, disease recurrence, and study withdrawals because of adverse events did not differ between compared treatments. In conclusion, use of antibiotics for acute sinusitis confers a small therapeutic benefit over placebo with a corresponding rise in the risk for adverse events. We suggest that antibiotics should be reserved for carefully selected patients with a higher probability for bacterial disease.

### Steroids for acute sinusitis [^114vJmXR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Acute sinusitis is a common reason for primary care visits. It causes significant symptoms and often results in time off work and school.

Objectives

We examined whether intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) are effective in relieving symptoms of acute sinusitis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 2006), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2006), EMBASE (1990 to June 2006) and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were considered eligible if they compared INCS treatment to placebo treatment of a control group for acute sinusitis; acute sinusitis was defined by clinical diagnosis and confirmed by radiological evidence or by nasal endoscopy. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with either resolution or improvement of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were any adverse events that required discontinuation of treatment, drop-outs before the end of the study, rates of relapse, complications and return to school or work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the data, assessed trial quality and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

Main Results

Four studies with 1943 participants met the inclusion criteria. The trials were well designed, double-blind, placebo controlled in which the included participants had acute sinusitis. The treatment assigned was INCS versus control treatment for 15 or 21 days. The rates of loss to follow up in the studies were 7%, 11%, 41% and 10%. When the results from the three trials included in the meta-analysis were combined, participants receiving INCS were more likely to have resolution or improvement of symptoms than those receiving placebo (73% versus 66.4%; RR 1.11; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.18). Higher doses of INCS had a stronger effect on improvement or complete relief of symptoms: for mometasone furoate (MFNS) 400 mcg versus 200 mcg, (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.18 versus RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.11). No significant adverse events were reported and there was no significant difference in the drop-out and recurrence rate for the two treatment groups and for groups receiving higher doses of INCS.

Authors' Conclusions

For acute sinusitis confirmed by radiology or nasal endoscopy, current evidence is limited, but supports the use of INCS as a monotherapy or as an adjuvant therapy to antibiotics. Clinicians should weigh the modest but clinically important benefits against possible minor adverse events when prescribing therapy.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1111sSY3]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Will additional amoxicillin benefit adults with acute bacterial sinusitis treated with standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate?

Findings

This randomized clinical trial of 157 patients with sinusitis was stopped early for futility when an interim analysis showed that a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days was reported by 31 of 70 patients (44.3%) who received a standard dose of amoxicillin plus clavulanate but only 24 of 66 patients (36.4%) receiving a high dose.

Meaning

Additional amoxicillin does not appear to benefit adults receiving standard-dose amoxicillin and clavulanate for acute sinusitis.

### Acute community-acquired bacterial sinusitis: continuing challenges and current management [^112SaKn8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Acute sinusitis is one of the most common infections seen in general clinical practice. The most common cause of acute sinusitis is viral; however, many patients receive a prescription for an antibiotic. Such injudicious prescribing habits have a major impact on health care costs, contribute to the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains of common respiratory pathogens, and reflect many of the challenges in differentiating viral and bacterial disease. Sinus puncture and culture of the aspirate, the diagnostic reference standard in the research setting, are not appropriate for routine clinical practice. However, certain clinical signs and symptoms that do not improve or that worsen after 7–10 days are currently accepted criteria for diagnosis of bacterial sinusitis. Accurate diagnosis can select patients who would benefit most from antimicrobial use. Antimicrobial agents should be selected on the basis of local resistance patterns, and their spectrum of activity should cover the common bacterial pathogens, including resistant strains.

Guideline definitions for evidence-based statements — clinician implications: Table 1 provides categories (strong recommendation, recommendation, option, and no recommendation) with explicit practice implications. Clinicians should follow a strong recommendation unless a clear and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present. Clinicians would be prudent to follow a recommendation, but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. Clinicians should consider the option in their decision-making, and patient preference may have a substantial role. Clinicians should be alert to new published evidence that clarifies the balance of benefit versus harm.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^112sLPyg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis states that clinicians should not routinely prescribe antimicrobial therapy for adults with CRS without acute exacerbation or as a mandatory prerequisite for paranasal sinus imaging or surgery. The action statement identifies aggregate evidence quality Grade A from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials with a high level of confidence, notes the role of patient preferences as limited, and specifies exceptions of acute exacerbation of CRS and odontogenic infection accompanying CRS, with policy level Recommendation. Supporting text notes that first-line treatment for CRS is nasal saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroid spray, and that there is no recent evidence for widespread empiric usage of antibiotic therapy for treating CRS; a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 50 patients studied 3 weeks of treatment with 3 arms, and clinical improvement was noted with the irrigation and the oral steroid arms but not with the antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115hCaj7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Table 5 — Patient information sheet on diagnosis of acute sinusitis — defines key diagnostic features and distinguishes viral from bacterial illness for adults. Sinusitis, also called rhinosinusitis, affects about 1 in 8 adults annually. Acute sinusitis is present with up to 4 weeks of cloudy or colored nasal drainage plus one or both of the following: a stuffy, congested, or blocked nose, and pain, pressure or fullness in the face, head, or around the eyes. Acute viral sinusitis is likely if illness has been present less than 10 days without worsening, whereas acute bacterial sinusitis is likely when there is no improvement within 10 days of getting sick or when symptoms worsen within 10 days after beginning to get better. Because treatment differs by cause, acute viral sinusitis does not benefit from antibiotics, but some patients with acute bacterial sinusitis may get better faster with an antibiotic.

Background

Acute sinusitis is a common reason for primary care visits. It causes significant symptoms and often results in time off work and school.

Objectives

We examined whether intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) are effective in relieving symptoms of acute sinusitis in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 4, MEDLINE (January 1966 to May week 2, 2013), EMBASE (1990 to May 2013) and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing INCS treatment to placebo or no intervention in adults and children with acute sinusitis. Acute sinusitis was defined by clinical diagnosis and confirmed by radiological evidence or by nasal endoscopy. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with either resolution or improvement of symptoms. Secondary outcomes were any adverse events that required discontinuation of treatment, drop-outs before the end of the study, rates of relapse, complications and return to school or work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data, assessed trial quality and resolved discrepancies by consensus.

Main Results

No new trials were found for inclusion in this update. Four studies involving 1943 participants with acute sinusitis met our inclusion criteria. The trials were well-designed and double-blind and studied INCS versus placebo or no intervention for 15 or 21 days. The rates of loss to follow-up were 7%, 11%, 41% and 10%. When we combined the results from the three trials included in the meta-analysis, participants receiving INCS were more likely to experience resolution or improvement in symptoms than those receiving placebo (73% versus 66.4%; risk ratio (RR) 1.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.18). Higher doses of INCS had a stronger effect on improvement of symptoms or complete relief: for mometasone furoate 400 µg versus 200 µg (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.18 versus RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.11). No significant adverse events were reported and there was no significant difference in the drop-out and recurrence rates for the two treatment groups and for groups receiving higher doses of INCS.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence is limited for acute sinusitis confirmed by radiology or nasal endoscopy but supports the use of INCS as a monotherapy or as an adjuvant therapy to antibiotics. Clinicians should weigh the modest but clinically important benefits against possible minor adverse events when prescribing therapy.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis [^115vXTiX]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing sinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis affects 1 in 7 adults in the United States, resulting in about 31 million individuals diagnosed each year. Since sinusitis almost always involves the nasal cavity, the term rhinosinusitis is preferred. The guideline target patient is aged 18 years or older with uncomplicated rhinosinusitis, evaluated in any setting in which an adult with rhinosinusitis would be identified, monitored, or managed. This guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage adults with sinusitis.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, reduce inappropriate use of radiographic imaging, and promote appropriate use of ancillary tests that include nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. In creating this guideline the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation selected a panel representing the fields of allergy, emergency medicine, family medicine, health insurance, immunology, infectious disease, internal medicine, medical informatics, nursing, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, pulmonology, and radiology.

Results

The panel made strong recommendations that 1) clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions, and a clinician should diagnose ABRS when (a) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis are present 10 days or more beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or (b) symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening), and 2) the management of ABRS should include an assessment of pain, with analgesic treatment based on the severity of pain. The panel made a recommendation against radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for acute rhinosinusitis, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected. The panel made recommendations that 1) if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin as first-line therapy for most adults, 2) if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days, the clinician should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, 3) clinicians should distinguish chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms, 4) clinicians should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis for factors that modify management, such as allergic rhinitis, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, ciliary dyskinesia, and anatomic variation, 5) the clinician should corroborate a diagnosis and/or investigate for underlying causes of CRS and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, 6) the clinician should obtain computed tomography of the paranasal sinuses in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 7) clinicians should educate/counsel patients with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis regarding control measures. The panel offered as options that 1) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing viral rhinosinusitis, 2) clinicians may prescribe symptomatic relief in managing ABRS, 3) observation without use of antibiotics is an option for selected adults with uncomplicated ABRS who have mild illness (mild pain and temperature < 38.3 degrees C or 101 degrees F) and assurance of follow-up, 4) the clinician may obtain nasal endoscopy in diagnosing or evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, and 5) the clinician may obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis.

Disclaimer

This clinical practice guideline is not intended as a sole source of guidance for managing adults with rhinosinusitis. Rather, it is designed to assist clinicians by providing an evidence-based framework for decision-making strategies. It is not intended to replace clinical judgment or establish a protocol for all individuals with this condition, and may not provide the only appropriate approach to diagnosing and managing this problem.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^114SXcRP]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

How can clinicians help their patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis as defined by the current IDSA guidelines? This randomized clinical trial found that adding more amoxicillin to the standard, but minimally beneficial, treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate does not appear to be the answer. Quinolones have shown some efficacybut are not without risks, including black box warnings. The best policy may be, therefore, to emphasize the use, also in accordance with IDSA guidelines, of saline flushes and nasal steroids.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^112tjjJt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

If acute and chronic cases are combined, rhinosinusitis (RS) is currently the most common indication for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. There are several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrating no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold/acute RS (ARS). and some evidence supporting the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of a select group of patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), However, there are only two published placebo-controlled randomized trials of antibiotic efficacy for chronic RS (CRS), defined as RS symptoms lasting > 12 weeks. Guidelines differ regarding whether antibiotics should be included as part of the regimen for medical therapy for CRS, which reflects both the paucity of rigorous and consistent evidence supporting their efficacy and the persisting uncertainty about the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of CRS. This article will review the rationale for and against antibiotic treatment of CRS based on available clinical evidence as well as the current understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. We will focus primarily on diffuse primary CRS in adults but antibiotic recommendations for some special considerations will be discussed also. The review will not cover the role of antifungals in the treatment of fungal sinusitis.

CRS encompasses a complex, heterogeneous group of debilitating chronic inflammatory sinonasal diseases. The changing of treatment recommendations over time reflects the evolving understanding of the pathogenesis of the various phenotypes and endotypes. Despite being the subject of considerable research, the etiology of CRS remains poorly understood. A wide range of potential causative agents have been investigated: microbes, aberrant inflammatory patterns, anatomic variations, the genetics underlying the innate immune system and epithelial barrier integrity and mucociliary clearance, hypersensitivities associated with asthma, hormonal imbalance, autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiency. There is little doubt that the condition is multifactorial. Defining the therapeutic role of antibiotics requires some understanding of the pathogenic role of bacteria in CRS.

Adult sinusitis guideline — management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) treatment failure specifies that if the patient fails to improve or worsens despite being on an appropriate antibiotic for 3–5 days, the clinician should reassess to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications, and if ABRS is confirmed, change the antibiotic. Recommendation.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116tfRog]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) in most adults — initial antibiotic and duration: If a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic agent, the clinician should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as first-line therapy for 5–7 days for most adults. This is a Recommendation based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneity and noninferiority design, with Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of Confidence in Evidence: Moderate. Benefits-harms assessment indicates a preponderance of benefit over harm, while risks include potential increased gastrointestinal adverse effects with amoxicillin-clavulanate and adverse effects from penicillin allergy. Exceptions include patients with penicillin allergy for whom amoxicillin is contraindicated. Intentional vagueness states that whether to prescribe amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is at the clinician's discretion and that "most" adults are recommended 5 days of therapy, although a longer course may be appropriate for more severe illness or persistent symptoms beyond the initial 5 days. Role of patient preferences is moderate for shared decision making and large for determining duration since adverse events are reduced with shorter duration of therapy.

### Systemic corticosteroids for acute sinusitis [^112U5ttG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute sinusitis is the inflammation and swelling of the nasal and paranasal mucous membranes and is a common reason for patients to seek primary care consultations. The related impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is attributable to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic corticosteroids on clinical response rates and to determine adverse effects and relapse rates of systemic corticosteroids compared to placebo or standard clinical care in children and adults with acute sinusitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (January 2009 to February 2014).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

Main Results

Five RCTs with a total of 1193 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged methodological quality to be moderate in four trials and high in one trial. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in four trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in one trial). In four trials antibiotics were prescribed in addition to oral corticosteroids or control treatment, while one trial investigated the effects of oral corticosteroids as a monotherapy. When combining data from the five trials, participants treated with oral corticosteroids were more likely to have short-term resolution or improvement of symptoms than those receiving the control treatment: at days three to seven (risk ratio (RR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 1.6; risk difference (RD) 17%, 95% CI 6% to 29%) and at days four to 14 (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.5; RD 14%, 95% CI 1% to 27%). A sensitivity analysis including the four trials with placebo as a control treatment showed similar results but with a lesser effect size: at days three to seven (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3; RD 11%, 95% CI 4% to 17%) and days four to 14 (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2; RD 8%, 95% CI 2% to 13%). Statistical heterogeneity was high for many analyses. Subgroup analyses revealed that corticosteroid monotherapy had no beneficial effects. Furthermore, scenario analysis showed that outcomes missing from the trial reports might have introduced attrition bias (a worst-case scenario showed no statistically significant beneficial effect of oral corticosteroids). No trial reported effects on relapse or recurrence rates. Reported side effects in patients treated with oral corticosteroids were mild (nausea, vomiting, gastric complaints) and did not significantly differ from those receiving placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

Oral corticosteroids as a monotherapy appear to be ineffective for adult patients with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis. Current data on the use of oral corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy to oral antibiotics are limited: almost all trials are performed in secondary care settings and there is a significant risk of bias. This limited evidence suggests that oral corticosteroids in combination with antibiotics may be modestly beneficial for short-term relief of symptoms in acute sinusitis, with a number needed to treat to benefit of seven for resolution or symptom improvement. A large primary care factorial trial is needed to establish whether oral corticosteroids offer additional benefits over antibiotics in acute sinusitis.

Background

Acute sinusitis is a common reason for patients to seek primary care consultations. The related impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is attributable to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of systemic corticosteroids in relieving symptoms of acute sinusitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 2, 2011, which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) Group's Specialised Register, the Database of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the NHS Health Economics Database, MEDLINE (1966 to June week 2, 2011) and EMBASE (January 2009 to June 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed methodological quality of the trials and extracted data.

Main Results

Four RCTs with a total of 1008 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged studies to be of moderate methodological quality. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants received oral antibiotics and were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in three trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in one trial). In all trials, participants treated with oral corticosteroids were more likely to have short-term resolution or improvement of symptoms than those receiving the control treatment: at Days 3 to 7, risk ratio (RR) 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8; risk difference (RD) 20% (6% to 34%) and at Days 4 to 10 or 12, RR 1.3, 95% CI (1.0 to 1.7), RD 18% (3% to 33%). An analysis of the three trials with placebo as a control treatment showed similar results but with a lesser effect size: Days 3 to 6: RR 1.2, 95% CI (1.1 to 1.4), RD 12% (5% to 19%) and Days 4 to 10 or 12: RR 1.1, 95% CI (1.0 to 1.2), RD 10% (3% to 16%). Scenario analysis showed that outcomes missing from the trial reports might have introduced attrition bias (a worst-case scenario showed no statistically significant beneficial effect of oral corticosteroids). We did not identify any data on the long-term effects of oral corticosteroids on this condition, such as effects on relapse or recurrence rates. Reported side effects of oral corticosteroids were limited and mild.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence suggests that oral corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy to oral antibiotics are effective for short-term relief of symptoms in acute sinusitis. However, data are limited and there is a significant risk of bias. High quality trials assessing the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids both as an adjuvant and a monotherapy in primary care patients with acute sinusitis should be initiated.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis? [^116GSbUg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics, based on current evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and will also summarize the current guidelines.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^117BuRsZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis — initial management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) states: "Clinicians should offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) for adults with uncomplicated ABRS with assurance of follow-up", and "The duration of watchful waiting may depend on the factors and timing under which the diagnosis was originally made". Evidence qualifiers include "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A", "Level of Confidence in Evidence: Medium", and "Policy level: Recommendation". The update specifies "reduced watchful waiting to 3 to 5 days duration from time of diagnosis", while prior guidance "endorsed watchful waiting without an antibiotic… even when signs and symptoms had persisted for 10 days or longer". Patient preference has a "Large role for shared decision-making for watchful waiting vs. antibiotic therapy". Exceptions include "Complicated sinusitis, immune deficiency, or coexisting bacterial illness", and the clinician should consider age, general health, cardiopulmonary status, co-morbid conditions, and factors suggesting "severe" disease when assessing suitability; the guideline notes "the strengthening of the recommendation of watchful waiting to the default initial therapy", with allowance to differ "when the clinician believes that 'severe' disease requires antibiotic therapy".

Each year, around 20 in every 1,000 people in the UK consult their GP about a suspected sinus infection,1 which means that each GP sees an average of about 50 such cases annually.2 Although most people recover from acute sinusitis with or without treatment within 10 days of seeing a GP,2 it is estimated that around 92% of those who consult their GP with a sinus infection are prescribed an antibacterial.1 Here we review the management of patients with acute sinusitis, and the place of antibacterial and other treatments.

### Evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of acute uncomplicated sinusitis in children: a systematic review [^117BP3u8]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

In 2001, the American Academy of Pediatrics published clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) in children. The technical report accompanying those guidelines included 21 studies that assessed the diagnosis and management of ABS in children. This update to that report incorporates studies of pediatric ABS that have been performed since 2001. Overall, 17 randomized controlled trials of the treatment of sinusitis in children were identified and analyzed. Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy have been published. The results of these studies varied, likely due to differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria. Because of this heterogeneity, formal meta-analyses were not performed. However, qualitative analysis of these studies suggests that children with greater severity of illness at presentation are more likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy. An additional 5 trials compared different antimicrobial therapies but did not include placebo groups. Six trials assessed a variety of ancillary treatments for ABS in children, and 3 focused on subacute sinusitis. Although the number of pediatric trials has increased since 2001, there are still limited data to guide the diagnosis and management of ABS in children. Diagnostic and treatment guidelines focusing on severity of illness at the time of presentation have the potential to identify those children most likely to benefit from antimicrobial therapy and at the same time minimize unnecessary use of antibiotics

Amoxicillin with or without clavulanate is the first-line treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. Clinicians should reassess initial management if there is caregiver report of worsening or failure to improve within 72 hours of initial management, and if the diagnosis is confirmed with worsening symptoms or failure to improve, clinicians may change the antibiotic therapy or initiate antibiotic treatment of the child initially managed with observation.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^113CWCdx]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Adult sinusitis guideline — Statement 1a (differential diagnosis of acute rhinosinusitis) states that clinicians should distinguish presumed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) from acute rhinosinusitis caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions. A clinician should diagnose ABRS when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis (purulent nasal drainage accompanied by nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, or both) persist without evidence of improvement for at least 10 days beyond the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, or when symptoms or signs of acute rhinosinusitis worsen within 10 days after an initial improvement (double worsening). This is a strong recommendation based on diagnostic studies with minor limitations and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile notes a quality improvement opportunity to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics for presumed viral infections, aggregate evidence quality Grade B and Level of Confidence in Evidence Medium, a benefits-harm assessment of preponderance of benefit over harm, and harms including the risk of misclassifying acute bacterial rhinosinusitis as viral, or vice-versa, with intentional vagueness and role of patient preferences listed as none.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^116uiYM7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — definition and timing of antibiotic treatment failure are specified as follows: For patients who have started on antibiotic therapy, treatment failure is defined as worsening of symptoms or failure to improve after 3 to 5 days, with worsening defined as the progression of presenting signs or symptoms of ABRS or the onset of new signs or symptoms, and failure to improve defined as a lack of reduction in presenting signs or symptoms of ABRS that would not apply if symptoms are persistent yet gradually improving. The statement lists "Policy level: Option". Fluctuations in signs and symptoms within the first 48 to 72 hours of initial therapy were not uncommon and not necessarily indicative of failure. Prior guidelines noted an "acceptable percentage of poor outcomes" when failure was defined at 7 days, but subsequent studies demonstrate an early response to effective antibiotic therapy, usually within 3 days, and the GUG felt that keeping a 7‑day cut‑point before changing antibiotics would result in more than an "acceptable percentage of poor outcomes".

### Principles of appropriate antibiotic use for acute rhinosinusitis in adults: background [^116JknDp]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The following principles of appropriate antibiotic use for adults with acute rhinosinusitis apply to the diagnosis and treatment of acute maxillary and ethmoid rhinosinusitis in adults who are not immunocompromised. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis diagnosed in ambulatory care are caused by uncomplicated viral upper respiratory tract infections. Bacterial and viral rhinosinusitis are difficult to differentiate on clinical grounds. The clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be reserved for patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms lasting 7 days or more who have maxillary pain or tenderness in the face or teeth (especially when unilateral) and purulent nasal secretions. Patients with rhinosinusitis symptoms that last less than 7 days are unlikely to have bacterial infection, although rarely some patients with acute bacterial rhinosinusitis present with dramatic symptoms of severe unilateral maxillary pain, swelling, and fever. Sinus radiography is not recommended for diagnosis in routine cases. Acute rhinosinusitis resolves without antibiotic treatment in most cases. Symptomatic treatment and reassurance is the preferred initial management strategy for patients with mild symptoms. Antibiotic therapy should be reserved for patients with moderately severe symptoms who meet the criteria for the clinical diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and for those with severe rhinosinusitis symptoms-especially those with unilateral facial pain-regardless of duration of illness. For initial treatment, the most narrow-spectrum agent active against the likely pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, should be used.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of antimicrobial treatment for children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis [^115JMaDZ]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Although antimicrobial treatment for children with acute sinusitis is used commonly, it is unclear whether it offers significant clinical benefit. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of antimicrobial treatments for acute sinusitis as they are used in community pediatric practice.

Methods

We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 3 community pediatric practices in St Louis, Missouri. A total of 188 patients who were between the ages of 1 and 18 years and who had had 10 to 28 days of persistent sinus symptoms and a clinical diagnosis of acute sinusitis were randomized to receive 14 days of amoxicillin (40 mg/kg/d in 3 daily doses), amoxicillin-clavulanate (amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/d in 2 daily doses), or placebo. Change in sinus symptoms was assessed both by a quantitative symptom score (the S5 score) and subjectively by the parent. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects of treatment and recurrence or relapse of sinus symptoms. Outcomes were assessed by telephone interviews over a 2-month period.

Results

Of the 161 patients who were included in the analysis, 58 received amoxicillin, 48 received amoxicillin-clavulanate, and 55 received placebo. Day 14 improvement rates were 79%, 81%, and 79%, respectively. There were no differences in the 14-day change in S5 score among treatment groups. The rates of adverse events (amoxicillin, 19%; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 11%; placebo, 10%), relapse (amoxicillin, 12%; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 13%; placebo, 13%), and recurrence (amoxicillin, 9%; amoxicillin-clavulanate, 13%; placebo, 13%) of sinus symptoms were similar among treatment groups.

Conclusion

Neither amoxicillin nor amoxicillin-clavulanate offered any clinical benefit compared with placebo for children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^114NUEJG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Modifying factors in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) should be evaluated by clinicians, who should assess the patient with CRS or RARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, aspirin‑exacerbated respiratory disease, and ciliary dyskinesia. This recommendation is based on multiple systematic reviews and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm, and the quality improvement opportunity is to promote effective treatment by identifying comorbid conditions known to accompany CRS and RARS, knowledge of which would improve sinusitis management and, conversely, management of sinusitis may improve the associated chronic condition (asthma).

Acute bacterial sinusitis in children — initial management by severity: Children with persistent sinusitis may be managed with either an antibiotic or an additional brief period of observation, allowing up to another 3 days to improve, whereas all children diagnosed with severe or worsening sinusitis should start antibiotic treatment. Observation is reasonable because some episodes of persistent sinusitis may improve on their own, and antibiotics can have adverse effects including vomiting, diarrhea, upset stomach, skin rash, allergic reactions, yeast infections, and development of resistant bacteria.

### Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis: clinical impact of resistance and susceptibility [^113LadA3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Sinusitis is a common disorder associated with notable direct and indirect economic costs. Acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a relatively poorly defined clinical syndrome characterized by a high spontaneous resolution rate, wide variations in presenting symptoms, and an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical course of the disease. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the most common causative pathogens in adult ABRS. A relative lack of bacteriological eradication data compared with other respiratory illnesses, uncertainty on the part of many clinicians as to when to treat, and increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance hamper logical treatment strategies. Because it is impossible to know which cases of ABRS will spontaneously resolve and which will not, antimicrobials are recommended. In general, antimicrobial treatment for ABRS should cover both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae while considering the risk of infection with resistant organisms. Treatment guidelines for ABRS were developed by the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership in 2000 and were updated in 2004. This article discusses a Sinusitis Therapeutic Outcome Model, a data-driven model used in the development of the treatment guidelines, with respect to different scenarios involving ABRS to illustrate the implications of antimicrobial selection on therapeutic outcome.

### Intranasal corticosteroids in management of acute sinusitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Nbh4u]. Annals of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

Acute sinusitis is a common condition in ambulatory care, where it is frequently treated with antibiotics, despite little evidence of their benefit. Intranasal corticosteroids might relieve symptoms; however, evidence for this benefit is currently unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of intranasal corticosteroids on the symptoms of acute sinusitis.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases until February 2011 for studies comparing intranasal corticosteroids with placebo in children or adults having clinical symptoms and signs of acute sinusitis or rhinosinusitis in ambulatory settings. We excluded chronic/allergic sinusitis. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the studies' methodologic quality.

Results

We included 6 studies having a total of 2,495 patients. In 5 studies, antibiotics were prescribed in addition to corticosteroids or placebo. Intranasal corticosteroids resulted in a significant, small increase in resolution of or improvement in symptoms at days 14 to 21 (risk difference [RD] = 0.08; 95% CI, 0.03–0.13). Analysis of individual symptom scores revealed most consistently significant benefits for facial pain and congestion. Subgroup analysis by time of reported outcomes showed a significant beneficial effect at 21 days (RD = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06–0.17), but not at 14 to 15 days (RD = 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11). Meta-regression analysis of trials using different doses of mometasone furoate showed a significant dose-response relationship (P = 0.02).

Conclusions

Intranasal corticosteroids offer a small therapeutic benefit in acute sinusitis, which may be greater with high doses and with courses of 21 days' duration. Further trials are needed in antibiotic-naïve patients.

CONSORT Flow Diagram: Patients Treated for Acute Sinusitis

IDSA indicates Infectious Disease Society of America.

Of the 157 patients enrolled, the mean age was 48.5 (range, 18.7–84.0) years, and 117 (74.5%) were women. Seventy-nine patients were randomized to the standard-dose arm (60 women [76.0%]; mean [SD] age, 48.5 [16.2] years) and 78 to the high-dose arm (57 women [73.1%]; mean [SD] age, 48.5 [15.8] years). The other baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The only significant differences between treatment groups were a longer mean [SD] duration of illness in those randomized to the standard dose (17.1 [2.7] days) than the high dose (13.9 [1.4] days) and a higher percentage with allergic rhinitis in the standard-dose group (21 [26.6%] vs 10 [12.8%]). In line with the progressive loss to follow-up and the incomplete collection of data, the results in Table 2 provide the actual numerator and denominator for each outcome.

### Current concepts in adult acute rhinosinusitis [^1156AdH2]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is one of the most common conditions that physicians treat in ambulatory care. Most cases of acute rhinosinusitis are caused by viral upper respiratory infections. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data found that common clinical signs and symptoms were not effective for identifying patients with rhinosinusitis who would benefit from antibiotics. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are somewhat useful tests for confirming acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis. Four signs and symptoms that significantly increase the likelihood of a bacterial cause when present are double sickening, purulent rhinorrhea, erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than 10 mm per hour, and purulent secretion in the nasal cavity. Although cutoffs vary depending on the guideline, antibiotic therapy should be considered when rhinosinusitis symptoms fail to improve within seven to 10 days or if they worsen at any time. First-line antibiotics include amoxicillin with or without clavulanate. Current guidelines support watchful waiting within the first seven to 10 days after upper respiratory symptoms first appear. Evidence on the use of analgesics, intranasal corticosteroids, and saline nasal irrigation for the treatment of acute rhinosinusitis is poor. Nonetheless, these therapies may be used to treat symptoms within the first 10 days of upper respiratory infection. Radiography is not recommended in the evaluation of uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. For patients who do not respond to treatment, computed tomography of the sinuses without contrast media is helpful to evaluate for possible complications or anatomic abnormalities. Referral to an otolaryngologist is indicated when symptoms persist after maximal medical therapy and if any rare complications are suspected.

Severe-onset cases are presumed bacterial because "a temperature of at least 39°C/102.2°F coexisting for at least 3 consecutive days with purulent nasal discharge is not consistent with the well-documented pattern of acute viral URI", and "children with worsening-course acute bacterial sinusitis have a clinical course that is also not consistent with the steady improvement that characterizes an uncomplicated viral URI"; additionally, "In both guidelines, however, children presenting with severe or worsening illness (which was not defined explicitly in the 2001 guideline) are to receive antibiotic therapy".

Statement 7a: Diagnosis of Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) or Recurrent Acute Rhinosinusitis (RARS) — Clinicians should distinguish CRS and RARS from isolated episodes of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and other causes of sinonasal symptoms. This recommendation is based on cohort and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action profile specifies a quality improvement opportunity to promote effective communication and coordination of care by raising awareness of the distinct clinical entities of CRS and RARS so that appropriate management strategies may be implemented; aggregate evidence quality is Grade C (cohort and observational studies) with a high level of confidence in evidence. Benefits are to distinguish conditions that might benefit from additional management strategies than isolated cases of ABRS, while risks include potential misclassification due to overlapping symptomatology with other illnesses; no cost. The benefits-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, with value judgments emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis, intentional vagueness noted as none, and the role of patient preferences as not applicable.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1141cYfL]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute sinusitis is a common outpatient diagnosis and is typically treated with antibiotics even though the current recommended regimen (875 mg of amoxicillin with 125 mg of clavulanate by mouth twice a day)has been shown in clinical trials to provide only minimal benefit beyond placebo. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommends using high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate (containing amoxicillin 2000 mg rather than 875 mg twice a day) only when the prevalence in the community of penicillin-resistant pneumococci exceeds 10%. However, few primary care clinicians will know this prevalence, and evidence from studies in children of the penetration of amoxicillin into middle ear fluidand of the treatment of acute sinusitis with high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanatesuggests that higher-dose amoxicillin might provide more benefit to adults as well, even in areas with a low prevalence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed from 2014 to 2017 comparing high-dose and standard-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate for adults with clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis. That study confirmed that very few individuals carried resistant bacteria. The primary outcome was the participants' subjective rating of improvement after 3 days of treatment, knowing that most people get better by 2 weeks but value rapid relief and that the benefit of other common treatments — eg, for streptococcal pharyngitisand influenza — is largely a quicker improvement. The study drug was the extended-release formulation of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate. Midway through the trial, the manufacturer stopped producing all formulations of the study drug. The study drug was transitioned to a combination of standard immediate-release amoxicillin with clavulanate (875/125 mg) and immediate-release amoxicillin (875 mg) twice a day. Unexpectedly, the extended-release formulation provided no significant benefit, but the immediate-release formulation did; in the second, immediate-release part of the study, 52% of participants receiving the high dose rated symptoms as "a lot better" at the end of 3 days of treatment vs 34% receiving the standard dose (P = 0.04).

### Cyclamen europaeum extract for acute sinusitis [^113tCUvJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute sinusitis is a common reason for primary care encounters. It causes significant symptoms including facial pain, congested nose, headache, thick nasal mucus, fever, and cough and often results in time off work or school. Sinusitis treatment focuses on eliminating causative factors and controlling the inflammatory and infectious components. The frozen, dried, natural fluid extract of the Cyclamen europaeum plant delivered intranasally is thought to have beneficial effects in relieving congestion by facilitating nasal drainage, and has an anti-inflammatory effect.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of topical intranasal Cyclamen europaeum extract on clinical response in adults and children with acute sinusitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registers (ClinicalTrials.gov; WHO ICTRP) in January 2018. We also searched the reference lists of included studies and review literature for further relevant studies and contacted trial authors for additional information.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing Cyclamen europaeum extract administered intranasally to placebo, antibiotics, intranasal corticosteroids, or no treatment in adults or children, or both, with acute sinusitis. Acute sinusitis was defined by clinical diagnosis and confirmed by nasal endoscopy or by radiological evidence.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included two randomised controlled trials that involved a total of 147 adult outpatients with acute sinusitis confirmed by radiology or nasal endoscopy who were assigned to Cyclamen europaeum nasal spray or placebo study arms for up to 15 days. The risk of selection and detection bias was unclear, as allocation concealment and blinding of outcome assessors were not reported in either study. Attrition was high (60%) in one study, although dropouts were balanced between study arms. Neither study reported our two primary outcomes: proportion of participants whose symptoms resolved or improved at 14 days and 30 days. No serious adverse events or complications related to treatment were reported; however, more mild adverse events such as nasal and throat irritation, mild epistaxis, and sneezing occurred in Cyclamen europaeum group participants (50%) compared to placebo group participants (24%) (risk ratio 2.11, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 3.29); moderate-quality evidence.

Authors' Conclusions

The effectiveness of Cyclamen europaeum for people with acute sinusitis is unknown. Although no serious side effects were observed, 50% of participants who received Cyclamen europaeum reported adverse events compared with 24% of those who received placebo.

### Acute sinusitis in children [^11681APj]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis is a common illness in children. Viral upper respiratory tract infection is the most common presentation of rhinosinusitis. Most children resolve the infection spontaneously and only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection. The proper choice of antibiotic therapy depends on the likely infecting pathogens, bacterial antibiotic resistance, and pharmacologic profiles of antibiotics. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is currently recommended as the empiric treatment in those requiring antimicrobial therapy. Isolation of the causative agents should be considered in those who failed the initial treatment. In addition to antibiotics, adjuvant therapies and surgery may be used in the management of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^113pi1at]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Acute bacterial sinusitis is common, but currently recommended antibiotic treatment provides minimal benefit.

Objective

To confirm the previous finding that high-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate (with double the amount of amoxicillin) may be superior to standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate in adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This double-blind, comparative-effectiveness randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 26, 2018, through May 10, 2020, at the academic primary care internal medicine and pediatrics practice of Albany Medical Center, located in Cohoes, New York. Participants included adults aged 18 years or older who were prescribed amoxicillin plus clavulanate for acute bacterial sinusitis diagnosed in accordance with the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.

Interventions

Amoxicillin 875 mg with clavulanate 125 mg plus either placebo (standard dose) or amoxicillin 875 mg (high dose) twice a day for 7 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy outcome was a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at the end of 3 days of treatment using a Global Rating of Improvement scale, with outcomes ranging from 1 (a lot worse) to 6 (no symptoms). The primary adverse effect outcome was severe diarrhea at 3 or 10 days after the start of treatment.

Results

At an unplanned interim analysis prompted by COVID-19 restrictions, 157 of a projected 240 participants had been enrolled (mean age, 48.5 [range, 18.7–84.0] years; 117 women [74.5%]), with 79 randomized to the standard dose and 78 to the high dose; 9 and 12, respectively, withdrew or were lost to follow-up before the assessment of the primary outcome. At day 3, 31 of 70 participants (44.3%) in the standard-dose group reported a global rating of "a lot better" or "no symptoms", as did 24 of 66 (36.4%) in the high-dose group, for a difference of -7.9% (95% CI, -24.4% to 8.5%; p = 0.35). The study was, therefore, stopped for futility. Diarrhea was common in both groups by day 3, with any diarrhea reported in 29 of 71 participants (40.8%) receiving the standard dose and 28 of 65 (43.1%) receiving the high dose and severe diarrhea reported in 5 of 71 (7.0%) and 5 of 65 (7.7%), respectively.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that adults treated for clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis did not appear to benefit from taking high-dose compared with standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate.

### Acute and chronic bacterial sinusitis [^111gAkAy]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Sinusitis is one of the most common complaints resulting in physician visits in the United States. An antecedent viral infection of the upper respiratory tract is the most common presentation. Despite its prevalence, most cases resolve spontaneously. Only a small proportion develops a secondary bacterial infection that will benefit from antimicrobial therapy. This article discusses the microbiology and pathogenesis of acute and chronic bacterial sinusitis. The role anaerobic bacterial in chronic and recurrent sinusitis is emphasized, and appropriate antimicrobial regimens are discussed.

### Decongestants, antihistamines and nasal irrigation for acute sinusitis in children [^115A5y7R]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of decongestants, antihistamines and nasal irrigation in children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis has not been systematically evaluated.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy of decongestants, antihistamines or nasal irrigation in improving symptoms of acute sinusitis in children.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1950 to June week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (1950 to June 2014).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs, which evaluated children younger than 18 years of age with acute sinusitis, defined as 10 to 30 days of rhinorrhea, congestion or daytime cough. We excluded trials of children with chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed each study for inclusion.

Main Results

Of the 662 studies identified through the electronic searches and handsearching, none met all the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to determine whether the use of antihistamines, decongestants or nasal irrigation is efficacious in children with acute sinusitis. Further research is needed to determine whether these interventions are beneficial in the treatment of children with acute sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^1118BtKs]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

Table 2 — Initial antibiotic use for acute bacterial sinusitis in children delineates therapy by presentation: for uncomplicated disease, the table lists Antibiotic therapy for severe and worsening illness and Antibiotic therapy or additional observation for 3 days for persistent illness, and for acute bacterial sinusitis with orbital or intracranial complications it lists Antibiotic therapy. Severe acute bacterial sinusitis is defined as temperature ≥ 39°C with purulent nasal discharge present concurrently for at least 3 consecutive days; worsening illness is defined by sudden worsening with new-onset fever ≥ 38° C/100.4° F or substantial increase in nasal discharge or cough after transient improvement; persistent illness is defined by nasal discharge, daytime cough, or both, persisting for > 10 days without improvement. A footnote notes an "Opportunity for shared decision-making" and that a mechanism must be in place to ensure follow-up and begin antibiotics if the child worsens at any time or fails to improve within 3 days of observation.

### Patterns of care before and after the adult sinusitis clinical practice guideline [^116Ckzhk]. The Laryngoscope (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Determine if patterns of care for acute sinusitis have changed after the publication of the adult sinusitis clinical practice guideline.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study with historical controls.

Methods

Cases of adult acute sinusitis occurring in 2005–2006 (before guideline publication) and 2009–2010 (> 1 year after guideline publication) were extracted from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey. Changes in the rates of analgesic recommendations, oral antibiotic prescriptions, and choice of antibiotic therapy were determined and compared before and after guideline publication and relative to guideline recommendations.

Results

An estimated 18.1 ± 1.8 million cases of adult acute sinusitis were studied before (7.9 ± 0.9 million visits for 2005–2006) and after (10.2 ± 1.5 million visits for 2009–2010) guideline publication. Recommendation rates for analgesics did not change significantly (18.9% before vs. 23.0% after, P = 0.470). The proportion of patients receiving oral antibiotics increased after guideline publication (75.5% before vs. 85.7% after, P = 0.021). In keeping with guideline recommendations, the proportion of patients treated with amoxicillin as the agent of choice when antibiotics are prescribed increased from 8.1% to 29.4% after guideline publication (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

Care patterns for the medical treatment of acute adult sinusitis have changed after guideline publication, with an increase in oral antibiotic prescription rates in cases of acute sinusitis and increase in the use of amoxicillin as the first-line antimicrobial agent. The latter is strongly in keeping with guideline recommendation. Clinicians' espousal of the analgesic recommendations likely needs improvement to better comply with guideline recommendations.

### Beginning antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis and choosing the right treatment [^117KCuAX]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) is an extremely common problem in both children and adults. There are three clinical presentations of acute sinusitis: (1) onset with persistent symptoms (nasal symptoms or cough or both for > 10 but < 30 d without evidence of improvement); (2) onset with severe symptoms (high fever and purulent nasal discharge for 3–4 consecutive days); and (3) onset with worsening symptoms (respiratory symptoms, with or without fever, which worsen after several days of improvement). Images to confirm the presence of acute sinusitis are necessary in older children (> 6 years) and adults to enhance the certainty of diagnosis. The predominant bacterial species that are implicated in acute sinusitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in children. In the last decade, there has been an increasing prevalence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, and beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. Although there has been some controversy in the literature regarding the effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of ABS, most studies in which the diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis is confirmed with images and appropriate anti-biotics are prescribed show superior outcomes in recipients of antibiotics. Therapy may be initiated with high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate. In penicillin-allergic patients or those who are unresponsive to amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate. Alternatives include cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, or cefdinir. In cases of serious drug allergy, clarithromycin or azithromycin may be prescribed. The optimal duration of therapy is unknown. Some recommend treatment until the patient becomes free of symptoms and then for an additional 7 d.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^1156yd7R]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized clinical trial, we did not find a benefit to patients of treating clinically diagnosed acute bacterial sinusitis with high-dose rather than standard-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate. This finding is disappointing because the IDSA-recommended standard dosehas a limited effect (vs placebo). This outcome is also surprising in light of the promising results of the previous trial.

Why would we get such very different results? First, the current trial suffered from an incomplete collection of data (although mostly for the secondary outcomes). Yet these missing data cannot explain such a pronounced lack of benefit. A best-case analysis of the missing primary outcomes made only a modest difference. We found no important changes in baseline characteristics in the participants who remained at the end of days 3 and 10, and it seemed futile to continue recruitment to achieve the planned number of participants. Second, the 2 groups were not completely similar at baseline. Standard-dose participants reported a longer average duration of illness; therefore, more of them might have had spontaneous improvement unrelated to antibiotic dose by the end of day 3. However, the actual impact of duration of illness appeared to be minimal. In addition, even if an effect of allergic rhinitis in diminishing the response to antibiotics had been found, it would have reduced primary outcomes in more participants in the standard-dose group. Third, one or both of the studies may have suffered from a randomly skewed, nonrepresentative sample of participants. Whatever the explanation, the addition of the current participants to those from our previous study reduced the benefit of high-dose amoxicillin with clavulanate to statistical nonsignificance.

Three secondary findings are of interest. First, the frequency of diarrhea and vaginal yeast infections was quite high, even though most cases were mild. Second, patients who reported they were prone to adverse effects were more likely to experience them. Whether or not this outcome represented a self-fulfilling prophecy, this information would seem important when discussing with patients the pros and cons of antibiotic treatment. Third, the large number of patients with presumed penicillin allergy (Figure 1) underlines the need for more widespread testing for penicillin allergy. As shown in multiple studies, most of these patients do not have, or no longer have, an allergy to penicillin and can benefit from having the option of treatment with a penicillin.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^113waBfR]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Outcomes

The primary efficacy outcome was the percentage of participants in each group assigning a GRI of 5 or 6 ("a lot better" or "no symptoms") at the end of 3 days of treatment. The secondary efficacy outcomes were the percentage in each group assigning a GRI of 5 or 6 at day 10 and the mean extent of improvement of the total SNOT-16 score at days 3 and 10. The total SNOT-16 score was the sum of all 16 symptoms rated on a scale of 0 (no problem) to 3 (severe problem), with a possible range of 0 to 48. The primary adverse effect outcome was a score of 3 (severe) for diarrhea at day 3 or 10.

Sample Size

The previous studyfound that 34% of the participants in the standard-dose group reported a GRI of 5 or 6 at the end of 3 days. We estimated that a sample size of 115 in each group would give us 80% power to detect an increase of 18 percentage points in the GRI among those in the high-dose group (ie, an increase to 52%, as reported previously) with an α of.05 for a 2-sided test. We aimed, therefore, to enroll 240 patients (anticipating 10 dropouts before day 3).

### A trial of high-dose, short-course levofloxacin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis [^111chAJn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Compare two dosage strengths of levofloxacin in the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis.

Study Design and Setting

Multicenter clinical trial comparing levofloxacin 750 mg for 5 days vs levofloxacin 500 mg for 10 days.

Results

Sinus fluid samples were obtained by antral puncture (59.2%) or by sinus endoscopy (40.8%). Among microbiologically evaluable patients, 91.4% (139/152) of patients receiving levofloxacin 750 mg achieved clinical success vs 88.6% (132/149) of patients receiving levofloxacin 500 mg (95% CI -10.0, 4.2). Clinical success rates by pathogen were above 90% in both treatment groups for the 3 typical pathogens of acute sinusitis: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The safety profile of the 2 dosage strengths was similar.

Conclusion

Levofloxacin 750 mg for 5 days is noninferior to levofloxacin 500 mg for 10 days.

Significance

Levofloxacin 750 mg for 5 days represents a safe and effective treatment regimen for acute bacterial sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and 3 new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

Purpose

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, which includes radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia.

Action Statements

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians (1) should distinguish presumed ABRS from acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) caused by viral upper respiratory infections and noninfectious conditions and (2) should confirm a clinical diagnosis of CRS with objective documentation of sinonasal inflammation, which may be accomplished using anterior rhinoscopy, nasal endoscopy, or computed tomography. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should either offer watchful waiting (without antibiotics) or prescribe initial antibiotic therapy for adults with uncomplicated ABRS; (2) should prescribe amoxicillin with or without clavulanate as ﬁrst-line therapy for 5 to 10 days (if a decision is made to treat ABRS with an antibiotic); (3) should reassess the patient to confirm ABRS, exclude other causes of illness, and detect complications if the patient worsens or fails to improve with the initial management option by 7 days after diagnosis or worsens during the initial management; (4) should distinguish CRS and recurrent ARS from isolated episodes of ABRS and other causes of sinonasal symptoms; (5) should assess the patient with CRS or recurrent ARS for multiple chronic conditions that would modify management, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised state, and ciliary dyskinesia; (6) should confirm the presence or absence of nasal polyps in a patient with CRS; and (7) should recommend saline nasal irrigation, topical intranasal corticosteroids, or both for symptom relief of CRS. The update group stated as options that clinicians may (1) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of viral rhinosinusitis; (2) recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation) for symptomatic relief of ABRS; and (3) obtain testing for allergy and immune function in evaluating a patient with CRS or recurrent ARS. The update group made recommendations that clinicians (1) should not obtain radiographic imaging for patients who meet diagnostic criteria for ARS, unless a complication or alternative diagnosis is suspected, and (2) should not prescribe topical or systemic antifungal therapy for patients with CRS.

### Decongestants, antihistamines and nasal irrigation for acute sinusitis in children [^115jLUR4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of decongestants, antihistamines and nasal irrigation in children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis has not been systematically evaluated.

Objectives

To systematically review the efficacy of decongestants, antihistamines and nasal irrigation in children with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis. We considered the following four interventions: 1) decongestants versus placebo or no medication, 2) antihistamines versus placebo or no medication, 3) decongestant and antihistamine combination versus placebo or no medication, 4) nasal irrigation versus no irrigation. The primary outcomes of the review were symptom resolution (improvement in symptom score from enrolment to day five and overall symptom burden (as measured by average symptom scores while on therapy).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 1), which includes the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialized Register, MEDLINE (1950 to January week 3, 2012) and EMBASE (1950 to January 2012).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs which evaluated children less than 18 years of age with acute sinusitis, defined as 10 to 30 days of rhinorrhea, congestion or daytime cough. We excluded trials of children with chronic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed each study for inclusion.

Main Results

Of the 526 studies found through the electronic searches and handsearching, none met all the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence to determine whether the use of antihistamines, decongestants or nasal irrigation is efficacious in children with acute sinusitis. Further research is needed to determine whether these interventions are beneficial in the treatment of children with acute sinusitis.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of acute bacterial sinusitis in children aged 1 to 18 years [^115VLjBL]. Pediatrics (2013). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics — acute bacterial sinusitis first-line therapy in children: Amoxicillin remains the antimicrobial agent of choice for first-line treatment of uncomplicated acute bacterial sinusitis when antimicrobial resistance is not suspected. For children aged 2 years or older with mild to moderate uncomplicated disease who do not attend child care and have not been treated with an antimicrobial agent within the last 4 weeks, amoxicillin is recommended at 45 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses. In communities with a high prevalence of nonsusceptible S pneumoniae (> 10%), treatment may be initiated at 80 to 90 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose. Patients with moderate to severe illness or those younger than 2 years, attending child care, or recently treated with an antimicrobial may receive high-dose amoxicillin-clavulanate 80–90 mg/kg per day of the amoxicillin component with 6.4 mg/kg per day of clavulanate in 2 divided doses with a maximum of 2 g per dose; potassium clavulanate levels are adequate to inhibit β-lactamase–producing H influenzae and M catarrhalis. Risk factors for resistance include attendance at child care, antimicrobial treatment within the previous 30 days, and age younger than 2 years.

### Chronic sinusitis in children [^115tJ7HH]. Clinical Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute sinusitis in children have been published by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Of note is that in this document, a brief discussion of chronic disease concluded that the pathogenesis and management are essentially unknown. Although there are insufficient data in the literature to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines, a careful review of the literature and clinical experience of experts who manage pediatric chronic sinusitis is presented in an effort to develop specific recommendations and to offer practical treatment options. Factors associated with chronic sinusitis should be addressed individually and include recurrent viral upper respiratory infections, allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, ciliary dyskinesia, cystic fibrosis, immunodeficiency, and anatomic abnormalities. Bacteriology includes the 3 pathogens associated with acute disease i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis but with chronic sinusitis also includes Staphylococcus aureus, anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. Medical interventions discussed include endoscopic sinus surgery, saline nasal irrigation, intranasal decongestant therapy, intranasal steroids, and oral antibiotics. Clinical ranking without regard to side effects and cost suggests that endoscopic sinus surgery and antral irrigation have the highest probability of substantial symptom improvement. Other issues discussed include identification and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), allergy, and immune deficiency.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^116NN5uF]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Statistical Analysis

We compared baseline characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes using χ² tests, Fisher exact tests, and t tests as appropriate for differences in proportions and means. We reported 95% CIs and P values for the differences in proportions between the 2 groups, and we reported standard deviations (SDs) for the means for the groups as well as 95% CIs and P values for the differences between these means. We used the statistical software Stata, version 15.0 (StataCorp LLC) for analysis and assessed statistical significance at the.05 level.

To look for potential confounding factors, we analyzed the effect on the primary outcome of any significant differences between groups in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. In our unplanned interim analysis, we did a best-case analysis for participants lost to follow-up, classifying those missing in the high-dose arm as a GRI 5 or 6 and in the standard-dose arm as a GRI less than 5. After the decision to stop the trial, we investigated futility further by calculating, under different assumptions, the conditional power of finding the proposed 18% increase in positive outcomes in the high-dose group if we would continue to the planned enrollment of 115 in each group.

We had planned to do repeat analyses by combining the participants in this study and those in the second time period of the initial study (because the methodology was the same). Given the negative results of the current study, however, we looked only at the primary efficacy outcome.

### Levofloxacin [^112oeDEw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.4 Acute Bacterial Sinusitis: 5-day and 10 to 14 day Treatment Regimens

Levofloxacin is approved for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) using either 750 mg by mouth x 5 days or 500 mg by mouth once daily x 10 to 14 days. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a high dose short course of levofloxacin, 780 outpatient adults with clinically and radiologically determined acute bacterial sinusitis were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, prospective, multicenter study comparing levofloxacin 750 mg by mouth once daily for five days to levofloxacin 500 mg by mouth once daily for 10 days.

Clinical success rates (defined as complete or partial resolution of the pre-treatment signs and symptoms of ABS to such an extent that no further antibiotic treatment was deemed necessary) in the microbiologically evaluable population were 91.4% (139/152) in the levofloxacin 750 mg group and 88.6% (132/149) in the levofloxacin 500 mg group at the test-of-cure (TOC) visit (95% CI [-4.2, 10] for levofloxacin 750 mg minus levofloxacin 500 mg).

Rates of clinical success by pathogen in the microbiologically evaluable population who had specimens obtained by antral tap at study entry showed comparable results for the five- and ten-day regimens at the test-of-cure visit 22 days post treatment (see Table 14).

### Antibiotics for clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^1129kxFt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In primary care settings, the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor recommended. Individual trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

Main Results

We included 10 trials involving 2450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB)) 18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 1.58 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.22)), (NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 51, I(2) statistic 0%, three trials). However, 27% of the participants who received antibiotics and 15% of those who received placebo experienced adverse events (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.77) (number needed to treat to harm (NNTH)) 8 (95% CI 6 to 13, I(2) statistic 13%, seven trials). More participants in the placebo group needed to start antibiotic therapy because of an abnormal course of rhinosinusitis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.66), NNTH 20 (95% CI 14 to 35, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Only one disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in a patient treated with antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis needs to be seen in the context of a high prevalence of adverse events. Taking into account antibiotic resistance and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude that there is no place for antibiotics for the patient with clinically diagnosed, uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. This review cannot make recommendations for children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease, as these populations were not included in the available trials.

### High-dose vs standard-dose amoxicillin plus clavulanate for adults with acute sinusitis: a randomized clinical trial [^116vhhAF]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

In addition, as shown in the eTable in Supplement 2, the dropout rate during the study did not significantly alter the balance in important baseline characteristics of those participants available at the end of days 3 and 10, including age; sex; underlying conditions of smoking, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or allergic rhinitis; nasal steroid use; days of illness; IDSA category; or SNOT-16 score. Furthermore, for those lost to follow-up, even if we assigned negative outcomes to everyone receiving the standard dose and positive outcomes to everyone receiving the high dose, the difference in the primary outcome was not significant: 39.2% (31 of 79) had a negative outcome in the standard-dose group vs 46.2% (36 of 78) in the high-dose group, a difference of 6.9% (95% CI, −8.5% to 22.4%; p = 0.38). The combined primary efficacy outcomes of this study and the corresponding segment of the original study were 39.6% (53 of 134) rating "a lot better" or "no symptoms" at 3 days in the standard-dose groups and 44.2% (57 of 129) in the high-dose groups, for a difference of 4.6% (95% CI, −7.3% to 16.5%; p = 0.45).

### The evidence base for the optimal antibiotic treatment duration of upper and lower respiratory tract infections: an umbrella review [^1115KrVP]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Background

Many trials, reviews, and meta-analyses have been performed on the comparison of short versus long antibiotic treatment in respiratory tract infections, generally supporting shorter treatment. The aim of this umbrella review is to assess the soundness of the current evidence base for optimal antibiotic treatment duration.

Methods

A search in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection was performed on May 1, 2024, without date and language restrictions. Systematic reviews addressing treatment durations in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), acute sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or pharyngotonsillitis were included. Studies from inpatient and outpatient settings were included; reviews in paediatric populations were excluded. Outcomes of interest were clinical and bacteriological cure, microbiological eradication, mortality, relapse rate, and adverse events. The quality of the reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool, risk of bias of all included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (version 1), and overall quality of evidence according to GRADE.

Findings

We identified 30 systematic reviews meeting the criteria; they were generally of a low to critically low quality. 21 reviews conducted a meta-analysis. For CAP outside the intensive care unit (ICU; 14 reviews, of which eight did a meta-analysis) and AECOPD (eight reviews, of which five did a meta-analysis), there was sufficient evidence supporting a treatment duration of 5 days; evidence for shorter durations is scarce. Evidence on non-ventilator-associated HAP is absent, despite identifying three reviews (of which one did a meta-analysis), since no trials were conducted exclusively in this population. For sinusitis the evidence appears to support a shorter regimen, but more evidence is needed in the population who actually require antibiotic treatment. For pharyngotonsillitis (eight reviews, of which six did a meta-analysis), sufficient evidence exists to support short-course cephalosporin but not short-course penicillin when dosed three times a day.

Interpretation

The available evidence for non-ICU CAP and AECOPD supports a short-course treatment duration of 5 days in patients who have clinically improved. Efforts of the scientific community should be directed at implementing this evidence in daily practice. High-quality RCTs are needed to underpin even shorter treatment durations for CAP and AECOPD, to establish the optimal treatment duration of HAP and acute sinusitis, and to evaluate shorter duration using an optimal penicillin dosing schedule in patients with pharyngotonsillitis.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: rapid evidence review [^111khKvo]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages. Antibiotics should be considered for patients with 3 or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after 3 to 5 days of symptoms, or 7 or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available. Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limited, lasting 7 to 10 days. Complications of rhinosinusitis are rare but may include orbital cellulitis, meningitis, and abscess. Computed tomography and referral to an otolaryngologist should be considered for patients with recurrent rhinosinusitis or concern about complications.

### Clinical practice guideline: adult sinusitis update [^115NRCVW]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Statement 3: Symptomatic relief of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) — clinicians may recommend analgesics, topical intranasal steroids, and/or nasal saline irrigation for symptomatic relief of ABRS. This is an option based on randomized controlled trials with heterogeneous populations, diagnostic criteria, and outcome measures with a balance of benefit and harm. The action profile urges promotion of analgesics, saline irrigation, and topical intranasal steroids and discourages interventions with questionable, unknown or unproven efficacy such as systemic steroids, decongestants, antihistamines, and guaifenesin. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade A for topical nasal steroids, Grade B for saline irrigation and systemic steroids, and grade D for analgesics, decongestants, antihistamines (in non-atopic patients) and guaifenesin. Benefits include relief of facial pain with analgesics, a modest increase in symptom relief from topical nasal steroids (number needed to treat 11), and possible symptom relief from saline irrigations; risks include local and systemic adverse reactions and medication costs. Level of confidence in evidence is Medium.

### Adult sinusitis-clinical practice guideline… [^1135p4b5]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

The guideline, Adult Sinusitis, was developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and was reviewed and categorized as Affirmation of Value by the American Academy of Family Physicians. Read the full recommendation which includes a treatment algorithm and more information about antibiotic choices. These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These recommendations are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America.

To be effective, the recommendations must be implemented.

### Diagnosis and first-line treatment of chronic sinusitis… [^113S6nN6]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Chronic sinusitis is a commonly diagnosed disease of the nose and sinuses, and is a distinct disease entity from acute sinusitis. Unlike acute sinusitis, chronic sinusitis it not primarily an infectious condition, but rather a chronic inflammatory process. Clinical practice guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery outline diagnostic and treatment recommendations, but above all else, emphasize the need for accurate diagnosis. 1 Treatment for chronic sinusitis involves saline irrigation, nasal steroid spray, or both. 1, 2 Surgery is reserved for patients with severe or refractory disease. Although this and other CPGs for chronic sinusitis recommend long-term use of nasal steroid spray, 3, 4 few studies have examined the uptake of this recommendation. Bergmark RW, Pynnonen M.
