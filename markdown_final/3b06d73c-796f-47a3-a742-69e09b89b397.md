## Question

best abortive medications for seizures

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best abortive medications for seizures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the terminology and clinical context of "abortive" versus preventive therapy. Then, I should identify first-line agents with the strongest evidence. Next, I will examine non-IV and prehospital alternatives and verify comparative efficacy. After that, I should outline escalation strategies for refractory seizures, including second- and third-line agents. Finally, I will integrate special populations and synthesize practical, evidence-based recommendations while checking for pitfalls and ensuring the guidance is consistent with current guidelines and labels.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate abortive (acute seizure termination) with preventive therapy. Current literature prefers "antiseizure medicines (ASMs)" for agents that symptomatically treat seizures rather than modify epileptogenesis, and "abortive" here refers to rescue medicines used to stop ongoing or clustered seizures, distinct from chronic prophylaxis [^113BJ6iu] [^116nSqMh].

> I will now examine first-line abortive therapy. Benzodiazepines are the cornerstone with robust guideline support, and I should verify which specific agents have the highest level of evidence: IV lorazepam and IV diazepam are established as efficacious for convulsive status epilepticus, and intramuscular midazolam achieves similar or superior effectiveness in prehospital settings when IV access is delayed or unavailable, with RAMPART demonstrating noninferiority of IM midazolam to IV lorazepam and even advantages in time-to-control and hospitalization metrics, so I need to ensure I'm not overvaluing IV-only options in the field [^111NJofA] [^1116aG1n] [^115vyzyu].

> Wait, let me verify comparative effectiveness within benzodiazepines. Lorazepam has repeatedly outperformed diazepam and phenytoin in randomized and systematic evidence, with Cochrane analyses showing lower risk of non-cessation and less need for alternative drugs or anesthesia, so when IV access is available and time-critical, lorazepam remains a preferred first choice, while acknowledging diazepam is still effective and appropriate when lorazepam is unavailable or in specific formulations [^115vyzyu] [^117S7Ndb] [^1133opk9].

> Hold on, I should review non-IV and prehospital alternatives because delays in obtaining IV access can worsen outcomes. Non-IV benzodiazepines (IM midazolam, intranasal midazolam, intranasal diazepam, rectal diazepam, buccal midazolam) are effective and often faster to administer than IV benzodiazepines, with meta-analytic data suggesting lower treatment failure and faster time-to-control for non-IV routes despite slightly longer drug-to-cessation intervals, which makes physiologic sense given earlier administration. IN midazolam (e.g. Nayzilam) and IN diazepam (e.g. Valtoco) carry FDA labeling for seizure clusters, and rectal diazepam gel remains a long-standing, evidence-based option particularly for pediatric use and when nasal delivery is impractical [^1132cS5V] [^116Fg4d9] [^114QXTwW] [^116XTvG4].

> I need to check dosing anchors so recommendations are concrete. For lorazepam, typical IV dosing is 0.1 mg/kg or 4 mg IV with the option to repeat once, and for diazepam, 0.2 mg/kg IV is standard with awareness of redistribution and the need for a second agent if seizures persist. For IM midazolam, 10 mg IM is effective in adults, with pediatric weight-based dosing typically 0.2 mg/kg. Intranasal diazepam is dosed by age and weight with 0.3 mg/kg as a common target, and rectal diazepam gel uses a 0.3 mg/kg dose as well, which I should confirm aligns with labels and guidelines before finalizing [^1116aG1n] [^117Qed5o].

> Next, I should review escalation for benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus. The best-supported second-line options are fosphenytoin (preferred over phenytoin for tolerability and safety), levetiracetam, and valproic acid, with contemporary evidence and guidelines suggesting broadly similar efficacy among these choices, so agent selection should be individualized to comorbidities, drug interactions, and sex/childbearing potential. Importantly, after a benzodiazepine, a second-line ASM should be administered promptly rather than repeated benzodiazepine dosing, as effectiveness declines with each successive step [^111NJofA] [^117L76KF] [^117U5nmu].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "phenytoin after benzodiazepines" was a universal first-line second-step based on older policies, but I should double-check. More recent emergency medicine guidance lists phenytoin among acceptable second-line options but also emphasizes that fosphenytoin, levetiracetam, or valproate are reasonable and may be preferred depending on context, so I should correct myself and frame phenytoin as an alternative when fosphenytoin is unavailable or contraindicated, while noting the IV phenytoin risks of hypotension and arrhythmias and the advantage of fosphenytoin's safety profile [^117U5nmu] [^111NJofA].

> I will now examine third-line therapy for refractory status epilepticus. Continuous infusions of midazolam, propofol, or barbiturates (pentobarbital or thiopental) are recommended, with ketamine increasingly used as an alternative when traditional agents fail, and early transition to continuous EEG monitoring and aggressive supportive care is critical to prevent neuronal injury. Let me verify that the balance of data still supports early anesthesia and EEG rather than repeated non-benzodiazepine ASM stacking, which it does in contemporary reviews and practice standards [^117L76KF] [^114kM9ZS] [^111NJofA].

> Let me consider special populations and settings so I don't overgeneralize. In neonates, phenobarbital is first-line with phenytoin or levetiracetam as second-line depending on etiology and comorbidities, and in pregnancy, benzodiazepines remain acceptable acutely while valproate should generally be avoided. In children and adolescents, non-IV benzodiazepines are crucial in schools and community settings, with buccal or intranasal midazolam and rectal diazepam as principal rescue options and explicit seizure action plans to reduce delays. In alcohol withdrawal seizures, benzodiazepines are first-line and phenytoin is ineffective unless treating underlying epilepsy, so I should ensure these distinctions are preserved in the final synthesis [^111VD5Cb] [^112MX8od] [^111oCzPo] [^114opkTM] [^1137w9Yc].

> But wait, what about seizure clusters and home/ambulatory rescue? Intranasal midazolam and intranasal diazepam offer practical, socially acceptable, and effective options to abort clusters, with randomized data supporting comparable or noninferior efficacy to rectal diazepam and clear benefits in caregiver administration and time-to-treatment, so I should emphasize equipping patients with an ASM rescue and a written action plan, especially in those with prolonged or repetitive seizures [^112vnETL] [^116Fg4d9].

> Let me synthesize a practical hierarchy while I keep checking for consistency with evidence: first-line is a benzodiazepine, with IV lorazepam preferred when IV access is immediately available, IM midazolam preferred in prehospital or when IV access is delayed, and IN/rectal benzodiazepines (midazolam or diazepam) for community rescue. Second-line, administered without undue delay if seizures persist beyond about 5–10 minutes or after an adequate benzodiazepine dose, is fosphenytoin, levetiracetam, or valproic acid, chosen based on patient-specific factors. Third-line is continuous infusion of midazolam, propofol, or barbiturates with EEG monitoring, and ketamine as an adjunct in refractory cases, with a parallel emphasis on treating precipitating causes and supportive critical care [^111NJofA] [^117L76KF] [^114kM9ZS].

> I should confirm the key clinical pearls to prevent common pitfalls: treat at or before 5 minutes to reduce pharmacoresistance and neuronal injury, avoid stacking multiple benzodiazepines without adding a second-line ASM, individualize second-line selection to comorbidities and reproductive status, and ensure every patient at risk has a rescue plan with trained caregivers and access to non-IV benzodiazepines. If I overlooked any population-specific nuances, I will now incorporate neonatal and pregnancy guidance as above to keep the synthesis complete and safe [^115kFBS2] [^111NJofA] [^114opkTM].

The best abortive medications for seizures are **benzodiazepines** — intravenous lorazepam, intravenous diazepam, intramuscular midazolam, and rectal diazepam gel — because they act rapidly and are first-line for acute seizure termination and status epilepticus [^111NJofA] [^114kM9ZS]. Lorazepam is preferred for its longer duration and lower risk of recurrence, while midazolam is favored when IV access is not available [^111NJofA] [^1132cS5V]. For out-of-hospital or pediatric use, **rectal diazepam gel or intranasal benzodiazepines** (midazolam or diazepam) are effective alternatives [^116Fg4d9] [^115kWfEY] [^111n2Fyw]. Second-line agents (levetiracetam, valproate, fosphenytoin) are used if benzodiazepines fail, but benzodiazepines remain the most effective abortive therapy [^117L76KF] [^113EHgMj].

## Benzodiazepines: first-line abortive medications

Benzodiazepines are the cornerstone of acute seizure management because of their **rapid onset and high efficacy**. The following benzodiazepines are commonly used:

| **Medication** | **Route of administration** | **Onset of action** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Lorazepam | IV | 1–3 minutes | Preferred due to longer duration of action and lower risk of recurrence [^notfound] |
| Diazepam | IV | 1–3 minutes | Rapid onset but shorter duration; may require repeat dosing [^notfound] |
| Midazolam | IM, IV, intranasal | 2–5 minutes | Effective when IV access is unavailable; intranasal formulation available [^1132cS5V] [^114QXTwW] |
| Diazepam gel | Rectal | 5–10 minutes | Useful for out-of-hospital and pediatric use [^115kWfEY] [^111n2Fyw] |

---

Lorazepam is **preferred** due to its longer duration of action, reducing the risk of seizure recurrence. Diazepam is effective but may require repeat dosing due to its shorter half-life. Midazolam is particularly useful in prehospital settings or when IV access is unavailable, and its intranasal formulation provides a non-invasive alternative.

---

## Second-line abortive medications

If benzodiazepines fail to terminate seizures, **second-line antiseizure medications** are employed:

- **Levetiracetam**: Preferred for its favorable safety profile and minimal drug interactions.
- **Valproic acid**: Effective but contraindicated in certain populations (e.g. pregnant women, patients with hepatic disease).
- **Fosphenytoin**: A prodrug of phenytoin, effective but associated with cardiovascular risks.

---

## Comparative efficacy and safety

Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses consistently demonstrate benzodiazepines' **superior efficacy** in rapidly terminating seizures compared with other antiseizure medications. They also have a favorable safety profile, although respiratory depression and sedation are potential adverse effects that require monitoring.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the American Epilepsy Society (AES) and the Neurocritical Care Society **strongly recommend benzodiazepines as first-line therapy** for acute seizures and status epilepticus. They emphasize early administration, adequate dosing, and rapid escalation if initial treatment fails [^111NJofA] [^115cfuNh].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Rectal diazepam gel and intranasal benzodiazepines are effective and practical for out-of-hospital use [^112vnETL].
- **Elderly patients**: Caution is advised due to increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines, necessitating careful dosing and monitoring.
- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Benzodiazepines metabolized by the liver may require dose adjustments and close monitoring.

---

## Conclusion

Benzodiazepines — particularly lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam — are the **most effective abortive medications** for acute seizures and status epilepticus. They provide rapid seizure control, have a favorable safety profile, and are supported by strong clinical evidence and guidelines. Second-line agents such as levetiracetam, valproic acid, and fosphenytoin are used when benzodiazepines fail or are contraindicated.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive quantitative synthesis to date, examining the use of third-generation ASMs as an add-on strategy in patients with treatment-resistant FOS, boasting the largest sample size. Compared to previous studies addressing the same issue, we provide an updated and detailed assessment of efficacy, tolerability, and safety outcomes for both ASMs and their different dosages. Our findings aim to inform clinical guidelines and support decision-making for patients and clinicians, helping to select the most appropriate treatment strategies in this critical clinical area.

Achieving seizure freedom is a primary objective in the treatment of epilepsy. However, only 50% of patients who receive their first antiepileptic drug treatment become seizure-free. This means that many patients require additional treatment in order to reach this goal. Unfortunately, more than a third of patients with epilepsy continue to experience uncontrolled seizures even after being treated with an antiepileptic drug. Additionally, very few patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy are able to achieve seizure freedom, even with the use of newer drugs. Uncontrolled epilepsy can have a profound impact on patients' lives, leading to psychological and social dysfunction, limited educational and employment opportunities, and a diminished quality of life. It also poses a risk of premature death, with persistent generalised tonic-clonic seizures being a particular risk factor for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Given these challenges, there is a critical need for new and more effective antiepileptic drugs that can reduce seizures in patients with uncontrolled epilepsy and help a greater number of individuals attain seizure freedom.

Real-Time Management of Seizures

Efforts have been made for decades to predict when seizures will occur and provide an immediate intervention to either prevent or terminate the seizure. These efforts rely on a range of recording devices, computational algorithms to identify at-risk periods, and active response in the form of electrical/optical stimulation or administration of a drug. Although there has been steady progress with these strategies over the decades, many approaches are maturing to the point where they seem poised to provide a workable and effective therapy for a larger number of patients. Indeed, the introduction in 2013 of an FDA-approved closed loop device that detects seizures and aborts them by deep brain stimulation has spawned many efforts to refine stimulation parameters for better seizure control. New seizure prediction algorithmsas well as new devices may allow intravenous injection or even direct infusion of antiseizure agents into the brain at the onset of or immediately before a seizure is predicted. This approach has the capacity to harness the utility of proven pharmacological treatments without the side effects of chronic exposure to drug in blood and brain. Taken a step further, introduction of active drug locally into the epileptic focus could provide more selective treatment of certain epileptic conditions, including refractory epilepsies, localization-related epilepsies, and status epilepticus. Increasing power of computational algorithmsshould allow enhanced ability to predict seizures from multiple streams of data, including electrical recordings and peripheral readouts. In addition, miniaturization of devices can improve the ability to deliver electrical, light, or pharmacological stimuli to specific regions both inside and outside of the central nervous system. The emergence of new animal models of genetic epilepsies provides another opportunity to test detection and seizure interruption strategies in homogeneous models that share some basis with human epilepsy and thus might provide robust data that can be translated to patients harboring these variants. A range of models might stimulate improvements in the low signal to noise ratio in seizure prediction and in the abortion of seizures, such as evaluation of new biomarkers that change prior to seizure initiationand consideration of circadian rhythms. Ultimately, these systems need to be suitable for self-management in the home and other nonmedical settings in order to improve adherence and efficacy.

### Other approaches to treatment… [^114fMuED]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

16 Initiating AED therapy after the first seizure decreases the absolute risk of recurrence by 35% over the next two years. AED therapy is almost always indicated after two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart because of the high recurrence rate. AEDs may not improve quality of life and prognosis for sustained seizure remission. The risk of an adverse effect from an AED ranges from 7% to 31%. 16–18. ADULTS AT LOW RISK OF RECURRENCE In adults who have had a single seizure and who lack high-risk characteristics, delaying AED therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year seizure remission rates. AEDs are associated with significant adverse effects, including subtle cognitive and behavioral effects occurring in up to 50% of treated patients; therefore, delaying their use until a second seizure is reasonable.

13, 33, 34 Vagus nerve stimulation may increase seizure-free time in patients with medically refractory epilepsy who are not candidates for surgery or in whom surgery has been ineffective. It is approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for use in persons older than 12 years. In this procedure, a battery-powered vagus nerve stimulator is implanted with the leads around the left vagus nerve and attached to a programmable pacemaker. The exact mechanism of action is unclear but likely due to vagal afferent activity that suppresses the electrical circuits in the brain that lead to seizures. 13, 35–38 Responsive neurostimulation is another approach to treating medically refractory partial-onset seizures. This recently approved system is different from the vagus nerve stimulator in that the leads are implanted directly into the seizure-onset zone, which may be cortical or subcortical.

In response to abnormal electrical activity, the neurostimulator delivers electrical stimulation to the target seizure-onset zone. Adverse effects include implant site pain, implant site infection, headache, and dysesthesia. 39, 40. Further Considerations CONTRACEPTION AND PREGNANCY Women of childbearing age should be counseled, in consultation with a neurologist, about the potential decrease in effectiveness of AEDs when using estrogen-based contraception and offered alternative contraceptive methods. The potential teratogenicity of AEDs, potential adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, and the potential increased risk of complications during pregnancy and labor should also be discussed, and genetic counseling offered before conception.

### One for all-can we have and Do we want a first-line monotherapy for epilepsy? [^114f3Ymt]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

The pragmatic open-label comparative effectiveness trials attempt to simplify the problem of treating a heterogeneous condition in a group of patients with many comorbidities by addressing a simple question: what is the efficacy and tolerability in a group with a type of epilepsy (focal vs generalized) as a whole, by defining treatment failure in a way that encompasses efficacy and tolerability. The effort is laudable — many disciplines have evidence-based first-line therapies for various ailments. Why not epilepsy too? Isn't the goal of classification of epilepsies to enable us putting patients in "buckets" that have specific treatment responses and improve treatment strategy? The SANAD trials in generalized epilepsy offers useful data, which is that valproate has superior efficacy over other drugs. But this finding is not helpful for people of childbearing age who may desire a pregnancy, which is why this Italian studywas undertaken. The issue of people with pregnancy potential is not the only one though, which is why this Italian cohort study fails to answer the question — what should a neurologist offer to the individual presenting to clinic. Some have embraced these inherent challenges to picking one best drug for all, and instead developed algorithms to find a potential best first drug for one.

The authors of this study conclude that "great uncertainties still exist regarding the best ASM to prescribe as initial monotherapy in these patients". This statement cannot be disputed. The question is how to get to this answer. If there was a "perfect" ASM — well tolerated, easy to administer, safe in pregnancy, high efficacy, then we would likely have an undisputed first-line therapy for focal or generalized epilepsies. Unfortunately, every anti-seizure medication comes with some drawback — whether risk of specific side effects, need for titration, need for blood monitoring, teratogenicity, or less than ideal efficacy. There still is no first-line monotherapy for focal or generalized epilepsy. But the reason for this may not be that we have not found the right study design, but perhaps that the right drug is not here yet…

### Rescue therapies in epilepsy [^112vnETL]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to provide a succinct evaluation of the current rescue medications and action plans available to our patients with seizure clusters in the outpatient setting.

Recent Findings

The main themes of the recent findings are that rescue medications and seizure action plans (SAPs) are underutilized, particularly in the adult population. The safety and efficacy of intranasal midazolam and intranasal diazepam is comparable with rectal diazepam for the treatment of seizure clusters. Additionally, this intranasal formulation has the benefit of a more socially acceptable route of administration and ease of use.

Summary

The implication of these findings is a greater variety and awareness in the rescue medications available to our patients suffering from seizure clusters.

### Which drug is most effective for generalized epilepsy? [^113sfm4U]. AAFP (2007). Low credibility.

With alternative drugs now available, the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drug study was conducted in the United Kingdom to compare the efficacy, tolerability, quality of life, and economic impacts of valproate, lamotrigine, and topiramate in patients with generalized seizures. Results: Follow-up was achieved for the equivalent of 2, 333 patient-years. For time to treatment failure, valproate was significantly better than topiramate or lamotrigine. Early treatment failures were attributed to adverse effects, whereas later treatment failures generally reflected inadequate control of seizures. Clinically significant adverse events were reported by 36 percent of patients receiving valproate, 37 percent of those receiving lamotrigine, and 45 percent of those receiving topiramate. Only 165 patients completed the questionnaires on cost and quality of life, but the available data indicated that topiramate was less expensive and more effective than lamotrigine.

Valproate performed best on cost-per-seizure-avoided and on quality-of-life measures. Conclusion: Valproate should remain as the first-line therapy for patients with generalized or difficult-to-classify seizures. Because this was a heterogeneous group of patients, individual patients may achieve better results with one of the other agents. In particular, consideration must be given for women of childbearing age and the potential adverse effects of valproate during pregnancy. editor's note: In a companion article, 1 the authors report on comparisons of therapy for partial onset seizures in 1, 721 patients. They compared carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcar-bazepine, and topiramate. For time to treatment failure for patients with partial seizures, lamotrigine performed significantly better than the other medications, although the difference between lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine did not reach statistical significance.

For time to 12-month remission, carbamazepine was considered the best medication overall. However, the authors conclude that lamotrigine had the best overall clinical performance compared with the other study medications, and it is a cost-effective alternative to carbamazepine for partial onset seizures. — a. d. w.

### Antiepileptic drugs after first unprovoked seizure… [^115ZoK6D]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: Patients of any age with any type of first unprovoked seizure 1 Efficacy End Points: Seizure recurrence; seizure remission; mortality Harm End Points: Tiredness or drowsiness; gastrointestinal symptoms; depression or anxiety; dizziness or unsteadiness; headache; injury. Two studies of 1, 212 participants reported on the primary outcome of seizure recurrence within five years after initiation of an antiepileptic drug immediately following an unprovoked seizure. Participants randomized to immediate treatment had a statistically significantly lower probability of repeat seizure at five years, which yielded a number needed to treat of 10. A secondary outcome, seizure recurrence risk, was also statistically significantly lower in the immediate treatment group at one year and at two years.

As for the risk of recurrent seizure during the 24 months following treatment, there was no difference between immediate drug treatment and control in terms of five-year remission at any time, reflecting the short-term effect of antiepileptic drugs. The median time to seizure recurrence after randomization to the control group was 736 days compared with 1, 165 days in the immediate treatment group. Antiepileptic drugs did not significantly affect overall mortality after a first seizure. When compared with deferred treatment, there was a higher risk of adverse events in the immediate treatment group, with a number needed to harm of 10. Initiating antiepileptic drugs immediately following a first unprovoked seizure reduced the risk of a subsequent seizure, but did not affect the number of patients who achieved remission in the long term or impact overall mortality.

Adverse events were more common in the treatment group, although this evidence was graded as low to moderate. Overall, the results of this meta-analysis support those reported in a previous meta-analysis.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, more specifically with respect to management of withdrawal seizure, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate immediate treatment with a medication effective at preventing another seizure following a withdrawal seizure. Administer benzodiazepines as first-line therapy, preferably a fast-acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam. Consider administering phenobarbital as another option but is less preferred than benzodiazepines.

### Quality improvement in neurology: child neurology quality measure set: executive summary [^115kFBS2]. Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Convulsive seizures — prehospital rescue therapy and status epilepticus (SE) context highlight rapid treatment. The definition of SE was narrowed "from a clinical seizure lasting longer than 30 to 5 minutes", and evidence indicates that the sooner prolonged seizures are treated, the greater the likelihood of termination. Therefore, rescue therapy with an appropriate medication at an effective dose should be provided for in the prehospital setting.

Four Good Reasons for Using the Term "ASMs" When Referring to Symptomatic Medicines

Names of medicines are best defined by their effects. The medicines currently used to treat epilepsy are symptomatic. Just as antitussives treat cough in people who may have many underlying illnesses, medications used to treat people with epilepsy treat the symptom of seizure. It would be inaccurate to call antitussives "antibronchitis" treatments. It is equally as inaccurate to call a medication "antiepileptic" if it has no ability to treat the underlying causes of epilepsy. Indeed, "antiepileptic" is suggestive of an action for which these agents were not developed either clinically or preclinically. - Because the ability of currently used medicines to prevent or abort seizures has been clearly demonstrated, the term "ASMs" reflects precisely those effects. Other terms which are sometimes used when referring to ASMs are likewise less than desirable. "Anticonvulsants" may be appropriate when referring to the action of these medicines against convulsions in animal models of seizures, but it is improper when referring to them collectively because not all seizures are convulsive and because some ASMs (eg, ethosuximide) are not effective against convulsions.

International issues. Some have argued that the term "antiseizure", while useful in English-speaking regions, would be problematic for regions where there is no name for "seizure". This should not be considered a barrier. In some cultural settings, medicines used to treat persons with epilepsy are named in ways that bear no semantic relationship with either "epilepsy" or "seizures". In several Latin languages, for example, these medications are at times referred to as "anticomiciales" (Spanish)", anticomitiaux" (French), or "anticomiziali" (Italian), which are considered by some as advantageous because they may minimize potential stigma associated with the name of the disease or its manifestations. However, the origin of these terms is actually even more stigmatizing because it can be traced back to a peculiar rule that was in place in ancient Rome. Then, when someone had a seizure during comitia, that is, an assembly of the people, the assembly had to be dispersed because the occurrence of the seizure was considered an ominous sign. Irrespective of their origin, these terms are problematic in that they fail to reflect transparently the actual effect of the medicines.

### Management of functional neurological disorder [^114dYZvh]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

In terms of pharmacologic therapy, there are no specific medications shown to be effective in treating functional seizures. Instead, it is recommended to assess for and treat co-existing psychiatric disorders on an individual basis, as well as to discontinue antiepileptic therapy in patients without comorbid epilepsy. Specifically, post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders have been reported at high rates in patients with functional seizures and should be treated if present. One randomized clinical trial demonstrated a significant reduction of functional seizure frequency for patients treated with both CBT and sertraline (59%), as well as with CBT alone (51%), while sertraline alone did not significantly reduce seizure frequency (27%). Worth noting is that the CBT only group reported a greater improvement of secondary outcomes (quality of life, depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, impulsivity and psychosocial functioning) as compared to CBT plus sertraline, perhaps owing to medication adverse effects in a somatically-focused population of patients.

### Drug-related seizures: mechanisms, risk factors and clinical management [^112FNajM]. Practical Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Seizures can be a side effect of medications and represent a frequently encountered clinical problem in both acute and long-term settings. They negatively impact quality of life and costs and may affect long-term mortality and morbidity. This paper discusses the pharmacological and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying drug-related seizures, defined by the occurrence of seizures at therapeutic doses, focusing primarily on medications with a direct/mechanistic basis for seizure precipitation. High-risk drugs and populations are discussed, as are diagnostic approaches and management strategies.

### Anticonvulsant therapy for status epilepticus [^117S7Ndb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus is a medical emergency associated with significant mortality and morbidity, which requires immediate and effective treatment.

Objectives

(1) To determine whether a particular anticonvulsant is more effective or safer to use in status epilepticus compared to another and compared to placebo.(2) To delineate reasons for disagreement in the literature regarding recommended treatment regimens and to highlight areas for future research.

Search Strategy

We searched the following electronic databases using the highly sensitive search strategy for identifying published randomised controlled trials: (1) Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (July 2005); (2) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2,2005); (3) MEDLINE (1966 - August 2004); (4) EMBASE (1966 - January 2003).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of participants with premonitory, early, established or refractory status epilepticus using a truly random or quasi-random allocation of treatments were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eleven studies with 2017 participants were included. Few studies used the same interventions. Diazepam was better than placebo in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92), requirement for ventilatory support (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.94) or continuation of status epilepticus requiring use of a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92). Lorazepam was better than placebo for risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.71) and for risk of continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.71). Lorazepam was better than diazepam for reducing risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90) and had a lower risk for continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88). Lorazepam was better than phenytoin for risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86). Diazepam (30 mg intrarectal gel) was better than a lower dose (20 mg intrarectal gel) in premonitory status epilepticus for the risk of seizure continuation (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.86).

Authors' Conclusions

Lorazepam is better than diazepam or phenytoin alone for cessation of seizures and carries a lower risk of continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia. Both lorazepam and diazepam are better than placebo for the same outcomes. In the treatment of premonitory seizures, diazepam 30 mg in an intrarectal gel is better than 20 mg for cessation of seizures without a statistically significant increase in adverse effects. Universally accepted definitions of premonitory, early, established and refractory status epilepticus are required.

### Doctor, why can' T you Pick the right medication for my epilepsy? [^117QDN1G]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

When we don't have the evidence, what is the next best thing? We could turn to expert opinion. A large group of epilepsy specialists across the United States was given a survey of 43 multiple-part scenario questions, with respondents providing information on what they felt would be the preferred medication for each scenario. This survey was completed in 2001, 20015, and 2016. The results of identified medications that the experts recommended as treatments of choice for focal and generalized epilepsies. Although this provided excellent information for clinical practice, multiple treatments of choice were offered, not a single best medication. Once again, it is up to the provider to choose the best medication for his/her patient.

Epilepsy experts recently created an algorithm using the Delphi process that takes into account seizure types, history, and other relevant information to identify potential misdiagnosis of epilepsy/seizure types and then provide medication recommendations. Possible medications are identified as best, second best options, and "least desirable options though still acceptable". Given that the initial provider is often not an epilepsy subspecialist, this tool has the potential to be of great service for identifying initial treatment options. Unlike previous studies, it also helps avoid misdiagnosing seizures or epilepsy syndromes. However, like all other studies, unfortunately, this only narrows the list of potential options and does not give us the one best option.

Perhaps it is time for us to humbly recognize our limitations as epilepsy doctors. It is important to recognize that we just don't know enough yet to identify the most effective and best tolerated medication for each patient right from the beginning. Given the lack of evidence, how to we build patient trust? We must have good communication with our families. It is important that they understand the complexity of using ASMs, as well as treatment of chronic disease, so they know what to expect. We must have close follow-up, especially at the beginning of our patient's epilepsy treatment journey, to make medication adjustments and answer questions. A new diagnosis of epilepsy is frightening and fraught with uncertainty. Whether or not the studies ever exist that identify the one best medication for each patient, the goal for treatments remains: No seizures. No treatment side effects. For now, that is our one best option.

Longer-term outcomes show that seizure freedom "demonstrates no benefit for immediate AED treatment", and "there is no evidence that immediate AED treatment reduces [physical harm or death] or improves QOL". Regarding mortality, "the only study… of sudden unexplained death after an unprovoked first seizure demonstrates no advantage with immediate AED therapy".

### Immediate antiepileptic drug treatment, versus placebo, deferred, or no treatment for first unprovoked seizure [^113rbptj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is considerable disagreement about the risk of recurrence following a first unprovoked epileptic seizure. A decision about whether to start antiepileptic drug treatment following a first seizure should be informed by information on the size of any reduction in risk of future seizures, the impact on long-term seizure remission, and the risk of adverse effects.

Objectives

To review the probability of seizure recurrence, seizure remission, mortality, and adverse effects of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment given immediately after the first seizure compared to controls, in children and adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (accessed 13 October 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library September 2015, issue 9, accessed 13 October 2015), PUBMED (accessed 22 April 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 13 October 2015), EMBASE (accessed 22 April 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (accessed 15 October 2015), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, accessed 13 October 2015). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that could be blinded or unblinded. People of any age with a first unprovoked seizure of any type. Included studies compared participants receiving immediate antiepileptic treatment versus those receiving deferred treatment, those assigned to placebo, and those untreated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the studies identified by the search strategy for inclusion in the review and extracted data. The quality of the evidence was classified in four categories according to the GRADE approach. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as Risk Ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Time-to-event outcomes were expressed as Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95% CI. Only one trial used a double-blind design, and the two largest studies were unblinded. Most of the recurrences were generalized tonic-clonic seizures, a major type of seizures that is easily recognised, which should reduce the risk of outcome reporting bias.

Main Results

After exclusion of uninformative papers, only six studies (nine reports) were selected for inclusion. For the two largest studies data were available for individual participant meta-analysis. Compared to controls, participants randomised to immediate treatment had a lower probability of relapse at one year (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.58, high quality evidence), at five years (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89; high quality evidence) and a higher probability of an immediate five-year remission (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.54, high quality evidence). However there was no difference between immediate treatment and control in terms of five year remission at any time (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.21, high quality evidence). Antiepileptic drugs did not affect overall mortality after a first seizure (RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.95, high quality evidence). Compared to deferred treatment (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.79, moderate quality evidence), treatment of the first seizure was associated with a significantly higher risk of adverse events. Moderate to low quality imprecise evidence was available for the association of treatment of the first seizure compared to no treatment or placebo (RR 14.50, 95% CI 1.93 to 108.76) and(RR 4.91, 95% CI 1.10 to 21.93) respectively)

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of the first unprovoked seizure reduces the risk of a subsequent seizure but does not affect the proportion of patients in remission in the long-term. Antiepileptic drugs are associated with adverse events, and there is no evidence that they reduce mortality. In light of this review, the decision to start antiepileptic drug treatment following a first unprovoked seizure should be individualized and based on patient preference, clinical, legal, and socio-cultural factors.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^114B3wap]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Convulsive status epilepticus is the most severe form of epilepsy and requires urgent treatment. We synthesised the current evidence on first-line treatments for controlling seizures in adults with convulsive status epilepticus before, or at, arrival at hospital.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing antiepileptic drugs offered to adults as first-line treatments. Major electronic databases were searched.

Results

Four RCTs (1234 adults) were included. None were conducted in the UK and none assessed the use of buccal or intranasal midazolam. Both intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam administered by paramedics were more effective than placebo and, notably, intramuscular midazolam was non-inferior to intravenous lorazepam. Overall, median time to seizure cessation from drug administration varied from 2 to 15 min. Rates of respiratory depression among participants receiving active treatments ranged from 6.4 to 10.6%. Mortality ranged from 2 to 7.6% in active treatment groups and 6.2 to 15.5% in control groups.

Conclusions

Intravenous and intramuscular benzodiazepines are safe and effective in this clinical context. Further research is needed to establish the most clinically and cost-effective first-line treatment and preferable mode of administration. Head-to-head trials comparing buccal versus intranasal midazolam versus rectal diazepam would provide useful information to inform the management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults, especially when intravenous or intramuscular access is not feasible. Approaches to improve adherence to clinical guidelines on the use of currently available benzodiazepines for the first-line treatment of convulsive status epilepticus should also be considered.

### Optimizing treatment of epilepsy during pregnancy [^1137w9Yc]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Freedom from seizures is the ultimate goal in treatment of patients with epilepsy. At the same time, the side effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) should not outweigh the benefits of treatment. This is particularly important in women with epilepsy who wish to become pregnant. These women and their partners should be made aware of the risks associated with uncontrolled seizures as well as the teratogenicity of some AEDs. Recent studies have indicated a higher risk for birth defects and possibly also adverse cognitive effects associated with exposure to valproate compared with carbamazepine. Although further studies are needed, it appears reasonable to use valproate with caution in women with epilepsy who are planning to become pregnant and to consider whether other equally effective and safer AEDs are available. However, women who need valproate to control their seizures should continue the drug and not be discouraged from pregnancy, provided that they receive counseling with the best available knowledge. With proper management before conception, during pregnancy, and after birth, the vast majority of pregnancies in women with active epilepsy will have a favorable outcome.

Clinical context — when a patient with a first seizure has one or more ensuing seizures, an antiepileptic drug (AED) should be initiated because the risk of additional seizures is very high (57% by 1 year and 73% by 4 years), with risk increasing proportionally after each subsequent recurrence as the time interval between seizures decreases, whereas immediate AED treatment at the time of the first unprovoked seizure is not well accepted and is debated.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^111oCzPo]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal seizure — pharmacotherapy: Following a withdrawal seizure, patients should be immediately treated with a medication effective at preventing another seizure; benzodiazepines are first-line and a fast-acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam is preferred, while phenobarbital is an option but less preferred. Following a withdrawal seizure, parenteral administration of medications is preferred; if available, IV administration is preferred to intramuscular (IM), but IM administration is also effective, and parenteral phenobarbital should only be used in highly supervised settings (e.g. Intensive Care Unit [ICU] or Cardiac/Coronary Care Unit [CCU]) because of risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression. It is not recommended to use alpha2-adrenergic agonists or beta-adrenergic antagonists to prevent or treat alcohol withdrawal seizures, beta-adrenergic antagonists also can lower the seizure threshold, and phenytoin should not be used unless treating a concomitant underlying seizure disorder.

### Exit strategy: balancing the risks and rewards of antiseizure medication withdrawal [^117VaF7J]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Anti-Seizure Medication Withdrawal After Acute Symptomatic Seizures

Acute symptomatic seizures (ASyS) are defined as "events, occurring in close temporal relationship with an acute central nervous system insult, which may be metabolic, toxic, structural, infectious, or due to inflammation". Acute symptomatic seizures are highly prevalent, constituting up to 55% of all recorded seizures. Guidelines typically do not advocate routine treatment for patients experiencing ASyS, a recommendation grounded in the comparatively low overall risk of spontaneous seizures following ASyS in comparison to a first unprovoked seizure.

Despite this guidance, a significant proportion (∼86%, according to one estimate)of ASyS cases receive treatment in the acute setting. In instances where ASMs are initiated, a common recommendation is to gradually taper treatment immediately following the acute phase, that is, after 7 to 14 days. However, real-life data shows that 56% of adults with ASyS remain on ASMs at discharge, and 49% continue ASM use after 3 months, despite being free from unprovoked seizures.

The rationale behind the prolonged ASM treatment for certain patients with ASyS lies in the variability of the risk of unprovoked seizures based on the type of brain insult. Individuals with nonstructural etiologies, such as metabolic or toxic abnormalities, or seizures arising from alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal, exhibit a markedly low risk of unprovoked seizures. Similarly, patients with reversible etiologies, like eclampsia or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, also demonstrate a low risk. Conversely, those with structural etiologies, including cerebrovascular disorders or infections leading to a structural brain insult, face a risk ranging from 20% to 40% of developing unprovoked seizures.

These risks are also influenced by the type of ASyS and individual characteristics. For instance, ASyS regardless of etiology presenting as status epilepticus carry a 41% risk of subsequent unprovoked seizures, with ASyS presenting as status epilepticus after ischemic stroke yielding a > 80% risk. Prognostic models, exemplified by the SeLECT score for ischemic and the CAVE score for hemorrhagic stroke (see next for details), aid in integrating other individualized factors such as the location and severity of the brain insult into the risk assessment.

### Anticonvulsant therapy for status epilepticus [^115vyzyu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Status epilepticus is a medical emergency associated with significant mortality and morbidity that requires immediate and effective treatment.

Objectives

(1) To determine whether a particular anticonvulsant is more effective or safer to use in status epilepticus compared to another and compared to placebo.(2) To delineate reasons for disagreement in the literature regarding recommended treatment regimens and to highlight areas for future research.

Search Methods

For the latest update of this review, the following electronic databases were searched on 15/08/2013: the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register, CENTRAL The Cochrane Library July 2013, Issue 7, and MEDLINE (Ovid) 1946 to 15/08/2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of participants with premonitory, early, established or refractory status epilepticus using a truly random or quasi-random allocation of treatments were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eighteen studies with 2755 participants were included. Few studies used the same interventions. Intravenous diazepam was better than placebo in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures (risk ratio (RR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.92), requirement for ventilatory support (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.94), or continuation of status epilepticus requiring use of a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.92). Intravenous lorazepam was better than placebo for risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.71) and for risk of continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.71). Intravenous lorazepam was better than intravenous diazepam for reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90) and had a lower risk for continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.88). Intravenous lorazepam was better than intravenous phenytoin for risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.86). Diazepam gel was better than placebo gel in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.43 95% CI 0.30 to 0.62)For pre-hospital treatment, intramuscular midazolam is at least as effective as (probably more effective than) intravenous lorazepam in control of seizures (RR1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.27) and frequency of hospitalisation (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97) or intensive care admissions (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.96). It was uncertain whether Intravenous valproate was better than intravenous phenytoin in reducing risk of non-cessation of seizures (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.00). Both levetiracetam and lorazepam were equally effective in aborting seizures (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.13). Results for other comparisons of anticonvulsant therapies were uncertain due to single studies with few participants. The body of randomised evidence to guide clinical decisions is small. It was uncertain whether any anticonvulsant therapy was better than another in terms of adverse effects, due to few studies and participants identified. The quality of the evidence from the included studies is not strong but appears acceptable. We were unable to make judgements for risk of bias domains incomplete outcome reporting (attrition bias) and selective outcome reporting (selection bias) due to unclear reporting by the study authors.

Authors' Conclusions

Intravenous lorazepam is better than intravenous diazepam or intravenous phenytoin alone for cessation of seizures. Intravenous lorazepam also carries a lower risk of continuation of status epilepticus requiring a different drug or general anaesthesia compared with intravenous diazepam. Both intravenous lorazepam and diazepam are better than placebo for the same outcomes. For pre hospital management, midazolam IM seemed more effective than lorazepam IV for cessation of seizures, frequency of hospitalisation and ICU admissions however, it was unclear whether the risk of recurrence of seizures differed between treatments. The results of other comparisons of anticonvulsant therapies versus each other were also uncertain. Universally accepted definitions of premonitory, early, established and refractory status epilepticus are required. Diazepam gel was better than placebo gel in reducing the risk of non-cessation of seizures. Results for other comparisons of anticonvulsant therapies were uncertain due to single studies with few participants.

Pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome — topiramate and valproate prophylaxis use, dosing, and monitoring: The panel recommended that these medicines be reserved for those with more frequent (> 1/month) episodes and more severe symptoms (ED visits and hospitalizations) who have not responded to lifestyle modifications, nonpharmacological interventions, abortive medications and who are refractory to other prophylactic agents with more favorable side effect profiles; caution is indicated in those who may be considering pregnancy, and these drugs may be more suitable for patients with comorbid epilepsy. The potential side effects should be fully disclosed to the parents before initiating therapy, and topiramate should be titrated gradually from 25 mg/day or 0.5 mg/kg/day every 2 weeks by 1 mg/kg until a dose of 2 mg/kg/day divided BID is reached. Monitoring should include follow-up of therapeutic and adverse effects including weight checks at least every 6 months, and hepatic transaminases and platelets should be monitored while on valproate. The guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty evidence and judged these two medications acceptable to some and accessible to most patients, while determining there was a moderate therapeutic benefit and large harm and reserving its use for those who are refractory to other treatments.

### Immediate antiepileptic drug treatment, versus placebo, deferred, or no treatment for first unprovoked seizure [^114ztvdV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the Cochrane review previously published in 2016. There is considerable disagreement about the risk of recurrence following a first unprovoked epileptic seizure. A decision about whether to start antiepileptic drug treatment following a first seizure should be informed by information on the size of any reduction in risk of future seizures, the impact on long-term seizure remission, and the risk of adverse effects.

Objectives

To review the probability of seizure recurrence, seizure remission, mortality, and adverse effects of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment given immediately after the first seizure compared to controls (placebo, deferred treatment, or no treatment) in children and adults.

Search Methods

For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web) and MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to May 24, 2019) on 28 May 2019. There were no language restrictions. The Cochrane Register of Studies includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials from Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that could be blinded or unblinded. People of any age with a first unprovoked seizure of any type. Included studies compared participants receiving immediate antiepileptic treatment versus those receiving deferred treatment, those assigned to placebo, and those untreated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the studies identified by the search strategy for inclusion in the review and extracted data. The certainty of the evidence for the outcomes was classified in four categories according to the GRADE approach. Dichotomous outcomes were expressed as Risk Ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Time-to-event outcomes were expressed as Hazard Ratios (HR) with 95% CI. Only one trial used a double-blind design, and the two largest studies were unblinded. Most of the recurrences were generalised tonic-clonic seizures, a major type of seizures that is easily recognised, which should reduce the risk of outcome reporting bias.

Main Results

After exclusion of irrelevant papers, six studies (eleven reports) were selected for inclusion. Individual participant data were available from the two largest studies for meta-analysis. Selection bias and attrition bias could not be excluded within the four smaller studies, but the two largest studies reported attrition rates and adequate methods of randomisation and allocation concealment. Only one small trial used a double-blind design and the other trials were unblinded; however, most of the recurrences were generalised tonic-clonic seizures, a type of seizure that is easily recognisable. Compared to controls, participants randomised to immediate treatment had a lower probability of relapse at one year (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.58; 6 studies, 1634 participants; high-certainty evidence), at five years (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89; 2 studies, 1212 participants; high-certainty evidence) and a higher probability of an immediate five-year remission (RR 1.25; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.54; 2 studies, 1212 participants; high-certainty evidence). However, there was no difference between immediate treatment and control in terms of five-year remission at any time (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.21; 2 studies, 1212 participants; high-certainty evidence). Antiepileptic drugs did not affect overall mortality after a first seizure (RR 1.16; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.95; 2 studies, 1212 participants; high-certainty evidence). Compared to deferred treatment, treatment of the first seizure was associated with a significantly higher risk of adverse events (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.79; 2 studies, 1212 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We assessed the certainty of the evidence as moderate to low for the association of higher risk of adverse events when treatment of the first seizure was compared to no treatment or placebo, (RR 14.50, 95% CI 1.93 to 108.76; 1 study; 118 participants) and (RR 4.91, 95% CI 1.10 to 21.93; 1 study, 228 participants) respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

Treatment of the first unprovoked seizure reduces the risk of a subsequent seizure but does not affect the proportion of patients in remission in the long term. Antiepileptic drugs are associated with adverse events, and there is no evidence that they reduce mortality. In light of this review, the decision to start antiepileptic drug treatment following a first unprovoked seizure should be individualised and based on patient preference, clinical, legal, and sociocultural factors.

### Time to start calling things by their own names? The case for antiseizure medicines [^113BJ6iu]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It is time to change the name of medicines used to treat seizures. The medicines currently used are effective in aborting or preventing seizures through a merely symptomatic effect, that is, they have no known impact on the disease process in patients at risk of developing epilepsy or in those who have epilepsy, yet the current name is "antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)". - Referring to these medicines as "antiepileptic" rather than "antiseizure" misrepresents what these compounds actually do. Yet, the term "antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)" is pervasive in the medical literature. A PubMed search conducted on November 10, 2019, using the term "antiepileptic drugs" yielded 156 499 hits, compared to a paltry 383 hits for "antiseizure drugs". The time has come to adopt a more transparent language to define the medicines that we use. In this article, we review the pros and cons for abandoning the term "antiepileptic drugs", and for referring consistently to "antiseizure medicines (ASMs)" when dealing with drugs intended to have a symptomatic effect.

First unprovoked seizure in children — treatment recommendations emphasize individualized, risk–benefit decisions for children and adolescents who have experienced a first seizure. The decision as to whether or not to treat with AED following a first unprovoked seizure in a child or adolescent must be based on a risk–benefit assessment that weighs the risk of another seizure (both the statistical risk of recurrence and the potential consequences of a recurrence) against the risk (cognitive, behavioral, and physical side effects) as well as psychosocial of chronic AED therapy. This decision must be individualized and take into account both medical issues and patient and family preference. Treatment with AED is not indicated for the prevention of the development of epilepsy (Level B). Treatment with AED may be considered in circumstances where the benefits of reducing the risk of a second seizure outweigh the risks of pharmacologic and psychosocial side effects (Level B).

### Pharmacologic considerations in the treatment of repetitive or prolonged seizures [^1177G9RW]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Seizure emergencies are relatively common; however, in-hospital emergency care often is delayed by a variety of factors. Home-based treatment is effective at interrupting prolonged or repetitive seizures, but this option is underused despite its wide availability. The choice of agent used to treat seizure emergencies will depend chiefly on differences among the properties of the available drugs, particularly with regard to route of administration, lipid solubility, formulation characteristics, and the relative size of the absorptive surface area. These factors also can play a part in the decision to use one route of administration over another. Intravenous administration is the fastest and most reliable method of drug delivery, but alternative methods of drug delivery include oral, intramuscular, buccal, nasal, and rectal routes.

### Medications for early life epilepsy: evidence versus experience? [^113L2dC2]. Epilepsy Currents (2019). Medium credibility.

In the current era of rapidly expanding lists of anti-seizure medications, how do we know which ones are best to use in one of our most vulnerable populations? The continued use of phenobarbital is likely due to lack of good evidence to support the use of other medications. Currently, no anti-seizure medications have been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in neonates and few are approved for infants. Most clinical trials of anti-seizure medications exclude children of any age, especially infants. Once a medication is approved for adults, approval in pediatrics may take an average of 8 additional years. In the meantime, medications are used off label, which may increase the risk of adverse medication reactions. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Commission of Pediatrics carefully reviewed the current information available for treatment of seizures beginning in infancy and found strong evidence that levetiracetam is effective for the treatment of focal seizures in infants. However, the evidence for the preferred treatment of generalized seizures, benign infantile convulsions, benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, and provoked/situational seizures was weak, resulting in an overall lack of evidence-based recommendations for this population.

Without evidence, we fall back on the next best option for decision-making: experience. However, "because that's what we've always done" is not a replacement for practicing evidence-based medicine. The answer to this initially seems simple — do more studies of efficacy and safety of anti-seizure medications in neonates, infants, and children. Obtain the evidence-based information. However, this view may be overly simplistic and fraught with challenges.

The pediatric population is a vulnerable population, especially neonates and infants, making rigorous consent and safety monitoring of utmost importance. Parents fear anti-seizure medication side effects, with up to 86% reporting an adverse drug event in their child. Consequently, parents may fear enrolling their child in drug studies. This is also a population of great variability in size (comparing a neonate to a child) and metabolism, making pharmacokinetics challenging. In addition, when pediatric trials for drug development are created, there is a high trial failure rate due to difficulties with dose selection and trial design. Finally, infant-onset epilepsy is rare, making recruitment challenging.

### Emergency treatment of status epilepticus: current thinking [^113JH8JM]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Current thinking about the acute treatment of status epilepticus (SE) emphasizes a more aggressive clinical approach to this common life-threatening neurologic emergency. In this review, the authors consider four concepts that can accelerate effective treatment of SE. These include (1) updating the definition of SE to make it more clinically relevant, (2) consideration of faster ways to initiate first-line benzodiazepine therapy in the prehospital environment, (3) moving to second-line agents more quickly in refractory status in the emergency department, and (4) increasing detection and treatment of unrecognized nonconvulsive SE in comatose neurologic emergency patients.

### Dobbs versus Jackson: epilepsy, reproductive health, and abortion [^113Tsusv]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

Current State of Affairs on Abortion

Abortion is common in the United States; about 25% of people who can become pregnant have at least one. Most abortions (85%) occur early in pregnancy within the first trimester. Young age, being in school, difficult economic circumstances, lack of social support, and previously completing a family comprise common reasons. Black Americans, who face higher risks in pregnancy and worse economic circumstances than white Americans, more often end their pregnancies with abortion. People with epilepsy of childbearing potential (PWECP) experience as many, perhaps more, unplanned pregnancies than their healthy peers. About 50% of these unplanned pregnancies end in abortion.

Two methods are used for abortion early in pregnancy: dilation and suction curettage (D&C) and medications. Dilation and suction aspiration can be accomplished safely with local cervical anesthesia and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as well as moderate or deep sedation. Most sedation for abortion includes a benzodiazepine which is helpful to patients with epilepsy by decreasing the risk of a seizure. Most abortions by D&C occur in free-standing facilities outside of hospitals which is also safe for patients with well-controlled seizures. As of 2020, medications are used for about 50% of early abortions. Medication abortion includes oral mifepristone, a potent progesterone antagonist, followed by the prostaglandin misoprostol. Telehealth services are a safe and effective way to provide medication abortion. Using these medications, patients experience bleeding and cramping and expel the pregnancy at home. Patients report high satisfaction rates with both approaches. Safety of early abortion is high — less than 1% experience a serious complication. The risk of complications increases with advancing gestational age (GA). Uncomplicated abortion preserves future fertility.

Research consistently indicates PWECP lack understanding about fertility, teratogenicity of ASMs, contraception and related drug interactions. Providers caring for PWECP must understand how to provide either an effective contraception or an appropriate referral. The consequences of unplanned pregnancy can be severe: patients face a higher risk of morbidity and mortality which is complicated by the lack of specialized obstetric providers for persons who have epilepsy. In states with the most extreme bans, neither a medical condition such as epilepsy nor a fetal anomaly due to ASM exposure constitute eligible exceptions for an abortion. Persons with epilepsy can obtain information on how to access safe and affordable abortion care through the National Abortion Federation Hotline.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with seizures: approved by the ACEP board of directors, April 17, 2024 [^1134Njz6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Known seizure disorder — route of antiepileptic medication resumption in the emergency department (ED) is addressed with Level C guidance. Level A recommendations: None specified. Level B recommendations: None specified. Level C recommendations: When resuming antiepileptic medication in the ED is deemed appropriate, the emergency physician may administer intravenous (IV) or oral medication at their discretion. The emergency physician is often faced with determining how best to resume antiepileptic medications in patients with known seizure disorders, and strategies often become an issue under one of 2 circumstances: the patient could in theory benefit from rapid administration of prescribed medication (loading) to improve the likelihood of a safe, seizure-free discharge, or the patient has a contraindication to oral administration medications; patients who might potentially benefit from loading include those noted to have a subtherapeutic serum level of medication or to be noncompliant with a medication when a serum level cannot be readily assessed. The literature reviewed for this clinical question is limited because the only studies found did not use early seizure recurrence as a primary outcome measure, and most studies investigated loading dose strategies with attainment of drug levels, using serum levels as a surrogate outcome measure for efficacy.

### Seizure rescue medications and seizure action plan-AAP… [^117Qed5o]. AAP (2025). Medium credibility.

Please discuss the following scenarios for pediatric patients with epilepsy and/or seizures. For each patient, provide a recommendation for a seizure rescue medication and a seizure action plan. Suggested Answers: a) Intranasal diazepam 10 mg. This could be administered for seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes or clusters of seizures. b) She should receive intranasal diazepam at her weight-based dose, which is roughly 10 mg. c) Rectal diazepam can also be administered at 0. 3 mg/kg, again around 10 mg, but considering the seizures occur at school, intranasal diazepam is preferred to reduce embarrassment and allow for ease of access by faculty and staff. d) She is too young to receive intranasal midazolam. 2) What seizure rescue medication formulation and dose would be most appropriate for the 12-month-old boy with clusters of febrile seizures when sick. Suggested Answers: a) Rectal diazepam 5 mg.

Although rectal diazepam is only approved for children older than 2 years, it is often used in children older than 6 months. Children with febrile seizures often have seizures at the beginning of the illness. While rescue treatment is not necessarily needed for a single brief febrile seizure if the patient has prolonged or repetitive febrile seizures a rescue medication is indicated. b) Another option to consider would be an oral clonazepam bridge during periods of illness. 3) What seizure rescue medication formulation and dose would be most appropriate for the 15-year-old girl with prolonged focal seizures who wants to go on a sleepover. Should the patient disclose to her friend and their parents that she has epilepsy. Suggested Answers: a) Intranasal midazolam 5mg or intranasal diazepam 15mg.

Alternatively, because the patient has a premonitory phase if she is aware enough during this period, she could take an oral abortive agent such as clonazepam. ii) Make sure she takes her regular medication before attending to prevent a breakthrough seizure. c) Rectal medications are not preferred since she can receive intranasal. If you have any questions regarding epilepsy orthisfacilitated minitraining, please contact: The National Coordinating Center for Epilepsy.

### Are we failing to provide adequate rescue medication to children at risk of prolonged convulsive seizures in schools? [^112y6S2a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2013). Low credibility.

Prolonged convulsive seizures in children

Seizures that last more than 5 min are unlikely to stop on their own; thus, guidelines recommend that rescue medication (buccal midazolam or, if preferred or if buccal midazolam is unavailable, rectal diazepam) be administered for any convulsive seizure lasting 5 min or more in a community setting. Delays in treatment increase the risk of status epilepticus, which may result in possible cognitive deficitsand even death.

The NICE guidelines for the diagnosis and management of the epilepsies in primary and secondary care recommend that all relevant caregivers, who include parents, teachers and other school staff, receive dedicated training to be able to administer rescue medication as promptly as possible to children according to a prespecified protocol. Guidance on medicines management in mainstream schools also exists within the educational sector; however, it is not specific to the situation of children with prolonged convulsive seizures, and thus recommendations are subject to interpretation (box 1).

Box 1
Summary of recommendations in existing national guidance on the management of medicines in schools

Parents submit a request to the school for their child to receive prescribed medication as needed. They provide all the necessary medical information from the treating physician.
An individualised healthcare plan is agreed among the parents, school head, local health service and school doctor or nurse (if available).
This is supported by a school policy on the administration of medicines and/or epilepsy.
Teachers (or other staff members) are asked to volunteer to take responsibility for administering the medication in question.
They receive specific training to do so either from the school nurse or local health service.

### Evidence-based guideline update: vagus nerve stimulation for the treatment of epilepsy: report of the guideline development subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^112DJgf4]. Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) magnet-activated stimulation at aura or seizure onset was evaluated across five Class III studies; among 114 adult subjects with partial epilepsy, 21.3% of the active magnet group reported seizure abortion versus 11.9% with magnet off (difference nonsignificant) and response to active magnet use was associated with overall response to VNS (χ2, p = 0.0479); in another cohort of 35 patients, 21 could use the magnet and 14 (67%) consistently aborted partial or secondary generalized seizures, with 8 of these 14 later achieving at least 50% seizure frequency reduction; in a separate cohort, of 17 patients with seizure auras, 82% could abort seizures by magnet activation, whereas a pediatric drop-attack cohort showed no effect; conclusions state magnet-activated stimulation is possibly associated with overall response and may abort seizures one-fourth to two-thirds of the time during auras, and the recommendation is that patients may be counseled accordingly (Level C for both statements).

### Recommendations for the design of therapeutic trials for neonatal seizures [^117Edj5H]. Pediatric Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Choice of trial design

The trial design selected should use estimation methods (for early phase exploratory trials) and provide the best evidence (for Phase 2/3 randomized confirmatory trials) with the fewest number of neonates to maximize potential benefit and minimize risk. As such, adaptive trial designs integrating an interim analysis for safety and/or efficacy evaluation are increasingly accepted designs that may provide these advantages.
A. Adaptive design Advantages of sequential/adaptive design: Optimizes the number of included or randomized subjects, which is important given the relatively limited population of eligible neonates with seizures. Maximizes the number of subjects included or randomized to the most/more effective treatment, since data analyzed sequentially during the trial benefit subsequently enrolled subjects (e.g. prioritize treatments based on optimal seizure reduction). Trial stops as soon as pre-defined efficacy endpoints have been adequately evaluated, e.g. reaching a pre-defined threshold of increased probability of seizure reduction. Can adapt one or more design variables, such as treatment group assignment, sample size, dose selection, or even endpoint definition (based on interim estimate of treatment effect), e.g. de-prioritize treatments that miss the pre-defined threshold for seizure reduction probability. Requirements to be specified before using an adaptive design: An adaptive design requires generation of initial assumptions based on all available data from published trials and observational data. In addition, the stopping rules for these designs depend on the definition and selection of the study endpoints. This limitation regarding endpoints exists in part because clinically meaningful reduction in neonatal seizure burden as a primary endpoint has been defined partly by expert consensus rather than direct evidence of any benefit(s) of seizure reduction. In particular, the large variability in seizure burden in neonates may make an adaptive design based on endpoints or treatment assignment more prone to error with small sample size. A limited sample size in an adaptive design trial may also be too small to adequately test some outcomes completely (e.g. safety and secondary outcomes). Thus, early phase dose escalation studies might need to stipulate a minimum number of subjects prior to escalation if there are limited safety data available for the drug being tested, which favors inclusion of a control arm. Confirmatory randomized trials that use a frequentist approach require a priori consensus on the null hypothesis for superiority testing (what constitutes adequate evidence of a drug effect), which defines the upper and lower bounds for the stopping rules. – For confirmatory trials using a Bayesian approach, consensus is needed for the definition of the threshold of the posterior probabilities for efficacy parameters, such as a given increase in the probability of neonatal seizure reduction.
B. Conventional (i.e. non-adaptive) trial design: Conventional design may be appropriate for exploratory, early phase trials if there is significant uncertainty regarding many of the initial assumptions, which limits generation of critical aspects of an adaptive trial design.
C. Crossover design: Crossover design is discouraged because it requires a significantly larger number of subjects to test most outcomes (efficacy, safety, PK/PD), and because there is limited interpretation of all outcomes if majority of subjects crossover, as is likely given high failure rate of current drugs for neonatal seizures.

### Pediatric advanced life support. post-cardiac arrest care [^1154Q2Kp]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric advanced life support — post-cardiac arrest care in children addresses seizure management as follows: the ILCOR review concludes that there is insufficient evidence to make a treatment recommendation for or against the treatment of seizures in children post-cardiac arrest, yet for seizure treatment ILCOR made a good practice statement suggesting that it is reasonable to treat seizures in children with ROSC following cardiac arrest. In forming these statements, considerations included the lack of direct evidence in children, indirect adult cardiac arrest evidence that failed to show a benefit from prophylactic anti-seizure medications, and evidence that prophylactic anti-seizure medication in other forms of acute brain injury is not associated with improved long-term outcomes. The authors note that newer anti-seizure medications have not been studied for prophylaxis in children post-ROSC and may have fewer side effects or better efficacy, and that a high seizure burden in children is associated with poor neurological outcomes while anti-seizure medications can reduce seizures in children with status epilepticus. Lastly, there was insufficient evidence to suggest for or against treatment of rhythmic and periodic EEG pattern in children post-cardiac arrest, highlighting that there are many knowledge gaps and much more research is needed.

### Management of the first stage of convulsive status epilepticus in adults: a systematic review of current randomised evidence [^116XrDxK]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Convulsive status epilepticus is the most severe form of epileptic attack and a life-threatening neurological emergency, which is associated with substantial mortality and morbidity. The clinical manifestation of convulsive status epilepticus is characterised by a prolonged tonic–clonic seizure or repetitive seizures without full recovery of consciousness between them.

Epidemiological studies have documented a global annual incidence of status epilepticus of 7 to 41 cases per 100,000 population. In Europe, the annual incidence of status epilepticus lies between 10 and 16 per 100,000 population, and convulsive status epilepticus accounts for 45–74% of all cases. Incidence of convulsive status epilepticus tends to be higher in males than females. Mortality of status epilepticus has been reported to range from around 8–33% according to aetiology, with older age being a detrimental factor. A recent meta-analysis of convulsive status epilepticus in high-income countries reported pooled mortality of 15.9% and the authors noted that survival rates have not improved over the last 30 years.

The ultimate goal of treatment is to stop both clinical and electroencephalographic seizure activity as soon as possible as convulsive status epilepticus can worsen with delayed or suboptimal treatment. Early treatment of convulsive status epilepticus is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality and with a greater proportion of terminated seizures at arrival at the hospital emergency department.

The first-line treatment of status epilepticus is currently benzodiazepines. The UK NICE Clinical Guidance recommends the use of buccal midazolam in the community setting before arrival at the hospital, or the administration of rectal diazepam if buccal midazolam is not available. The Scottish SIGN guideline and the 2010 European Federation of Neurologists recommend intravenous (IV) administration of lorazepam or diazepam if IV access is already established and resuscitation available. To date, few trials have evaluated treatment options for adults and there is uncertainty about the optimal first-line treatment to control seizures before arrival at the hospital.

Objectives

The objective of this assessment was to synthesise current evidence on first-line pharmacological interventions to control seizures in adults before, or at, arrival at the hospital with the aim to inform clinical practice and future research.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review according to current methodological standards and pre-specified its methods in a research protocol (PROSPERO registration: CRD42020201953). This report adheres to the principles of the PRISMA 2020 statement.

### The charges for seizures in the pediatric emergency room: a single center study [^112yXf8B]. Pediatric Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The direct charges for emergency department visits resulting from recurrent seizures are significant, and home intervention with abortive medications can be cost-saving. Over a 1-year period, we evaluated children with seizures who were seen in the emergency department, stabilized, and released. The information is necessary to assess the pharmacoeconomic advantages of at-home interventions for seizure emergencies.

Methods

We did a retrospective chart review of 90 patients and divided them into febrile versus nonfebrile seizures and existing versus new-onset seizure disorder. The hospital accounting department performed a charge analysis.

Results and Conclusion

The total charges for all 90 patients treated for seizures in the emergency department were $219,945. The minimum was $370, for a patient with no history of febrile seizures. The maximum was $17,126, for a patient with a nonfebrile seizure and a history of seizures. This information allows a comparison with the cost of preventive medications, such as diazepam rectal gel or intranasal midazolam.

Regarding medical management for neonatal seizures, more specifically with respect to antiepileptic drugs, second-line, ILAE 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering a sodium channel blocker (phenytoin or carbamazepine depending on the clinical state of the neonate, whether critically ill or otherwise well, and the regional availability of antiseizure medication and monitoring of drug levels) as a second-line antiseizure medication if channelopathy is suspected as an etiology for seizures based on clinical or EEG features.

Medication overuse headache (MOH) in patients with a preexisting headache condition can be diagnosed when they use non-opioid analgesic, opioid, or combination analgesic medications for the acute treatment of headache more than 10–15 days each month (dependent on the type of medication or medications used), and headache attributed to MOH occurs 15 or more days per month with overuse of one or more acute headache medications for more than 3 months. MOH is described as a frequently missed diagnosis when evaluating chronic headache disorders, and in the United States nearly one-quarter of people with chronic headaches take abortive medications daily. The association between butalbital containing compounds and developing MOH is highlighted along with the importance of not abruptly stopping these medications (because abrupt cessation can precipitate withdrawal seizures). MOH is noted as a condition that can be treated or even prevented with judicious and infrequent use of abortive pain medications and close communication and collaboration between patients and health care providers regarding the degree of headache control, appropriate use of headache preventive medications, and accurate assessment of the use of as-needed pain medication.

Alcohol withdrawal seizure management — following a withdrawal seizure, parenteral administration of medications is preferred, with IV preferred to intramuscular (IM) and IM administration also effective; parenteral phenobarbital should only be used in highly supervised settings because of risk of over-sedation and respiratory depression. It is not recommended to use alpha2-adrenergic agonists or beta-adrenergic antagonists to prevent or treat alcohol withdrawal seizures, beta-adrenergic antagonists can lower the seizure threshold, and phenytoin should not be used unless treating a concomitant underlying seizure disorder.

### Epilepsy benchmarks area III: improved treatment options for controlling seizures and epilepsy-related conditions without side effects [^114KiavH]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Status epilepticus remains a clinical challenge, with a subset of patients proving refractory to multiple treatmentsdespite the development and approval of new antiseizure medications (ASMs). The persistent seizures associated with this condition focus attention on how little we understand about the processes of seizure initiation, maintenance, and termination. Thus, insight into mechanisms that maintain hypersynchronous firing for prolonged durations in the face of adaptive changes, exhaustion of energy stores, and mounting inflammatory cascades may allow improved treatments that can stop ongoing seizures and status epilepticus. Although a variety of processes are considered relevant to status epilepticus, - we still lack a clear assessment of the relative contributions of each one. New mechanism-based targets would improve our ability to effectively terminate status epilepticus.

An impressive amount of electrophysiological analysis of mechanisms that can lead to hypersynchronous firing has been performed either in vivo in adult animals or ex vivo in brain slices from rodents that range in age from adolescence to young adulthood. There is a growing opportunity to complement animal tissue work with acute and organotypic human brain slices obtained following surgical resection, as well as in vivo recordings from depth electrode–implanted patients. However, there is a stark lack of information in some areas, for example, related to features of the neonatal brain that contribute to hypersynchronous activity, apart from changes in chloride (Cl −) gradients that render GABAergic transmission excitatory. Early-life seizures are an important therapeutic target because many epileptic encephalopathies become apparent early in life. In particular, understanding the mechanisms underlying hypersynchronous firing in neonatal brain could lead to the development of therapies that are more effective for neonatal seizures as opposed to simply modifying the dosing of drugs that showed a positive signal in clinical trials in adults with epilepsy. Strategies could involve use of repurposed drugs, specific combinations of therapies, or the development of new therapies, noting, however, the substantial hurdles for bringing to market drugs for a pediatric population. Although the first uncontrolled trial of the repurposed drug bumetanide did not show efficacy, this finding was controversial, and the results of a subsequent blinded controlled trial of bumetanide is reported to be more promising. To this end, new genetic models of ultrarare variants in genes capable of producing seizures and hyperexcitability may provide new models of mechanisms underlying development of an epileptic focus in neonatal animals. Indeed, multiple animal models of genetic epilepsies show seizure activity at an early age, providing an opportunity to study epilepsy in the developing brain.

### Benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus: a narrative review [^117L76KF]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seizures are a common complaint in the emergency department, with status epilepticus (SE) associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While the typical first-line therapy for seizures includes benzodiazepines, patients with SE may be refractory to benzodiazepines. Seizures of longer duration are harder to break, and SE becomes a self-sustaining cycle; thus, benzodiazepine-refractory SE is a particularly challenging condition facing emergency clinicians.

Objectives

This narrative review provides a focused evaluation of SE refractory to first-line therapy, highlighting potential underlying causes and management strategies.

Discussion

SE may occur in 22% of seizure cases presenting to the emergency department, and up to 40% of these patients will have seizure activity refractory to benzodiazepine therapy. Prolonged seizure activity is associated with long-term neurologic consequences. Potential underlying causes of SE include endocrine, metabolic, infectious, neurologic, obstetric, toxicologic, and traumatic etiologies. Reversing these underlying causes can help terminate seizure activity. Benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam) are considered first-line anti-seizure medications (ASMs) and must be administered in adequate doses to reach their maximum therapeutic potential. Patients who continue seizing should receive a second dose of benzodiazepines at the 5-min mark, combined with a second-line ASM, such as fosphenytoin (preferred over phenytoin), levetiracetam, or valproic acid. Patients who continue seizing are considered to have refractory SE and should receive third-line agents, such as ketamine, pentobarbital, propofol, or thiopental, as the clinician prepares for intubation. Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) should be considered when moving from second- to third-line ASMs or when intubation is necessary. Early aggressive therapy is key for terminating seizure activity.

Conclusion

Recognizing and treating SE early is critical for preserving neurologic function. Emergency clinicians must be prepared to reverse the underlying causes of SE and utilize second- and third-line ASMs to abort seizure activity when necessary.

Potential substitution for effective treatment

Given the perception that cannabis-derived products are more natural, there is real concern that patients and caregivers may substitute medications with scientifically proven medical benefit for cannabis-derived products with unsubstantiated claims. A recent study demonstrated that nearly 50% of subjects had substituted cannabis for a prescription medication. With social media allowing for personal stories extolling marijuana products for life-threatening diseases, such as epilepsy and cancer, we need to implement strategies highlighting the risks of avoiding or demonizing scientifically proven or FDA-approved treatments. One example is a cannabis-derived product sold online purportedly to abort seizures: Given the substantial risk of injury from prolonged seizures and clear data supporting earlier treatment using benzodiazepines for first-line therapy to abort seizures, using cannabis-derived products in this manner is, at best, misguided and more likely to be negligent.

Product Variability and Lack of Standards in Manufacturing and Product Quality

In the current environment, CBD and cannabis-derived compounds are available through 3 different marketing avenues. There is the FDA-approved CBD product, Epidiolex®, other FDA-approved cannabis-derived compounds (eg, Marinol, Syndros, Cesamet), state-authorized CBD or cannabis-derived compounds, and artisanal or completely unregulated products.

Types of available products

As noted, there are FDA-approved CBD and cannabis-derived compounds that are available to patients through the traditional prescriptive process. We will not comment on these products, as they meet FDA standards and regulation.

Several states, like Minnesota, Iowa, and Ohio have developed their own programs for authorization of products of CBD or cannabis-derived compounds. Laws and regulations for these programs and the products vary greatly from state to state, with Iowa being one example. However, the programs usually require some type of physician authorization for a patient to obtain CBD or cannabis-derived compounds; state authorization of the CBD or cannabis-derived compound products available to patients; state monitoring of quality, purity, and manufacturing of the CBD or cannabis-derived compound products; governance or oversight of the cannabis program by a medical and regulatory board; and use of state licensed or authorized dispensaries for distribution of CBD and cannabis-derived compounds. Minnesota has one of the longest records in operating a state-authorized cannabis program and has a good amount of data on the use of cannabis for various medication conditions.

### Rescue medicine for epilepsy in education settings [^114opkTM]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Children and adolescents with epilepsy may experience prolonged seizures in school-associated settings (eg, during transportation, in the classroom, or during sports activities). Prolonged seizures may evolve into status epilepticus. Administering a seizure rescue medication can abort the seizure and may obviate the need for emergency medical services and subsequent care in an emergency department. In turn, this may save patients from the morbidity of more invasive interventions and the cost of escalated care. There are significant variations in prescribing practices for seizure rescue medications, partly because of inconsistencies between jurisdictions in legislation and professional practice guidelines among potential first responders (including school staff). There also are potential liability issues for prescribers, school districts, and unlicensed assistive personnel who might administer the seizure rescue medications. This clinical report highlights issues that providers may consider when prescribing seizure rescue medications and creating school medical orders and/or action plans for students with epilepsy. Collaboration among prescribing providers, families, and schools may be useful in developing plans for the use of seizure rescue medications.

### Pick your poison but Pick It wisely: choosing a second-line medication for the management of status epilepticus [^113EHgMj]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurologic emergency with elevated mortality rates of over 20% in adults and 3% to 6% in children. The International League Against Epilepsy introduced a new definition and classification of SE in 2015, which highlights the severity of this condition, its long-term consequences in terms of neuronal death, and irreversible brain damage as well as the urgency to treat it. The operational dimensions of this classification considers generalized motor SE as more acutely threatening for long-term damage than focal or absence SE. Higher mortality rates are seen in prolonged and progressively refractory SE. Controlling ongoing clinical seizures as well as nonconvulsive SE (NCSE) in the shortest amount of time is an urgent priority.

The first-line treatment of SE is a benzodiazepine. Lorazepam has shown efficacy and ease of use superior to other anti-seizure medications (ASM). More recently, the use of intramuscular midazolam was shown to be as effective as intravenous lorazepam, to have similar rate of complications including need for intubation, and to be easier to use in the prehospital management of SE. Benzodiazepines are effective in 60% to 70% of cases when adequate doses are used; unfortunately, they are often underdosed in the emergency department setting.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114k4vzo]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal seizures — acute treatment and anticonvulsant options — are outlined as follows: Benzodiazepines are effective in the primary and secondary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures, and intravenous (IV) administration of a fast-acting agent such as lorazepam or diazepam is recommended after a withdrawal-related seizure; in a randomized, double-blind trial, patients received either 2 mL of saline or 2 mL of lorazepam intravenously and IV lorazepam significantly reduced recurrent seizures. All patients presenting with an alcohol withdrawal seizure should have IV access established immediately for fluids and medication, and intramuscular (IM) administration is also an effective and acceptable route. Phenobarbital is an appropriate option with a long half-life and a narrow therapeutic window and is more commonly used in an inpatient setting, such as the intensive care unit (ICU) or emergency department (ED) where there is continuous supervision; the Guideline Committee recommends caution when using in settings that offer less monitoring than the ICU and ED, and clinicians with minimal experience should use extra caution in case over-sedation or respiratory depression occurs. Supporting data include a prospective series in which none of the 38 patients with alcohol withdrawal seizures had a subsequent convulsion after IV phenobarbital, and a small randomized trial in the ED found phenobarbital to be as effective as benzodiazepines for reducing CIWA-Ar scores from baseline to discharge. While animal studies show anticonvulsants can prevent seizures and delirium, human evidence is mixed and insufficient to conclude superiority over benzodiazepines, and phenytoin has been shown to be ineffective in preventing the recurrence of seizure and is not recommended unless treating a concomitant underlying seizure disorder.

### First-trimester abortion in women with medical conditions: release date October 2012 SFP guideline # 20122 [^115V8sXF]. Contraception (2012). Medium credibility.

Epilepsy — women with well-controlled epilepsy may receive outpatient abortion care, whereas those with recent onset or uncontrolled seizures may benefit from hospital-based care. The dose of mifepristone may be increased in patients who take antiepileptic drugs that augment the hepatic P450 system that metabolizes mifepristone (i.e., phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and oxcarbazepine); however, no research data guide the choice of mifepristone dose, and a mifepristone dose of up to 600 mg is approved as safe and effective for abortion care. If a seizure occurs during abortion in an awake patient, appropriate measures include maintaining patient safety (safe positioning with support) and interrupting the abortion procedure if possible while the seizure resolves; benzodiazepines, such as midazolam, will control prolonged or repetitive tonic-clonic seizures quickly and prevent seizure-related neurological and systemic injury. Ancillary measures include airway maintenance, oxygen administration, administration of intravenous fluids, monitoring of vital signs and prompt hospitalization. For postabortion contraception, consideration should be given to interactions of certain anticonvulsants with combined hormonal contraception, there are no data to guide dosing of DMPA in the context of antiepileptic drug therapy, and intrauterine contraception may be ideal.

### Common pitfalls, and how to avoid them, in child and adolescent psychopharmacology: part II [^113wYKpV]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment

The most common treatment pitfall to be avoided by the practitioner managing children with epilepsy is the failure to treat psychiatric disorders adequately because of an inappropriate concern about exacerbating seizures. Misleading conclusions were drawn from past studies because of a lack of recognition that many psychiatric disorders, including ADHD and depression, are associated with epilepsy, implying seizures in these disorders were often not the result of the psychotropic medication but were, instead, the result of an association with the disorder itself. A good knowledge of valid evidence allows these pitfalls to be avoided. What are the common psychiatric conditions associated with epilepsy and what is the risk of treating them with standard medication? Overall, stimulant medication for ADHD, SSRIs for anxiety, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, and melatonin for sleep-onset disorder do not appear in general to exacerbate seizures. The risk of exacerbating seizures with low-dose risperidone when used by some practitioners for anxiety treatment seems to be low, but this compound should only be used after a fair trial of non-pharmacological interventions and SSRIs if symptoms are still impairing. When treating psychosis, the risk of seizure exacerbation is related to the dose of antipsychotic medication. Therefore, practitioners should use a minimal effective dose. Notably, the distress caused by the psychosis might be far more than the distress caused by a seizure exacerbation.

Although the risk of seizure exacerbation with most psychotropic medications is generally small, certain medications probably should be avoided, if possible, including bupropion, imipramine, clomipramine, alprazolam, chlorpromazine, quetiapine, olanzapine and clozapine because there is evidence for seizure precipitation/exacerbation. However, even with many of these medications, including clozapine, if the dose is kept low, the risk is probably small. Knowledge of which medications should not be used or, if they are prescribed, should be monitored closely, allows the clinician to treat the individual with confidence and to avoid the pitfall of failing to treat psychiatric conditions because of inappropriate fear of seizure exacerbation.

### Dobbs versus Jackson: epilepsy, reproductive health, and abortion [^116q4y8W]. Epilepsy Currents (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

A half-century ago, Roe v. Wade was decided by the Supreme Court when Texas lawyer Sarah Weddington argued the case that women had the right to privacy under the 14th Amendment to determine whether to pursue a safe and legal abortion. That same year, Henri Gastaut, along with World Health Organization collaborators, published the Dictionary of Epilepsy where he defined older terms such as "falling sickness" and "fit" as "obsolete", engaging the medical community to embrace new terms that took on a data-driven view of epilepsy, a need that he described as "increasingly urgent". Changes throughout the medical community were occurring as new viewpoints of age-old problems emerged.

On June 24, 2022, Dobbs vs Jackson Women's Health Organization was decided by the Supreme Court effectively overturning the former precedent of Roe v. Wade. Many national and international medical organizations took to their platforms to state their opinion on this landmark decision including the American Epilepsy Society (AES) which stated that the goal of AES is "equitable access to quality health care for all people. Further, we stand firm in our responsibility to deliver evidence-based medical care consistent with the best interests of our patients and against any interference into the practice of medicine that undermines the integrity of the physician-patient relationship". It was acknowledged that although not all may share the same opinion on abortion, "it is critically important that medical decisions are made by qualified practitioners" and that this be done based on evidence with respect for the individual patient.

In caring for persons with epilepsy, maintaining the highest standard of evidence-based care is our goal. The consequences of caring for people who can become pregnant without such knowledge regarding the intersection of epilepsy and reproductive health bears a greater weight for these individuals who may have fewer reproductive options since Dobbs v. Jackson. The goal of this article is to review key information to equip the epilepsy practitioner in caring effectively and compassionately for persons who may be affected by this ruling. In this context, this article will review (1) the current state of affairs on abortion in the United States; (2) contraception options, their effectiveness, and interactions with anti-seizure medications (ASM); (3) teratogenic effects and adverse neurocognitive outcomes of ASMs; (4) folic acid supplementation; (5) the effect on perinatal and pediatric care; and (6) unique issues related to people of color (POC).

### Pick your poison but Pick It wisely: choosing a second-line medication for the management of status epilepticus [^117U5nmu]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

While ESETT provides high-level evidence regarding the choice of ASM in the management of SE in all age groups, other considerations may come into place when making this decision. If all 3 alternatives are equally safe and effective, we need to rather think about the long-term effects of committing a patient to these therapies. Keeping in mind that ASM are often easy to start and difficult to discontinue, considerations such as sex, medical comorbidities, pharmacologic interactions with other chronic therapies, and neuropsychiatric profile may sway the decision one way or another. Practical examples include avoiding valproic acid when treating a woman of childbearing age or fosphenytoin in patients with cardiovascular disease on chronic anticoagulation, among others.

The cause of SE may be another variable to consider. In patients with chronic epilepsy who present with medication noncompliance as the precipitating factor for SE, using the same medication the patient missed at a loading dose may result in a more sustainable therapy than adding a new medication to a patient who already had compliance issues. Checking ASM levels is useful to understand the cause of SE, even if these results will not be readily available for the acute treating team. Although SE is an emergency and clinical decisions are made within a narrow window of time, the decisions we make may become difficult to undo in the longer term. The good news is: all 3 of these medications seem to be equally effective. We have then the responsibility of choosing wisely for each patient. The information needed, such as demographics, prior history of epilepsy, home ASM doses, and potential noncompliance as well as medical and psychiatric comorbidities, is often readily available.

Since ESETT enrollment and publication, other medications have become available that are suitable for ER use in this critical situation, including lacosamide and brivaracetam as well as others coming into the market. Having a strong level of evidence of efficacy and safety for the therapies that we use is an advantage. Other medications will have to measure themselves to this standard.

One last thought is for the 40% or so of patients with established convulsive SE who do not respond to the second-line ASM. One option is to add a different second-line (now third) agent. Alternatively, considering the potential long-term damage and high mortality associated with refractory SE, moving faster to general anesthesiaunder continuous EEG monitoring may be the clear next step. Further studies are needed to evaluate this intervention.

### Evidence-based guideline: treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children and adults: report of the guideline committee of the American Epilepsy Society [^111NJofA]. Epilepsy Currents (2016). Low credibility.

Context

The optimal pharmacologic treatment for early convulsive status epilepticus is unclear.

Objective

To analyze efficacy, tolerability and safety data for anticonvulsant treatment of children and adults with convulsive status epilepticus and use this analysis to develop an evidence-based treatment algorithm.

Data Sources

Structured literature review using MEDLINE, Embase, Current Contents, and Cochrane library supplemented with article reference lists.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials of anticonvulsant treatment for seizures lasting longer than 5 minutes.

Data Extraction

Individual studies were rated using predefined criteria and these results were used to form recommendations, conclusions, and an evidence-based treatment algorithm.

Results

A total of 38 randomized controlled trials were identified, rated and contributed to the assessment. Only four trials were considered to have class I evidence of efficacy. Two studies were rated as class II and the remaining 32 were judged to have class III evidence. In adults with convulsive status epilepticus, intramuscular midazolam, intravenous lorazepam, intravenous diazepam and intravenous phenobarbital are established as efficacious as initial therapy (Level A). Intramuscular midazolam has superior effectiveness compared to intravenous lorazepam in adults with convulsive status epilepticus without established intravenous access (Level A). In children, intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam are established as efficacious at stopping seizures lasting at least 5 minutes (Level A) while rectal diazepam, intramuscular midazolam, intranasal midazolam, and buccal midazolam are probably effective (Level B). No significant difference in effectiveness has been demonstrated between intravenous lorazepam and intravenous diazepam in adults or children with convulsive status epilepticus (Level A). Respiratory and cardiac symptoms are the most commonly encountered treatment-emergent adverse events associated with intravenous anticonvulsant drug administration in adults with convulsive status epilepticus (Level A). The rate of respiratory depression in patients with convulsive status epilepticus treated with benzodiazepines is lower than in patients with convulsive status epilepticus treated with placebo indicating that respiratory problems are an important consequence of untreated convulsive status epilepticus (Level A). When both are available, fosphenytoin is preferred over phenytoin based on tolerability but phenytoin is an acceptable alternative (Level A). In adults, compared to the first therapy, the second therapy is less effective while the third therapy is substantially less effective (Level A). In children, the second therapy appears less effective and there are no data about third therapy efficacy (Level C). The evidence was synthesized into a treatment algorithm.

Conclusions

Despite the paucity of well-designed randomized controlled trials, practical conclusions and an integrated treatment algorithm for the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus across the age spectrum (infants through adults) can be constructed. Multicenter, multinational efforts are needed to design, conduct and analyze additional randomized controlled trials that can answer the many outstanding clinically relevant questions identified in this guideline.

The use of ECT in the perinatal period

In systematic reviews of the case literature on ECT in the perinatal period, summarised by, the most common adverse effects attributed to the treatment were foetal bradyarrhythmia, abdominal pain, uterine contractions, premature birth, vaginal bleeding, placental abruption and threatened abortion. In many cases, symptoms were mild and transient. No maternal deaths were reported.

Among 339 cases summarised by, 11 foetal or neonatal deaths were reported, one of which was attributed to the treatment: it occurred in the context of maternal status epilepticus following three successive stimuli administered during ECT.found a high rate of complications in their systematic review of case reports and series, including 12 foetal and neonatal deaths among 169 cases. However, the authors did not state whether these outcomes were caused or thought to be caused by ECT. This review included all adverse maternal and foetal outcomes among complications of ECT even if they were highly unlikely to be related to the treatment, such as, for example, anencephaly and other congenital anomalies. This approach led the authors to call for great caution when considering the use of ECT in pregnancy. The authors of the other four systematic reviews – while acknowledging the difficulties with interpreting case literature – concluded that ECT is an effective treatment for severe mental illness during pregnancy and that the risks to mother and foetus are relatively low. This view is shared by publications of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the APA, and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.

To achieve the optimal outcomes for mother and child, it is important that professionals with expertise in ECT, perinatal psychiatry and obstetrics are involved in a decision to deliver ECT during pregnancy. It is essential that clinicians identify pre-existing risk factors for poor outcomes, appropriately monitor maternal and foetal well-being before, during and after the procedure, and utilise effective preventative interventions. The location and team composition for conducting the ECT and what measures should be taken before, during and after the procedure to prevent maternal and foetal complications depend on the stage of pregnancy.

There is evidence from three observational studies that ECT is more effective for women with severe affective disorders after childbirth than for non-postnatal patients. The short half-lives of medication used for anaesthesia and muscle relaxation during ECT mean that women should not be prevented from resuming breastfeeding after treatments.

Although definition of seizure cessation and of convulsive status epilepticus varied across the four included trials, our findings showed that, in general, benzodiazepines (i.e. lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam) were effective at stopping seizures in adults treated in the pre-hospital setting. In the only trial with an untreated placebo arm by Alldredge et al. convulsive status epilepticus was successfully terminated before arrival at the emergency department in 59.1%, of adults treated with 2 mg IV lorazepam, in 42.6% of those treated with 5 mg IV diazepam and in 21.1% of those who received placebo, with no significant difference between the two benzodiazepine treatments (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.8 to 4.4). The hazard ratio for the time between active treatment and seizure cessation was 2.94 (95% CI 1.41–5.88) for lorazepam versus placebo and 1.54 (95% CI 0.85–2.77) for lorazepam versus diazepam. In the RAMPART trial by Silbergleit et al. 10 mg IM midazolam was non-inferior to 4 mg IV lorazepam for achieving seizure cessation (73.9% vs 62.4% of participants, respectively and the median time from active treatment to cessation of convulsions was similar across treatment groups: 2 versus 3 min in the midazolam and lorazepam groups, respectively). In the trial by Navarro et al. the addition of 2.5 g IV levetiracetam to 1 mg clonazepam did not confer any clear benefits over 1 mg clonazepam plus IV placebo in terms of the proportion of participants with seizure cessation (73.2% vs 83.8% participants, respectively). The median time between active treatment and interruption of the convulsion was 3 versus 5 min in the levetiracetam + clonazepam group and the clonazepam + placebo group, respectively. In the study by Shaner et al. more participants treated with 100 mg/min IV phenobarbital plus 40 mg/min phenytoin achieved seizure cessation than those treated with 2 mg/min IV diazepam plus 40 mg/min phenytoin (72.2% participants vs 33.3%, respectively). The median time from active treatment to seizure cessation was shorter for the phenobarbital group than for the diazepam group (5.5 vs 15 min, respectively, p < 0.10).

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition 2025 guidelines on the diagnosis of cyclic vomiting syndrome in children [^115DNiPS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric cyclic vomiting syndrome prophylaxis — topiramate and valproate evidence and candidate patients: These two medications, topiramate and valproate, were judged acceptable to some and accessible to most patients, and the guideline panel determined that there is very low certainty evidence (4 studies with direct and 20 studies with indirect evidence) for a net health benefit while also determining a moderate therapeutic benefit and large harm, reserving use for those who are refractory to other treatments. The panel recommended that these medicines be reserved for those with more frequent (> 1/month) episodes and more severe symptoms (ED visits and hospitalizations) who have not responded to lifestyle modifications, nonpharmacological interventions, abortive medications and who are refractory to other prophylactic agents with more favorable side effect profiles, with caution indicated in those with hepatic disease and thrombocytopenia; these drugs may be more suitable for patients with comorbid epilepsy.

### Intravenous versus nonintravenous benzodiazepines for the cessation of seizures: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1132cS5V]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The acquisition of intravenous (IV) access in the actively convulsing patient is difficult. This often delays the administration of the IV benzodiazepine (BDZ) necessary for seizure cessation. Delays in seizure cessation are associated with increased pharmacoresistance, increased risk of neuronal injury, worse patient outcomes, and increased morbidity.

Objective

The objective was to assess whether the delay imposed by IV access acquisition is justified by improved outcomes. We compared IV versus non-IV BDZ efficacy in the real world with regard to failure rates (primary outcome), interval to seizure control, and observed complications (secondary outcomes).

Methods

A systematic review was performed using Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. All studies published or in press from the inception of the respective database to July 2016 were included. Only randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials directly comparing IV to non-IV (buccal, rectal, intranasal, or intramuscular) BDZ were included.

Results

Our search strategy retrieved 2,604 citations for review. A total of 11 studies were finally included in qualitative synthesis and 10 in quantitative analysis. Only one was of high quality. For treatment failure, non-IV BDZ was superior to IV BDZ (odd ratio [OR] = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.56–0.92). However, no significant difference was found between the two treatments in the pediatric subgroup (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.74–1.81). Non-IV BDZ was administered faster than IV BDZ and therefore controlled seizures faster (mean difference = 3.41 minutes; 95% CI = 1.69–5.13 minutes) despite a longer interval between drug administration and seizure cessation (mean difference = 0.74 minutes; 95% CI = 0.52–0.95 minutes). Respiratory complications requiring intervention were similar between non-IV BDZ and IV BDZ, regardless of administration route (risk difference = 0.00; 95% CI = -0.02 to 0.01).

Conclusion

Non-IV BDZ, compared to IV BDZ, terminate seizures faster and have a superior efficacy and side effect profile. Higher-quality studies and further evaluation in different age groups are warranted.

### Efficacy of new antiepileptic drugs [^117QPZmM]. Epilepsy Currents (2011). Low credibility.

Regarding efficacy of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for seizure control, there are three important clinical questions. How effective are new AEDs when corrected for the efficacy of placebo? And even more important: How do new AEDs fare in terms of seizure remission compared with established agents? And finally: Have patients seizure-free on new AEDs a better chance for lasting remission after withdrawal versus those withdrawing from older agents? The answers raise concerns. Although add-on therapy with marketed new AEDs is more effective than placebo, as expected, the treatment difference for becoming seizure-free is disappointingly small (6%; 95% CI: 4–8%; z = 6.47; p < 0.001). Although many, but not all, new AEDs have comparable efficacy to old standard drugs in well-controlled trials, none of the new AEDs is superior to old drugs in terms of seizure remission. So far, we have no antiepileptogenic treatments that prevent the development of epilepsy or modify its detrimental course. The sobering results suggest the need for novel experimental and clinical strategies for the development of more effective new AEDs that interrupt ictogenesis more effectively and prevent or abort epileptogenesis. Ideally, we need new drugs that block both ictogenesis and epileptogenesis, resulting in complete cure of epilepsy.
