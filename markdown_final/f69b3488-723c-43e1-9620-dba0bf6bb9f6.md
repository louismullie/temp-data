## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role, evidence, and practical management of non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs/DOACs) across indications, special populations, and emergencies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the drug class and mechanisms. Then, I should verify the regulatory indications and core efficacy-safety data versus warfarin. Next, I will examine special populations and contraindications, followed by peri-procedural and emergency management, including reversal. After that, I should review drug–drug interactions, adherence, and cost. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight evidence gaps, ensuring each step aligns with high-quality guidelines and pivotal trials.

> Let me first confirm the drug class and mechanisms. NOACs/DOACs directly inhibit a single coagulation factor: dabigatran inhibits thrombin (IIa), while rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban inhibit factor Xa; this targeted inhibition yields predictable pharmacokinetics, rapid onset/offset, and obviates routine coagulation monitoring, unlike VKAs that indirectly suppress multiple vitamin K–dependent factors and require INR monitoring [^112rtM8j] [^1144n4cB] [^115ApHep].

> I need to check the approved indications and core efficacy-safety signals. For nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, large randomized trials show NOACs are at least noninferior to warfarin for stroke prevention, with substantially less intracranial hemorrhage and, in some analyses, lower all-cause mortality; meta-analyses also suggest fewer fatal/disabling strokes with NOACs versus warfarin, reinforcing a favorable net clinical benefit in most patients [^112rtM8j] [^116dopcv] [^114om5Yx]. For acute VTE treatment, NOACs are noninferior to VKA/LMWH regimens for recurrence and generally have comparable or lower major bleeding, enabling outpatient monotherapy in many patients [^114E5r44] [^112qPpGh]. For secondary prevention after unprovoked VTE, extended NOAC therapy reduces recurrence compared with placebo or aspirin, though bleeding risk must be weighed, and agent selection can be individualized [^111Lw6Cb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal superiority. I should confirm contraindications and special valvular contexts. Mechanical heart valves and moderate-to-severe rheumatic mitral stenosis remain contraindications to NOACs; VKAs are mandatory in these settings due to valve thrombosis risk and lack of supportive NOAC data [^1127iB7y] [^115DCmNA]. For bioprosthetic valves beyond 3 months post-implantation, NOACs are acceptable alternatives to VKAs for AF-related stroke prevention, while early postoperative periods often favor VKAs; after TAVR, evidence is mixed, with some analyses suggesting higher mortality or bleeding with certain NOACs versus antiplatelet therapy in patients without an anticoagulation indication, so I need to be cautious and align with evolving guidance and patient-specific risk [^1127iB7y] [^116nCcEL].

> Next, I should review renal and hepatic impairment. I initially thought NOACs were broadly contraindicated in advanced CKD, but wait, let me verify the nuance: apixaban is FDA-labeled for use in ESRD on dialysis with dose adjustments, and observational data suggest similar or lower bleeding versus warfarin, though randomized data are limited and adherence/confounding are concerns; for other NOACs, severe renal dysfunction generally precludes use or mandates substantial dose reductions, and guideline bodies advise NOACs over VKAs in CKD G1–G4 with careful dose adjustment and caution in G4–G5 [^115bGynt] [^117BbGF9] [^114xgsnt]. Hepatic impairment remains a relative or absolute contraindication depending on severity, and I should double-check labels before prescribing [^116G32bB].

> I will now examine peri-procedural and ablation-related management. Uninterrupted NOAC strategies are endorsed for AF ablation, with randomized data showing fewer major bleeding and tamponade events versus uninterrupted VKA; holding 1–2 doses pre-procedure is reasonable for some agents, and TEE can be used selectively based on rhythm and anticoagulation duration [^1158GhaU] [^111EEAGL]. For elective noncardiac procedures, I should confirm last-dose timing based on renal function and bleeding risk; for urgent procedures, measuring anticoagulant effect with PT/aPTT and considering specific reversal or PCC is prudent when bleeding risk is high or time-critical [^115fvJS4] [^116v9ZUs].

> Let me consider emergency bleeding and reversal. For life-threatening bleeding or urgent surgery, I should stop the NOAC, initiate local control and supportive care, and use targeted reversal when available: idarucizumab for dabigatran and andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors. If specific reversal is unavailable or delayed, 4-factor PCC is a reasonable bridge, acknowledging variable evidence for hard outcomes and the need for individualized risk–benefit assessment [^115oG679] [^116v9ZUs] [^114E46sw]. I should confirm that routine coagulation assays (PT/INR/aPTT) are insensitive for NOAC quantification; anti-Xa activity or dilute thrombin time can be considered when available to guide management in select scenarios [^115fvJS4] [^114KX42i].

> But wait, what about drug–drug interactions and adherence. Strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors or inducers can meaningfully alter NOAC exposure; I need to check for agents like amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, phenytoin, and certain antiretrovirals, which have been associated with increased bleeding risk in real-world cohorts, and adjust dose or choose an alternative strategy accordingly [^113aekAh] [^111ervAF]. Given shorter half-lives, NOACs are less forgiving of nonadherence than warfarin; cost and access barriers contribute to suboptimal persistence, so I should proactively address adherence, affordability, and education to mitigate early discontinuation and rebound thrombotic risk [^114zrT3G] [^114CbWSF].

> I should double-check special thrombophilic and oncologic contexts. In antiphospholipid syndrome, NOACs have not reliably reproduced warfarin's efficacy in small studies and should generally be avoided outside of trials or compelling indications; VKAs remain standard pending larger definitive trials [^111xKE6S]. For cancer-associated VTE, real-world and trial data increasingly support NOACs as alternatives to LMWH in selected patients, with attention to platelet counts and GI bleeding risk; LMWH remains standard in many guidelines until more robust comparative data accrue [^1171Q4dU] [^116xk4G9].

> Let me verify neurovascular considerations. NOAC-associated intracerebral hemorrhage carries high rates of hematoma expansion and mortality. While specific reversal agents are recommended, randomized evidence for improved outcomes is limited, and adjunctive hemostatic strategies such as tranexamic acid are under investigation. In acute ischemic stroke, eligibility for IV thrombolysis on NOACs depends on timing of last dose and laboratory assessment, and protocols are evolving to broaden access when anticoagulant effect is minimal or reversed [^1114rEd5] [^112khdky].

> Next, I should review switching and practical implementation. When converting from VKA to NOAC, I need to ensure INR is below therapeutic range to mitigate overlap. When switching between NOACs, a washout of 2–3 half-lives is reasonable in most patients, with longer intervals in renal impairment. Structured follow-up and anticoagulation cards improve safety and adherence in routine care [^112FikNY] [^116G32bB]. I should confirm that quality metrics emphasize appropriate NOAC dosing by renal function and comorbidities, and that shared decision-making addresses bleeding risk, cost, and patient preferences [^1155vNti] [^111itZLr].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and acknowledge gaps. Head-to-head NOAC comparisons are sparse; indirect comparisons and network meta-analyses suggest broadly similar efficacy across agents with nuanced safety differences, but patient selection and trial design heterogeneity complicate ranking; ongoing and future trials in TAVR, cancer-associated VTE, and dialysis populations will refine agent selection and dosing strategies [^117WFok9] [^116nCcEL] [^116xk4G9]. Until then, I need to individualize therapy, reassess renal and hepatic function regularly, and remain vigilant for emerging safety signals such as ILD with factor Xa inhibitors, balancing these against clear reductions in intracranial bleeding and improved convenience versus VKAs [^117HB55R] [^112rtM8j].

> In summary, NOACs have transformed anticoagulation by offering fixed dosing, rapid onset/offset, fewer dietary and drug interactions, and superior safety profiles versus warfarin for key outcomes, making them first-line for most nonvalvular AF and acute/extended VTE when not contraindicated. Careful attention to renal function, drug interactions, peri-procedural planning, and bleeding management — including targeted reversal — are essential to safe, effective use, and shared decision-making should incorporate cost, adherence, and patient values to sustain long-term net clinical benefit [^112rtM8j] [^114CbWSF] [^115oG679].

---

NOACs are **first-line anticoagulants** for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, offering **noninferior or superior efficacy** to warfarin with less intracranial bleeding and no routine monitoring [^117EASHR] [^112qPpGh]. They have rapid onset/offset, fixed dosing, and fewer food/drug interactions, but require dose adjustment for renal impairment and avoidance in mechanical valves or moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis [^114xgsnt] [^1127iB7y]. Specific reversal agents exist for dabigatran (idarucizumab) and factor Xa inhibitors (andexanet alfa) [^114E46sw], and management of bleeding or urgent procedures follows standardized pathways [^115oG679].

---

## Mechanisms of action

NOACs act by **directly inhibiting** key coagulation enzymes:

- **Dabigatran**: direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitor.
- **Rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban**: direct factor Xa inhibitors.

This targeted inhibition provides predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, enabling fixed dosing without routine coagulation monitoring [^115ApHep].

---

## Clinical indications

NOACs are approved for:

- **Stroke prevention**: non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) [^112Rt6WG].
- **Treatment and prevention**: venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) [^112qPpGh].
- **Prevention**: VTE after orthopedic surgery (rivaroxaban, apixaban) [^1159A2jK].

---

## Comparative efficacy and safety

NOACs have been extensively compared with warfarin in large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses:

| **Clinical outcome** | **Noacs vs warfarin** |
|-|-|
| Stroke/systemic embolism | Noninferior or superior [^112rtM8j] [^116dopcv] |
| Major bleeding | Similar or lower [^116dopcv] |
| Intracranial hemorrhage | Significantly lower [^116dopcv] |
| Gastrointestinal bleeding | Slightly higher with some agents (e.g. rivaroxaban, dabigatran) [^113539MM] |

---

Overall, NOACs provide **comparable or superior efficacy** with improved safety profiles, particularly regarding intracranial hemorrhage [^113XcCRz].

---

## Pharmacokinetic properties

NOACs exhibit **rapid onset** (2–4 hours) and offset of action, allowing for quick achievement of therapeutic anticoagulation and rapid reversal upon discontinuation [^115ApHep]. Their fixed dosing regimens simplify treatment and improve adherence compared with warfarin, which requires frequent INR monitoring and dose adjustments [^112a1kSL].

---

## Clinical limitations and considerations

Despite their advantages, NOACs have **specific limitations**:

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustments are required based on creatinine clearance; dabigatran requires adjustment at CrCl < 50 mL/min, while factor Xa inhibitors require adjustment at CrCl < 30 mL/min [^114xgsnt].
- **Mechanical heart valves**: Contraindicated due to increased thromboembolic risk [^1127iB7y].
- **Moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis**: Contraindicated due to limited evidence [^1176E2p1].
- **Drug interactions**: Caution required with P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers (e.g. amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, phenytoin) [^113aekAh] [^111ervAF].

---

## Monitoring and laboratory assessment

Routine coagulation monitoring is not required for NOACs; however, **specific assays** may be used in special circumstances (e.g. bleeding, overdose, renal impairment):

- **Dabigatran**: Dilute thrombin time (dTT) or Ecarin clotting time (ECT).
- **Factor Xa inhibitors**: Anti-Xa activity assays [^notfound].

---

## Reversal strategies

Specific reversal agents have been developed for NOACs:

- **Idarucizumab**: Rapidly reverses dabigatran [^114E46sw].
- **Andexanet alfa**: Reverses factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) [^114E46sw].
- **Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs)**: Used off-label for urgent reversal when specific agents are unavailable [^114E46sw].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **recommend NOACs as first-line anticoagulants** for stroke prevention in NVAF and for treatment and prevention of VTE, citing their favorable efficacy-safety balance and ease of use [^117EASHR].

---

NOACs are **first-line anticoagulants** for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, offering noninferior or superior efficacy to warfarin with less intracranial bleeding and no routine monitoring [^112rtM8j] [^114E5r44].

### Management of bleeding in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants [^117RLVb4]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulants are frequently prescribed agents for the prevention and treatment of a myriad of cardiovascular conditions. Conventional anticoagulant agents, such as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; warfarin, phenprocoumon, or coumadin) and heparin or low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, are increasingly replaced by direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) directly inhibiting factor Xa (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) or factor IIa (e.g. dabigatran). This new generation of anticoagulants is termed novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) or DOACs. A large number of clinical studies have shown that these agents can prevent or treat acute or chronic thromboembolic diseases.

The most important complication of treatment with anticoagulant agents is hemorrhage, which may be serious, may cause long-term debilitating disease, or may even be life-threatening. Bleeding in a patient on anticoagulants may require specific (additional) management; if the bleeding situation is sufficiently severe, swift reversal of the anticoagulant effect of the anticoagulant agent may even be required. Depending on the clinical situation, including the site and/or the severity of the bleeding, this reversal may take place in a few hours, but in some cases immediate reversal is needed. Generally, each (immediate) reversal of anticoagulant treatment needs also to take into consideration the indication for the antithrombotic agents. For example, the immediate interruption of anticoagulants in a patient with recent venous thromboembolism will markedly increase the short-term risk of recurrent venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Likewise, in a patient with advanced heart disease and atrial fibrillation, interruption of anticoagulants may increase the risk of cerebral or systemic embolism. Each of these specific clinical settings requires a careful and balanced individual assessment of the benefits and dangers of reversing anticoagulants (and potential strategies to keep the period of reversal as brief as possible). Here we will briefly describe the epidemiology of bleeding complications due to anticoagulants and various strategies to reverse the anticoagulant effect of antithrombotic agents, focusing on the new generation of anticoagulants (DOACs).

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^112cLD57]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Another area of uncertainty is the use of NOACs in patients whose renal function fluctuates widely over time or who are at heightened risk for acute kidney injury, such as patients with advanced heart failure. Patients with AF and a ≥ 25% relative decrease in their estimated glomerular filtration rate had a 2‐fold higher risk of ischemic stroke. 121 Acute and chronic renal dysfunction is common among individuals requiring long‐term anticoagulant therapy. 122 Patients with impaired renal function represent a distinct high‐risk group and there are limited data on what the optimal strategy of anticoagulation should be.

### Oral Xa inhibitors [^112a1kSL]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Several new oral drugs that selectively and directly inhibit factor Xa seem promising alternatives to existing antithrombotic drugs. These drugs have a convenient route of administration, can be given in fixed doses, and do not require coagulation monitoring. Favorable results of clinical trials support their potential to change current practice. Translation into daily clinical practice may take some time; clinical studies over the next months and years will reveal the impact of rivaroxaban and other compounds in development. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the more advanced oral, direct factor Xa inhibitors and to briefly describe the results of the completed studies.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) post-percutaneous coronary intervention: a network meta-analysis [^114z7QzS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians must balance the risks of bleeding and thrombosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in people with an indication for anticoagulation. The potential of non-vitamin K antagonists (NOACs) to prevent bleeding complications is promising, but evidence remains limited.

Objectives

To review the evidence from randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared to vitamin K antagonists post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in people with an indication for anticoagulation.

Search Methods

We identified studies by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, the Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science and two clinical trials registers in February 2019. We checked bibliographies of identified studies and applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared NOACs and vitamin K antagonists for people with an indication for anticoagulation who underwent PCI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked the results of searches to identify relevant studies, assessed each included study, and extracted study data. We conducted random-effects, pairwise analyses using Review Manager 5 and network meta-analyses (NMA) using the R package 'netmeta'. We ranked competing treatments by P scores, which are derived from the P values of all pairwise comparisons, and allow ranking of treatments on a continuous 0 to 1 scale.

Main Results

We identified nine RCTs that met the inclusion criteria, but four were ongoing trials, and were not included in this analysis. We included five RCTs, with 8373 participants, in the NMA (two RCTs compared apixaban to a vitamin K antagonist, two RCTs compared rivaroxaban to a vitamin K antagonist, and one RCT compared dabigatran to a vitamin K antagonist). Very low- to moderate-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between NOACs and vitamin K antagonists in death from cardiovascular causes (not reported in the dabigatran trial), myocardial infarction, stroke, death from any cause, and stent thrombosis. Apixaban (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.95), high dose rivaroxaban (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.00), and low dose rivaroxaban (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92) probably reduce the risk of recurrent hospitalisation compared with vitamin K antagonists. No studies looked at health-related quality of life. Very low- to moderate-certainty evidence suggests that NOACs may be safer than vitamin K antagonists in terms of bleeding. Both high dose dabigatran (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.97), and low dose dabigatran (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.70) may reduce major bleeding more than vitamin K antagonists. High dose dabigatran (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.96), low dose dabigatran (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.75), apixaban (RR 0,67, 95% Cl 0.51 to 0.88), high dose rivaroxaban (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83), and low dose rivaroxaban (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88) probably reduce non-major bleeding more than vitamin K antagonists. The results from the NMA were inconclusive between the different NOACs for all primary and secondary outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Very low- to moderate-certainty evidence suggests no meaningful difference in efficacy outcomes between non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) and vitamin K antagonists following percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. NOACs probably reduce the risk of recurrent hospitalisation for adverse events compared with vitamin K antagonists. Low- to moderate-certainty evidence suggests that dabigatran may reduce the rates of major and non-major bleeding, and apixaban and rivaroxaban probably reduce the rates of non-major bleeding compared with vitamin K antagonists. Our network meta-analysis did not show superiority of one NOAC over another for any of the outcomes. Head to head trials, directly comparing NOACs against each other, are required to provide more certain evidence.

### Non-vitamin-K-antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after acute myocardial infarction: a network meta-analysis [^116sFTwj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Types of outcome measures

Reporting one or more of the outcomes listed below in the trial was not an inclusion criterion for the review. Where a published study did not report one of these outcomes, we accessed the trial protocol and contacted the trial authors to ascertain whether the outcome was measured but not reported. For the outcomes that could occur more than once in a participant during the trial, we measured the number of participants with at least one event.

Primary outcomes

All‐cause mortality
Cardiovascular mortality
Major bleeding

Secondary outcomes

Myocardial infarction
Stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or of uncertain cause)
Stent thrombosis
Non‐major bleeding
Recurrent hospitalisation
Systemic embolism
Health‐related quality of life, assessed using validated instruments (e.g. 36‐Item Short‐Form Health Survey (SF‐36), EuroQol Five‐Dimension Health Survey (EQ‐5D))

We assessed all outcomes at the longest point of follow‐up for each trial. We accepted the definitions of clinical event outcomes (e.g. stroke, myocardial infarction) provided in the individual trials. We defined major bleeding according to the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) criteria (Chesebro 1987 ;). Non‐major bleeding was any bleeding that did not fit the TIMI major bleeding criteria. We defined stent thrombosis according to the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) criteria (Cutlip 2007). Recurrent hospitalisation was a dichotomous outcome (more than one hospitalisation after randomisation and during follow‐up, yes/no).

### Uninterrupted anticoagulation with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation catheter ablation: lessons learned from randomized trials [^111EEAGL]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Catheter ablation has been established as a rhythm control strategy in selected patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have failed or wish to avoid anti-arrhythmic drugs. Uninterrupted oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) peri-ablation is associated with a lower risk of thromboembolic and bleeding complications as compared to interrupted oral anticoagulation and bridging heparin. However, a substantial portion of patients with AF are treated with non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Herein, we perform an in-depth review and comparison of three recent randomized trials of uninterrupted oral anticoagulation with NOACs vs VKAs in patients undergoing AF catheter ablation. Furthermore, we report pooled results of these randomized trials. The pooled incidence of major bleeding was significantly lower with NOACs as compared to VKAs (2% vs 4.9%, respectively; odds ratio [OR] 0.40; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.16–0.99). Similarly, cardiac tamponade was also reduced in the NOAC group (0.4% vs 1.5%; OR 0.27; 95% CI 0.07–0.97). Thromboembolic complications were not significantly different between groups. Overall, these findings support the 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement's class I recommendation for uninterrupted NOAC use in patients undergoing AF catheter ablation.

### 2017 HRS / EHRA / ECAS / APHRS / SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1158GhaU]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation — preablation anticoagulation: For patients therapeutically anticoagulated with warfarin or dabigatran, performance of the ablation procedure without interruption of warfarin or dabigatran is recommended, and for those on rivaroxaban, performance without interruption of rivaroxaban is recommended; for novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) other than dabigatran or rivaroxaban, performance without withholding a NOAC dose is reasonable. Anticoagulation guidelines that pertain to cardioversion of AF should be adhered to in patients who present for an AF catheter ablation procedure. For patients anticoagulated with a NOAC prior to AF catheter ablation, it is reasonable to hold one to two doses of the NOAC prior to AF ablation with reinstitution postablation. Performance of a TEE is reasonable in patients who are in AF on presentation and have been receiving anticoagulation therapeutically for 3 weeks or longer, and is also reasonable in those who present in sinus rhythm and have not been anticoagulated prior to catheter ablation.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Oral anticoagulant therapy in asymptomatic atrial fibrillation — Oral anticoagulant therapy (OAC) using either vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) effectively reduces stroke, systemic embolism, and mortality in AF patients at increased risk of stroke, and compared to VKAs, NOACs exert broadly similar efficacy, but are safer with less intracranial bleeding, and more convenient for long-term use. The decision to use OAC for thromboprophylaxis in AF patients depends on the presence of CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk factors, but not on arrhythmia-related symptoms. In observational studies of asymptomatic AF, OAC use vs. no therapy has been associated with a significant reduction in stroke and mortality; and residual stroke risk was similar among anticoagulated AF patients and matched non-AF controls; however, adherence can be challenging, with a screening-detected cohort reporting the 5-year adherence to OAC was 88% and stroke rates significantly declined. After AF ablation, whether OAC can be stopped is uncertain, and current guidelines recommend continuation of OAC in the presence of stroke risk factors, irrespective of the apparent success of rhythm-control interventions; the OCEAN trial is an ongoing multicentre randomized controlled trial evaluating two antithrombotic treatment strategies (rivaroxaban vs. aspirin).

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115oG679]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

ACC 2020 oral anticoagulant bleeding — initial assessment and control of bleeding begins by determining whether ≥ 1 of the following factors apply: bleeding at a critical site, hemodynamic instability, or clinically overt bleeding with hemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL or administration of ≥ 2 units RBCs; if yes, the bleed is considered major, if no, the bleed is considered non‑major. For major bleeding, the pathway poses "Is the bleed at a critical site or life threatening?" and directs actions to "Stop OAC" and "Initiate appropriate measures to control bleeding", with an option to "Administer suggested reversal/hemostatic agent* to control bleeding and stabilize patient". For non‑major bleeding, assess "Does the bleed require hospitalization, surgical/procedural intervention, or transfusion?"; if yes, the actions are "Stop OAC" and "Initiate appropriate measures to control bleeding", and if no, "Continue OAC" and "Initiate appropriate measures to control bleeding". Reversal options and abbreviations are specified: "Reversal/hemostatic agents include repletion strategies such as PCCs, plasma, vitamin K, and specific reversal agents for DOACs (e.g., idarucizumab for dabigatran; andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban)", and "DOAC = direct‑acting oral anticoagulant; OAC = oral anticoagulant, including DOACs and VKAs; PCC = prothrombin complex concentrate; RBC = red blood cell; VKA = vitamin K antagonist".

### European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) / Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) / Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) / Latin American Heart Rhythm Society (LAHRS) expert consensus on arrhythmias and cognitive function: what is the best practice? [^113R64sc]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — anticoagulation intensity and cognitive outcomes — In patients managed long term with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), TTR is inversely associated with new-onset dementia, and the risk of dementia is augmented in AF patients who are frequently over anticoagulated or receiving antiplatelet therapy; however, oral anticoagulation in AF patients has not been consistently associated with either improved cognitive function or less hippocampal atrophy, and warfarin neither influenced the reduction of total brain volume nor cognitive function. Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant therapy may reduce the incidence of brain micro-haemorrhage compared with VKAs, but whether NOACs improve long-term cognitive function is currently unknown; a community-based study found that NOAC therapies were associated with lower stroke and dementia rates compared with warfarin.

### Updated European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin-K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: executive summary [^116boLpC]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

In 2013, the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) published a Practical Guide on the use of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) (Heidbuchel H, Verhamme P, Alings M, Antz M, Hacke W, Oldgren J, Sinnaeve P, Camm AJ, Kirchhof P, European Heart Rhythm A. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel H, Verhamme P, Alings M, Antz M, Hacke W, Oldgren J, Sinnaeve P, Camm AJ, Kirchhof P. EHRA practical guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation: executive summary. Eur Heart J 2013;34:2094–2106). The document received widespread interest, not only from cardiologists but also from neurologists, geriatricians, and general practitioners, as became evident from the distribution of > 350 000 copies of its pocket version (the EHRA Key Message Booklet) world-wide. Since 2013, numerous new studies have appeared on different aspects of NOAC therapy in AF patients. Therefore, EHRA updated the Practical Guide, including new information but also providing balanced guiding in the many areas where prospective data are still lacking. The outline of the original guide that addressed 15 clinical scenarios has been preserved, but all chapters have been rewritten. Main changes in the Update comprise a discussion on the definition of 'non-valvular AF' and eligibility for NOAC therapy, inclusion of finalized information on the recently approved edoxaban, tailored dosing information dependent on concomitant drugs, and/or clinical characteristics, an expanded chapter on neurologic scenarios (ischaemic stroke or intracranial haemorrhage under NOAC), an updated anticoagulation card and more specifics on start-up and follow-up issues. There are also many new flow charts, like on appropriate switching between anticoagulants (VKA to NOAC or vice versa), default scenarios for acute management of coronary interventions, step-down schemes for long-term combined antiplatelet-anticoagulant management in coronary heart disease, management of bleeding, and cardioversion under NOAC therapy. The Updated Guide is available in full in EP Europace (Heidbuchel H, Verhamme P, Alings M, Antz M, Diener HC, Hacke W, Oldgren J, Sinnaeve P, Camm AJ, Kirchhof P, Advisors.

### New avenues for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation [^112iAzci]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) were, until recently, the only option for chronic anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation. Three new oral anticoagulants have been tested for this indication in recent randomized trials: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. They offer the promise of consistent effect without the need for monitoring drug levels. Overall, efficacy and safety appear to be noninferior, and in some instances superior, to warfarin. However, the new drugs have their downsides, and switching from warfarin is not recommended for all patients. This review focuses on the available evidence and attempts to provide guidance to clinicians in the field.

Conclusions

In patients with non‐valvular AF, patients treated with NOACs have a lower risk of both AKI and ESRD when compared with warfarin. These benefits might come from class effect or specific individual effect of NOAC. More data to support this knowledge are needed in the future.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants provide less adverse renal outcomes than warfarin in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and metaAnalysis [^112k6Hjf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Admittedly, there were some limitations in the present meta‐analysis. First, there was the high I 2 value, which represented considerable heterogeneity. Second, some papers demonstrated only the change of renal functions in short‐term follow‐up that we cannot include in our meta‐analysis in terms of incidence of ESRD. 23, 29, 30 Third, the definitions of worsening renal outcome and estimated glomerular filtration rate equation were varied among the studies, both of which might affect the validity of the results. Lastly, the clinical outcomes per each NOAC were only described in AKI. Unfortunately, the data about other outcomes especially incidence of ESRD are insufficient to analyze for individual NOACs. Therefore, we cannot make the final conclusion that these benefits might come from class effect or specific individual effect of NOAC.

### A review of the efficacy and safety profiles of the novel oral anticoagulants in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism [^112qPpGh]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study aims to review the published literature concerning the use of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and to identify the appropriate niche for each NOAC by comparing their behaviors in Phase III and Phase IV clinical trial settings.

Methods

The ClinicalTrials.gov database was used to identify Phase III and postmarketing (Phase IV) randomized controlled trials concerning the efficacy and safety profiles of the oral NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran etexilate, exodaban, and rivaroxaban) for the treatment or prevention of VTE. Studies of special interest included those that compared the administration of a NOAC versus standard anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin and/or a vitamin K antagonist.

Findings

Overall, the NOACs offer a simplified anticoagulation regimen that has noninferiority and similar rates of bleeding when compared with standard therapy throughout multiple studies. This finding held true across several VTE conditions that required anticoagulation, such as the treatment and prophylaxis of acute VTE, including both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Absence of dietary restrictions and fixed oral dosing that does not require monitoring makes NOACs ideal for the outpatient setting. Apparent niches for each individual NOAC are discussed in detail; however, the paucity of trials comparing NOAC performance in specific clinical settings makes precise definition of these niches problematic.

Implications

It now seems reasonable for clinicians to consider NOACs as first-line agents for both the treatment and prophylaxis of VTE and to attempt to tailor their particular medication choices for each patient scenario. More trials comparing NOAC performance in specific clinical settings are essential to ensure these medications are being used to their full potential.

### The use of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in dialysis patients – A systematic review [^117BbGF9]. Seminars in Dialysis (2022). Medium credibility.

Siontis et al.did the largest cohort study. More than 25,000 dialysis patients with AF were included for comparison of apixaban (n = 2,351) with warfarin (n = 23,172). The study reported that apixaban was associated with similar risk of stroke but less risk of bleeding compared with warfarin. The study was also able to differentiate stroke and bleeding outcomes based on apixaban dose. Both 5 and 2.5 mg twice daily were associated with significantly lower risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin, whereas stroke prevention was best with 5 mg twice daily in comparison with either reduced dose (2.5 mg twice daily) or warfarin. A large and broad study population is a big advantage regarding bleeding and stroke outcomes compared with the smaller studies. By sheer size, the findings by Siontis et al.have more weight but several limitations should be mentioned. Due to the observational design, residual selection bias likely affected the results to some extent. Apixaban adherence and quality of the VKA treatment (time in therapeutic range) were not included. Discontinuation rates were high (about two thirds of patients in each group were no longer taking the anticoagulant 1 year after the initial prescription), and the observation period was short (mean follow‐up < 1 year). Collectively, these aspects make the comparison between apixaban and VKA difficult and highlights the need of adequately sized RCTs.

Comparison of NOAC (apixaban) treatment versus no anticoagulant therapy in dialysis patients with AF was investigated by Mavrakanas et al. In this study, apixaban did not lower the risk of stroke compared with non‐treated regardless of apixaban dosage and could reflect poor treatment adherence. The risk of fatal or intracranial bleeding events was higher on apixaban compared with no treatment especially with 5 mg apixaban twice daily. Ideally, VKA treated should have been included as a third group to facilitate comparison with the study by Siontis et al. Overall, comparison with the latter study is difficult due to a markedly lower stroke incidence most likely caused by methodological differences such as patient population (incident vs. prevalent population) and outcome definition (ischemic stroke vs. any stroke). Yet, the fact that fewer bleeding events were observed with the reduced dose compared with the standard dose, in line with PK data, suggest that the low dose regimen of apixaban potentially could be a better treatment option compared with standard dose and VKA treatment.

New antithrombotic drug development — platelet and coagulation targets — includes novel inhibitors of the thromboxane A2 receptor, new P2Y12 antagonists, and inhibitors of protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), the major thrombin receptor on platelets. On the anticoagulant front, most recent attention has focused on developing new oral agents to replace vitamin K antagonists; rivaroxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, and dabigatran etexilate, a direct thrombin inhibitor, have been licensed in many countries for short-term thromboprophylaxis.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111cBg6Z]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Restarting oral anticoagulation (OAC) after bleeding — indications and risk–benefit factors: In most cases, restarting OAC after a bleeding event provides net clinical benefit, and after a patient has a bleeding event on OAC, the indication for OAC should be reassessed to determine whether continued therapy is warranted on the basis of established clinical practice guidelines. Possible conditions for which OAC may no longer be indicated include nonvalvular AF with CHA2DS2-VASc score < 2 in men and < 3 in women, first time provoked VTE > 3 months ago, or bioprosthetic valve placement in the absence of AF > 3 months ago. If there is an ongoing indication for OAC, the clinician must evaluate the net clinical benefit of OAC in the context of a recent bleed, and this assessment should be conducted in consultation with other practitioners and in discussion with patients or caregivers; several validated bleeding assessment tools are available, but none has been studied in the specific situation of active or very recent bleeding. Reversible factors that may have contributed to the bleed, such as a high INR in a patient on a VKA, concomitant antiplatelet therapy, acute or worsening renal insufficiency leading to elevated OAC levels, or significant drug interactions that could increase DOAC levels, should be addressed prior to restarting therapy. If the patient is on dual antiplatelet therapy, re-evaluating whether aspirin can be discontinued is reasonable, and bleed characteristics that contribute substantially to risks with restarting anticoagulation include the location, the source and whether it was definitively identified and treated, the mechanism, and whether further surgical or procedural interventions are planned; patients who are at a high thrombotic risk will likely benefit from restarting anticoagulation even if the risk of rebleeding is high.

Essentials

Although lowering coagulation tendency to the same level, VKA and NOAC have vascular off‐target effects impacting atherosclerosis and calcification.
However, the precise mechanism underlying the effect on atherosclerosis is not known.
VKA aggravate atherosclerosis and vascular calcification whereas NOAC inhibit atherosclerotic plaque progression.
The results confirm that choice of venous and arterial thrombosis treatment impacts cardiovascular disease.

### Tranexamic acid for intracerebral hemorrhage in patients on non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (TICH-NOAC): a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^1114rEd5]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease with high mortality and morbidity. Oral anticoagulation is a well-defined complicating factor of ICH, resulting in increased risk of hematoma expansion (HE), mortality, and morbidity compared with patients with ICH without anticoagulation therapy. Novel, non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC) are the mainstay of oral anticoagulation and have largely replaced vitamin K antagonists over the past decade. With the increasing use of NOAC, the proportion of NOAC-associated ICH is steadily increasing, too. Knowledge about NOAC-associated ICH is scarce, but retrospective observational studies reported high rates of HE (40%), high rates of in-hospital mortality (25%), and substantial disability. –

Currently, no evidence-based hemostatic treatment exists for NOAC-associated ICH. NOAC-specific reversal agents (idarucizumab for direct thrombin inhibitors and andexanet alfa for direct factor Xa inhibitors) have been approved by medical authorities but lack clear evidence from randomized controlled trials to be superior to any other standard of care. While guidelines recommend the use of NOAC-specific reversal agents and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4fPCC) to restore coagulation in NOAC-associated ICH, no robust evidence exists that these treatments limit HE or improve clinical outcomes.

Tranexamic acid (TXA) — an antifibrinolytic drug — has been investigated in non–NOAC-associated ICH, most notably in the recent TICH-2 trial. Although its efficacy with regard to functional outcome has not been established, it may be modestly effective in reducing early death and limiting HE, particularly when administered early in patients at high risk for HE, and seems safe. – With the advantages of wide availability, ease of administration, low cost, and distinct, non–NOAC-specific antifibrinolytic mechanism of action with potential for synergistic effectswith the aforementioned procoagulant treatments currently recommended as standard of care, TXA seems an attractive candidate for the treatment of NOAC-associated ICH, for which it has not been tested so far.

Here, we report the results of TICH-NOAC (Treatment of Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Patients on Non–Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants With Tranexamic Acid), a randomized placebo-controlled trial investigating the effect of TXA on HE among patients with NOAC-associated ICH in addition to standard medical care.

### Early versus delayed anticoagulation treatment for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation-related acute ischaemic stroke [^113oP1Yu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Oral anticoagulants, such as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) and non‐vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), are recommended for stroke prevention in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke. Anticoagulants exert their action on the clotting cascade to reduce fibrin polymerisation and prevent the formation of blood clots, thereby reducing the risk of stroke or systemic embolism. VKAs, such as warfarin, inhibit the synthesis of vitamin K‐dependent clotting factors, including factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, as well as the natural anticoagulants protein C and protein S, to inhibit blood clot formation. Warfarin is administered orally, and doses are adjusted based on the International Normalised Ratio (INR) to maintain the optimal therapeutic range. Achieving an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 with adjusted‐dose warfarin treatment can significantly reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in people with atrial fibrillation‐related stroke. The advantages of warfarin include its effectiveness, affordability, and widespread availability. In cases of bleeding or overdose, warfarin's adverse effects can be reversed through the administration of vitamin K or an infusion of fresh frozen plasma. However, warfarin has drawbacks such as being prone to interactions with multiple foods and drugs, having a narrow therapeutic window, having a high risk of bleeding, and requiring complex management.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^115bGynt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

End‐Stage Renal Disease

Currently available NOACs are primarily renally excreted. Dabigatran is 80% renally excreted, while the renal excretion of factor Xa inhibitors ranges between 6% and 13% (betrixaban) and 50% (edoxaban). 112 Clinical trials included patients with mild to moderate renal disease with assigned lower study dose in most of these trials. Rivaroxaban 15 mg once per day 13, 15 and edoxaban 30 mg once per day 16 were used in patients with creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min. The dose of apixaban was reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily in the presence of 2 of 3 factors (age > 80 years, weight < 60 kg, creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or greater). The proportion of patients with moderate renal disease (creatinine clearance of 30–49 mL/min) that enrolled in these trials ranged between 15% and 21%. In a study of 14 264 patients with nonvalvular AF and creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min, rivaroxaban 15 mg per day had similar efficacy and safety compared with dose‐adjusted warfarin. 113 A meta‐analysis of 10 trials and 40 693 patients with creatinine clearance of 30 to 49 mL/min suggested that NOACs are noninferior to standard anticoagulation, and they are associated with less bleeding. 114 However, clinical trials excluded patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban and < 25 mL/min for apixaban) and those on dialysis. There are limited data on the efficacy and safety of NOACs in these patient populations. Despite the dearth of data, there is a reported increase in the number of NOAC prescriptions in patients on dialysis. 115 In pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic simulation studies, most NOAC administration in patients on dialysis could potentially result in higher levels compared with those without renal impairment. 116, 117, 118 In a small pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety study, patients with end‐stage renal disease on dialysis (n = 8) had a modest increase (36%) in apixaban area under the curve and no increase in apixaban maximal concentration compared with subjects with normal renal function (n = 8). Hemodialysis had a limited impact on apixaban clearance. 119 These data resulted in the Food and Drug Administration revising the label of apixaban and recommending that 5 mg twice daily can be used in patients with end‐stage renal disease on hemodialysis, while 2.5 mg twice daily should be used in patients who are older than 80 years of age or weigh < 60 kg. Until clinical data on the safety and efficacy of other NOACs in patients with end‐stage renal disease or on dialysis become available, apixaban could be used with caution while other NOACs should not be used in these patients. VKAs have been the standard anticoagulation treatment, although a clear benefit over risk has not been demonstrated, and more data are needed for this challenging group of patients. 120

### Oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: current status, special situations, and unmet needs [^112rtM8j]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

In patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists reduces the risk of stroke by more than 60%. But vitamin K antagonists have limitations, including causing serious bleeding such as intracranial haemorrhage and the need for anticoagulation monitoring. In part related to these limitations, they are used in only about half of patients who should be treated according to guideline recommendations. In the past decade, oral agents have been developed that directly block the activity of thrombin (factor IIa), as well as drugs that directly inhibit activated factor X (Xa), which is the first protein in the final common pathway to the activation of thrombin. These novel non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been shown to be at least as good as warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and they have proved to have better safety profiles. Their net advantage is underscored by significantly lower all-cause mortality compared with warfarin in large clinical trials. Because of these features and their ease of use, they are recommended for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. They have also a fast onset and offset of action, but they currently lack specific antidotes. This paper addresses the role of anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in the era of NOACs, with a focus on special situations including management in the event of bleeding and around the time of procedures including cardioversion, catheter ablation, and device implantation. Also their use in patients with concomitant coronary artery disease, with advanced age, with chronic kidney disease, or with valvular heart disease will be discussed as well as the interaction of NOACs with other cardiac medication, and switching between anticoagulants.

### Emergency care of patients receiving non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^114FEJAq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) and factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) have been introduced in several clinical indications. Although NOACs have a favourable benefit-risk profile and can be used without routine laboratory monitoring, they are associated-as any anticoagulant-with a risk of bleeding. In addition, treatment may need to be interrupted in patients who need surgery or other procedures. The objective of this article, developed by a multidisciplinary panel of experts in thrombosis and haemostasis, is to provide an update on the management of NOAC-treated patients who experience a bleeding episode or require an urgent procedure. Recent advances in the development of targeted reversal agents are expected to help streamline the management of NOAC-treated patients in whom rapid reversal of anticoagulation is required.

### Reversal agents for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^114E46sw]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) include dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin, and apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, which inhibit coagulation factor Xa. Although clinical studies of NOACs were conducted without antidotes, patient outcomes with major bleeding when receiving NOACs were no worse than those in patients treated with a vitamin K antagonist. Nonetheless, in patients with life-threatening bleeding or requiring urgent surgery, the capacity for rapid NOAC reversal is likely to increase patient safety. Three NOAC reversal agents are in various stages of development: idarucizumab, a specific reversal agent for dabigatran; andexanet alfa, which reverses factor Xa inhibitors; and ciraparantag, which is purported to reverse all NOACs. Idarucizumab is licensed in many countries, andexanet is under consideration by regulatory agencies, and ciraparantag is undergoing phase III evaluation. In the absence of licensed reversal agents for the oral factor Xa inhibitors, prothrombin complex concentrates are often used in patients taking these agents who present with life-threatening bleeding. In this Review, we summarize the approved indications for the NOACs, outline how to measure their anticoagulant effects, describe the mechanism of action of the reversal strategies, assess the preclinical and clinical data supporting their use, provide guidance on potential indications for reversal, and offer a management approach for patients treated with NOACs who present with serious bleeding or require urgent surgery.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), also referred to as novel (or non-vitamin K antagonist) oral anticoagulants (NOACs), represent a major development in anticoagulation therapy due to their rapid onset of action, predictable dose-response with fixed doses and limited interactions with food and drugs. 1,2 However, these agents have been in widespread clinical use for less than a decade and, compared with extensive experience with warfarin, there is uncertainty relating to optimal laboratory monitoring of anticoagulation, perioperative management and treatment of bleeding.3 In addition, there is currently only one drug licensed in the UK for rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect of a DOAC. Here, we review DOAC-related bleeding and the role of drugs to reverse the anticoagulant action of DOACs.

Choice of anticoagulant

Oral anticoagulation to prevent strokes in patients with AF can be achieved with vitamin K antagonists or non-vitamin-K-antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs). Patients with mechanical heart valves and those with moderate or severe mitral stenosis should be treated with vitamin K antagonists. Considering their superior safety compared with warfarin (10% lower mortality, approximately 50% lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage or haemorrhagic stroke), patients who are eligible for therapy with the NOACs apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban or rivaroxaban (in alphabetical order) should preferentially be treated with a NOAC.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant use in patients with atrial fibrillation and associated intracranial hemorrhage: a focused review [^116B6ixT]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and predisposes patients to an increased risk of embolic stroke. After nearly 60 years, warfarin is no longer the only effective therapeutic option for patients with AF. Large randomized trials have consistently shown that non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) including dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban significantly reduce from the risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) compared with warfarin. We provide a focused review regarding the NOACs and ICH in AF patients by summarizing findings of these large clinical trials, mechanisms of lower ICH, reversal strategies with specific agents, and monitoring strategies.

### Safety of switching from a vitamin K antagonist to a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant in frail older patients with atrial fibrillation: results of the FRAIL-AF randomized controlled trial [^1179VocP]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There is ambiguity whether frail patients with atrial fibrillation managed with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) should be switched to a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC).

Methods

We conducted a pragmatic, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled superiority trial. Older patients with atrial fibrillation living with frailty (≥ 75 years of age plus a Groningen Frailty Indicator score ≥ 3) were randomly assigned to switch from international normalized ratio-guided VKA treatment to an NOAC or to continued VKA treatment. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL·min -1 ·1.73 m -2 or with valvular atrial fibrillation were excluded. Follow-up was 12 months. The cause-specific hazard ratio was calculated for occurrence of the primary outcome that was a major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding complication, whichever came first, accounting for death as a competing risk. Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. Secondary outcomes included thromboembolic events.

Results

Between January 2018 and June 2022, a total of 2621 patients were screened for eligibility and 1330 patients were randomly assigned (mean age 83 years, median Groningen Frailty Indicator score 4). After randomization, 6 patients in the switch-to-NOAC arm and 1 patient in the continue-with-VKA arm were excluded due to the presence of exclusion criteria, leaving 662 patients switched from a VKA to an NOAC and 661 patients continued VKAs in the intention-to-treat population. After 163 primary outcome events (101 in the switch arm, 62 in the continue arm), the trial was stopped for futility according to a prespecified futility analysis. The hazard ratio for our primary outcome was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.23–2.32). The hazard ratio for thromboembolic events was 1.26 (95% CI, 0.60–2.61).

Conclusions

Switching international normalized ratio-guided VKA treatment to an NOAC in frail older patients with atrial fibrillation was associated with more bleeding complications compared with continuing VKA treatment, without an associated reduction in thromboembolic complications.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112gxF8q]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Delaying restart of anticoagulation — algorithm for post-bleed management in patients on oral anticoagulants details sequential decision points and actions. If the answer to "Is the patient willing to restart anticoagulation at this time?" is no, proceed to "Initiate clinician/patient discussion (see Table 7)". If yes, ask "Is an urgent surgical/ invasive procedure planned?"; for yes, "Suggest delaying restart of anticoagulation until procedure performed". If no, evaluate "Did bleeding occur at a critical site (see Table 1)?" and "Has sufficient time passed to consider restarting anticoagulation?"; if no to the latter, "• Ensure plan for follow-up on a specific date to address restarting anticoagulation
- Consider nonpharmacologic therapies". If time has passed, assess "Is the patient at high risk of rebleeding?"; if no, "Suggest restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 5)". If yes, determine "Is the patient at low/moderate thrombotic risk?"; for yes, actions include "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary anticoagulation for VTE prophylaxis
- Delay anticoagulation for a short duration and reassess". If no (high thrombotic risk), the box "Patient is at high thrombotic risk:" advises "• Consider patient values/preferences
- If indicated, start temporary parenteral anticoagulation with IV heparin or pharmacological VTE prophylaxis until bleeding risk decreases
- If the patient is a candidate, consider nonpharmacological therapies".

Figure 5.
Time to all-cause mortality and Cox proportional hazards analysis for early vs delayed initiation of NOAC until 90 days. HR indicates hazard ratio; and NOAC, non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant.

During the first 28 days after randomization, 10 major bleeding events occurred: 7 in the early and 3 in the delayed treatment group. Three of these events were intracerebral hemorrhages not fulfilling the symptom criteria in the outcome definition: 2 cases of hemorrhagic transformation in the early group, which occurred 2 and 17 days after randomization (difference in NIHSS scores before and at event, 1 and 0 points), and 1 case of hemorrhagic transformation in the delayed treatment group, which occurred 13 days after randomization (difference in NIHSS scores, 0 points).

The per-protocol–treated population (Figure 1) consisted of 819 patients (92.2% of the intention-to-treat population). The primary outcome was observed in 28 (6.65%) of the 421 patients receiving early treatment and in 30 (7.54%) of the 398 patients receiving delayed treatment (risk difference, −0.89% [95% CI, −4.41% to 2.63%]; P noninferiority = 0.0384). Ischemic stroke was observed in 13 patients (3.09%) in the early group and 16 patients (4.02%) in the delayed group (risk difference, −0.93% [95% CI, −3.47% to 1.61%]). All-cause mortality was observed in 19 patients (4.51%) in the early and 19 (4.77%) in the delayed group (risk difference, −0.26% [95% CI, −3.15% to 2.62%}).

Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF) with valvular heart disease (VHD) — algorithm: For rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS), long-term vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation (1). For native valve disease (except rheumatic MS), non–vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) or VKA based on CHA2DS2-VASc score (1). For a bioprosthetic valve, if > 3 mo after procedure, use NOAC or VKA based on CHA2DS2-VASc score (1); if new-onset AF occurs within 3 mo of valve implantation, anticoagulation with VKA (2a).

### Lower risk of dementia in patients with atrial fibrillation taking non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^115n6VcV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Stratified Analyses by Sex, Age, Stroke Risk, and Bleeding Risk

Stratified analyses were performed with different cohorts to further define the association between NOAC or warfarin use and the risk of dementia. We stratified the cohorts by age, sex, stroke risk as assessed by the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score, and bleeding risk as assessed by the HAS‐BLED score. Patients aged 65 to 74 years using NOACs had a lower risk of dementia than patients of the same age using warfarin. Compared with users of warfarin with a high risk of stroke, users of NOACs with a high risk of stroke had a lower risk of dementia. Moreover, users of NOACs with a high risk of bleeding also had a lower risk of dementia than users of warfarin with a high risk of bleeding (Table 3).

Table 3
Stratified Analysis to Assess Risk of Dementia in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Receiving Non‐Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants Versus Those Receiving Warfarin

Sensitivity Analyses

To remedy possible selection bias, sensitivity analysis A, using all study participants, without propensity score matching, was performed, which revealed similar findings. The NOAC cohort had a lower risk of dementia compared with the warfarin cohort (aHR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.97; P = 0.0106) (Table 4). The detailed results of additional sensitivity analyses (sensitivity analyses B through E) are in Tables S2 and S3. The cumulative incidence curves for various definitions of dementia are reported in Figure S1.

Sensitivity Analyses A: Risk of Dementia in Patients With Atrial fibrillation Receiving Non‐Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants Versus Those Receiving Warfarin

Supplemental Analyses

The detailed results of the supplemental analyses, which compared the risk of dementia between patients with and without oral anticoagulant treatment, were shown in Tables S4 and S5. In brief, users of NOACs were associated with a lower risk of dementia than those who did not use oral anticoagulants. Users of warfarin had a similar risk of dementia as those who did not use oral anticoagulants.

### Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation: where are we now? [^1131hFnL]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) confers increased risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events, and oral anticoagulation therefore is the essential part of AF management to reduce the risk of these complications. Until recently, the vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, e.g., warfarin) were the only oral anticoagulants available, acting by decreased synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (II, VI, IX, and X). The VKAs had many limitations: delayed onset and prolonged offset of action, variability of anticoagulant effect among patients, multiple food and drug interactions affecting pharmacological properties of warfarin, narrow therapeutic window, and obligatory regular laboratory control, which all made warfarin "inconvenient" both for patients and clinicians. The limitations of VKAs led to development of a new class of drugs collectively defined as non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs), which included direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) and factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). The NOACs avoid many of the VKA drawbacks. In this review, we will focus on the current evidence justifying the use of NOACs in non-valvular AF.

Definitions — anticoagulant and reversal terminology used in this pathway: DOAC is defined as any direct-acting oral anticoagulant (e.g., apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban); OAC is any oral anticoagulant, including DOACs and VKAs; reversal/hemostatic agents are repletion strategies such as prothrombin complex concentrates, plasma, vitamin K, and specific reversal agents for DOACs (e.g., idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban); VKAs are vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin and other coumarins); and ABO refers to the three basic blood groups.

### Defining nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: a quest for clarification [^1176E2p1]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are currently recommended for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation since the publication of the 4 major pivotal trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of factor IIa and factor Xa inhibitors. The definition of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is unclear, varying from one trial to another and even between North American and European guidelines, which is a source of uncertainties in clinical practice. However, many patients with atrial fibrillation present signs of valvular involvement, and clarification of this term is needed to not deny NOACs to patients based on the wrong perception that they may have valvular atrial fibrillation. The currently unique contraindications to NOACs are patients with mechanical heart valves and those with moderate-to-severe mitral stenosis, as stated by the recent 2015 position paper of the European Heart Rhythm Association. Patients with native heart valve involvement, regardless of their severity, are suitable for NOAC therapy. Patients with bioprosthetic heart valves and mitral valve repair may be suitable for NOACs except for the first 3 and the first 3–6 months postoperatively, respectively. Patients with transaortic valve implantation or percutaneous transluminal aortic valvuloplasty are also considered as being eligible for NOACs, although the bleeding risk has to be carefully considered in this population often requiring a combination with antiplatelet therapy. Future studies are warranted to increase the level of evidence of use of NOACs, particularly in patients with transaortic valve implantation and valvular surgery, and to determine whether they could be used in the future in the only 2 remaining contraindications.

### Comparison between non-vitamin K antagonist oral… [^1171Q4dU]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 1109 patients with cancer-associated VTE, use of a NOAC was not associated with increased risk of recurrent VTE or major bleeding but was associated with lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding compared with use of the LMWH enoxaparin. Meaning These findings suggest that in real-world practice, among Asian individuals with cancer-associated VTE, use of a NOAC had similar risk for recurrent VTE or major bleeding compared with use of LMWH. Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study found that in real-world practice, among Asian patients with cancer-associated VTE, use of a NOAC was associated with a similar risk for recurrent VTE or major bleeding compared with use of the LMWH enoxaparin. Nonetheless, use of a NOAC was associated with a significantly lower rate of gastrointestinal bleeding. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

We observed significantly lower GI bleeding rates in the NOAC group compared with the LMWH group. The observed numerical intergroup difference regarding major bleeding was primarily associated with the significantly lower rate of major GI bleeding with NOAC use compared with enoxaparin use. The results for effectiveness and safety outcomes remained consistent with the primary analyses after adjusting for death as competing risk, providing further evidence for the robustness of the main findings. Approximately one-fifth of our patient population had platelet counts less than 100 000 per μl, and patients with this characteristic were excluded from the Select-D trial.

16 Although our analysis included a population with a wide range of characteristics, which was more applicable to real-world clinical practice, the subgroup analysis found that use of NOACs was associated with significantly increased recurrent VTE and major bleeding in patients with platelet levels of less than 50 000 /ul. This cohort study found that NOAC therapy, compared with LMWH therapy, in Asian patients with cancer was associated with similar rates of recurrent VTE, with no increase in major bleeding events. Furthermore, a significant decrease in GI bleeding risk was observed with NOACs. These results suggest that NOACs are associated with effective and safe outcomes as alternatives to LMWHs for the treatment of cancer-associated VTE in Asian patients in real-world practice.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR): a network meta-analysis [^116nCcEL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Balancing the risk of thromboembolism and bleeding after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains clinically challenging. Questions regarding the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after TAVR still need to be definitively answered.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs after TAVR in individuals with and without indication for anticoagulation.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP on 7 October 2023 together with reference checking and citation searching to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared NOACs versus antiplatelet therapy or vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after TAVR in adults with or without an indication for anticoagulation.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods and conducted random-effects pair-wise analyses and network meta-analyses (NMAs). Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and major bleeding. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included four RCTs with 4808 participants in the NMA. Of these, one compared rivaroxaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared apixaban versus antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation or versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; one compared edoxaban versus VKA in people with an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR; and one compared edoxaban with antiplatelet therapy in people without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR. The mean age of trial participants was 81 years. Follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 18 months. Overall, we judged the risk of bias in the included trials to be low in all domains except for blinding, which was assessed as high in all four studies. No studies evaluated dabigatran. In people without an indication for anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality after TAVR as compared to antiplatelet therapy (rivaroxaban: risk ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 2.46; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence; apixaban: RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.02; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence), while edoxaban may result in little or no difference (RR 1.59, 95% CI 0.27 to 9.36; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). Low-certainty evidence suggests little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality (rivaroxaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.10; studies = 1, participants = 1644; apixaban: RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.65; studies = 1, participants = 1049; edoxaban: RR 7.44, 95% CI 0.39 to 142.38; studies = 1, participants = 229) and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke (rivaroxaban: RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.00; studies = 1, participants = 1644; edoxaban: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.15 to 7.42; studies = 1, participants = 229). While rivaroxaban versus antiplatelets probably increases major bleeding after TAVR (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.65; studies = 1, participants = 1644; moderate-certainty evidence), there may be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.64; studies = 1, participants = 1049; low-certainty evidence). It is unclear if edoxaban has an effect on major bleeding, although the point estimate suggests increased bleeding (versus antiplatelets: RR 2.13, 95% CI 0.54 to 8.30; studies = 1, participants = 229; low-certainty evidence). In people with an indication for anticoagulation, low-certainty evidence suggests apixaban or edoxaban may result in little to no difference in our predefined primary efficacy outcomes after TAVR when compared to VKA (all-cause mortality: apixaban: RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.77; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.20; studies = 1, participants = 1426; cardiovascular mortality: apixaban: RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.57; studies = 1, participants = 1426; stroke: apixaban: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.70; studies = 1, participants = 451; edoxaban: RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34; studies = 1, participants = 1426). While apixaban may result in a similar rate of bleeding as VKA in this population, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding after TAVR in people with an indication for anticoagulation (apixaban: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.54; studies = 1, participants = 451; low-certainty evidence; edoxaban: RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.93; studies = 1, participants = 1426; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In people without an indication for oral anticoagulation, rivaroxaban and apixaban may increase all-cause mortality when compared to antiplatelet therapy, while edoxaban may result in little or no difference. There might be little or no difference between rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban and antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular mortality, and between rivaroxaban or edoxaban and antiplatelets in stroke. While rivaroxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR, there might be little or no difference between apixaban and antiplatelet therapy, and the effect of edoxaban on major bleeding remains unclear. In people with an indication for anticoagulation, apixaban and edoxaban may be as effective as VKA in preventing all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and stroke. Apixaban may lead to a similar rate of major bleeding as VKA in this population. However, edoxaban probably increases major bleeding following TAVR when compared to VKA. Our NMA did not show superiority of one NOAC over another for any of the primary outcomes. Head-to-head trials directly comparing NOACs against each other are required to increase the certainty of the evidence.

### Secondary prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism after initial oral anticoagulation therapy in patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism [^111Lw6Cb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Currently, little evidence is available on the length and type of anticoagulation used for extended treatment for prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with unprovoked VTE who have completed initial oral anticoagulation therapy.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of available oral therapeutic options (aspirin, warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) for extended thromboprophylaxis in adults with a first unprovoked VTE, to prevent VTE recurrence after completion of an acceptable initial oral anticoagulant treatment period, as defined in individual studies.

Search Methods

For this review, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (March 2017) as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2). We also searched trials registries (March 2017) and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials in which patients with a first, symptomatic, objectively confirmed, unprovoked VTE, who had been initially treated with anticoagulants, were randomised to extended prophylaxis (vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), antiplatelet agents, or DOACs) versus no prophylaxis or placebo. We also included trials that compared one type of extended prophylaxis versus another type of extended prophylaxis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion.

Main Results

Six studies with a combined total of 3436 participants met the inclusion criteria. Five studies compared extended prophylaxis versus placebo: three compared warfarin versus placebo, and two compared aspirin versus placebo. One study compared one type of extended prophylaxis (rivaroxaban) versus another type of extended prophylaxis (aspirin). For extended prophylaxis versus placebo, we downgraded the quality of the evidence for recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality to moderate owing to concerns arising from risks of selection and performance bias in individual studies. For all other outcomes in this review, we downgraded the quality of the evidence to low owing to concerns arising from risk of bias for the studies stated above, combined with concerns over imprecision. For extended prophylaxis versus other extended prophylaxis, we downgraded the quality of the evidence for recurrent VTE and major bleeding to moderate owing to concerns over imprecision. Risk of bias in the individual study was low. Meta-analysis showed that extended prophylaxis was no more effective than placebo in preventing VTE-related mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 6.98; 1862 participants; 4 studies; P = 0.98; low-quality evidence), recurrent VTE (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.03; 2043 participants; 5 studies; P = 0.07; moderate-quality evidence), major bleeding (OR 1.84, 95% CI 0.87 to 3.85; 2043 participants; 5 studies; P = 0.86; low-quality evidence), all-cause mortality (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.57; 2043 participants; 5 studies; P = 0.99; moderate-quality evidence), clinically relevant non-major bleeding (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.59 to 5.33; 1672 participants; 4 studies; P = 0.30; low-quality evidence), stroke (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.46; 1224 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.80; low-quality evidence), or myocardial infarction (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.87; 1495 participants; 3 studies; P = 1.00; low-quality evidence). One study showed that the novel oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban was associated with fewer recurrent VTEs than aspirin (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.54; 1389 participants; P = 0.0001; moderate-quality evidence). Data show no clear differences in the incidence of major bleeding between rivaroxaban and aspirin (OR 3.06, 95% CI 0.37 to 25.51; 1389 participants; P = 0.30; moderate-quality evidence) nor in the incidence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.94; 1389 participants; 1 study; P = 0.69; moderate-quality evidence). Data on VTE-related mortality, all-cause mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction were not yet available for participants with unprovoked VTE and will be incorporated in future versions of the review.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is currently insufficient to permit definitive conclusions concerning the effectiveness and safety of extended thromboprophylaxis in prevention of recurrent VTE after initial oral anticoagulation therapy among participants with unprovoked VTE. Additional good-quality large-scale randomised controlled trials are required before firm conclusions can be reached.

### Quality indicators for the care and outcomes of adults with atrial fibrillation [^1155vNti]. Europace (2021). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation quality indicators — Domain 02: Anticoagulation — include the proportion of patients appropriately prescribed anticoagulation according to CHA2DS2-VASc, the proportion with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 0 for men and 1 for women who are inappropriately prescribed long-term anticoagulation, and appropriateness at every follow-up visit including TTR% ≥ 70% for vitamin-K antagonist and appropriate dose for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) according to manufacturer recommendations.

### The 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation [^112FikNY]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The current manuscript is the second update of the original Practical Guide, published in 2013 [Heidbuchel et al. European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of new oral anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2013;15:625–651; Heidbuchel et al. Updated European Heart Rhythm Association Practical Guide on the use of non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulants in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Europace 2015;17:1467–1507]. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are an alternative for vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and have emerged as the preferred choice, particularly in patients newly started on anticoagulation. Both physicians and patients are becoming more accustomed to the use of these drugs in clinical practice. However, many unresolved questions on how to optimally use these agents in specific clinical situations remain. The European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) set out to coordinate a unified way of informing physicians on the use of the different NOACs. A writing group identified 20 topics of concrete clinical scenarios for which practical answers were formulated, based on available evidence. The 20 topics are as follows i.e., (1) Eligibility for NOACs; (2) Practical start-up and follow-up scheme for patients on NOACs; (3) Ensuring adherence to prescribed oral anticoagulant intake; (4) Switching between anticoagulant regimens; (5) Pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions of NOACs; (6) NOACs in patients with chronic kidney or advanced liver disease; (7) How to measure the anticoagulant effect of NOACs; (8) NOAC plasma level measurement: rare indications, precautions, and potential pitfalls; (9) How to deal with dosing errors; (10) What to do if there is a (suspected) overdose without bleeding, or a clotting test is indicating a potential risk of bleeding; (11) Management of bleeding under NOAC therapy; (12) Patients undergoing a planned invasive procedure, surgery or ablation; (13) Patients requiring an urgent surgical intervention; (14) Patients with AF and coronary artery disease; (15) Avoiding confusion with NOAC dosing across indications; (16) Cardioversion in a NOAC-treated patient; (17) AF patients presenting with acute stroke while on NOACs; (18) NOACs in special situations; (19) Anticoagulation in AF patients with a malignancy; and (20) Optimizing dose adjustments of VKA. Additional information and downloads of the text and anticoagulation cards in different languages can be found on an EHRA website (www.NOACforAF.eu).

Vitamin K for INR 4.5–10 without bleeding in vitamin K antagonist (VKA)-treated patients — evidence and recommendation: Four randomized controlled trials found similar major bleeding over 1 to 3 months when vitamin K was compared with placebo (2% [10 of 452] vs 0.8% [four of 447]). Table 16 shows for major bleeding an OR 2.6 (0.8–9.8) with anticipated absolute effects of risk with only holding VKA 8 per 1,000 and risk difference with vitamin K 13 more per 1,000 (from 2 fewer to 69 more); for thromboembolism OR 1.3 (0.3–6.6) with 9 per 1,000 and 3 more per 1,000 (from 6 fewer to 48 more); and for all-cause mortality OR 1.3 (0.6–2.9) with 29 per 1,000 and 9 more per 1,000 (from 12 fewer to 51 more). The guideline states, "For patients taking VKAs with INRs between 4.5 and 10 and with no evidence of bleeding, we suggest against the routine use of vitamin K (Grade 2B)".

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants provide less adverse renal outcomes than warfarin in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and metaAnalysis [^115DeeFk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common types of cardiac arrhythmia. 1 The prevalence of AF has been increasing worldwide, particularly in the aging population and in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). 2, 3 When AF occurs, the blood clots can be easily formed in the atria, and this can cause cardiac embolism. Accordingly, prevention therapy of cardiac embolism, especially ischemic stroke, with oral anticoagulant, is the cornerstone in AF management in the general population and patients with CKD. 4

Nowadays, oral anticoagulants are recommended in patients with AF with high CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score. 4, 5 In selection of anticoagulant medication, the following issues should be considered: side effects, drug interactions, patient comorbidities, and patient compliance. Heretofore, warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, has been the mainstay therapy of non‐valvular AF. 4, 5 In this regard, non‐vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are increasingly used for thromboembolism prevention in patients with non‐valvular AF because of their favorable safety profile compared with warfarin, particularly lower bleeding risk, including intracranial hemorrhage. 6 Furthermore, the use of NOACs does not need drug level monitoring, resulting in improved patient compliance. According to the 2019 American Heart Association guideline, 4 NOACs have been approved and are now recommended in preference to warfarin in most of the patients with non‐valvular AF.

Excessive doses of warfarin could cause acute kidney injury (AKI) or "warfarin‐related nephropathy", the causes of which are still unestablished but might be mediated by glomerular bleeding and red blood cell cast obstruction. 7, 8 Most but not all studies showed that NOACs, which do not have a direct effect on vitamin K, could cause lower incidence of AKI. 9, 10, 11, 12 Besides AKI, chronic use of warfarin might gradually deteriorate renal function, possibly by increasing renovascular calcification. 13 This would cause progressive renal impairment in long‐term outcome. Some earlier studies illustrated that NOACs, which can attenuate vascular inflammation, provided better long‐term renal outcomes than warfarin. 10, 14, 15 Previous meta‐analyses on these issues yielded contradictory results and did not extensively examine long‐term renal outcomes. 16, 17 In addition, there were several methodology‐related drawbacks in these meta‐analyses, including insufficient numbers of sample size, study designs, variation in the definition of renal outcomes, and drug‐related issues in the studies.

Two review authors (SAS, SA) independently extracted data from the included trials. We extracted and collated the following data using a standardised data extraction form.

Methods: study design, total duration of study, details of any run‐in period, number of study centres and location, study setting, date of study
Participants: number randomised, number lost to follow‐up/withdrawn, number analysed, mean age, age range, sex, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, type of myocardial infarction (NSTEMI, STEMI), kidney function
Interventions: intervention, doses of the intervention, comparison, concomitant medications, excluded medications
Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and collected, time points reported, number of participants with the events and total number of participants randomised for dichotomous outcomes, and relative treatment effects (e.g. risk ratio (RR)) with relative 95% confidence interval (CI)
Notes: funding for trial, notable conflicts of interest of trial authors

From each study, we extracted the following potential effect modifiers: age, sex, lipid levels, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities and embolic risk. Two review authors (SAS, SA) independently extracted the outcome data from the included studies. We resolved any disagreements by consensus or by involving a third review author (WS), if necessary. One review author (SA) transferred the data to Review Manager Web (Review Manager 2020). We double‐checked correct data entry by comparing the data presented in the systematic review with the data extraction form. A second review author (SAS) spot‐checked study characteristics for accuracy against the trial reports.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^115ApHep]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The need to overcome these limitations resulted in the development of a new class of oral anticoagulants, the non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs), also known as "direct oral anticoagulants". Currently, there are 5 NOACs that have completed phase III clinical trials and are approved for clinical use (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban). Contrary to VKAs that indirectly inhibit the synthesis of coagulation factors, NOACs directly inhibit specific coagulation factors. Dabigatran inhibits thrombin (factor IIa), whereas apixaban, betrixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban inhibit activated factor X (Xa). 10 These agents have more predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics than VKAs and a wide therapeutic window, allowing for a fixed oral dosing, without the need for monitoring their anticoagulation effect. In addition, most have a short elimination half‐life compared with VKAs and rapid onset of action, achieving therapeutic levels in the plasma within 1 to 2 hours. 10 Betrixaban has distinct pharmacokinetic properties because it is minimally cleared by the liver and the kidneys and has a prolonged half‐life. 11 The terminal half‐life of betrixaban is 37 hours. Table 1 summarizes the landmark phase III clinical trials involving NOACs. These trials demonstrate noninferiority or superiority of NOACs compared with VKAs in stroke prevention in patients with AF, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and prevention 17, 18, 19 and treatment 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 of VTE, with a better safety profile. The results from phase III clinical trials on NOACs and the ease of their use have resulted in their progressively increasing utilization. However, some areas of uncertainty remain. First, their efficacy has not been validated in patients with severe mitral stenosis or mechanical prosthetic valves. RE‐ALIGN (A Randomised, Phase II Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Oral DabIgatran Etexilate in Patients After Heart Valve Replacement), a phase II clinical trial of dabigatran in patients with mechanical heart valves, was discontinued prematurely because of an increased rate of thromboembolic and bleeding events among patients in the dabigatran group. 26 Second, there are limited data in patients with cancer‐associated VTE or other hypercoagulable states, such as the anti‐phospholipid syndrome (APS), the nephrotic syndrome, and congenital coagulopathies. Third, the efficacy of NOACs has not been evaluated in patients with advanced renal insufficiency, end‐stage renal disease, or hepatic dysfunction. Fourth, important patient subgroups, such as pediatric patients and pregnant women, have not been adequately studied. Last, the prevalence and sequelae of physician underdosing warrants study, as does patient adherence and long‐term medication persistence. This review will expand on the treatment gaps in NOAC use and summarize indications where anticoagulation with indirectly acting anticoagulants such as VKAs and heparins will still be considered first‐line treatment pending further studies.

There are limited clinical data on the safety and efficacy of NOACs in patients with APS. The rivaroxaban trials (EINSTEIN‐DVT and EINSTEIN‐PE) included a small subset of patients with known thrombophilic conditions (5–7%) including some patients with aPLs. The sample size of those patients is limited and details on the antibody profile or APS status are not available. The results of these studies cannot be generalized to patients with APS. 101 In small case series, dabigatran and rivaroxaban have failed to prevent thrombosis in patients with APS. 101, 102 In RAPS (Rivaroxaban in Anti‐Phospholipid Syndrome), patients with APS and a history of VTE who had been on warfarin (INR range between 2.0 and 3.0) for at least 6 months were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (or 15 mg once daily if creatinine clearance is 30–49 mL/min, n = 116) or continue warfarin with a target INR of 2.5 (n = 54). The primary outcome was percentage change in endogenous thrombin potential from randomization to day 42. Rivaroxaban failed to reach the noninferiority threshold in reducing endogenous thrombin potential. There was no increase in thrombotic risk in patients treated with rivaroxaban compared with standard‐intensity warfarin, although this small study was not powered for efficacy. 103 There are 3 ongoing clinical trials currently evaluating NOACs in patients with APS. TRAPS (Trial on Rivaroxaban in AntiPhospholipid Syndrome, NCT02157272) is a multicenter, randomized, open‐label study that evaluates whether rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (or 15 mg in patients with moderate renal insufficiency) is noninferior to warfarin (INR target 2.5), for the prevention of thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and death in high‐risk patients with antiphospholipid syndrome. 104 Rivaroxaban for Patients With Antiphospholipid Syndrome (NCT02926170) is a randomized open‐label clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban (20 mg daily) with dose‐adjusted acenocoumarol in patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome who are treated with VKA for at least 6 months. ASTRO‐APS (Apixaban for the Secondary Prevention of Thrombosis among Patients with Antiphospholipid Syndrome, NCT02295475) is a prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded event pilot study. In this study, patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who have been on anticoagulation for secondary prevention of thrombosis are randomized to receive apixaban 5 mg twice a day or adjusted‐dose warfarin and the safety and efficacy of the 2 strategies will be compared. 105 Until the results of these trials provide evidence of efficacy and safety of NOACs in patients with APS, according to the task force report on antiphospholipid syndrome treatment trends, NOACs should be considered in APS patients with VTE only when there is known VKA allergy, intolerance, or poor anticoagulant control. 90

### Impact of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants from a basic science perspective [^1144n4cB]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

The biochemical properties of the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and their differences from the mechanism of action of vitamin K antagonists contribute to their properties as anticoagulants. These properties include as follows: (1) Inhibiting a single protease is much less effective at inhibiting coagulation than is inhibiting at multiple steps. Thus, the dose-response relationship between NOAC level and intensity of anticoagulation is shallower and more linear than that of vitamin K antagonists. This partially accounts for the greater safety of NOACs than vitamin K antagonists reported in some studies. (2) Because they are small molecules, NOACs can reach their target proteases in locations that plasma protease inhibitors, such as antithrombin, cannot. (3) NOACs compete with substrates for binding at the active site of the target protease and that binding is reversible. When the drug level falls, the drug dissociates from its target, and protease activity is restored. Thus, there is the possibility of a rebound in procoagulant activity if the drug is abruptly terminated. (4) The effects of a NOAC can be overcome by increasing the amount of substrate available for the target protease or the amount of protease produced. This property may contribute to the safety of NOACs and their potential reversibility by coagulation factor concentrates. The biochemical properties of NOACs contribute to their suitability for use in conditions that require a predictable moderate degree of anticoagulation when administered orally at a consistent dose. Their effects can be overcome by a sufficiently strong procoagulant stimulus. This characteristic likely contributes to their generally reduced risk of serious bleeding. However, they are not well suited for use in settings that require a profound degree of anticoagulation.

Drug Adherence and Physician Underdosing

The effect of medication adherence among patients prescribed NOACs has not been adequately assessed to date. Medication nonadherence is a very common and perplexing issue. Approximately 50% of patients fail to comply with their prescribed medication regimen, independently of sex, age, and medical condition. 138 Most NOACs have a short half‐life, ranging from 6 to 8 (apixaban and edoxaban) to 12 to 17 hours (dabigatran and rivaroxaban). 112 The half‐life of betrixaban is 37 hours. Warfarin has an average half‐life of 40 to 60 hours. For this reason, medication nonadherence will be less tolerated with NOACs as compared with warfarin. In a small cohort of 347 patients studied over a year, 36% of out‐of‐range INRs were caused by nonadherence. 139 Warfarin nonadherence is associated with increased health‐related costs. 140 In a recent real‐world analysis of > 36 000 patients with nonvalvular AF, there was a concerningly low adherence to NOAC therapy with proportion of days covered ranging between 69.2% and 80% over 6 months of follow‐up. 141, 142 The cost of treatment is directly associated with medication nonadherence. 143 NOACs are significantly more expensive compared with VKAs; the annual cost for NOACs is estimated to be around $3000 to $3500, compared with warfarin, which is around $50. 144 In clinical trials, given the strict protocols and close follow‐up, medication nonadherence is infrequently an issue, but adherence outside of this structured setting can be problematic.

### A systematic update on the state of novel anticoagulants and a primer on reversal and bridging [^11618K95]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Current prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes familiar agents that have been in use for many years, including unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). A number of novel oral anticoagulants are currently developed or are in stages of development to either replace VKAs in concert with initial heparin or LMWH, or to replace both heparin/LMWH and VKAs totally as monotherapy. These agents hold the promise of not requiring monitoring, being safer in terms of bleeding risk than current agents, and being of equal or improved efficacy compared with established anticoagulants.

Methods

In the following report, we systematically review the oral agents currently approved or closest to approval for both VTE and atrial fibrillation treatment, focusing on the treatment of VTE: dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban.

Results

Findings of clinical use and comparisons to standard care of these agents are summarized in depth, by succinctly reviewing all major randomized controlled trials. Mechanistic and functional differences are reviewed, as Dabigatran targets activated factor II (factor IIa), while rivaroxaban and apixaban target activated factor X (factor Xa). We also discuss the inability at the present time to reliably reverse the anticoagulant effects of these agents, provide a suggested strategy for reversal, and finally discuss an approach to bridging these agents when other procedures are required while currently taking one of these three agents.

Conclusions

These agents, while still with many unanswered questions, demonstrate great promise in the prevention and treatment of VTE.

2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were eligible if they met the following criteria: (1) design of the study: observational prospective or retrospective study; (2) study population: patients with ventricular thrombus, regardless of the etiology, such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, acute myocardial infarction, and nonischemic cardiomyopathy; (3) comparisons: any NOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban; any dose) versus VKAs (e.g. coumadin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, and warfarin); (4) clinical outcomes: thrombus resolution, stroke or systemic embolism, bleeding events, and all‐cause death. We accepted the original definitions of the included studies; and (5) follow‐up duration: no restrictions.

Certain publication types (e.g. reviews, case series, case reports, meta‐analyses, editorials, and conference abstracts) or studies with insufficient data were excluded. If the study population had a substantial overlap among different studies, we included the study with the longest follow‐up or largest sample size.

2.3 Data extraction

All of the retrieved studies were independently screened by two reviewers. The first phase of screening was performed by reading the titles and abstracts of the records. Then, the second phase of screening involved reviewing the full text of the studies to identify potentially eligible studies. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion or dealt with by consultation with a third reviewer. Ultimately, we included the studies that met the eligibility criteria mentioned above. For each included study, the following basic information was collected: study characteristics (e.g. the first author and publication year, study design, study period), patient characteristics (e.g. age, sex), type of NOACs, type of VKAs, follow‐up time, and outcomes of interest. In the NOAC or VKA groups, the number of events, event rates, and sample size were extracted for the reported outcomes (thrombus resolution, stroke or systemic embolism, bleeding events, and all‐cause death).

### Novel oral anticoagulants: efficacy, laboratory measurement, and approaches to emergent reversal [^112EiJjk]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Warfarin, the most commonly used of the vitamin K antagonists, has been a mainstay of oral anticoagulation for decades. However, its usage is limited by morbidity and mortality secondary to bleeding as well as a cumbersome therapeutic monitoring process. In the past several years, a number of competing novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed, each of which aspires to match or exceed warfarin's effectiveness while mitigating bleeding risk and eliminating therapeutic monitoring requirements. At present, 1 oral direct thrombin inhibitor and 2 direct factor Xa inhibitors are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Here, we compare the clinical efficacy and safety profiles of these new drugs. In addition, we discuss various laboratory assays that may be useful to measure these drugs in certain clinical circumstances. Finally, we discuss emerging strategies to reverse these agents in an emergency. The purpose of this article is to provide a framework for practicing pathologists to advise clinicians on NOAC laboratory measurement and management of NOAC-associated bleeding.

### Comparative effectiveness and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation: propensity weighted nationwide cohort study [^1165tqqE]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In this large comparative effectiveness and safety analysis of NOAC drugs and warfarin from routine care setting, we found that non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (novel oral anticoagulants, NOACs) are overall safe and effective alternatives to warfarin treatment.

We observed differential prescribing of different non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (novel oral anticoagulants, NOACs) in relation to patient characteristics was evident. For example, dabigatran was preferentially prescribed in younger patients with a lower risk of stroke and less renal impairment. For ischaemic stroke only, no significant differences were evident (hazard ratios) between NOACs and warfarin; however, for the combined endpoint of ischaemic stroke or systemic embolism, rivaroxaban was associated with a lower risk than warfarin, with dabigatran and apixaban showing no significant differences. Apixaban and dabigatran were associated with a significantly lower risk of death compared with rivaroxaban or warfarin. The endpoints of any bleeding or major bleeding were significantly lower for apixaban and dabigatran than for rivaroxaban or warfarin; the last two drugs had similar profiles for bleeding risk.

### Novel oral anticoagulants and reversal agents: considerations for clinical development [^1129SxDt]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

This white paper provides a summary of presentations and discussions that were held at an Anticoagulant-Induced Bleeding and Reversal Agents Think Tank co-sponsored by the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the FDA's White Oak Headquarters on April 22, 2014. Attention focused on a development pathway for reversal agents for the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs). This is important because anticoagulation is still widely underused for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. Undertreatment persists, although NOACs, in general, overcome some of the difficulties associated with anticoagulation provided by vitamin K antagonists. One reason for the lack of a wider uptake is the absence of NOAC reversal agents. As there are neither widely accepted academic and industry standards nor a definitive regulatory policy on the development of such reversal agents, this meeting provided a forum for leaders in the fields of cardiovascular clinical trials and cardiovascular safety to discuss the issues and develop recommendations. Attendees included representatives from pharmaceutical companies; regulatory agencies; end point adjudication specialist groups; contract research organizations; and active, academically based physicians. There was wide and solid consensus that NOACs overall offer improvements in convenience, efficacy, and safety compared with warfarin, even without reversal agents. Still, it was broadly accepted that it would be helpful to have reversal agents available for clinicians to use. Because it is not feasible to do definitive outcomes studies demonstrating a reversal agent's clinical benefits, it was felt that these agents could be approved for use in life-threatening bleeding situations if the molecules were well characterized preclinically, their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles were well understood, and showed no harmful adverse events in early human testing. There was also consensus that after such approval, efforts should be made to augment the available clinical information until such time as there is a body of evidence to demonstrate real-world clinical outcomes with the reversal agents. No recommendations were made for more generalized use of these agents in the setting of non-life-threatening situations. This article reflects the views of the authors and should not be construed to represent FDA's views or policies.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115DCmNA]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation (AF) in valvular heart disease (VHD) — For patients with AF and native valve heart disease (except rheumatic mitral stenosis [MS]) or who received a bioprosthetic valve > 3 months ago, a non–vitamin K oral anticoagulant (NOAC) is an effective alternative to vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation and should be administered on the basis of the patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score (1 A). For patients with AF and rheumatic MS, long-term VKA oral anticoagulation is recommended (1 C-EO). For patients with new-onset AF ≤ 3 months after surgical or transcatheter bioprosthetic valve replacement, anticoagulation with a VKA is reasonable (2a B-NR). In patients with mechanical heart valves with or without AF who require long-term anticoagulation with VKA to prevent valve thrombosis, NOACs are not recommended (3: Harm B-R).

Abstract

Direct oral anticoagulants (s) have quickly become attractive alternatives to the long‐standing standard of care in anticoagulation, vitamin K antagonist.s are indicated for prevention and treatment of several cardiovascular conditions. Since the first approval in 2010, s have emerged as leading therapeutic alternatives that provide both clinicians and patients with more effective, safe, and convenient treatment options in thromboembolic settings. With the expanding role ofs, clinicians are faced with increasingly complex decisions relating to appropriate agent, duration of treatment, and use in special populations. This review will provide an overview ofs and act as a practical reference for clinicians to optimizeuse among common challenging scenarios. Topics addressed include (1) appropriate indications; (2) use in patients with specific comorbidities; (3) monitoring parameters; (4) transitioning between anticoagulant regimens; (5) major drug interactions; and (6) cost considerations.

### Interstitial lung disease with non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants… [^117HB55R]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The landscape of atrial fibrillation management has changed considerably over the past decade, and the worldwide transition from warfarin to non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants has been almost fully achieved. 1 Notwithstanding the well-established advantages of NOACs over warfarin in AF, including a consistent and clinically relevant reduced risk of intracranial bleeding, postmarketing surveillance remains pivotal to characterize their comparative safety, especially with regard to rare but unpredictable nonbleeding adverse events. In this context, the timely retrospective nationwide cohort study by Chan et al2 tested the hypothesis that NOACs are associated with increased risk of incident interstitial lung disease in patients with nonvalvular AF without a preexisting lung disease, an emerging safety issue, especially in the current COVID-19 era.

Moreover, channeling bias is a real threat in pharmacovigilance. The study by Chan et al2 supported the existence of a genuine pharmacovigilance signal and, for the first time, corroborated the association between FXa inhibitors and ILD. The association of ILD with NOACs mirrors the recent debate on the potential risk of drug-induced liver toxicity. By definition, ILD and DILI are idiosyncratic; the mechanistic basis, primum movens, host-, patient- and drug-related risk factors are still incompletely characterized, especially for ILD, making our understanding, prediction, and prevention in clinical practice unsatisfactory. Therefore, this first important piece of clinical evidence cannot stand alone when selecting a given oral anticoagulant; the overall risk-benefit profile of NOACs remains unaffected.

The absolute difference in rates of ILD between the FXa inhibitors and warfarin groups was much lower than the corresponding absolute reduction in thromboembolism and major bleeding and even lower than previous estimates on DILI.

### Efficacy and safety of novel oral anticoagulants for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism: direct and adjusted indirect meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114E5r44]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Patients' characteristics

There were 16 701 patients in the efficacy analysis (recurrence of acute venous thromboembolism) and 16 611 in the safety analysis (major bleeding and all cause mortality) (table 2). The mean age of patients ranged was 54–60 and 47–54% were men. Trauma/surgery and previous acute venous thromboembolism were the most common associated risk factors described, though not all studies reported the same risk factors. In the comparison arms, the international normalised ratio was moderately well controlled, with 50–63% of measurements in the target range.

INR = international normalised ratio.

Primary analysis: stratification by drug name

For recurrent acute venous thromboembolism, we found no evidence of difference between any of the novel oral anticoagulants and the vitamin K antagonists for each comparison (fig 2). In the major bleeding meta-analysis (fig 3), the only drug associated with a decreased risk of major bleeding was rivaroxaban (relative risk 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.84), with no evidence of heterogeneity between studies (I 2 = 0%). For all cause mortality (fig 4), there was no evidence of differences in outcome between any of the novel oral anticoagulants and conventional treatment, with no evidence of heterogeneity between studies.

### Effect of non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants on stroke severity compared to warfarin: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114om5Yx]. European Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

In addition to lowering stroke risk, warfarin use is also associated with reduced stroke severity in patients with atrial fibrillation and acute ischaemic stroke. It was sought to determine whether the effect of non-vitamin-K oral anticoagulants (NOACs), compared to warfarin, differed by stroke severity.

Methods

Phase III randomized controlled trials with participants who were randomized to receive NOACs or warfarin for stroke prevention in the setting of non-valvular atrial fibrillation were identified. Stroke was classified into two categories, fatal or disabling stroke and non-disabling stroke, and meta-analyses were completed for both outcomes and for comparative case fatality of stroke amongst trials.

Results

Five randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. In clinical trials evaluating the NOACs usually prescribed in clinical practice (four trials), acute stroke was reported in 1403 (1.86%) participants, 787 (1.04%) in the NOAC group [386 (0.51%) fatal or disabling, 401 (0.53%) non-disabling] and 616 (0.82%) in the warfarin group [367 (0.49%) fatal or disabling, 249 (0.33%) non-disabling]. On meta-analysis NOACs were significantly superior to warfarin for fatal or disabling stroke (odds ratio [OR] 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66–0.89, I² = 21%) and non-disabling stroke (OR 0.85; 95% CI 0.73–0.98, I² = 2%). The case fatality of stroke was no different between groups (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.75–1.13, I² = 0%), but the point estimate favoured NOACs.

Conclusion

In phase III trials of NOACs, for prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation, NOACs are associated with a lower risk of both fatal/disabling and non-disabling stroke compared to warfarin.

### Bleeding risk in nonvalvular AF on NOACs with vs without other medications… [^113aekAh]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Findings Among 91 330 NOAC users in Taiwan, the risk of major bleeding was significantly increased with concurrent use of amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, or phenytoin compared with NOAC use alone. Meaning Physicians prescribing NOAC medications should consider the potential risks associated with concomitant use of other drugs. Concurrent use of amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin, and phenytoin with NOACs had a significant increase in adjusted incidence rates per 1000 person-years of major bleeding than NOACs alone:

38. 09 for NOAC use alone vs
52. 04 for amiodarone. During follow-up, 4770 major bleeding events occurred during 447 037 person-quarters with NOAC prescriptions. The major bleeding events included 1177 intracranial and 3341 gastrointestinal bleedings and 182 events occurred in other sites. Table 3 summarizes the incidence rate, adjusted incidence rate, and adjusted incidence rate difference for major bleeding among the 12 combinations of a NOAC and concurrent medications.

Compared with person-quarters of NOAC use alone, the adjusted incidence rate differences per 1000 person-years of major bleeding for a NOAC combined with other medications were 13. 94 with amiodarone, 138.
46. The combinations of NOAC with both groups were associated with a higher bleeding risk. Amiodarone plus a NOAC was associated with significantly more major bleeding events in all primary and secondary analyses. During observation periods, the combination of a NOAC and amiodarone use was associated with an adjusted incidence rate difference for major bleeding of 13. 94 events per 1000 person-years, which probably exceeds any benefit that such a combination could deliver. On the other hand, shared metabolic pathways might explain the high bleeding risk of NOACs plus fluconazole or amiodarone.

The most plausible reason for this discrepancy may be that higher plasma levels of NOAC did not necessarily result in more bleeding, which was also related to the comorbidity and the main drug benefits of the concurrent medications. Another reason might be that the limited pharmacokinetic data of NOAC use was mostly collected from healthy volunteers who have different pharmacokinetic profiles from NOAC users, who tend to be older, with more comorbidity and polypharmacy.

Oral anticoagulant therapy — this guideline article summarizes published literature on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral anticoagulant drugs currently available for clinical use, covering vitamin K antagonists and the newer agents dabigatran etexilate (direct thrombin inhibitor) and rivaroxaban (direct factor Xa inhibitor). It reports that the antithrombotic effect of each drug, drug–drug interactions, and monitoring of anticoagulation intensity are described and discussed without providing specific recommendations, and it further addresses clinical applications, optimal dosages, initiation and monitoring issues, adverse events such as bleeding and other potential side effects, and strategies for reversal. The conclusions note extensive evidence for vitamin K antagonists and a growing body of evidence for dabigatran and rivaroxaban in clinical use.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^115ge9wN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions and Future Directions

The non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants constitute a major breakthrough in the management of thromboembolic disease. The ease of their use, the wide therapeutic window, and the fact that they do not require monitoring will help to overcome the significant obstacles encountered with VKAs. The studies conducted to date justify their use in patients with nonvalvular AF, and for VTE prophylaxis and treatment. However, there are specific conditions, such as valvular heart disease, cancer‐associated VTE, APS, and other hypercoagulable states, severe renal and hepatic dysfunction, pediatric patients, and pregnancy, where the efficacy and safety of NOACs have yet to be demonstrated. From a translational science perspective, it is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of thrombosis in these conditions. Determining the factors that have a nodal role in these diseases would lay the theoretical ground for developing anticoagulation strategies, specific for each disease, that achieve the maximal antithrombotic effect while minimizing hemorrhagic complications. From a clinical perspective, given the complexity and the challenges inherent to the management of these diseases, well‐designed randomized clinical trials should be performed specifically in patients with these medical conditions. Until such data become available, traditional anticoagulation with VKAs or heparins will remain the mainstay of anticoagulation therapy.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

Our findings agree with and extend the findings of three previous systematic reviews.

Oldgren 2013 performed a meta‐analysis of RCTs to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding NOACs (apixaban, dabigatran, darexaban, rivaroxaban, and ximelagatran) to single (aspirin) or dual (aspirin and clopidogrel) antiplatelet therapy after ACS. The findings suggested that adding NOACs to antiplatelet therapy resulted in a modest reduction in cardiovascular events but a substantial increase in bleeding. However, Oldgren 2013 included RCTs of NOACs that were not approved by the FDA (ximelagatran and darexaban).

Khan 2017 conducted a meta‐analysis to assess the safety and efficacy of adding NOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran) to SAPT or DAPT in people with ACS, and concluded that the addition of NOACs to DAPT was associated with an increase in the risk of clinically significant bleeding and only a modest reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events. The addition of NOACs to SAPT did not result in a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events or an increase in clinically significant bleeding. However, Khan 2017 included RCTs assessing NOACs in people with an indication for anticoagulation due to atrial fibrillation.

Chiarito 2018 suggested a favourable net clinical benefit when adding NOACs to antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention after ACS, particularly in people presenting with STEMI; the findings showed that administration of NOACs in addition to antiplatelet therapy after STEMI appeared to improve ischaemic events at the cost of a marginally increased risk of major bleeding.

In contrast to these previous meta‐analyses, we used individual efficacy outcomes rather than composite outcomes, which might explain why we found no meaningful difference in efficacy for all individual doses. We analysed the safety results using the TIMI criteria to avoid the limitation of the variability in definitions of bleeding events across included studies. Furthermore, our review provided a comprehensive and comparative evaluation of all available treatment options within an NMA framework, thus increasing the statistical power and confidence in the results.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^116xk4G9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

There is limited evidence of NOAC use in these patients. In 3 single‐center, single‐arm, nonrandomized, open‐label cohorts of 200 to 400 patients with cancer‐associated VTE, treatment with rivaroxaban for 3 to 6 months was associated with VTE recurrence in 3.3% to 4.4%, and major bleeding occurred in 2.2% to 2.5% of the participants. 82, 83, 84 There are currently several ongoing trials evaluating NOACs in the treatment of VTE in patients with cancer (Table 2). Before these trials conclude, LMWH will remain the standard treatment of cancer‐associated VTEs.

Figure 2 — management of major bleeding on OACs (including direct-acting oral anticoagulants [DOACs] and vitamin K antagonists [VKAs]) first asks, "Is the bleed at a critical site or life threatening?" If yes, actions are: stop OAC and antiplatelet agent(s); if patient is on a VKA, give 5–10 mg IV vitamin K; provide local therapy/ manual compression; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. If no (major but not critical/life threatening), actions are: stop OAC; provide local therapy/ manual compression; if patient is on a VKA, give 5–10 mg IV vitamin K; provide supportive care and volume resuscitation; if applicable, stop antiplatelet agent(s); assess for and manage comorbidities that could contribute to bleeding (e.g., thrombocytopenia, uremia, liver disease); and consider surgical/procedural management of bleeding site. After initial measures, the pathway asks, "Did the above measures control the bleed?" and if not, it states, "Suggest administering reversal/hemostatic agents* (see Figure 3)"; once the patient is stable, it advises, "consider restarting anticoagulation (see Figure 4)". Reversal/hemostatic agents include repletion strategies such as PCCs, plasma, vitamin K, and specific reversal agents for DOACs (e.g., idarucizumab for dabigatran; andexanet alfa for apixaban or rivaroxaban).

### Novel oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists in transcatheter aortic valve replacement treated patients-patients' vulnerability still matters [^111uKfVm]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2022). Medium credibility.

Key points

Current meta‐analysis suggests that outcomes with novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) do not significantly differ compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), in particular, NOACs failed to demonstrate a better safety profile than VKAs in this clinical setting.
Accordingly, the choice between NOACs and VKAs in AF patients after TAVR is left to clinical judgment.
Future large‐scale clinical trials are warranted to establish a clinically superior anticoagulant regime in this clinical setting, based on risk profile and need for concomitant antiplatelet therapy.

Oral anticoagulants — vitamin K antagonists — note that "Since the 1950s, warfarin was used as a first-line therapy until DOACs came into practice", but its "narrow therapeutic window" with INRs, monitoring, drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and "low clinical safety profile affected the routine use of warfarin in practice". Due to affordability barriers to DOACs, "warfarin is still an appropriate OAC due to its lower cost for patients who cannot afford DOACs", and utilization data show "About 21% of patients with nonvalvular AF were still receiving warfarin, while the rest received DOACs in the first quarter of 2017".

### Impact of patient selection in clinical trials: application of ROCKET AF and ARISTOTLE criteria in GARFIELD-AF [^117WFok9]. Open Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment effectively decreases the burden of stroke and mortality in at-risk atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are non-inferior to vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in reducing stroke risk while being associated with a lower risk of bleeding. If indicated from the CHA 2 DS 2- VASc score, current guidelines recommend NOACs rather than VKAs for stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular AF, without making general recommendations regarding specific NOACs. The most recent NICE guidance notes an absence of direct clinical head-to-head comparisons that would allow such a distinction.

Researchers are, therefore, dependent on an indirect approach, comparing safety and efficacy outcomes of published randomised trials of various NOACs versus VKA. This approach, however, is hampered by considerably different study protocols. This applies specifically to the two landmark trials for approval of the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban and rivaroxaban — ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in AF) and ROCKET AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in AF). In these trials, non-identical patient selection criteria resulted in much higher cardiovascular disease burden among patients in ROCKET AF compared with ARISTOTLE. Moreover, these trials used different definitions for their primary safety endpoint, further impeding a comparison of the relative efficacy and safety of each NOAC versus VKA.

In the current work, we investigate the influence of the trials' inclusion and exclusion criteria on results for safety and efficacy of apixaban and rivaroxaban versus VKA using uniform endpoints in an international AF patient registry.

### Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation [^112Rt6WG]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

For more than 50 years, vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have been the standard of care for treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the numerous limitations of VKAs have led to the development of non-VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs). There are 4 NOACs currently approved for prevention of thromboembolism in patients with nonvalvular AF. This article provides an overview of AF, summarizes basic properties of NOACs, and reviews the landmark trials. Current data on use of NOACs in special populations and specific clinical scenarios are also presented. Lastly, recommendations from experts on controversial topics of bleeding management and reversal are described.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^114KX42i]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy is used for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism. As OAC use is so widespread, emergency physicians are likely to encounter patients on anticoagulant therapy in the emergency department (ED) on a regular basis, either for the same reasons as the population in general or as a result of the increased bleeding risk that OAC use entails.

The vitamin K antagonist warfarin has been the standard OAC for several decades, but recently, the newer agents dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban and apixaban (collectively, novel OACs, non-vitamin K OACs, or simply 'NOACs') have become available for long-term use. Protocols for assessing and managing warfarin-treated patients in the ED are well established and include international normalised ratio (INR) testing, which helps guide patient management. However, the INR does not give an accurate evaluation of coagulation status with NOACs, and alternative tests are therefore needed for use in emergency settings. This paper discusses what information the INR provides for a patient taking warfarin and which coagulation tests can guide the physician when treating patients on one of the NOACs, as well as other differences in emergency anticoagulation management.

### Safety and efficacy of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant use early after cardiac surgery: a systematic review [^115DD9n9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine the safety and efficacy of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) initiated early after cardiac surgery.

Data Sources

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, and MEDLINE (database inception to January 20, 2021), www.clinicaltrials.gov, www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/, NOAC trial registries, and bibliographies of relevant guidelines and other reviews were used.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that initiated NOACs within the index hospitalization and that reported bleeding for the primary outcome were included.

Data Synthesis

A total of 6 cohort studies, 1 RCT, and 3 ongoing RCTs were included. Most studies were single-centered, limited to postoperative atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting, and with 30-day follow-up; few studies included patients with isolated bioprosthetic valve replacement or valve repair. Bleeding risk varied (0%-28.6%), and all but one study showed no significantly higher risk with NOAC compared with warfarin.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Overall, NOACs were used in 26% to 37.5% of patients early after cardiac surgery. Starting a NOAC on postoperative day 4 appeared to have similar bleeding rates compared with warfarin, but clinical application is limited by heterogeneity of outcome definitions, confounding, and bias. Compared with warfarin, NOACs may have similar thromboembolism risk, reduced length of stay, and cost.

Conclusions

There is limited evidence to guide NOAC use early after cardiac surgery. Three ongoing randomized trials will add to the literature and provide guidance for clinicians on whether, in whom, when, and how to use NOACs safely early after cardiac surgery.

### Patients and their physician's perspectives about oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation not receiving an anticoagulant [^111itZLr]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Table 2 shows the correlation of answers by patients and their physicians on whether they would consider anticoagulation in the future. After rereview, physicians said they would consider prescribing oral anticoagulation in only 221 patients (27.1%) (44 [5.4%] with warfarin and 177 [21.7%] with novel oral anticoagulant [NOAC]). In contrast, 311 patients (38.1%) agreed or strongly agreed to the statement that they would consider taking an oral anticoagulant. In addition, 216 (26.4%) were neutral to taking oral anticoagulants, thus a total of 527 patients (64.5%) were open to consideration of anticoagulation. The majority of these were among patients in whom the physician said they would not prescribe an oral anticoagulant. Interestingly, among 272 patients in whom the physician cited patient refusal as the reason for not prescribing oral anticoagulant, 67 patients (24.6%) indicated on the survey that they would consider taking an oral anticoagulant. Of the 817 patients with AF who were not receiving anticoagulants, in 138 cases (16.9%), patients and their corresponding physicians were agreeable to starting oral anticoagulation.

Temporary interruption and switching of oral anticoagulants (OAC) after bleeding — the document states, "In general, temporary interruption of OAC for limited periods is likely appropriate for most patients without high thrombotic risk as determined by the care team". It adds, "Switching to an alternate OAC should also be considered after a bleeding event, particularly in cases in which a specific cause is identified", with examples: "in the setting of a supratherapeutic INR, switching to a DOAC should be considered", and "a decrease in renal function may increase DOAC drug levels and prompt switching to a VKA".

### Review and update of the concept of embolic stroke of undetermined source [^1162oDwD]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Ischaemic strokes have traditionally been classified according to the TOAST criteria, in which strokes with unclear aetiology are classified as cryptogenic strokes. However, the definition of cryptogenic stroke did not meet the operational criteria necessary to define patient populations for randomized treatment trials. To address this problem, the concept of embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) was developed and published in 2014. A hypothesis that underpinned this concept was that most strokes in patients with ESUS are caused by embolic events, perhaps many cardioembolic, and that anticoagulation would prevent secondary ischaemic events. On this basis, two large randomized trials were conducted to compare the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) dabigatran and rivaroxaban with aspirin. Neither NOAC was superior to aspirin in these trials, although subgroups of patients with ESUS seemed to benefit specifically from anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. The neutral results of the trials of anticoagulation and insights into ESUS from research conducted since the concept was introduced warrant reassessment of the ESUS construct as a research concept and a treatment target. In this Review, we discuss the evidence produced since the concept of ESUS was introduced, and propose updates to the criteria and diagnostic algorithm in light of the latest knowledge.

### New oral anticoagulants in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^113539MM]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The choice of an oral anticoagulant (OAC) for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a major and complex clinical decision taking into account the individual risk-benefit ratio and bearing in mind the chronicity of therapy. This review focuses on the safety and efficacy of new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared with conventional vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in patients with NVAF. Current data suggest that NOACs are at least as effective and safe as VKAs for most NVAF subjects. The NOACs do not mandate dietary restrictions and regular pharmacodynamic monitoring, and they seem to have lesser incidence of intracranial or fatal bleeding when compared with VKAs. However, both dabigatran 150 twice daily and rivaroxaban have a slightly higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding when compared with VKAs. The article will delineate the current knowledge as well as scientific gaps related to the choice and dosage of anticoagulation regimens for various NVAF subsets and will address certain common clinical scenarios requiring special considerations. The article also addresses the shortcomings of NOACs: lack of therapeutic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets, absence of tools to assess compliance and efficacy, rigid and limited dosage options, and absence of effective and inexpensive reversal agents.

### Updates in the perioperative and emergency management of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants [^1159A2jK]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants: new challenges

Direct thrombin inhibitors, dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa®, Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma GmbH, Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany), and direct factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban (Xarelto®, Johnson and Johnson/Bayer HealthCare AG, Leverkusen, Germany) and apixaban (Eliquis®, Bristol Myers Squibb/Pfizer, Uxbridge, UK), are non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) increasingly used in the treatment of venous thromboembolism, prevention of cerebrovascular embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, and thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery. Although the advantages of these new agents include rapid onset (2 to 4 hours) of action, in addition to a predictable anticoagulant effect without monitoring requirements, different clinical conditions can impair their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Despite published management perspectives, strategies are not yet clearly defined for perioperative management in patients treated with NOACs.

### New oral anticoagulants: which one should my patient use? [^113GEt11]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

The new oral anticoagulants are rapidly replacing warfarin for several indications. In contrast to warfarin, which lowers the functional levels of all of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, the new agents target either factor Xa or thrombin. With targeted inhibition of coagulation, the new oral anticoagulants have pharmacologic and clinical features that distinguish them from warfarin. Focusing on these features, this paper (a) compares the pharmacology of the new oral anticoagulants with that of warfarin (b) identifies the class effects of these drugs and their differentiating features, (c) reviews their current indications, and (d) uses this information to help clinicians make informed decisions regarding the choice of the right anticoagulant for the right patient.
