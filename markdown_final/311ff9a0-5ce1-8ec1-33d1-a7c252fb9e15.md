## Question

Can you take keflex if you have a penicillin allergy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cephalexin (Keflex) can be taken safely by someone with a penicillin allergy, and under what circumstances it should be avoided or managed differently. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the nature of the reported penicillin allergy and how to risk-stratify it. Then, I should verify the current understanding of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, especially first-generation agents like cephalexin. Next, I will align recommendations with contemporary guidelines and real-world data. Finally, I will translate this into practical, scenario-based advice and note exceptions where cephalexin should be avoided or alternative strategies used.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: most patients who report a penicillin allergy are not truly allergic, and mislabeling is common, so I need to check the reaction history carefully before deciding anything about cephalexin use [^b16b356b] [^c7ce3c0e]. I should categorize the prior reaction as nonanaphylactic versus anaphylactic, and verify whether the allergy has ever been confirmed by testing or challenge, because this will drive the risk calculation and management plan [^7a0a0a5b].

> Now, I will examine cross-reactivity risk. Historically, a blanket 8–10% cross-reactivity figure was cited, but wait, let me verify the modern data. Contemporary evidence shows that true IgE-mediated cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is far lower, roughly 2–5% overall, and is largely driven by similarities in the R1 side chains rather than the β-lactam core, which explains why some cephalosporins are safer than others in penicillin-allergic patients [^ff6a1cd0] [^3bca7f38] [^763652a2]. Hold on, I should verify cephalexin's side chain: cephalexin shares an R1 side chain with aminopenicillins like amoxicillin, so the risk is slightly higher in patients with confirmed aminopenicillin allergy compared with other penicillins, though still modest in absolute terms [^d532815e] [^1c71089e].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. For patients with an unverified, nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, current practice parameters suggest that any cephalosporin, including cephalexin, can be administered routinely without prior testing or special precautions, given the very low risk of reaction and the stewardship benefits of using first-line β-lactams when appropriate [^d367266f] [^e022828d]. Let me double-check the math: with less than 5% truly allergic and about 2% of those reacting to a cephalosporin, the estimated reaction risk is around 0.1%, which supports routine use in this scenario [^d367266f].

> But wait, what if the penicillin allergy was anaphylactic? I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize. For patients with a confirmed anaphylactic penicillin allergy, guidelines still allow cephalosporins with dissimilar R1 side chains to be given without prior testing, and cephalexin is not categorically contraindicated; however, many clinicians prefer to use agents with very low cross-reactivity, such as cefazolin or third-generation cephalosporins, and some may opt for penicillin skin testing or specialist input in higher-risk contexts, even though routine testing is not mandated by the parameters [^7a0a0a5b] [^d37021bb] [^3110e48a]. Hold on, I should verify cephalexin's relative risk: because cephalexin's R1 side chain matches aminopenicillins, the cross-reactivity risk is not zero, so if a truly anaphylactic penicillin allergy is confirmed, choosing a cephalosporin with a dissimilar side chain may be prudent when alternatives exist [^d532815e] [^3bca7f38].

> I will now examine real-world safety signals. Large health-system data after removing EHR warnings show increased cephalosporin prescribing in penicillin-allergic patients without increased anaphylaxis, supporting the safety of this approach in routine care when histories are low risk or appropriately risk-stratified [^2aa03efc] [^b13363fc]. Let me reconsider whether cephalexin-specific data exist: while most safety datasets aggregate cephalosporins, the mechanistic and guideline logic for cephalexin aligns with this broader signal, and expert reviews in dermatologic surgery similarly endorse cephalexin as a first-line prophylactic option even in patients with documented penicillin allergy, noting the low cross-reactivity and favorable profile compared with alternatives [^1c71089e].

> Next, I should review exceptions where cephalexin should be avoided. I need to ensure I flag severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions such as SJS/TEN, DRESS, AGEP, or organ-specific injury, because these are not IgE-mediated and are not covered by cross-reactivity algorithms; in these cases, the culprit drug and often the class should be avoided, and cephalexin should not be used [^d8b8e759] [^c7ce3c0e]. I should also confirm that patients with a confirmed selective aminopenicillin allergy have a slightly higher risk with cephalexin due to the shared R1 side chain; while many can still tolerate cephalexin, some clinicians prefer a dissimilar cephalosporin or consider specialist evaluation if the indication is strong and alternatives are limited [^d532815e] [^1c71089e].

> Let me translate this into practical recommendations. If the penicillin allergy is unverified and nonanaphylactic — such as a remote rash, GI upset, or unknown reaction — cephalexin can be prescribed without prior testing, with routine counseling and observation, because the risk of a serious reaction is extremely low [^d367266f] [^e022828d]. If the penicillin allergy was anaphylactic, cephalexin is not absolutely contraindicated, but I should confirm the allergy details, consider using a cephalosporin with a dissimilar side chain when feasible, and involve allergy consultation if the clinical stakes are high or if the patient prefers a structured evaluation; in urgent settings, many clinicians proceed with a dissimilar cephalosporin and monitor closely, consistent with guideline pathways [^7a0a0a5b] [^3110e48a]. If there is a history of severe delayed reactions to β-lactams, I should avoid cephalexin and choose a non–β-lactam alternative, documenting the rationale clearly [^d8b8e759].

> Finally, I should confirm stewardship and follow-up. Removing penicillin allergy labels when appropriate improves access to first-line β-lactams, reduces adverse outcomes, and lowers costs; when cephalexin is used in a penicillin-allergic patient, I should document the rationale, monitor for 60–90 minutes after the first dose when feasible, and arrange follow-up to reassess tolerance and consider formal delabeling of the penicillin allergy if the course is uneventful [^b16b356b] [^f86d53a6]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: if any new reaction occurs, I need to reassess the allergy phenotype and update the record accordingly to guide future therapy [^d8b8e759].

In most cases, **cephalexin (Keflex) can be given safely to patients with a reported penicillin allergy** because the risk of cross-reactivity is low (about 1–2%) and is largely due to shared side chains rather than the β-lactam core [^ff6a1cd0] [^3bca7f38]. Current guidelines support using cephalexin for patients with low-risk penicillin allergy histories (e.g. non-anaphylactic rash, GI upset, remote reactions) without prior testing [^d367266f] [^e022828d]. For high-risk histories (anaphylaxis, angioedema, severe IgE-mediated reactions), use caution and consider allergy evaluation or an alternative agent; avoid cephalexin in severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. SJS/TEN, DRESS) [^d8b8e759] [^c7ce3c0e]. If needed, a supervised oral challenge or desensitization can be arranged by an allergist [^b16b356b].

## Historical perspective on cross-reactivity

Historically, **cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins was estimated at 8–10%**, largely due to the shared β-lactam ring [^ff6a1cd0]. Early cephalosporins (e.g. cephalothin, cefamandole) had higher cross-reactivity, likely from impurities and similar side chains [^ebbf918e]. Modern data show **much lower cross-reactivity**, especially with newer cephalosporins that have distinct side chains [^3bca7f38].

---

## Current evidence on cross-reactivity

Recent studies and meta-analyses show **cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is about 1–2%**, and is mainly due to similarities in the R1 side chains rather than the β-lactam core [^ff6a1cd0] [^3bca7f38]. Cephalexin, a first-generation cephalosporin, has a unique side chain that reduces cross-reactivity with penicillins [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) provide clear recommendations on the use of cephalosporins, including cephalexin, in patients with penicillin allergy:

- **Low-risk penicillin allergy**: Patients with non-anaphylactic reactions (e.g. mild rash, gastrointestinal upset) can safely receive cephalexin without prior testing or additional precautions [^d367266f] [^e022828d].

- **High-risk penicillin allergy**: Patients with a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or severe IgE-mediated reactions should undergo allergy evaluation or consider alternative antibiotics. If cephalexin is deemed necessary, it should be administered under medical supervision with appropriate precautions [^7a0a0a5b] [^d37021bb].

- **Severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions**: Patients with a history of severe delayed reactions (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS) should avoid cephalexin and other β-lactam antibiotics [^d8b8e759] [^c7ce3c0e].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting cephalexin use

Several clinical studies and reviews support the safe use of cephalexin in patients with penicillin allergy:

- **Meta-analysis findings**: Studies have demonstrated that the risk of allergic reactions to cephalexin in penicillin-allergic patients is approximately 1–2%, significantly lower than historically reported [^ff6a1cd0] [^3bca7f38].

- **Prospective studies**: Patients with documented IgE-mediated penicillin allergy have safely received cephalexin without significant reactions, particularly when the side chains differ from the offending penicillin [^7ad8ea93].

- **Real-world data**: Removal of electronic health record warnings against cephalosporin use in penicillin-allergic patients resulted in increased cephalexin prescribing without a corresponding increase in adverse reactions [^2aa03efc] [^b13363fc].

---

## Risk stratification and management strategies

To minimize the risk of allergic reactions, clinicians should **stratify patients based on their allergy history**:

| **Risk category** | **Clinical features** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Low-risk | - Non-anaphylactic reactions<br/> - Mild rash<br/> - Gastrointestinal upset<br/> - Remote reactions (> 10 years ago) | Cephalexin can be administered without prior testing or additional precautions [^d367266f] [^e022828d] |
| High-risk | - Anaphylaxis<br/> - Angioedema<br/> - Severe IgE-mediated reactions<br/> - Recent reactions (< 1 year) | - Allergy evaluation<br/> - Alternative antibiotics<br/> - Supervised administration if cephalexin is necessary [^7a0a0a5b] [^d37021bb] |
| Severe delayed reactions | - Stevens-Johnson syndrome<br/> - Toxic epidermal necrolysis<br/> - DRESS<br/> - Organ involvement | Avoid cephalexin and other β-lactam antibiotics [^d8b8e759] [^c7ce3c0e] |

---

## Alternative antibiotics

If cephalexin is contraindicated or the patient prefers an alternative, **suitable options include**:

- **Macrolides**: Azithromycin, clarithromycin (consider local resistance patterns) [^7fb45163].

- **Clindamycin**: Effective against Gram-positive organisms, but higher risk of C. difficile infection [^7fb45163].

- **Fluoroquinolones**: Reserved for specific indications due to safety concerns and resistance patterns [^c793603a].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

In summary, **cephalexin (Keflex) can generally be administered safely to patients with a reported penicillin allergy**, particularly when the allergy is low-risk. The risk of cross-reactivity is low (approximately 1–2%) and is primarily due to similarities in side chains rather than the β-lactam core. Clinicians should assess the patient's allergy history, stratify risk, and follow current guidelines to ensure safe administration. For high-risk patients, allergy evaluation or alternative antibiotics should be considered, and severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions remain a contraindication to cephalexin use.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^80d2a2ab]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Thirty-six physicians (78.3%) reported having a capacity to test for both delayed and immediate reaction to cephalosporins, and 10 (21.7%) reported that they only test immediate reactions.

The second section of the survey was only available to participants who stated that they assess patients with cephalosporin allergy in their practice or if they planned to do so in the next year (44, 95.7%). The most common immediate cephalosporin reaction that participants reported evaluating was cefazolin (24, 53.3%), followed by cephalexin (18, 40.0%) and then ceftriaxone (3, 6.7%).

Survey results

Participant responses to how they would evaluate and test each of the 5 case scenarios (scenarios A-E) with a focus on cephalosporin use are shown in Fig 1, with answers aligning with current recommendations for testing in the practice parameters marked with an orange bracket. 

Fig 1 
Survey results for expert choice on tests for each case.

For scenario A, the practice parameters suggest that a patient reporting a low-risk penicillin allergy can receive a cephalosporin normally, without a preceding cephalosporin test. Some form of this response was selected by 91% of survey respondents, who focused on prescribing the cephalosporin, delabeling the low-risk penicillin allergy, or both.

For scenario B, the practice parameters suggest that a patient with a low-risk allergy to a cephalosporin should be evaluated by skin test before prescribing a structurally similar cephalosporin. In the survey, 12% chose to perform skin test before challenge, and 68% recommended direct challenge with the culprit drug.

### The use of perioperative cephalexin in penicillin allergic patients in dermatologic surgery: an advisory statement [^1c71089e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 10% of patients report penicillin allergy. Based on historical guidelines, patients with a penicillin allergy should receive an alternative to cephalexin for prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery.

Objective

To determine, based on evidence, if cephalexin should be used as a first-line prophylactic antibiotic in dermatologic surgery for patients with penicillin allergy.

Methods

Systematic review of the literature was performed with defined search terms.

Results

Less than 5% of those with penicillin allergy labels have a true penicillin allergy. For patients with true, persistent penicillin allergy, there is an overall low cross-reactivity with cephalosporins, especially with cephalosporins that do not share identical R1 side chain. The first-generation cephalosporins, including cephalexin, have a slightly higher risk of cross-reactivity in patients with reported allergy to amino-penicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin) but not other penicillins. The risk of severe cross-reactivity of cephalosporins in patients with low-risk penicillin allergies is extremely low. Cephalexin has a superior side effect profile and efficacy compared to alternatives.

Conclusion

Cephalexin should be used as the first-line prophylactic antibiotic in dermatologic surgery for patients with documented penicillin allergy, including anaphylaxis. There may be a higher risk of cross-reactivity with cephalexin in patients with a confirmed amino-penicillin allergy.

Study Selection and Description

After assessing 516 records and obtaining the full text for 29 reports, we found five studies meeting the inclusion criteria (Fig. 2). We identified 2 additional ongoing trials who seem to meet the inclusion criteria.

Fig. 2 
PRISMA flow chart illustrating screening and study selection for addressing penicillin allergy delabeling

We excluded thirteen reports because they were single-arm studies with no control groups, two studies were systematic reviews, one study had the wrong population, two studies had the wrong comparator, one study had the wrong study design, and one was a health economics analysis.

Three of the included studies were randomized controlled trials, one was a single-arm trial with historical controls, and one was a case–control study. One study was a conference abstract and we contacted the authors for further information on the study.

Included participants differed across studies, with two studies including only adults, and the remaining included a mix of children and adults (Table 1). One study only included pregnant patients.

RCT randomized controlled trial, N.A. not available

Four studies included patients only with cutaneous or non-life-threatening reactions (47, 48, 50, 51). One study also included patients classified as high-risk (recent reactions/ < 1 year, and with mucosal or systemic involvement.

The direct DC was oral in all studies, with 2-steps in three or 1 to 2-steps in the remainder. Amoxicillin only was used in two studies, whilst the other three used other studies used other penicillin-class drugs and/or cephalexin (Table 2). A detailed description of direct DC and PST protocols is provided in Table 3.

Appraisal of Evidence

The three included randomized controlled trials had one domain with high risk of bias and ≥ 2 domains with unclear risk. The two non-randomized controlled trials were rated as moderate quality (Table S.1. Supplementary Material).

The GRADE framework was applied to assess the certainty of evidence (Table S.2. Supplementary Material).

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^7a0a0a5b]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Beta-lactam cross-reactivity—management of penicillin and cephalosporin allergy: several studies indicate that the risk of cross-reactivity among beta-lactams is lower than previous reports suggested, and for management approaches, we suggest stratifying patients based on anaphylactic versus nonanaphylactic histories as well as verified versus unverified (unconfirmed) penicillin allergy. We suggest that for patients with a history of an unverified nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, any cephalosporin can be administered routinely without testing or additional precautions; for example, patients with a history of urticaria to a penicillin can receive any cephalosporin routinely without prior testing; in contrast, for those rare patients with a history of anaphylaxis to a penicillin, we suggest a non–cross-reactive cephalosporin (eg, cefazolin) can be administered routinely without prior testing. For patients with a primary allergy to cephalosporin, we suggest a similar approach: stratifying patients based on anaphylactic versus nonanaphylactic histories, as well as verified versus unverified cephalosporin allergy; we suggest that for patients with a history of an unverified nonanaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, a penicillin can be administered without testing or additional precautions, for example, patients with a prior history of urticaria to cephalexin can receive amoxicillin without prior testing; in contrast, for those rare patients with a history of anaphylaxis to a cephalosporin, we suggest penicillin skin testing and drug challenge be performed prior to administration of penicillin therapy.

### Safe use of selected cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients: a meta-analysis [^ebbf918e]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent analysis of clinical data and a clearer understanding of the role of chemical structure in the development of cross-reactivity indicate that the increased risk of an allergic reaction to a cephalosporin in penicillin-allergic patients is smaller than previously postulated.

Method

Medline and EMBASE databases were searched with the keywords: cephalosporin, penicillin, allergy, and cross-sensitivity for the years 1960 through 2005. Among 219 articles retrieved, 9 served as source material for this evidence-based meta-analysis.

Results

A significant increase in allergic reactions to cephalothin (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 5.5), cephaloridine (OR = 8.7; CI = 5.9 to 12.8), and cephalexin (OR = 5.8; CI = 3.6 to 9.2), and all first generation cephalosporins plus cefamandole (OR = 4.8; CI = 3.7 to 6.2) were observed in penicillin allergic patients; no increase was observed with second generation cephalosporins (OR = 1.1; CI, 0.6 to 2.1) or third generation cephalosporins (OR = 0.5; CI = 0.2 to 1.1). Clinical challenges, skin testing, and monoclonal antibody studies point to the paramount importance of similarities in side chain structure to predict cross-allergy between cephalosporins and penicillins.

Conclusion

First-generation cephalosporins have cross-allergy with penicillins, but cross-allergy is negligible with second- and third-generation cephalosporins. Particular emphasis should be placed on the role of chemical structure in determining the risk of cross-reactivity between specific agents.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^c52b97f0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a survey on current allergy clinic practices in relation to evaluation of cephalosporin allergy through the special-interest ARDBL Committee. At the time of our research, the committee included 136 members, who met both virtually and in person on average 4 times per year (including in person at the annual AAAAI meeting) to discuss and plan priorities in research, education, and clinical practice in drug allergy.

An 18-question descriptive survey in REDCap was sent to ARDBL Committee members, with 3 survey attempts made between February and April 2023. The survey included questions on demographics (country of practice, years in practice, types of drugs and reaction seen, availability of testing, etc) as well as current practices regarding cephalosporin allergy tests. In order to evaluate the latter, we used real case examples after each case presentation (high or low history of receipt of penicillin or cephalosporin), the survey participants were asked to answer the following question: “How do you evaluate this patient for cephalosporin allergy?” Multiple test options were offered, and more than one option could be chosen.

Five case scenarios of patients with previous reactions to β-lactams were presented to survey participants for their opinions on how they would evaluate and manage each case. The cases were as follows:
A. Low-risk history with penicillin.
B. Low-risk history with cephalosporin (cephalexin).
C. High-risk penicillin history.
D. High-risk history with cephalosporin (ceftriaxone).
E. High-risk history with cephalosporin (cefazolin).

Participants were asked to choose the preferred test for each case, specifically focused on answering the questions of future cephalosporin receipt and testing. Several answer choices for tests were offered—for example, penicillin skin test, penicillin oral challenge, cephalosporin skin test, or oral challenge with a dissimilar cephalosporin. Of note, we deliberately chose the term “oral challenge” in order to allow the choice of this test option both with or without a preceding skin test. The term “direct oral challenge” (DOC) was only used in retrospect, when the chosen evaluation options did not include skin test before oral challenge.

### Clinical features of penicillin allergy | Antibiotic prescribing and use (...) [^c7ce3c0e]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- 10% of U. S. patients reported having a penicillin allergy. When evaluated by clinicians, less than 1% of those patients were truly allergic.
- A penicillin allergy label can be evaluated through different methods including reviewing a patient’s allergy history, conducting a validated risk assessment, followed by penicillin skin testing and/or a direct oral challenge, as appropriate.
- Patients may have an inaccurate penicillin allergy label based on a past history of viral rashes, a family history of penicillin allergy, or intolerance to an antibiotic.
- A true penicillin allergy may cause either an immediate hypersensitivity reaction or a delayed hypersensitivity reaction.

For immediate hypersensitivity reactions, penicillin allergy-specific IgE antibodies may decrease over time resulting in patients tolerating penicillin-related antibiotics later in life.
- Clinicians can evaluate a penicillin allergy label through different methods, including reviewing a patient's allergy history and conducting a validated risk stratification, followed by penicillin skin testing and/or a direct oral challenge, as appropriate. Clinical Assessment Assessing a patient's penicillin allergy reaction history is important when deciding about next steps in allergy assessment and treatment selection. Special consideration: delayed hypersensitivity reactions Patients with severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions should not use the offending drug.

A direct oral challenge and skin testing are not appropriate for patients with severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions such as:
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome
- Toxic epidermal necrolysis
- Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms
- Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis
- Multifocal bullous fixed drug eruptions
- Drug-induced organ or blood cell injuries High-risk patients and patients with a history of severe delayed hypersensitivity reactions should be referred to a drug allergy specialist. Direct oral challenge A direct oral challenge is a method used to determine if a person with a history of penicillin allergy can safely take "penicillin class" antibiotics.
- Direct oral challenges are generally suitable for low-risk patients as determined through an assessment using validated risk stratification tools.
- A direct oral challenge involves giving a controlled oral dose of amoxicillin under close medical supervision.
- Direct oral challenges should be done with a standard protocol, in a safe setting, under observation, and with rescue medications available.
- A negative skin test should also be followed by a direct oral challenge.

### Cephalexin [^cf210a6a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions

Allergic reactions in the form of rash, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, erythema multiforme, Stevens- Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported with the use of cephalexin. Before therapy with cephalexin is instituted, inquire whether the patient has a history of hypersensitivity reactions to cephalexin, cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. Cross-hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibacterial drugs may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy.

If an allergic reaction to cephalexin occurs, discontinue the drug and institute appropriate treatment.

5.2 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea

Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including cephalexin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B, which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.3 Direct Coombs’ Test Seroconversion

Positive direct Coombs’ tests have been reported during treatment with the cephalosporin antibacterial drugs including cephalexin. Acute intravascular hemolysis induced by cephalexin therapy has been reported. If anemia develops during or after cephalexin therapy, perform a diagnostic work-up for drug-induced hemolytic anemia, discontinue cephalexin and institute appropriate therapy.

5.4 Seizure Potential

Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. If seizures occur, discontinue cephalexin. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to β-lactam antibiotics [^f7ce356a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy pose a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively nontoxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases health care costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Yet for those who truly have allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is a must. This article reviews current management strategies to determine which patients are good candidates for reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue avoidance.

### Taking a rational approach to a reported antibiotic allergy [^ad49e8a0]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Up to 10% of hospitalized patients have an antibiotic allergy label in their medical file, most frequently concerning penicillins. However, the vast majority of reported allergies to antibiotics does not represent a "true" allergy but are due to drug intolerance, idiosyncratic reactions or symptoms of the concurrent infectious disease. Since antibiotic allergy labels result in deviation from first-choice antimicrobial therapy, tackling the issue of incorrect antibiotic allergy labelling, already at young age, is a core element of antibiotic stewardship. In this article, we describe the structured approach to the patient with a presumed antibiotic allergy with emphasis on key elements of allergy-specific history taking and the limited risk of cross-allergic reactions between beta-lactam subclasses.

American Dental Association guideline—reported penicillin allergy and alternative antibiotics: Although approximately 10% of the population self-reports having a penicillin allergy and less than 1% of the entire population is truly allergic, clinicians should proceed with nonpenicillin drug class antibiotics until further confirmation of a true penicillin allergy, and the panel suggests prescribing oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin; some antibiotics may be less effective or carry a greater risk of harming patients through allergic reactions (penicillin) or Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the prevention of CDI should be a community priority in addition to a hospital priority, and according to a United Kingdom–based study, the incidence of CDI can be reduced through the appropriate use of antibiotics.

Cephalosporin allergy evaluation—Nonirritating concentrations of commonly used cephalosporins have been described, and 2 mg/mL is often used; a positive cephalosporin skin test suggests drug-specific IgE antibodies, and the patient should receive a skin test–negative alternative cephalosporin or alternate antibiotic, or undergo desensitization, whereas a negative cephalosporin skin test should be followed by a drug challenge to confirm tolerance; oral cephalosporins are not sterile and therefore cannot be used for intradermal skin testing, and skin testing with cephalexin has no clear utility; non–beta-lactam antibiotics may also be considered, but they may result in added patient morbidity, mortality, and cost of care.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^d367266f]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Penicillin allergy to cephalosporin administration—We suggest that for patients with a history of an unverified (not confirmed) nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, a cephalosporin can be administered without testing or additional precautions. Strength of Recommendation: Conditional. Certainty of Evidence: Moderate. Given that <5% of patients with an unverified penicillin allergy are truly allergic, and ~2% of those who are truly allergic will experience a reaction to a cephalosporin, when they are given cephalosporins directly, the chance of a reaction is very low with a linked probability of ~0.1% (ie, 0.05 x 0.02 = 0.001). Retrospective studies of parenteral cephalosporin administration to patients with a history of penicillin allergy, without prior penicillin skin testing, have shown rare cephalosporin allergic reactions.

### Why was there ever a warning not to use cephalosporins in the setting of a penicillin "Allergy"? [^48d51bf4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

It is now well-established that avoiding β-lactam antibiotics, when they are the drugs of choice, results in significantly worse long-term global outcomes for patients. Much of this avoidable morbidity has been caused by widespread warnings in electronic health care record systems not to use cephalosporins in the setting of penicillin allergy. High rates, up to 1000-fold higher than now seen, of immunologically mediated reactions were associated with early impure penicillin preparations. This instilled a rational fear of β-lactam-associated anaphylaxis in generations of physicians. In the late 1970s, several editorial comments regarding a potential increased risk to patients given cephalosporins who had a history of a penicillin allergy resulted in the warning that became imbedded in the culture of medicine. Over the past 40 years, compelling data have been developed that refute this warning and showed that the risks of avoiding cephalosporins outweighed the benefits. In late 2017, Kaiser Permanente Southern California completely removed all warnings not to use cephalosporins in the setting of a penicillin allergy. The results have recently been published in JAMA Network Open. This Rostrum article provides some of the backstory on the establishment and removal of this warning for physicians who trained over the past 30 years.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, more specifically with respect to evaluation of penicillin allergy, BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain skin testing to penicillins and the required cephalosporin to establish whether sensitization is to the β-lactam core or side chain if a cephalosporin is required by a patient with a previous reaction.
Obtain subsequent challenge testing to exclude allergy or desensitization if the patient is allergic.

### Antibiotic prescribing after removal of EHR cephalosporin warning for penicillin allergy (...) [^2aa03efc]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Point-of-care alerts to inform prescribing decisions by physicians and to enhance patient safety have been among the reasons for use of electronic health records. In December 2017, after a review of the literature and clinical deliberations among leaders in infectious diseases in the Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Permanente Southern California removed a warning in its EHR to avoid prescribing cephalosporins to patients with a penicillin allergy. In the current study, we examined the association of this change with choice of antibiotic, incidence of antibiotic allergy, incidence of cephalosporin-associated anaphylaxis, and rate of penicillin allergy–associated morbidities in patients with a penicillin allergy. Potential cases of cephalosporin-associated anaphylaxis in patients with a penicillin allergy were identified with International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes T78. 2 or T88.

6 recorded on the same day that a course of parenteral cephalosporins was started or within 1 day of starting a course of oral cephalosporins. The change in rates of use of cephalosporin, clindamycin, or quinolones at the comparison site before vs after removal of the alert was smaller; among patients with penicillin allergy, cephalosporin use increased from 15. 3% to
16. 2%, clindamycin use increased from 14. 0% to
14. 2%, and quinolone use decreased from 14. 7% to
14. 2%. The difference in the rates of anaphylaxis among individuals with penicillin allergies who used cephalosporin between the sites was not significant. The results for the other course-level outcome calculations are summarized in Table 3. New allergies and antibiotic treatment failure were more likely to occur among patients with a penicillin allergy than among those without a penicillin allergy.

Although the rate of adverse outcomes did not increase after removal of the warning, patients with penicillin allergy experienced worse outcomes in general than did those with no penicillin allergy. These results are consistent with prior studies16, 28 suggesting higher rates of new antibiotic allergies among patients with a penicillin allergy who receive any antibiotic compared with patients without a penicillin allergy. The results are also consistent with prior studies showing higher rates of infection16, 23, 28 and mortality16, 29 among patients with a penicillin allergy.

By the time of the week-8 follow-up, 37 (23.1%) participants had received antibiotics. Fifteen (40.5%) of these received a penicillin (6 in phase 1, 9 in phase 2). Of the 22 who received a nonpenicillin, 4 participants (18%, 2 in each phase) had been delabeled of their penicillin allergy. One participant who was delabeled in phase 2 to amoxicillin subsequently developed anaphylaxis following administration of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1 year after delabeling. The individual had a history of cephalexin-induced anaphylaxis 1 to 5 years before assessment. This participant was awaiting testing for clavulanic acid allergy and retesting to amoxicillin to delineate whether it is a de novo clavulanic acid allergy, a false delabeling to amoxicillin, or whether amoxicillin challenge acted as a sensitizing event.

### Overview of penicillin allergy [^d66e91b2]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Allergy to penicillin is the most commonly reported antibiotic allergy. However, most patients who report a positive history of a prior reaction to penicillin are not found to be allergic to penicillin upon skin testing. Often, this history is vague or based on a parent's recollection of an event that occurred in the distant past. Avoidance of penicillin based on self-reported allergic history alone often leads to the use of an alternate antibiotic with greater cost or side effect profile. Patients with a negative skin test to both major and minor determinants may generally be given penicillin, with a statistical risk of developing an allergic reaction similar to that observed in the general population. A more cautious approach in these cases where the degree of suspicion is low, an allergic etiology is unproven, or there is a negative skin test, is to do a graded challenge. If the skin test is positive, an alternate antibiotic should be used. If, however, an alternate antibiotic is not available, then desensitization may be performed, but there are limitations to desensitization as well, and tolerance is not permanent. Avoidance of cephalosporins may be recommended in cases of penicillin allergy, but newer generation cephalosporins have demonstrate less cross-reactivity to penicillin than earlier generation ones. Desensitization protocols for cephalosporins are available but not standardized. The mechanisms of antibiotic sensitization are not clearly understood.

### The role of major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing: time to revisit an old friend? [^b7d11058]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients who underwent penicillin allergy testing at the Royal Adelaide Hospital immunology department between January 2015 and December 2019 were included. Demographic data, information regarding Brown grading of anaphylaxis,specific penicillin-based antibiotic, and time since reaction were collected. Brown grading of anaphylaxis was defined as follows: mild (grade 1, with skin and subcutaneous tissues only), moderate (grade 2, with features suggesting respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal involvement), and severe (grade 3 with hypoxia, hypotension, or neurologic compromise).

Skin prick testing (SPT) (concentration 1:1) and intradermal testing (IDT) (volume 0.02 mL; concentrations of 1:100, 1:10, and 1:1) to amoxicillin (20 mg/mL), benzyl penicillin (5 mg/mL), and cefazolin (3 mg/mL), as well as to PPL and MDM (Diater DAP, Spain), were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Individuals with a positive SPT or IDT result had testing continued for an alternate penicillin. Cephalexin (3 mg/mL) SPT and IDT was performed only in those with a history of prior reaction. A positive SPT result was defined as a wheal measuring at least 3 mm after 15 minutes, and a positive IDT result was defined as an increase in wheal size by at least 2 mm at 20 minutes. If the results of SPT and IDT were negative, patients underwent graded oral amoxicillin challenge, and for those with a history of delayed reactions, a prolonged course was provided for 5 days. Patients received graded oral penicillin V challenge if the result of in vivo amoxicillin testing was positive, and in some instances. oral cephalexin at the discretion of the treating immunologist.

### Penicillin allergy-getting the label right [^7eb6552d]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Penicillin i allergy is a potentially serious adverse reaction that impacts on antibacterial treatment options. Although it is commonly reported and recorded in medical records, only a minority of patients with a label of penicillin allergy actually have the condition confirmed. The term 'allergy' may be incorrectly applied to adverse reactions that do not have an immunological basis and inappropriate labelling of penicillin allergy can lead to the unnecessary avoidance of penicillins and other beta-lactam antibacterials. Here, we discuss key features that help to distinguish patients at low or high risk of having a true penicillin allergy, summarise what is known about the risk of allergic reactions to other beta-lactam antibacterials in patients with penicillin allergy and discuss the steps to consider when assessing a label of penicillin allergy.

### A systematic review: can one prescribe carbapenems to patients with IgE-mediated allergy to penicillins or cephalosporins? [^5ecb820c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cross-reactivity between penicillins or cephalosporins and carbapenems is anticipated as all have a beta lactam ring. However, the true incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated cross-reactivity is not known.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to collect and combine all published data on children and adults reported to have a clinical history of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to a penicillin and/or cephalosporin who were subsequently given a carbapenem. Reactions were classified as proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated.

Results

Ten studies and 12 case reports describing 854 participants fit the study criteria. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated penicillin reactions (N = 838), the incidence of any type of suspected hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 36/838 (4.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1%-5.9%) and the incidence of proven (1/838), suspected (0/838), or possible (19/838) IgE-mediated reactions was 20/838 (2.4%; 95% CI, 1.6%-3.7%). Of the subset of patients with positive penicillin skin tests (n = 295), only 1 had a hypersensitivity reaction (0.3%; 95% CI, .06%-1.9%), and this was a possible IgE-mediated reaction. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated cephalosporin reactions (N = 12), the incidence of any type of hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 3/12 (25%); this included 2 non-IgE-mediated reactions and 1 possible IgE-mediated reaction.

Conclusions

The cross-reactivity between penicillins and carbapenems for IgE-mediated reactions is very low, but caution is still advised. Cross-reactivity rates may be higher between cephalosporins and carbapenems; however, minimal data are available.

### Penicillin skin testing (...) [^4b20ee50]. CDC (2022). Medium credibility.

652). Data from the Kaiser health care system reported that among 3, 313 patients with self-reported cephalosporin allergy who received a cephalosporin, no cases of anaphylaxis were reported. Use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems is safe for patients without a history of any IgE-mediated symptoms from penicillin during the preceding 10 years. For persons who have a positive skin test reactive to penicillin, treatment with a ß-lactam antibiotic is not usually advised, and other effective antimicrobials should be used. For persons among whom the only therapy option is a penicillin antibiotic and among whom a penicillin skin test is positive, induction of penicillin tolerance is required.

Desensitization protocols to penicillin should be performed by allergists, and they require a monitored inpatient environment. Because the remaining 1%–10% of penicillin-allergic patients who are not captured by this penicillin skin test are due to minor determinants IgE antibodies, the standard practice is to follow skin testing with an observed oral challenge of amoxicillin 250 mg with 1 hour of observation. If the skin test and oral challenge are both negative, the risk for IgE-mediated anaphylaxis approaches zero and is equivalent to that of a person who has never reported an allergy to penicillin. Persons with high-risk symptom histories should not be administered penicillin or a ß-lactam antibiotic in an ambulatory setting.

Furthermore, these persons with high-risk symptoms should not receive penicillin skin testing or amoxicillin oral challenge in an ambulatory STI setting and should be referred to an allergist for further evaluation. Persons with negative results of a penicillin skin test, followed by an amoxicillin oral challenge, can receive conventional penicillin therapy safely if needed. Persons with positive skin test results and for whom no other clinical options exist should be referred to an allergist and desensitized before initiating treatment.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, more specifically with respect to evaluation of penicillin allergy, BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain skin testing with penicillins and, if negative, challenge testing to exclude allergy to penicillin if penicillin is required in a patient with a clinical history of cephalosporin allergy.

### Penicillin and beta-lactam hypersensitivity [^5f369bee]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Ten percent of patients report penicillin allergy, but more than 90% of these individuals can tolerate penicillins. Skin testing remains the optimal method for evaluation of possible IgE-mediated penicillin allergy and is recommended by professional societies, as the harms for alternative antibiotics include antimicrobial resistance, prolonged hospitalizations, readmissions, and increased costs. Removal of penicillin allergy leads to decreased utilization of broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones and vancomycin. There is minimal allergic cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins. IgE-mediated allergy to cephalosporins is usually side-chain specific and may warrant graded challenge with cephalosporins containing dissimilar R1 or R2 group side chains.

Antibiotic follow-up and modification—patients with a history of a penicillin allergy (with or without anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives): Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient’s symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients with a history of a penicillin allergy and with or without a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

### The role of major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing: time to revisit an old friend? [^fa956900]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2023). Medium credibility.

Results and discussion

A total of 214 patients were identified; their average age was 57.9 years (range 20-94 years). There was a female predominance (n = 151 [70.6%]). Unspecified penicillin was the most common index drug (n = 127 [59.3%]), followed by amoxicillin (n = 53 [24.8%]) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (n = 21 [9.7%]) (Table I). Medication allergy in addition to penicillin was common and present in 105 patients (49.0%); the medications involved included cephalosporins (n = 44), with cephalexin (n = 28) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (n=18) accounting for around half of the cases (Table I).

Table I 
Patient demographics and baseline data

Of those patients with documented severity, more than half had mild reactions with cutaneous signs only (Brown grade 1) whereas 40% had a history of systemic reactions (grades 2 and 3) (Table I). The proportion of patients who had had a reaction more than 20 years before testing was higher than the proportion with a reaction less than 12 months before testing (Table I).

The result of in vivo testing was positive in 23 patients (10.7%), including 10 patients (4.7%) with a positive SPT result and 13 patients (6.1%) with a positive IDT result. Brown grade anaphylaxis score was higher (grade 2) in patients with a positive SPT and/or IDT result than in patients with a negative (grade 1) result (P <.0001). In those with positive in vivo test results, the median time to testing was shorter (6-12 months) than in those with a negative result (10-20 years). Even though unspecified penicillin was the most common index drug, positive in vitro test results were predominantly found in patients who specified amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid as the culprit index drug (n = 22 of 23 patients).

### A review of evidence supporting the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for prescribing cephalosporin antibiotics for penicillin-allergic patients [^1da64ec6]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, evidence-based guidelines endorse the use of cephalosporin antibiotics for patients with reported allergies to penicillin, for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and acute otitis media. Many physicians, however, remain reluctant to prescribe such agents. Although such concern is understandable, lack of consistent data regarding exactly what constitutes an initial penicillin-allergic reaction and subsequent cross-sensitivity to cephalosporins may be preventing many patients from receiving optimal antibiotic therapy. This article reviews evidence in support of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation. Included is an examination of the types and incidence of reactions to penicillins and cephalosporins; the frequency of cross-reactivity between these 2 groups of agents; experimental and clinical studies that suggest that side chain-specific antibodies predominate in the immune response to cephalosporins, thereby explaining the lack of cross-sensitivity between most cephalosporins and penicillins; the role of skin testing; and the risks of anaphylaxis. Specific recommendations for the treatment of patients on the basis of their responses to previously prescribed agents are summarized.

Direct treatment approach for ceftriaxone—third-generation cephalosporins in low-risk histories: Among persons with confirmed IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, the level of cross-reactivity with third-generation cephalosporins is low. If a patient has a low-risk history for an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, ambulatory settings often treat with third-generation cephalosporins without further testing. Low-risk history includes one nonspecific symptom (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonurticarial rash), and examples listed in Box 2 include gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, pruritis without rash, localized rash, delayed onset rash (>24 hours), symptoms unknown, family history of penicillin or another drug allergy, and a recorded allergy the patient denies. In addition, a family history of penicillin or β-lactam allergy alone is not a contraindication for treatment with β-lactam antibiotics.

### Practical aspects of choosing an antibiotic for patients with a reported allergy to an antibiotic [^ea47b77a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Physicians often must select antibiotics for patients who are reported to have an antibiotic allergy. For penicillins, the sensitivity of penicillin skin testing for predicting serious allergic reactions is excellent. For other beta-lactam antibiotics, penicillin skin testing is useful for excluding the possibility of sensitivity to the beta-lactam ring. For other antibiotics, the patient history remains the most useful tool for determining whether a serious reaction is likely to occur with further drug exposure. The cross-reactivity between penicillins and second- or third-generation cephalosporins (excluding cefamandole) is probably no higher than is the cross-reactivity between penicillins and other classes of antibiotics. When a patient has a suspected immunoglobulin E-mediated antibiotic allergy, desensitization therapy should be considered, if the efficacy of alternate antibiotics is in doubt. For the treatment of serious infections, it is usually possible to safely administer the antibiotic of choice despite a history of possible antibiotic allergy.

In the absence of penicillin allergy, treatments of choice are a single dose of intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin G, or a 10-day course of oral penicillin V or amoxicillin, while oral cephalexin (or other first-generation cephalosporin) or a macrolide may be used with nonimmediate or immediate allergy to penicillin, respectively.

### Diagnosis and management of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins [^763652a2]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Cephalosporins are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of antibiotics. Immediate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with use of a specific cephalosporin, as a cross-reaction between different cephalosporins or as a cross-reaction to other β-lactam antibiotics, namely, penicillin. Historically, frequent reports of anaphylaxis following administration of first- and second-generation cephalosporins to patients with a history of penicillin allergy led to the belief of a high degree of allergic cross-reactivity. More recent evidence reveals a significantly lower risk of cross-reactivity between penicillins and the newer-generation cephalosporins. The current thought is that a shared side chain, rather than the β-lactam ring structure, is the determining factor in immunologic cross-reactivity. Understanding the chemical structure of these agents has allowed us to identify the allergenic determinants for penicillin; however, the exact allergenic determinants of cephalosporins are less well understood. For this reason, standardized diagnostic skin testing is not available for cephalosporins as it is for penicillin. Nevertheless, skin testing to the cephalosporin in question, using a nonirritating concentration, provides additional information, which can further guide the work-up of a patient suspected of having an allergy to that drug. Together, the history and the skin test results can assist the allergist in the decision to recommend continued drug avoidance or to perform a graded challenge versus an induction of tolerance procedure.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^5d2de4b0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

On the subject of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, the practice parameter suggests again stratifying patients on the basis of anaphylactic versus nonanaphylactic histories, as well as determining whether the penicillin allergy is confirmed or unconfirmed. For patients with a history of an unconfirmed nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, any cephalosporin can be routinely administered without testing or additional precautions. In contrast, for those rare patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin, a non–cross-reactive cephalosporin can be administered routinely without prior testing.

Despite the simplified approach to cephalosporin evaluation, the extent to which this approach is incorporated into allergy practice remains unclear. Therefore, we surveyed the members of the Adverse Reactions to Drugs, Biologics, and Latex (ARDBL) Committee of the AAAAI between February and April 2023 to assess current practices of cephalosporin allergy testing using real case examples.

### Cephalosporin allergy [^48a262a2]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Allergic reactions to cephalosporins may occur because of sensitization to cephalosporin determinants shared with penicillin or to unique cephalosporin haptens. The exact nature of the haptenic determinants resulting from the degradation of currently available cephalosporins is incompletely understood. Cephalosporin skin testing or specific IgE immunoassays have limited clinical utility. Patients with a history of allergy to cephalosporins or penicillin may be at increased risk for a reaction to cephalosporins. Skin testing for an allergy to penicillin may be helpful in patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have a clinical indication for cephalosporin use. Most of these patients have negative tests and should not be at increased risk for a reaction to cephalosporins.

Penicillin allergy label—burden and clinical impact include that approximately 10% of patients report a history of reacting to a penicillin class antibiotic, yet >90% tolerate penicillins when evaluated; mislabeling leads to use of less effective, more toxic, or more expensive antibiotics, higher risks of resistant infections, and increased mortality over long-term follow-up.

Cefazolin, also known as Ancef, is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic often used in surgery to treat or prevent bacterial infection of the surgical site. Ancef is safe for most of the population; however, many physicians use alternative, less effective medications in patients with penicillin allergy due to a fear of cross-reactivity between Ancef and one's penicillin allergy. In this article, we aim to examine if cefazolin is safe for patients with penicillin allergy.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to β-lactam antibiotics [^c5bbf20f]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Clinicians commonly encounter patients with a history of allergy to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics, since about 10% of the population reports such an allergy. At the same time, it is known that about 90% of these patients are not truly allergic and could safely receive beta-lactam antibiotics. Instead, these patients are treated unnecessarily with alternate broad-spectrum antibiotics, which increases costs and contributes to the development and spread of multiple drug-resistant bacteria. In the case of penicillin, relevant allergenic determinants that elicit immune responses are known. Hence, validated diagnostic skin testing to detect the presence of drug-specific IgE antibodies is available. For non-penicillin beta-lactams, the immunogenic determinants that are produced by degradation are unknown, and diagnostic skin testing is of more limited value. Ideally, patients with a history of penicillin allergy should be evaluated when they are well and not in immediate need of antibiotic therapy. Patients who are found to be penicillin skin test-negative may be safely treated with all beta-lactam antibiotics. Penicillin skin test-positive patients should only receive a penicillin-class antibiotic via rapid desensitization, and only in cases when an alternative agent cannot be substituted. Penicillin skin test-positive patients may be safely treated with monobactams. The extent of allergic cross-reactivity between penicillin arid cephalosporins/carbapenems is uncertain; therefore penicillin skin test-positive patients should only receive these antibiotics via cautious graded challenge or desensitization. Identification of patients who erroneously carry a label of beta-lactam allergy leads to improved utilization of antibiotics and slows the spread of multiple drug-resistant bacteria.

### Misconceptions surrounding penicillin allergy: implications for anesthesiologists [^fb529c8e]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Administration of preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis, often with a cephalosporin, is the mainstay of surgical site infection prevention guidelines. Unfortunately, due to prevalent misconceptions, patients labeled as having a penicillin allergy often receive alternate and less-effective antibiotics, placing them at risk of a variety of adverse effects including increased morbidity and higher risk of surgical site infection. The perioperative physician should ascertain the nature of previous reactions to aid in determining the probability of the prevalence of a true allergy. Penicillin allergy testing may be performed but may not be feasible in the perioperative setting. Current evidence on the structural determinants of penicillin and cephalosporin allergies refutes the misconception of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cefazolin, and there is no clear evidence of an increased risk of anaphylaxis in cefazolin-naive, penicillin-allergic patients. A clinical practice algorithm for the perioperative evaluation and management of patients reporting a history of penicillin allergy is presented, concluding that cephalosporins can be safely administered to a majority of such patients.

Patients unable to tolerate oral therapy may be treated with intramuscular or intravenous ampicillin, ceftriaxone or cefazolin, and for those allergic to ampicillin who also cannot take oral agents, therapy is recommended with parenteral cefazolin, ceftriaxone or clindamycin.

### The use of cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients: a literature review [^f5ae573c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The practice of avoiding cephalosporin administration to penicillin-allergic patients persists despite the low rate of cross reactions between both groups of antibiotics.

Objective

The purpose of this literature review is to evaluate the published evidence regarding the commonly held belief that patients with a history of an allergic reaction to penicillin have a significantly increased risk of an allergic reaction to cephalosporins.

Materials and Methods

Articles were identified through a computerized search of MEDLINE from 1950 to the present using the search terms "penicillin$," "cephalosporin$," "allerg$," "hypersensitivity," and "cross-react$." All articles were reviewed, and additional sources cited in them were added to the literature review.

Results

Penicillins have a cross allergy with first-generation cephalosporins (odds ratio 4.8; confidence interval 3.7-6.2) and a negligible cross allergy with second-generation cephalosporins (odds ratio 1.1; confidence interval 0.6-2.1). Laboratory and cohort studies confirm that the R1 side chain is responsible for this cross reactivity. Overall cross reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is lower than previously reported, though there is a strong association between amoxicillin and ampicillin with first- and second-generation cephalosporins that share a similar R1 side chain.

Conclusions

Although a myth persists that approximately 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy will have an allergic reaction if given a cephalosporin, the overall cross-reactivity rate is approximately 1% when using first-generation cephalosporins or cephalosporins with similar R1 side chains. However, a single study reported the prevalence of cross reactivity with cefadroxil as high as 27%. For penicillin-allergic patients, the use of third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins or cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains than the offending penicillin carries a negligible risk of cross allergy.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^58fcb7d4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

When evaluating a patient with a high-risk penicillin allergy, many experts chose to include both penicillin and cephalosporin skin tests, as opposed to just performing a penicillin-based skin test, as suggested by the practice parameter. Similarly, for a high-risk cephalosporin history, more physicians recommended a penicillin skin test in addition to a cephalosporin skin test, even when evaluating whether the patient can receive cephalosporins, while the practice parameter does not suggest the need to evaluate penicillins.

We were especially interested in the approach to cefazolin allergy among drug allergy experts. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin broadly used for perioperative prophylaxis.Reviewing the chemical structures and immunogenic components of cefazolin shown that it has 2 side chains (R1 and R2) whose structures do not match those of any other β-lactams in use in the United States, including penicillin, which suggests that the true rate of cross-reactivity of cefazolin to other β-lactam antibiotics may actually be close to zero.Several studies suggest that patients with past immediate reactions to cefazolin often tolerate all other cephalosporins and other β-lactams. A 2021 study demonstrated that in a series of 452 patients labeled as having penicillin allergy who underwent allergy testing, none had a positive skin test result when tested specifically for cefazolin or ceftriaxone.In a systematic review and meta-analysis from 2021 looking at dual allergy to penicillin and cefazolin, less than 1% of nonconfirmed penicillin allergy also had the label of cefazolin allergy, suggesting that most patients with a history of penicillin allergy may safely be prescribed cefazolin.

Carbapenems—patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy: We suggest that in patients with a history of penicillin or cephalosporin allergy, a carbapenem may be administered without testing or additional precautions (Strength of Recommendation: Conditional; Certainty of Evidence: Moderate). The overall reported incidence of carbapenem allergy is 0.3%-3.7%. In a systematic review including 838 patients with proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, carbapenem reactions occurred in 4.3% of patients (95% CI: 3.1%-5.9%), and among those with positive penicillin skin tests (n = 295) only 1 (0.3%; 95% CI: 0.006%-1.9%) reacted. Another meta-analysis of 11 observational studies (1127 patients) found cross-reactivity to any carbapenem as 0.87% (95% CI: 0.32%-2.32%), and in a prospective study of 211 patients with skin test–confirmed penicillin allergy all tolerated carbapenems. Patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy histories, as long as it is not a severe delayed cutaneous or organ-involved reaction, can receive carbapenems without prior testing, though in certain situations such as multiple drug allergy or significant patient anxiety a graded drug challenge might be preferred.

Results

Study population

Between March 20, 2021, and November 1, 2023, 533 patients were screened, with 80 patients enrolled from four ICUs (Fig. 1). The characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. The median age of participants was 64.5 years (IQR 53.5, 74) with 40 (50%) female participants. Median Charlson comorbidity index was 4 (IQR 2, 6) and median ICU admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores were 4 (IQR 2, 6) and 11 (IQR 6.5, 14) respectively. At the time of randomisation, two (5%) patients in the intervention arm and one (2.5%) patient in the control arm were mechanically ventilated.

### Penicillin allergy in pregnancy: moving from "Rash" decisions to accurate diagnosis [^71970d74]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

The emergence of beta-lactam-resistant pathogenic organisms has resulted in limitation or even elimination of drugs such as penicillin and ampicillin from available antibiotic choices for treating common infections in obstetrics and gynecology. In clinical situations for which penicillins and cephalosporins are appropriate or recommended first-line agents, the problem of patient-reported penicillin allergies has led to routine use of alternative but potentially less effective agents. The use of broader-spectrum and potentially suboptimal alternative antibiotic regimens for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcus or for surgical prophylaxis for cesarean delivery in women with a reported penicillin allergy may affect these women during labor and birth. Most individuals who report a penicillin allergy are neither truly allergic nor at risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction after exposure to penicillin. The available evidence suggests that there are important roles for both targeted history-taking, to determine the nature of drug allergies and penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women, to optimize their antibiotic-related treatment both during pregnancy and for their lifetimes. Wider consideration and adoption of penicillin allergy testing in pregnant women specifically, as well as the general population of women cared for by providers of obstetrics and gynecology, is recommended.

### Evaluation and management of penicillin allergy: a review [^b16b356b]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

β-Lactam antibiotics are among the safest and most effective antibiotics. Many patients report allergies to these drugs that limit their use, resulting in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance and adverse events.

Observations

Approximately 10% of the US population has reported allergies to the β-lactam agent penicillin, with higher rates reported by older and hospitalized patients. Although many patients report that they are allergic to penicillin, clinically significant IgE-mediated or T lymphocyte-mediated penicillin hypersensitivity is uncommon (<5%). Currently, the rate of IgE-mediated penicillin allergies is decreasing, potentially due to a decreased use of parenteral penicillins, and because severe anaphylactic reactions to oral amoxicillin are rare. IgE-mediated penicillin allergy wanes over time, with 80% of patients becoming tolerant after a decade. Cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporin drugs occurs in about 2% of cases, less than the 8% reported previously. Some patients have a medical history that suggests they are at a low risk for developing an allergic reaction to penicillin. Low-risk histories include patients having isolated nonallergic symptoms, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, or patients solely with a family history of a penicillin allergy, symptoms of pruritus without rash, or remote (>10 years) unknown reactions without features suggestive of an IgE-mediated reaction. A moderate-risk history includes urticaria or other pruritic rashes and reactions with features of IgE-mediated reactions. A high-risk history includes patients who have had anaphylaxis, positive penicillin skin testing, recurrent penicillin reactions, or hypersensitivities to multiple β-lactam antibiotics. The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are undermined when reported allergy to penicillin leads to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics that increase the risk for antimicrobial resistance, including increased risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents also increase the risk of developing Clostridium difficile (also known as Clostridioides difficile) infection. Direct amoxicillin challenge is appropriate for patients with low-risk allergy histories. Moderate-risk patients can be evaluated with penicillin skin testing, which carries a negative predictive value that exceeds 95% and approaches 100% when combined with amoxicillin challenge. Clinicians performing penicillin allergy evaluation need to identify what methods are supported by their available resources.

Conclusions and Relevance

Many patients report they are allergic to penicillin but few have clinically significant reactions. Evaluation of penicillin allergy before deciding not to use penicillin or other β-lactam antibiotics is an important tool for antimicrobial stewardship.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^0f9a9a98]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Antimicrobial agents—penicillins general epidemiology reports that penicillins are commonly used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Penicillin allergy is one of the most commonly reported drug allergies, with a prevalence of 5% to 10%, and the reported prevalence is higher among hospitalized patients, at 11% to 15%. Individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity are more likely to receive alternative antibiotic therapy, which can lead to added expense.

### Testing strategies and predictors for evaluating immediate and delayed reactions to cephalosporins [^84cae89e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although 1% to 2% of the general population carries a cephalosporin allergy label (CAL), we lack validated testing strategies and predictors of true allergy.

Objective

To identify cross-reactivity patterns and predictors of skin test positive (STP) in geographically disparate patients with a CAL.

Methods

A total of 780 adult patients labeled with a CAL or penicillin allergy label (PAL) with unknown tolerance of cephalosporins identified from the Austin Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) (n = 410) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, TN) (n = 370) between 2014 and 2018 underwent a standardized skin testing.

Results

Of 328 patients with a CAL, 29 (8.8%) tested STP to ≥1 cephalosporin(s). There were no cefazolin or ceftriaxone STP, 0 of 452 (0%), in patients with a PAL only. Of 328 patients with a CAL, 16 (4.8%) were ampicillin STP. Eleven of 16 of these patients had an initial allergy label to cephalexin. Twenty of 29 cephalosporin STP patients demonstrated tolerance to a cephalosporin with a different R1 side chain, and 8 of 14 ampicillin STP patients demonstrated tolerance to ≥1 non-amino R1 group cephalosporin. Eleven of 13 patients STP to cefazolin were skin and ingestion challenge negative to all other penicillins and cephalosporins predicted by its distinct R1/R2 groups. Seven of 15 ceftriaxone STP patients demonstrated cross-reactivity with R1-similar cephalosporins. Time since the original reaction predicted STP testing to both penicillins, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) per year 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90, 0.97), and cephalosporins, aOR per year 0.71 (95% CI: 0.56, 0.90).

Conclusions

Cephalosporin cross-reactivity is based on shared R1 groupings. Increasing time since the original reaction and the presence of a PAL with unknown cephalosporin tolerance predict a lower likelihood of cephalosporin STP.

Preferred antibiotics are usually penicillinase-resistant penicillin, such as dicloxacillin, 500 mg four times per day; alternatively, cephalexin 500 mg four times a day or clindamycin 300 mg four times a day may be used if the patient has a penicillin allergy. A patient should be asked about a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in herself or in members of her household, and a 10–14-day course of antibiotics usually is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence from suboptimally treated mastitis.

Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy

Penicillin and other ß-lactam antibiotics have a crucial role in treating STIs. Penicillin is recommended for all clinical stages of syphilis, and no proven alternatives exist for treating neurosyphilis, congenital syphilis, or syphilis during pregnancy. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is recommended for gonorrhea treatment. For extragenital site infections, especially pharyngeal, failure rates of nonceftriaxone regimens can be substantial. In most clinical settings, patients who report a penicillin allergy are not treated with ß-lactam antimicrobials. For patients with a diagnosis of gonorrhea and a concomitant reported allergy to penicillin, ceftriaxone is often avoided, even though the cross-reactivity between penicillin allergy and third-generation cephalosporins is low (–).

Prevalence of reported allergy to penicillin is approximately 10% among the U.S. population and higher among hospital inpatients and residents in health care–related facilities (–). One large study in an STI clinic revealed that 8.3% of patients reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy. Penicillin allergy is often overreported, with the majority of patients who report penicillin allergy able to tolerate the medication. The prevalence of reported penicillin allergy in low-income countries is unknown; however, limited data indicate that penicillin is one of the most frequently reported antibiotic allergies.

Patients often are incorrectly labeled as allergic to penicillin and are therefore denied the benefit of a ß-lactam therapy. The presence of a penicillin allergy label considerably reduces prescribing options for affected patients. Moreover, penicillin allergy labels lead to the use of more expensive and less effective drugs and can result in adverse consequences, including longer length of hospital stay and increased risk for infection. Multiple studies have described that persons with reported penicillin or another ß-lactam antibiotic allergy have higher rates of surgical-site infections, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, and higher medical care usage (,–).

The overreported prevalence of penicillin allergy is secondary to imprecise use of the term “allergy” by families and clinicians and lack of clarity to differentiate between immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, drug intolerances, and other idiosyncratic reactions that can occur days after exposure. Approximately 80% of patients with a true IgE-mediated allergic reaction to penicillin have lost the sensitivity after 10 years. Thus, patients with recent reactions are more likely to be allergic than patients with remote reactions, and patients who had allergic reactions in the distant past might no longer be reactive.

### Cross-reactivity and tolerability of cephalosporins in patients with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to penicillins [^7ad8ea93]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Studies performed since 1990 on samples of at least 30 subjects with a documented IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to penicillins have found a rate of positive responses to allergy tests with cephalosporins ranging from 0% to 27%.

Objective

We sought to assess the cross-reactivity with cephalosporins and evaluate the possibility of using cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic subjects.

Methods

We conducted a prospective study of 252 consecutive subjects who had suffered 319 immediate reactions (mostly anaphylaxis) to penicillins and had positive skin tests to at least 1 penicillin reagent. All patients underwent serum specific IgE assays for cefaclor, as well as skin tests with 3 aminocephalosporins (cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefadroxil), cefamandole, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and cefepime. Patients with negative results for the last 5 cephalosporins were challenged with cefuroxime axetil and ceftriaxone; those with negative results for aminocephalosporins were also challenged with cefaclor and cefadroxil.

Results

Ninety-nine participants (39.3%) had positive allergy tests for cephalosporins. Specifically, 95 (37.7%) were positive to aminocephalosporins and/or cefamandole, which share similar or identical side chains with penicillins. All 244 subjects who underwent challenges with cefuroxime axetil and ceftriaxone tolerated them. Of the 170 patients who underwent aminocephalosporin challenges, 3 reacted to cefaclor and 4 to cefadroxil.

Conclusions

Cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins seems to be mainly related to side chain similarity or identity. Subjects with an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to penicillins could be treated with cephalosporins such as cefuroxime and ceftriaxone that have side-chain determinants different from those of penicillins and are negative in pretreatment skin testing.

In group 2, antibiotic prescriptions were piperacillin and tazobactam (n = 11); amoxicillin and clavulanic acid (n = 8); cefazolin (n = 5); ceftriaxone and metronidazole (n = 2); amoxicillin and gentamicin (n = 1); benzyl penicillin and metronidazole (n = 1); cefazolin and metronidazole (n = 1); ceftriaxone (n = 1); ceftriaxone and azithromycin (n = 1); ceftriaxone and gentamicin (n = 1); ceftriaxone and doxycycline (n = 1); cephalexin (n = 1); flucloxacillin (n = 1); flucloxacillin, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin (n = 1); and piperacillin, tazobactam, and vancomycin (n = 1). In this group, 1 patient (2.8%) had an antibiotic allergy label (vancomycin).

In group 3, the antibiotics included vancomycin (n = 12), vancomycin and anidulafungin (n = 1), vancomycin and ciprofloxacin (n = 1), and clindamycin (n = 2). One patient (6.3%) had an antibiotic allergy label (ceftriaxone).

Overall, the median LOS was 9 days, being highest in group 3 (at 15 days). Although total LOS and days to discharge after allergy consultation were lower in group 1a (10 days and 4 days, respectively) than in group 1b (11.5 days and 5 days, respectively), neither reached statistical significance. Group 2 had a significantly lower LOS (6 days) than either group 1a (10 days [P =. 043]) or group 3 (15 days [P =. 002]) (Fig 1). Collectively, no patients experienced any adverse reactions during their hospitalization with the respective antibiotics.

Penicillin testing result and aminopenicillin-specific considerations—If penicillin testing is negative, the patient can receive any cephalosporin without special precaution. Patients who are proven to be aminopenicillin-allergic should generally avoid cephalosporins with identical R1-group side chains. From 12% to 38% of patients with penicillin allergy in Europe are proven to be selectively allergic to aminopenicillins (ie, able to tolerate penicillin but not amoxicillin/ampicillin), the prevalence of aminopenicillin allergy in the United States appears to be rare.

### The role of major and minor determinants in penicillin allergy testing: time to revisit an old friend? [^ffa40de7]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2023). Medium credibility.

Table II shows a patient who had an initial index reaction to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (generalized urticaria and tongue angioedema) more than 20 years previously and then underwent amoxicillin challenge with negative results. However, on reexposure to amoxicillin a year later, she developed facial angioedema and erythema. Subsequent testing showed a positive IDT result to cefazolin and PPL. Because of a history of reaction with reexposure to amoxicillin, she was challenged to cephalexin, with no immediate reaction but a report of oral burning sensation on day 2 of the course and confirmation of mouth ulcers by her primary care physician. Because this is not indicative of an IgE-mediated mechanism, the IDT results were not deemed to be relevant. Further challenge was not undertaken.

There were 7 patients (3%) with a positive oral challenge result; the majority were mild cutaneous reactions. This rate is similar to those in other reports.

It is striking that even though unspecified penicillin was the most reported index drug, 95.7% of the patients with a positive skin testing result (22 of 23) had specified a history of reaction to amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Accordingly, the SPT and IDT were positive to amoxicillin in a large proportion of our skin test positive patients (17 of 23 [73.9%]). These findings likely reflect the rise in amoxicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid prescriptions. Selective sensitization to aminopenicillins has been reported in up to 50% of patients in other series.,,A study from the United Kingdom reported testing of more than 1000 patients, in whom monosensitization with amoxicillin was demonstrated in 48%, with 70% of the patients having a negative result of testing to major and minor determinants.Given the rise in amoxicillin allergy, our findings suggest that a panel comprising amoxicillin and benzyl penicillin may be sufficient in at least Australian and European populations, in which amoxicillin use is predominant. In this context, those patients with penicillin allergy are unlikely to be missed, even if the result of amoxicillin testing is negative.

Since the initial reports of penicillin and beta-lactam drugs causing allergic reactions, much has been elucidated regarding their pathophysiology and mechanism of action. Despite advances in testing for penicillin allergy, with IgE antibodies and skin tests available for the major and minor determinants of penicillin, these reactions remain a challenge to all physicians. They have characteristically been classified according to mechanism and time. Herein, the authors propose a classification system of penicillin allergy based on immunologic mechanisms.

Testing procedures and results

The flow of participant testing is described in Fig 1. Testing results are described in Table II. Drug-specific IgE was measured in 40 participants (20% overall, 21.2% phase 1, 20% phase 2; P >.05), with 2 positive results (5%). One went on to have further negative skin and provocation testing results, and both were assessed 6 to 12 months following their index reaction. Skin prick testing was performed in 151 participants (77.5% combined, 63.5% phase 1, 88.2% phase 2; P <.001), with 5 (3.3%) demonstrating positive test results. Of these 5 participants, 3 were assessed 1 to 6 months after their index reaction, and 2 were assessed more than 10 years after their index reaction. The most tested reagent was minor determinant mix (145 of 151), with a positivity rate of 0.7% (1 of 145). The skin prick test reagent with the highest positivity rate was cephalexin at 9% (1 of 11). Intradermal tests were performed in 147 participants (75.4% overall, 62.4% phase 1, 85.5% phase 2; P <.05), with positive results in 22 (15%). Eight of the positive participants were assessed more than 10 years after their index reaction, 6 within 1 to 5 years of their index reaction, 5 within 6 to 12 months of their index reaction, and 3 within 6 months. The most tested reagent was ampicillin (129 of 147 [87.8%]). The intradermal test reagent with the highest positivity rate was flucloxacillin (4 of 25 [16.0%]). There was no difference in the median number of skin test reagents used per participant between the phases.

Table II 
Testing results

The most common in vivo test across both phases was the oral provocation test (164 of 195 [84.1% overall]), with 10 (6.2%) yielding positive results. There was no significant difference in the use of oral provocation tests between the phases (78.8% phase 1, 88.2% phase 2; P >.05). The most common agent for oral provocation tests was amoxicillin (124 of 164 [76%]), with a positivity rate of 4.8% (6 of 124). The agent with the highest rate of positivity was cephalexin (6 of 14 [28.6%]). A further 3 provocation tests were performed intravenously with no positive results. Of the 10 positive challenges, 2 were in the same participant who reacted to amoxicillin and cephalexin. This participant had a mild to moderate reaction to amoxicillin 6 to 12 months before assessment. Of the other participants, 3 had a history of mild to moderate reactions to the index drug 1 to 6 months earlier, 4 had a history of a delayed reaction (3 more than 10 years earlier, one 1-6 months earlier), and 1 had a history of anaphylaxis more than 10 years ago. One participant who had a mild reaction to cephalexin at provocation test had not undergone skin testing.

A total of 135 participants (69.2%) underwent extended provocation challenges for 3 to 7 days (mean, 3.2 days). A total of 112 of these patients (82.9%) received oral amoxicillin, and 6 patients reported a reaction (5.4%, 5 mild, 1 moderate in severity). Four of these patients had an index history of delayed reaction to amoxicillin, 1 had anaphylaxis to cephalexin, and the index history of the remaining participant was unknown. The antibiotic with the highest rate of positivity was cephalexin (1 of 7 [14.3%]). There was no anaphylaxis as a result of in-clinic or extended provocation tests.

Participants were less likely to be delabeled if the index reaction was anaphylaxis (odds ratio, 0.69; P =.02) or if the participant had a history of anaphylaxis to any trigger (odds ratio, 0.34; P <.05). No other factors in regard to background history or index reaction were statistically significant in predicting outcome.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^e57fb250]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

We studied 2 cases of anaphylaxis to cephalosporins because we had a specific interest in the evaluation of cefazolin reactions and whether this drug is recognized by drug allergy experts as being primarily non–cross-reactive to both penicillins and cephalosporins. The practice parameter’s algorithm does not recommend a different evaluation for cefazolin, but it does mention the unique characteristics of this drug in its discussion of R1 side chain and cross-reactivity.

We present the results in such a way as to visually illustrate the distribution of answer combinations, with answers aligning with the practice parameter marked to help visually recognize trends of adherence to the guidelines.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^e9dd7c42]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

For scenario C, the practice parameters recommend normal administration of a dissimilar cephalosporin, as well as a skin test–based approach for a structurally similar cephalosporin, for patients with an anaphylactic history to a penicillin. Our survey results showed that 23% elected to perform a penicillin-based skin test and focus only on proving or disproving the penicillin allergy, which aligns with practice parameters’ recommendations.

For scenario D, for a patient with a high-risk cephalosporin history, the practice parameters suggest cephalosporin skin test as the evaluation approach. Forty-eight percent of the experts in our survey chose answers that aligned with this approach.

For scenario E, for patients with another high-risk history of a cephalosporin, specifically cefazolin, a higher number of participants, 57%, chose cephalosporin skin test as their evaluation.

Following scenario E, we specifically asked a question about the recommended steps in cephalosporin use when the skin test results are positive to cefazolin. For this scenario, most experts (34, 79.1%) recommended avoiding cefazolin and conducting an oral challenge with a structurally dissimilar cephalosporin, versus 9 experts (20.9%) who recommended avoiding cefazolin alone, without the need to continue to oral challenge.

We attempted to perform a post hoc analysis to look for a correlation between the experts’ time in practice and their adherence to the guidelines, but we found no such correlation in any of the case scenarios.

The survey’s last section asked about the impact of the 2022 practice parameter on the survey respondents’ individual practices.

Twenty-one participants (47.7%) agreed that the 2022 practice parameters had changed their approach specifically for cephalosporin allergy testing. Among the 21 who answered “yes” to having changed their practice after the updated drug allergy practice parameters were reported qualitative changes in their practice of doing more DOCs (7 experts), more single-dose challenges (2 reports), and fewer skin tests (6 reports), as well as being less concerned about penicillin and cephalosporin cross-reactivity.

Cross-reactivity with cephalosporins—risk levels and anaphylaxis—notes that third-generation cephalosporins have lower cross-reactivity with IgE-mediated penicillin-allergic patients (<1%) compared with first- and second-generation cephalosporins (range: 1%–8%). Anaphylaxis secondary to cephalosporins among persons who report a penicillin allergy is estimated at a rate of one per 52,000 persons, and Kaiser health care system data reported that among 3,313 patients with self-reported cephalosporin allergy who received a cephalosporin, no cases of anaphylaxis were reported. Use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems is safe for patients without a history of IgE-mediated symptoms from penicillin during the preceding 10 years.

Direct Treatment Approach for Ceftriaxone

Among persons with confirmed IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, the level of cross-reactivity with third-generation cephalosporins is low. If a patient has a low-risk history for an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, ambulatory settings often treat with third-generation cephalosporins without further testing. Low-risk history includes one nonspecific symptom (e.g. gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonurticarial rash) (Box 2). In addition, a family history of penicillin or ß-lactam allergy alone is not a contraindication for treatment with ß-lactam antibiotics. This practice is increasingly being used in ambulatory settings and for preoperative prophylaxis (,,,–).

BOX 2 
Low-risk history in patients who report penicillin allergy

Gastrointestinal symptoms

Headache

Pruritis without rash

Localized rash

Delayed onset rash (>24 hours)

Symptoms unknown

Family history of penicillin or another drug allergy

Patient denies allergy but it is on the medical record

Patients at Low Risk for Oral Challenge

If the patient gives only a low-risk history of IgE-mediated penicillin allergy that includes symptoms such gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonspecific pruritus, or gives a family history only, an oral challenge can be administered to document the absence of allergy (Box 2). If the reaction occurred in the distant past (>10 years), the likelihood is reduced even further. The risk for severe amoxicillin-mediated anaphylaxis has decreased over time and is rare. In the United Kingdom during 1972–2007, one fatal case of amoxicillin-medicated anaphylaxis was reported.

Skin Testing for Penicillin Allergy

Skin testing for penicillin allergy should be performed if any indication exists that the symptoms were secondary to an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Testing is also indicated as a potential diagnostic procedure to definitively rule out penicillin allergy and document a negative allergy status in the medical record (i.e. delabeling). Because penicillin allergy testing does not test for multiple minor determinants, a person with a negative skin test should follow up with an oral challenge to confirm the negative status.

Persons with negative results of a penicillin skin test, followed by an amoxicillin oral challenge, can receive conventional penicillin therapy safely if needed. Persons with positive skin test results and for whom no other clinical options exist (e.g. neurosyphilis and syphilis in a pregnant woman) should be referred to an allergist and desensitized before initiating treatment.

### Association between removal of a warning against cephalosporin use in patients with penicillin allergy and antibiotic prescribing [^b13363fc]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Increases in drug-resistant organisms are a global threat, and thus antibiotic stewardship is a critical priority.Approaches to antibiotic stewardship include both reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics and choosing the most appropriate agents. β-Lactams are the preferred treatment for many common pathogens, such as group A and B Streptococcus species, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Staphylococcus aureus.β-Lactams are also the preferred prophylactic agents for dental procedures and many other surgical procedures.Physicians may, however, choose a second-line antibiotic in the presence of drug allergies or potential cross-reactivity with β-lactams.

Point-of-care alerts to inform prescribing decisions by physicians and to enhance patient safety have been among the reasons for use of electronic health records (EHRs). In response to Meaningful Use requirements issued by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, many EHRs include an imbedded function to warn against prescribing cephalosporins to patients with a penicillin allergy. This warning is not consistent with current evidence.For example, no clinically significant immunologic cross-reactivity between penicillin and cephalosporins has been shown. Furthermore, avoiding β-lactams when they are the drug of choice is associated with worse outcomes, such as increased risk of surgical site infections,,, nephrotoxicity,and Clostridioides difficile infection.In addition, use of second-line antibiotic classes in patients with penicillin allergies may be associated with other adverse effects, decreased safety, and antimicrobial resistance.

In December 2017, after a review of the literature and clinical deliberations among leaders in infectious diseases in the Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Kaiser Permanente Southern California removed a warning in its EHR to avoid prescribing cephalosporins to patients with a penicillin allergy. In the current study, we examined the association of this change with choice of antibiotic, incidence of antibiotic allergy, incidence of cephalosporin-associated anaphylaxis, and rate of penicillin allergy–associated morbidities in patients with a penicillin allergy.

### Association between removal of a warning against cephalosporin use in patients with penicillin allergy and antibiotic prescribing [^8ef319a4]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this cohort study, removal of a warning in the EHR to avoid cephalosporin use in patients with penicillin allergies was associated with increased prescribing of cephalosporins and decreased prescribing of some second-line antibiotics. Overall rates of adverse antibiotic-associated reactions or specific serious cephalosporin-associated morbidities were similar before and after removal of the warning. Removing the warning was not associated with a reduction in the known morbidities associated with an unconfirmed penicillin allergy. Greater attention should be given to the accuracy with which patients are labeled as having a penicillin allergy.

The Standards of Care Committee of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology (BSACI) and an expert panel have prepared this guidance for the management of immediate and non-immediate allergic reactions to penicillins and other beta-lactams. The guideline is intended for UK specialists in both adult and paediatric allergy and for other clinicians practising allergy in secondary and tertiary care. The recommendations are evidence based, but where evidence is lacking, the panel reached consensus. During the development of the guideline, all BSACI members were consulted using a Web-based process and all comments carefully considered. Included in the guideline are epidemiology of allergic reactions to beta-lactams, molecular structure, formulations available in the UK and a description of known beta-lactam antigenic determinants. Sections on the value and limitations of clinical history, skin testing and laboratory investigations for both penicillins and cephalosporins are included. Cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is discussed in detail. Recommendations on oral provocation and desensitization procedures have been made. Guidance for beta-lactam allergy in children is given in a separate section. An algorithm to help the clinician in the diagnosis of patients with a history of penicillin allergy has also been included.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 199: use of prophylactic antibiotics in labor and delivery [^11dadb6c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic allergy and anaphylaxis risks—prevalence and cross-reactivity estimates include that approximately 25% of all patients that required antimicrobial therapy in the hospital reported an allergy to at least one antibiotic, and only 4% had documentation of the specific reaction. A severe allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to penicillin is estimated to occur 1 in 2,500–25,000 patients, with less severe reactions in approximately 10% of patients. Approximately 5% of patients who received an antibiotic in the hospital will have a severe adverse reaction. Cross-reactivity is reported, with up to 10% of patients with a history of a penicillin allergy reacting if given a cephalosporin; skin reactions to cephalosporins occur in 1–3% of patients and the risk of anaphylaxis is thought to be much lower (0.001–0.1%). Reported severe but uncommon outcomes include a case of anaphylaxis to penicillin after administration for GBS prophylaxis and reports of exfoliative dermatitis and severe immune hemolytic anemia associated with cephalosporin therapy; although uncommon, antibiotic use should be limited to the specific indications as outlined and customized as needed in cases of allergy. Penicillin allergy skin testing can be considered in evaluation of patients with a history of an allergy to penicillin, and skin testing, even after delivery, could decrease the morbidity and economic costs associated with treating these patients with costly alternative antibiotics that also may result in adverse consequences.

### Cross-reactivity and tolerability of cephalosporins in patients with immediate hypersensitivity to penicillins [^42aff293]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with documented IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to penicillins, data on sensitization to cephalosporins vary. Administering cephalosporins to such patients is often deferred because of the risk for cross-reactivity.

Objective

To assess the cross-reactivity with cephalosporins and its potential determinants in patients with documented penicillin allergy.

Design

Prospective study in patients without clinical indications for cephalosporin treatment.

Setting

Italy.

Patients

128 consecutive patients who sustained anaphylactic shock (n = 81) or urticaria (n = 47) and had positive results on skin tests for at least 1 of the penicillin reagents tested.

Measurements

All patients were skin tested with cephalothin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime. Patients with negative results for the last 4 cephalosporins were challenged with cefuroxime axetil and ceftriaxone.

Results

14 patients (10.9% [95% CI, 6.1% to 17.7%]) had positive results on skin tests for cephalosporins, mostly for cephalothin or cefamandole. Skin test results for the minor determinant mixture were positive in 10 of 14 patients (71.4%) with cross-reactivity and 44 of 114 patients (38.6%) without cross-reactivity (odds ratio, 3.90 [CI, 1.17 to 13.40]; P = 0.0189). All 101 patients with negative results on skin tests for cefuroxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime tolerated cefuroxime axetil and ceftriaxone (tolerability rate, 100% [CI, 96.4% to 100%]).

Limitations

Challenges were not followed by full therapeutic courses. Twenty-two patients declined challenges; positive responses in those patients would have decreased the tolerability rate to 82.1% (CI, 74.2% to 88.4%).

Conclusions

These data confirm the advisability of avoiding cephalosporin treatment in patients with positive results on skin tests for penicillin. In patients who especially require cephalosporin treatment, we recommend skin tests with cephalosporins before assessing the tolerability of the cephalosporin with a graded challenge.

### Impact of a clinical guideline for prescribing antibiotics to inpatients reporting penicillin or cephalosporin allergy [^0b1ed66b]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Self-reported penicillin allergy infrequently reflects an inability to tolerate penicillins. Inpatients reporting penicillin allergy receive alternative antibiotics that might be broader spectrum, more toxic, or less effective.

Objective

To develop and assess a clinical guideline for the general inpatient provider that directs taking a history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy.

Methods

A guideline was implemented to assist providers with assessing allergy history and prescribing antibiotics for patients with reported penicillin or cephalosporin allergy. The guideline used a standard 2-step graded challenge or test dose. A quasi-experimental study was performed to assess safety, feasibility, and impact on antibiotic use by comparing treatment 21 months before guideline implementation with 12 months after guideline implementation.

Results

Significantly more test doses to β-lactam antibiotics were performed monthly after vs before guideline implementation (median 14.5, interquartile range 13-16.25, vs 2, interquartile range 1-3.25, P < .001). Seven adverse drug reactions occurred during guideline-driven test doses, with no significant difference in rate (3.9% vs 6.1%, P = .44) or severity (P > .5) between periods. Guideline-driven test doses decreased alternative antimicrobial therapy after the test dose, including vancomycin (68.3% vs 37.2%, P < .001), aztreonam (11.5% vs 0.5%, P < .001), aminoglycosides (6.0% vs 1.1%, P = .004), and fluoro quinolones (15.3% vs 3.3%, P < .001).

Conclusion

The implementation of an inpatient antibiotic prescribing guideline for patients with penicillin or cephalosporin allergy was associated with an almost 7-fold increase in the number of test doses to β-lactams without increased adverse drug reactions. Patients assessed with guideline-driven test doses were observed to have significantly decreased alternative antibiotic exposure.
