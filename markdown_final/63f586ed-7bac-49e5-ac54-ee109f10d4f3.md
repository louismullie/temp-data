obesity hypoventillation syndrome

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about obesity hypoventilation syndrome: definition, diagnosis, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, treatment (stable and acute), special populations, perioperative management, monitoring, and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal diagnostic criteria and how they differ from colloquial "triad" descriptions. Then, I should verify the recommended risk-stratified diagnostic approach. Next, I will examine pathophysiology to anchor phenotype-specific therapy. After that, I need to review evidence-based management for stable ambulatory patients and for acute/hospitalized presentations. Then, I should consider perioperative risks and special populations, including sex and pediatric issues. Finally, I will integrate monitoring and prognosis to deliver a concise, evidence-backed summary [^113fd7xB].

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor incorrectly. OHS is defined by the coexistence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²), awake arterial hypercapnia (PaCO2 > 45 mmHg), and exclusion of other causes of hypoventilation such as COPD, neuromuscular disease, or chest wall disorders; while many patients have sleep-disordered breathing, it is not required for the diagnostic criteria per ATS 2019 guidelines [^113fd7xB] [^111zE1HP] [^111xbD2V]. Wait, I initially thought the "triad" mandated sleep-disordered breathing, but I should correct myself: the formal diagnosis rests on obesity plus daytime hypercapnia after ruling out alternative etiologies, though OHS does sit at the severe end of a sleep-disordered breathing spectrum from snoring to OSA to OHS, which explains why SDB is common even if not mandatory [^113enfsX].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic strategy and make sure I triage testing by pretest probability. For low-to-moderate suspicion (< 20%), I need to check a serum bicarbonate; if it is < 27 mmol/L, OHS is unlikely and I can defer ABGs, but if it is ≥ 27 mmol/L, I should confirm with an arterial PaCO2 rather than relying on bicarbonate alone, because bicarbonate is sensitive but not specific and reflects chronic compensation rather than current ventilatory status [^111zE1HP]. For high clinical suspicion, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions with screening surrogates; I should measure PaCO2 directly rather than using bicarbonate or SpO2, to avoid missing hypercapnia in high-risk patients [^114QdVcj] [^113GZf7r] [^111dJYTF].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology, but wait, let me verify that I capture both the mechanical and central control components. OHS is a multifactorial disorder combining "can't breathe" elements (mass loading, reduced compliance, atelectasis, increased work of breathing) and "won't breathe" elements (impaired central drive, blunted chemoreflexes), with emerging evidence for leptin resistance affecting ventilatory control, which helps explain why not all obese patients develop OHS and why phenotypes differ by OSA burden and ventilatory responsiveness [^117LJ3HK] [^113enfsX]. Let me reconsider progression: some patients demonstrate sleep hypoventilation without daytime hypercapnia as a potential prodrome, consistent with a spectrum view that can evolve into frank OHS over time [^113enfsX].

> I need to ensure the clinical picture and consequences are clear. Patients often present with excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, morning headaches, dyspnea, and signs of chronic hypoxemia; many remain minimally symptomatic until acute decompensation, which contributes to underdiagnosis and delayed care in practice [^113enfsX] [^116xfYnd]. Hold on, I should verify the high-acuity risks: OHS predisposes to pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and acute hypercapnic respiratory failure; in ICU series, NIV is usually effective and mortality can be low when promptly instituted, but morbidity and long-term utilization remain significant compared with eucapnic obese comparators [^116NMdcz] [^1168mn9f].

> Now, for stable ambulatory management, I should confirm the first-line modality by OSA phenotype. If OHS coexists with severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30/h), CPAP is recommended as initial therapy rather than NIV because correcting upper airway obstruction is typically sufficient and yields outcomes comparable to bilevel PAP in randomized trials; wait, I should double-check that equivalence signal before concluding, and yes, the Thorax RCT showed similar treatment failure and PaCO2 reduction between CPAP and bilevel PAP over 3 months [^113tKcLs] [^111qoMk7] [^113Yfd8P]. But if OHS presents without severe OSA, I should initiate noninvasive ventilation (bilevel PAP) because central hypoventilation predominates and NIV reduces PaCO2 more than lifestyle measures alone, and it improves sleepiness and some HRQoL indices even over short follow-up [^114MBSq3] [^114tuNXn]. Let me verify feasibility of stepping from NIV to CPAP in selected stable patients with adequate OSA burden; pilot work supports a supervised switch in those with AHI ≥ 15/h and no obstructive lung disease, though individualized titration remains essential [^1177Bf4S] [^111ePDRe].

> I should confirm the centrality of weight loss, as ventilatory mechanics will not normalize otherwise. The ATS recommends weight-loss strategies that achieve sustained 25–30% total body weight reduction to resolve OHS; bariatric surgery is the most effective path for many, though OHS patients may lose modestly less than non-OHS peers yet still achieve clinically meaningful improvements, so I should not discourage surgery solely based on suspected OHS [^1161FNyt] [^113fd7xB] [^112y9bpR] [^113VBrxv] [^116KjF7j] [^117EEd3E]. Wait, let me verify postoperative metrics: elevated bicarbonate preoperatively did not lengthen hospital stay in bariatric cohorts, reinforcing that perioperative risk can be managed effectively in experienced centers [^112y9bpR] [^113VBrxv].

> Next, I should review pharmacologic and adjunctive measures, and I need to check the oxygen caveat carefully. Acetazolamide can lower bicarbonate and modestly enhance CO2 responsiveness in selected patients, though data are limited and use is adjunctive rather than definitive [^111rShhF]. But wait, supplemental oxygen can worsen hypercapnia via reduced ventilatory drive and increased V/Q mismatch; even moderate FiO2 (0.28–0.50) raised PavCO2 and induced acidaemia in crossover studies, and in clinical trials oxygen added to CPAP increased morning confusion, so oxygen should not be used as standalone therapy and must be titrated cautiously with ventilation addressed first [^112TX9GR] [^116QLjcm].

> For acute and hospitalized presentations, I should double-check that immediate NIV is indicated even without a confirmatory sleep study. Yes, in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, NIV should be initiated promptly following COPD-exacerbation protocols, with good success rates in OHS and low ICU mortality when applied early and appropriately monitored [^1174hykS] [^116NMdcz]. I need to ensure continuity across transitions: ATS recommends discharging suspected OHS patients on NIV and continuing it until outpatient diagnostic workup and PAP titration are completed within 2–3 months; an erratum clarifies the conditional wording but not the substance of the recommendation [^112fguHF] [^116U8TzY] [^1124uZbu]. But wait, what about access barriers to NIV initiation at discharge; policy experts suggest accepting validated noninvasive CO2 surrogates and avoiding delays that hinge on formal sleep studies to expedite timely NIV in hypoventilation syndromes [^112B6RkL].

> Perioperative considerations require careful anticipation of ventilatory vulnerability. Patients with unrecognized OHS or overlap syndromes have higher risks of postoperative respiratory failure, prolonged intubation, and ICU use; I should screen preoperatively with bicarbonate as a proxy when ABGs are not available and plan for postoperative PAP, recognizing that CPAP may be insufficient in true hypoventilation phenotypes and bilevel PAP with or without a backup rate may be needed [^117LuSQP] [^111jc8B1]. Hold on, I should verify that elevated bicarbonate alone predicted longer length of stay; actually, in bariatric cohorts LOS was similar regardless of bicarbonate status, though weight loss at one year was slightly lower in those with suspected OHS, reinforcing nuanced risk stratification rather than blanket exclusion from surgery [^112y9bpR] [^113VBrxv].

> I will now examine special populations and sex differences, and I need to be cautious because data remain limited. OHS without severe OSA appears more common in women and may be increasingly recognized after menopause, possibly reflecting changes in upper airway collapsibility and progesterone-driven ventilatory stimulation; diagnosis may be delayed in women, emphasizing the need for a high index of suspicion across phenotypes [^111YEYYW]. Pediatric OHS remains uncommon but is rising with pediatric obesity; I should not confuse OHS with ROHHAD, a distinct pediatric syndrome with hypothalamic dysfunction and autonomic dysregulation requiring different diagnostic and management pathways [^111B4dCq] [^113DqLQJ].

> Next, I should review monitoring and prognosis to close the loop. I need to track PaCO2 and PaO2 (or validated noninvasive surrogates), serum bicarbonate trends, polysomnography parameters including AHI and nocturnal hypoventilation, PAP adherence, and weight trajectory; baseline PaCO2 severity predicts persistent ventilatory failure at 3 months, underscoring the value of early, adequate ventilatory support and aggressive weight management [^113Yfd8P] [^113fd7xB]. Let me verify outcomes: untreated OHS confers high morbidity and mortality, whereas phenotype-appropriate PAP plus weight loss improves gas exchange, quality of life, and survival, particularly when instituted early in the disease course [^116xfYnd] [^113fd7xB].

> Final synthesis, and I should double-check that each element aligns with the best evidence. OHS is defined by obesity with awake hypercapnia after excluding other causes, often embedded in the sleep-disordered breathing spectrum; diagnosis is risk-stratified using bicarbonate screening followed by confirmatory PaCO2 in appropriate patients; management is phenotype-specific with CPAP first-line for those with concomitant severe OSA and NIV prioritized when severe OSA is absent; weight loss of 25–30% is the cornerstone for resolution; oxygen is adjunctive only and may worsen hypercapnia if not paired with adequate ventilation; acute decompensation requires prompt NIV with structured post-discharge titration; and vigilant perioperative planning, attention to sex-specific presentations, and longitudinal monitoring are essential to reduce cardiorespiratory complications and mortality [^113fd7xB] [^113Yfd8P] [^113tKcLs] [^114MBSq3] [^1161FNyt] [^112TX9GR] [^112fguHF].

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is defined by **BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²** [^113fd7xB] with **daytime PaCO₂ > 45 mmHg** and no other cause of hypoventilation [^114QdVcj]. It is driven by **impaired respiratory mechanics** [^1163G7xV], blunted ventilatory drive [^117LJ3HK], and sleep-disordered breathing, especially OSA [^113enfsX]. Diagnosis requires **ABG** to confirm hypercapnia and exclude other causes [^114QdVcj]; **serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mmol/L** can screen when suspicion is low [^111zE1HP].

First-line therapy is **CPAP** for OHS with severe OSA [^113tKcLs] [^113Yfd8P]; use **NIV** if CPAP fails or OSA is absent [^111qoMk7] [^115coDkd]. Weight loss, including bariatric surgery, is essential for long-term control [^113fd7xB] [^1161FNyt]. Untreated OHS increases risks of pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and mortality, so early recognition and treatment are critical [^115TPoje] [^116xfYnd].

---

## Pathophysiology

OHS arises from **impaired respiratory mechanics**, whereby obesity reduces chest wall compliance, increases the work of breathing, and decreases functional residual capacity, leading to hypoventilation [^1163G7xV]. A blunted ventilatory drive with reduced sensitivity to hypercapnia and hypoxemia contributes to chronic hypoventilation [^117LJ3HK]. Most patients with OHS have OSA, which causes intermittent hypoxemia and hypercapnia that further impair ventilatory control [^1173tRFa] [^113enfsX].

---

## Clinical presentation

Patients with OHS typically present with:

- **Daytime hypercapnia**: PaCO₂ > 45 mmHg [^113fd7xB].

- **Hypoxemia**: Reduced arterial oxygen saturation [^116xfYnd].

- **Sleep-disordered breathing**: Frequent apneas and hypopneas during sleep [^111CCazG].

- **Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale**: Common complications due to chronic hypoxemia and hypercapnia [^115TPoje].

---

## Diagnostic criteria

The diagnosis of OHS requires:

- **Obesity**: BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² [^111xbD2V].

- **Daytime hypercapnia**: PaCO₂ > 45 mmHg [^114QdVcj].

- **Exclusion of other causes**: No significant lung disease, neuromuscular disorders, or metabolic conditions causing hypoventilation [^113fd7xB].

- **Sleep-disordered breathing**: Typically present, confirmed by polysomnography [^111CCazG].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnostic evaluation includes **arterial blood gas** testing, which is essential to confirm hypercapnia and exclude other causes [^114QdVcj]. Serum bicarbonate levels ≥ **27 mmol/L** suggest chronic hypercapnia and can be used as a screening tool [^111zE1HP]. Polysomnography confirms **sleep-disordered breathing** and helps distinguish OHS from other sleep-related breathing disorders [^113fd7xB].

---

## Management strategies

### Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy

Within positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy, **continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)** is first-line for stable ambulatory patients with OHS and severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index ≥ 30 events/hour) [^113tKcLs] [^113Yfd8P]. Noninvasive ventilation (**NIV**) is recommended for patients who fail CPAP therapy or do not have severe OSA [^111qoMk7] [^114MBSq3].

---

### Weight loss interventions

Weight loss interventions include **lifestyle modifications** (diet, exercise, and behavioral therapy) to achieve sustained weight loss [^113fd7xB] and **bariatric surgery**, considered for patients with severe obesity and OHS, which leads to significant improvements in respiratory function and quality of life [^113fd7xB] [^1161FNyt] [^113VBrxv].

---

### Pharmacological management

Pharmacological management may include **acetazolamide** to stimulate ventilation and reduce hypercapnia in selected patients [^111rShhF].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Untreated OHS is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including:

- **Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale**: Due to chronic hypoxemia and hypercapnia [^115TPoje].

- **Cardiovascular disease**: Increased risk of hypertension, heart failure, and arrhythmias [^115TPoje].

- **Respiratory failure**: Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring intensive care [^113mAYkP].

- **Increased mortality**: Higher mortality rates compared to obese individuals without OHS [^116xfYnd].

---

## Preventive measures and lifestyle modifications

Preventive measures and lifestyle modifications center on **weight management** through regular physical activity, dietary modifications, and behavioral therapy to prevent obesity and OHS [^113fd7xB] [^115TPoje]. Early screening involves regular monitoring of individuals with obesity for signs of **hypoventilation** and **sleep-disordered breathing** [^113fd7xB] [^111dJYTF]. Patient education focuses on awareness of **OHS symptoms and complications** to encourage early medical intervention [^117DgYHJ].

---

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is a serious condition characterized by obesity, chronic hypercapnia, and sleep-disordered breathing. Early diagnosis and management, including **positive airway pressure therapy** and **weight loss interventions**, are essential to improve patient outcomes and reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Respiratory mechanics and ventilatory control in overlap syndrome and obesity hypoventilation [^113enfsX]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome occurs at the end of the spectrum of sleep-disordered breathing, which starts with simple snoring and evolves into OSA, eventually in association with COPD. OHS is commonly defined as a combination of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) and awake arterial hypercapnia (PaCO₂ > 45 mmHg) in the absence of other known causes of hypoventilation. Patients are characterized by a spectrum of findings: episodes of obstruction, hypoventilation, or sustained obstructive hypoventilation due to partial upper airway obstruction.

The etiology of OHS is not fully understood and appears to be almost certainly multifactorial. It remains unclear why some obese patients develop OHS, while others do not. Patients may complain of fatigue or daytime sleepiness, but many remain asymptomatic with no sleep-related complaints. Sleep hypoventilation alone does not define OHS unless daytime hypercapnia is also present. It is hypothesized that obese patients with hypoventilation during sleep without awake hypercapnia have a "prodromal" form of OHS and will later develop chronic hypercapnia.

Some authors suggest that OHS is a mixed disorder of "can't breathe" (inability to overcome impediments to breathing resulting from derangements in lung function, performance of the respiratory muscles, and/or the mass loading effect of truncal obesity) and "won't breathe" (decreased ventilatory drive disorder). Abnormal load responsiveness, ventilatory muscle dysfunction, increased respiratory work and CO₂ production, and impaired central respiratory drive are potential contributors to OHS.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, more specifically with respect to blood gas analysis, ATS 2019 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of serum bicarbonate levels to decide when to measure PaCO2 in patients with a low-to-moderate probability (< 20%) of having OHS. Consider measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate levels ≥ 27 mmol/L to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of OHS. Avoid measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate levels < 27 mmol/L, as the diagnosis of OHS is very unlikely in these patients.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and postsurgical outcomes in a bariatric surgery cohort [^112y9bpR]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

- **Study flow and general characteristics**: As shown in Fig. 2, the mean length of hospital stay (LOS) was very similar for patients with and without elevated bicarbonate and suspected OHS (1.50 vs. 1.49 days, P = 0.98). The LOS data were non-normally distributed, but results were similar after log transformation (not shown) or when comparing the fraction of patients whose LOS was greater than 1 day (36% OHS vs. 38% non-OHS, P = 0.88).

- **Length of hospital stay**: As illustrated in Fig. 3, the mean percent weight loss at 1 year was 21.5% (95% CI 19.25 to 23.7; P < 0.001) in suspected OHS patients compared with 25.7% (95% CI 24.3 to 27.0; P < 0.001) in non-elevated bicarbonate patients. This indicates that mean weight loss was 4.2% (95% CI 1.6 to 6.8) less in suspected OHS vs. non-OHS patients, which was statistically significant (P = 0.002). Results were similar when adjusting for baseline covariates, including age, in a multivariable regression analysis (mean weight loss 3.3% less in suspected OHS vs. non-OHS patients, P = 0.03). Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis of 43 elevated bicarbonate cases who were age-matched with controls in a 1:3 ratio (mean [SD] age 45 vs. 45 years) confirmed the robustness of these results (mean weight loss 4% less in OHS vs. non-OHS patients, P = 0.005).

- **Predictors and robust findings**: In our cohort, age was the only significant predictor of elevated bicarbonate and suspected OHS (OR per 10-year change = 1.44, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.07, P = 0.04).

### Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD): A case with additional features and review of the literature [^113DqLQJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

A rare syndrome of rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) has been recently described. We report the first patient with this syndrome in Southeast Asia and review reported cases at the time of writing. Our patient was in good health with normal development until the age of 2. He then developed hyperphagic obesity, hypersomnolence, seizures, alveolar hypoventilation, central hypothyroidism, sodium and water dysregulation, gastrointestinal dysmotility, strabismus, disordered temperature, irregular heart rate, altered sweating, delayed puberty, mental retardation, and respiratory tract infections. The cardiomyopathy with heart failure and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurotransmitter analysis present in our patient have not been reported previously. Tumors of the sympathetic nervous system are known to be associated with this syndrome but had not been found in our patient at the time of reporting. We highlight the difficulty of achieving the diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome and its overlap with other well-established disease entities. The mortality and morbidity resulting from the high incidence of cardiorespiratory arrest may be prevented by early ventilatory support.

### Hypercapnic respiratory failure in obesity-hypoventilation syndrome: CO₂ response and acetazolamide treatment effects [^111rShhF]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

In obesity-hypoventilation syndrome patients mechanically ventilated for hypercapnic respiratory failure, we investigated the relationship between CO₂ response, body mass index, and plasma bicarbonate concentration, and the effect of acetazolamide on bicarbonate concentration and CO₂ response.

- **Methods**: CO₂ response tests and arterial blood gas analysis were performed in 25 patients ready for a spontaneous breathing test, and repeated in a subgroup of 8 patients after acetazolamide treatment. The CO₂ response test was measured as (1) hypercapnic drive response (the ratio of the change in airway occlusion pressure 0.1 seconds after the start of inspiratory flow to the change in P(aCO₂), and (2) hypercapnic ventilatory response (the ratio of the change in minute volume to the change in P(aCO₂)).

- **Results**: We did not find a significant relationship between CO₂ response and body mass index. Patients with higher bicarbonate concentration had a more blunted CO₂ response. Grouping the patients according to the first, second, and third tertiles of the bicarbonate concentration, the hypercapnic drive response was 0.32 ± 0.17 cm H₂O/mm Hg, 0.22 ± 0.15 cm H₂O/mm Hg, and 0.10 ± 0.06 cm H₂O/mm Hg, respectively (P = 0.01), and hypercapnic ventilatory response was 0.46 ± 0.23 L/min/mm Hg, 0.48 ± 0.36 L/min/mm Hg, and 0.22 ± 0.16 L/min/mm Hg, respectively (P = 0.04). After acetazolamide treatment, bicarbonate concentration was reduced by 8.4 ± 3.0 mmol/L (P = 0.01), and CO₂ response was shifted to the left, with an increase in hypercapnic drive response by 0.14 ± 0.16 cm H₂O/mm Hg (P = 0.02).

### Obstructive sleep apnea in a severely obese child with combined central sleep apnea and sleep-related hypoventilation disorder caused by a medullary tumor [^113VscoV]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

A medullary tumor is a relatively rare disease that causes severe and complicated respiratory disorders, including sleep-related breathing disorders, due to dysregulation of respiratory control. A severely obese 12-year-old male was admitted to our hospital for worsening dyspnea and received a diagnosis of type II respiratory failure. Although obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and/or obesity hypoventilation syndrome were suspected, a polysomnogram obtained during a nap (nap study) revealed central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoventilation disorder (SRHD) in addition to OSA. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass in the medulla oblongata.

The patient received a diagnosis of CSA/SRHD caused by a medullary tumor, and with OSA. A partial brainstem tumor resection was performed. Noninvasive positive airway pressure therapy was initiated and continued after surgery. However, the patient died unexpectedly, 20 months after surgery. When children with sleep problems caused by OSA present with atypical symptoms of OSA, a neurological examination and polysomnography should be conducted to detect CSA and SRHD.

### A novel case of central hypoventilation syndrome or just heavy breathing [^111B4dCq]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

With the growing prevalence of obesity in the pediatric population, reports of its severe complications are increasing. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is an uncommon disorder in children characterized by altered respiratory mechanics, sleep-disordered breathing, and impaired ventilatory responses, leading to persistent hypercapnia. **Presentation**: The presentation is varied, and children may remain relatively asymptomatic until challenged by a respiratory infection, at which point they may present with acute respiratory failure.

- **Genetic testing insights**: With the increasing use of genetic testing in pediatric patients, our understanding of potential contributors to hypoventilation syndromes is expanding. Although mutations in the paired-like homeobox 2B gene are known to cause congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, other genes may also contribute to hypoventilation phenotypes. We report one of the youngest patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome in pediatrics, proposing a congenital predisposition for central hypoventilation derived from a deletion in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene.

### A randomised controlled trial of CPAP versus non-invasive ventilation for initial treatment of obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^113Yfd8P]. Thorax (2017). High credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is the most common indication for home ventilation; however, the optimal therapy remains unclear, particularly for severe disease. We compared Bi-level and continuous positive airway pressure (Bi-level PAP; CPAP) for the treatment of severe OHS.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, parallel, double-blind trial for the initial treatment of OHS, with participants randomized to nocturnal Bi-level PAP or CPAP for 3 months. The primary outcome was the frequency of treatment failure (hospital admission, persistent ventilatory failure, or non-adherence); secondary outcomes included health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and sleepiness.

- **Results**: Sixty participants were randomized; 57 completed follow-up and were included in the analysis (mean age 53 years, body mass index 55 kg/m², PaCO₂ 60 mmHg). There was no difference in treatment failure between groups (Bi-level PAP, 14.8% vs. CPAP, 13.3%, p = 0.87). Treatment adherence and wake PaCO₂ were similar after 3 months (5.3 hours/night Bi-level PAP, 5.0 hours/night CPAP, p = 0.62; PaCO₂ 44.2 and 45.9 mmHg, respectively, p = 0.60). Between-group differences in improvement in sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale 0.3 [95% CI -2.8, 3.4], p = 0.86) and HRQoL (Short Form [SF]36-SF6d 0.025 [95% CI -0.039, 0.088], p = 0.45) were not significant. Baseline severity of ventilatory failure (PaCO₂) was the only significant predictor of persistent ventilatory failure at 3 months (OR 2.3, p = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: In newly diagnosed severe OHS, Bi-level PAP and CPAP resulted in similar improvements.

### Switch of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a pilot study [^1177Bf4S]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). High credibility.

This prospective open trial, testing the feasibility of a protocol switching NIV to CPAP in stable patients in real-life conditions, suggests the possibility of this switch in patients suffering from obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 15/h and without pulmonary obstructive disease. In these conditions, we reported no significant treatment effect differences between before and after the switch to CPAP in diurnal and nocturnal alveolar gas exchange, mean AHI, mean compliance, quality of sleep, and quality of life. In addition, 80% of patients preferred CPAP over NIV.

The pathophysiology of OHS is complex and multifactorial, eventually leading to chronic, diurnal hypercapnia resulting from an imbalance between apnea and inter-apnea periods and deficiency of the compensatory mechanisms to unload the carbon dioxide in excess. This suggests the need to determine different phenotypes of OHS and, therefore, adapt therapeutic intervention according to the phenotype. Therefore, we have chosen in this trial to exclude from the study patients with an AHI < 15/h, speculating that the CPAP mechanism to treat hypoventilation was mostly due to the correction of apneas and hypopneas. Indeed, if CPAP is not intrinsically the most efficient treatment of hypoventilation, it is still effective on most of the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to OHS by decreasing upper airways resistance, increasing central response to hypercapnia and hypoxemia, increasing lung volumes, treating atelectasis, and decreasing intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). This is the reason why CPAP is efficient in most patients with OHS associated with…

### Switch of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a pilot study [^114neqf4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

To eliminate the persistent effect of NIV, we introduced a protocol that included a withdrawal from NIV for seven nights before starting CPAP, and reevaluated patients more than a month after starting CPAP. It is possible that not all persistent effects attributable to NIV were eliminated by this withdrawal. Ideally, the protocol would have randomized patients into three groups: one group continuing NIV, one group switching to CPAP, and one group stopping ventilation. However, this protocol did not seem ethical for patients withdrawn from ventilation, considering that a higher mortality rate has been reported in untreated patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS).

In our study, 12 out of 15 patients were diagnosed with OHS and started on NIV following an episode of exacerbation. This raises the question of whether the diagnosis of OHS was made in excess in patients with normocapnic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) undergoing an exacerbation. However, this assertion is contradicted by the fact that nine out of the 12 patients diagnosed with OHS following an exacerbation had high bicarbonates levels (HCO3- > 28 mmol/l), supporting chronic hypercapnia.

When measuring the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), we used the built-in software available in the NIV and CPAP devices. Although the accuracy of these systems is debatable, recent studies favor the reliability of these built-in softwares.

### CPAP in the perioperative setting: Evidence of support [^117LuSQP]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

In the context of evaluating surgical patients with OSA who may be at increased risk, it remains unclear which subgroups of patients with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are more likely to benefit from positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. Patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, overlap syndrome, severe OSA (AHI > 30), and a high arousal threshold accompanied by severe hypoxemia might gain advantage from preoperative PAP therapy.

Patients with OSA and unrecognized obesity hypoventilation syndrome or overlap syndrome (COPD and OSA) exhibit higher risks of postoperative respiratory failure, heart failure, prolonged intubation, and extended ICU and hospital stays compared to those with non-hypercapnic OSA. Hypercapnia serves as a significant risk modifier. While many patients usually do not undergo arterial blood gas measurements, elevated serum bicarbonate levels in venous blood can act as a proxy for hypercapnia, aiding in the identification of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Recognizing this patient group is crucial, as CPAP use alone might be inadequate; alternative advanced PAP therapies, such as bilevel PAP with or without a backup rate, might be necessary.

Recent findings indicate that 26% of patients without OSA (preoperative AHI < 15) presented respiratory effort-related arousals that may have developed into apneas or hypopneas within the first 1 to 3 days post-surgery, possibly due to increased upper airway collapsibility. This increased collapsibility is likely linked to rostral fluid shifts, although further details were truncated.

### Acute respiratory failure in obesity-hypoventilation syndrome managed in the ICU [^116NMdcz]. Respiratory Care (2019). Low credibility.

Obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is defined as the combination of obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m²) and daytime arterial hypercapnia (P aCO2 > 45 mm Hg) in the absence of other causes of hypoventilation and can lead to acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in the ICU. Our objective was to describe the ventilatory management and outcomes of subjects with OHS admitted to the ICU for this condition.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively built a cohort of subjects with OHS admitted for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in four ICUs at the university teaching hospital in Lyon, France, between 2013 and 2017. The main endpoint was the rate of success of noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Secondary endpoints were survival from OHS diagnosis to the last follow-up and risk factors for ICU admission and long-term survival.

- **Results**: One hundred fifteen subjects with OHS were included. Thirty-seven subjects (32.1%) were admitted to the ICU for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Congestive heart failure was the leading cause of this condition (54%). At ICU admission, pH before NIV use was median (range) 7.26 (7.22–7.31) and P aCO2 was 70 (61–76) mm Hg. NIV was used as first-line ventilatory support in 36 subjects (97.2%) and was successful in 33 subjects (91.7%). ICU mortality was low (2.7%). The subjects admitted to the ICU were significantly older and had a lower FEV1 and vital capacity at the time of an OHS diagnosis. The difference in the restricted mean survival time was 663 days in favor of subjects not admitted to the ICU.

### Optimal NIV Medicare access promotion: Patients with hypoventilation syndromes: A technical expert panel report from the American College of Chest Physicians, the American Association for Respiratory Care, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and the American Thoracic Society [^112B6RkL]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

The existing coverage criteria for home noninvasive ventilation (NIV) do not recognize the diversity of hypoventilation syndromes and advances in technologies. This document summarizes the work of the hypoventilation syndromes technical expert panel working group.

- **Coverage barriers**: The most pressing coverage barriers identified were: (1) overreliance on arterial blood gases (particularly during sleep); (2) need to perform testing on prescribed oxygen; (3) requiring a sleep study to rule out OSA as the cause of sustained hypoxemia; (4) need for spirometry; (5) need to show bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) without a backup rate failure to qualify for BPAP spontaneous/timed; and (6) qualifying hospitalized patients for home NIV therapy at the time of discharge.

- **Evidence support**: Critical evidence support for changes to policies includes randomized controlled trial evidence and clinical practice guidelines.

To decrease morbidity and mortality by achieving timely access to NIV for patients with hypoventilation, particularly those with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, we make the following key suggestions: (1) given the significant technological advances, we advise acceptance of surrogate noninvasive end-tidal and transcutaneous Pco2 and venous blood gases in lieu of arterial blood gases; (2) not requiring Pco2 measures while on prescribed oxygen; (3) not requiring a sleep study to avoid delays in care in patients being discharged from the hospital; (4) remove spirometry as a requirement; and (5) not requiring BPAP without a backup rate failure to approve BPAP spontaneous/timed.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112fguHF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding respiratory support for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, specifically with respect to noninvasive ventilation, the ATS 2019 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of noninvasive ventilation before hospital discharge in hospitalized patients with respiratory failure suspected of having OHS. This should be continued until they undergo outpatient workup and titration of positive airway pressure therapy in the sleep laboratory, ideally within the first three months after hospital discharge.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: A state-of-the-art review [^116xfYnd]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is defined as the triad of obesity, daytime hypoventilation, and sleep-disordered breathing in the absence of an alternative neuromuscular, mechanical, or metabolic explanation for hypoventilation. During the last three decades, the prevalence of extreme obesity has markedly increased in the United States and other countries. With such a global epidemic of obesity, the prevalence of OHS is bound to increase. Patients with OHS have a lower quality of life, with increased healthcare expenses, and are at higher risk of developing pulmonary hypertension and early mortality compared to eucapnic patients with sleep-disordered breathing.

OHS often remains undiagnosed until late in the course of the disease. Early recognition is important, as these patients have significant morbidity and mortality. Effective treatment can lead to significant improvement in patient outcomes, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis. This review will include disease definition and epidemiology, clinical characteristics of the syndrome, pathophysiology, and morbidity and mortality associated with it. Lastly, treatment modalities will be discussed in detail.

### Recent advances in obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^115KWzs9]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) consists of a combination of obesity and chronic hypercapnia accompanied by sleep-disordered breathing. During the last three decades, the prevalence of extreme obesity has markedly increased in the United States and other countries. With a global epidemic of obesity, the prevalence of OHS is bound to increase. Patients with OHS experience a lower quality of life with increased health care expenses and are at a higher risk for the development of pulmonary hypertension and early mortality compared to eucapnic patients with sleep-disordered breathing. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome, it is often unrecognized, and treatment is frequently delayed. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion since early recognition and treatment reduce the high burden of morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome.

In this review, we discuss the definition and clinical presentation of OHS and provide a summary of its prevalence. We also review the understanding of the pathophysiology and discuss recent advances in therapeutic options.

### Using intra-breath oscillometry in obesity hypoventilation syndrome to detect tidal expiratory flow limitation: A potential marker to optimize CPAP therapy [^117VTj5s]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

OHS, as a leading cause of chronic respiratory failure, requires a clear understanding of its pathophysiology and the ways to optimize treatment. Our results demonstrate that intra-breath oscillometry can provide important information about position-related tEFL in patients with OHS and may aid in optimizing CPAP therapy.

### Non-invasive ventilation in obesity hypoventilation syndrome without severe obstructive sleep apnoea [^114MBSq3]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an effective form of treatment in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) who have concomitant severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). However, there is a paucity of evidence on the efficacy of NIV in patients with OHS without severe OSA. We performed a multicentre randomised clinical trial to determine the comparative efficacy of NIV versus lifestyle modification (control group) using daytime arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) as the main outcome measure.

- **Methods**: Between May 2009 and December 2014, we sequentially screened patients with OHS without severe OSA. Participants were randomised to NIV versus lifestyle modification and were followed for 2 months. Arterial blood gas parameters, clinical symptoms, health-related quality of life assessments, polysomnography, spirometry, 6-minute walk distance test, blood pressure measurements, and healthcare resource utilisation were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using intention-to-treat analysis.

- **Results**: A total of 365 patients were screened, of whom 58 were excluded. Severe OSA was present in 221, and the remaining 86 patients without severe OSA were randomised. NIV led to a significantly larger improvement in PaCO2 of -6 (95% CI -7.7 to -4.2) mmHg versus -2.8 (95% CI -4.3 to -1.3) mmHg (p < 0.001) and serum bicarbonate of -3.4 (95% CI -4.5 to -2.3) versus -1 (95% CI -1.7 to -0.2) mmol/L (p < 0.001). PaCO2 change adjusted for NIV compliance did not further improve the inter-group statistical significance. Sleepiness and some health-related quality of life aspects improved with NIV.

### Pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a case series [^114TbsPS]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is caused by complex interactions between multiple pathological processes, including diminished respiratory drive and sleep-related breathing alterations, leading to structural and functional respiratory impairment, and ultimately, pulmonary hypertension. Because pulmonary hypertension is closely associated with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, thoroughly evaluating its etiology is essential, and individualized treatments must be considered.

We describe two patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome exhibiting severe pulmonary hypertension with pulmonary vascular resistance exceeding 5 Wood units. Both were classified as Group 1 pulmonary hypertension, that is, pulmonary arterial hypertension. Initially admitted to our hospital complaining of dyspnea, both patients commenced pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies in addition to positive airway pressure therapy and diuretics, improving their hemodynamic status, dyspnea, and exercise capacity, and finally enabling their discharge.

These findings suggest that pulmonary arterial hypertension can coexist with obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and pulmonary arterial hypertension therapies, introduced with careful consideration, may provide substantial benefits for select patients.

### Non-invasive ventilation in obesity hypoventilation syndrome without severe obstructive sleep apnoea [^114tuNXn]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Several studies have reported an improvement in various measures of respiratory function in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) treated with non-invasive ventilation (NIV), although these findings are not universal. In contrast to our recently published parallel randomized clinical trial that included only patients with OHS with severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), the present study did not observe a significant improvement in spirometry and 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) tests in patients treated with NIV. Patients with OHS and severe OSA were more obese, and it is plausible that NIV was more effective in reducing microatelectasis leading to improvement in lung volume. On the other hand, patients with OHS without severe OSA have a higher burden of cardiovascular morbidity, which may partly explain the lack of improvement in 6-MWD with NIV therapy.

Although, by design, we excluded patients with severe OSA, some degree of OSA was present in our patients (mean apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) = 14), and NIV significantly reduced the AHI and improved other polysomnographic parameters of sleep-disordered breathing, such as arousal index, oxygen desaturation index, and total sleep time (TST) with SaO2 < 90% compared with the control group. This finding aligns with similar observations in prior studies that predominantly included patients with OHS with severe OSA, suggesting a similar improvement in central hypoventilation in both OHS phenotypes. However, in contrast to prior studies, we did not find any improvement in the percentage of sleep stages, indicating that the improvement in sleep quality with NIV may be dependent on the presence of severe OSA.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and postsurgical outcomes in a bariatric surgery cohort [^117EEd3E]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The length of postoperative hospital stay in our group of patients undergoing bariatric surgery did not vary significantly based on preoperative serum bicarbonate levels, adding insight into the role of this surrogate marker for potential OHS. Furthermore, we observed a small but significant influence of elevated bicarbonate level on weight loss at 1 year. As a result, our findings did not support the notion that obesity hypoventilation syndrome (suspected based on surrogate measurements) led to deleterious perioperative consequences for those afflicted but did impact the longer-term weight loss results to some extent.

The mechanisms underlying potential poor outcomes in OHS are unclear. A number of studies have been conducted in this context. Some studies have suggested evidence of pulmonary hypertension, which could clearly contribute to worsened cardiovascular outcomes as well as exercise impairment. While interventions such as noninvasive ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) have been shown to reduce hypoventilation and prevent morbidity from long-term hospitalizations, underdiagnosis remains a large barrier to providing this treatment.

Our study may be especially notable as the ATS Clinical Practice Guideline on OHS highlights bariatric surgery as one of the most viable options for the degree of sustained weight loss (20–35% total weight loss) that is needed to improve hypoventilation. In our study, patients with suspected OHS based on elevated serum bicarbonate exhibited a statistically significant smaller percent total body weight compared to others.

### Cyclophosphamide for rapid-onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation syndrome [^111VCmeX]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with rapid-onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, autonomic dysregulation, and neural crest tumor syndrome have poor long-term outcomes. We report a patient who was treated successfully with high-dose cyclophosphamide immunoablation. This experience offers a novel therapeutic approach and an indirect insight into the underlying pathogenesis of this syndrome.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: current theories of pathogenesis [^117LJ3HK]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to summarize recent primary publications and discuss the impact these findings have on the understanding of the development of hypoventilation in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), also known as Pickwickian syndrome.

Recent findings indicate that due to the significant morbidity and mortality associated with OHS, evidence is building for pre-OHS intermediate states that can be identified earlier and treated sooner with the goal of modifying the course of the disease. While findings of alterations in respiratory mechanics with obesity remain unchanged, elevated metabolism and CO2 production may be instrumental in OHS-related hypercapnia. Ongoing positive airway pressure trials continue to demonstrate that the correction of nocturnal obstructive sleep apnea and hypoventilation improves diurnal respiratory physiology, metabolic profiles, quality of life, and morbidity/mortality. The central nervous system effects of leptin on respiratory mechanics and chemoreceptor sensitivity are becoming better understood; however, characterization remains incomplete.

OHS is a complex multiorgan system disease process that appears to be driven by adaptive changes in respiratory physiology and compensatory changes in metabolic processes, both of which are ultimately counterproductive. The diurnal hypercapnia and hypoxia induce pathologic effects that further worsen sleep-related breathing, resulting in a slowly progressive worsening of the disease. In addition, leptin resistance in obesity and OHS likely contributes to the blunting of ventilatory drive and inadequate chemoreceptor response.

### Non-invasive ventilation in obesity hypoventilation syndrome without severe obstructive sleep apnoea [^115coDkd]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is an effective form of treatment in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) who have concomitant severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).

### Non-invasive ventilation in obesity hypoventilation syndrome without severe obstructive sleep apnoea [^1173tRFa]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is characterized by obesity and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in the absence of neuromuscular, metabolic, lung, or chest wall diseases. Although the majority of patients with OHS have concomitant severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), nocturnal hypoventilation may be the only respiratory sleep disorder present. In fact, in the largest clinical trial of OHS, we recently reported that 73% had severe OSA.

The prevalence of OHS in the general population is unknown, but it has been estimated to be 0.3–0.4%. Given the global obesity epidemic, the prevalence of OHS may be on the rise. It is important for clinicians to promptly diagnose and adequately treat OHS because, when left untreated, it is associated with significantly worse cardiovascular morbidity, mortality, and healthcare resource utilization compared with eucapnic OSA and eucapnic obese patients.

The etiology of daytime hypercapnia in OHS is complex and not fully understood, but the progressive accumulation of CO2 caused by repetitive obstructive events (particularly with short inter-event periods and non-apnoeic hypoventilation, mainly rapid eye movement sleep hypoventilation) seems to be an important contributor. Conceptually, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is not an effective treatment for patients with OHS who are mostly hypoventilators without significant OSA. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), most commonly in the form of bilevel positive airway pressure, can treat both apnoeic and non-apnoeic nocturnal hypoventilation in this phenotype of patients.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111xbD2V]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this guideline is to optimize the evaluation and management of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS).

- **Methods**: A multidisciplinary panel identified and prioritized five clinical questions. The panel performed systematic reviews of available studies (up to July 2018) and followed the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation evidence-to-decision framework to develop recommendations. All panel members discussed and approved the recommendations.

- **Recommendations**: After considering the overall very low quality of the evidence, the panel made five conditional recommendations. We suggest that:
	1. Clinicians use a serum bicarbonate level < 27 mmol/L to exclude the diagnosis of OHS in obese patients with sleep-disordered breathing when the suspicion for OHS is not very high (< 20%) but measure arterial blood gases in patients strongly suspected of having OHS.
	2. Stable ambulatory patients with OHS receive positive airway pressure (PAP).
	3. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) rather than noninvasive ventilation be offered as the first-line treatment to stable ambulatory patients with OHS and coexistent severe obstructive sleep apnea.
	4. Patients hospitalized with respiratory failure and suspected of having OHS be discharged with noninvasive ventilation until they undergo outpatient diagnostic procedures and PAP titration in the sleep laboratory (ideally within 2–3 months).
	5. Patients with OHS use weight-loss interventions that produce sustained weight loss of 25% to 30% of body weight to achieve resolution of OHS.

### Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation syndrome and celiac disease in a 13-year-old girl: Further evidence for autoimmunity [^113jez7Q]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) syndrome is a rare and potentially lethal disorder. Its etiology remains unclear, but both paraneoplastic syndrome and autoimmunity secondary to neural crest tumors have been considered, even in patients without any detectable tumor due to their tendency for spontaneous remission. We present a case of a 13-year-old girl with ROHHAD syndrome and celiac disease, which may suggest further evidence for an immune-mediated etiology in the pathogenesis of ROHHAD syndrome.

### Rohhad syndrome - A still unrecognized cause of childhood obesity: Report of three cases [^116kqbgQ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare, potentially fatal pediatric syndrome. We present three cases of ROHHAD syndrome in Greece. The primary and earliest symptom was excessive and rapid weight gain at the ages of 5, 2, and 3 years. Years after the onset of obesity, patients developed hypothalamic dysfunction with various endocrinological abnormalities at 9, 8, and 6.8 years, respectively. They also experienced autonomic dysregulation, and eventually, alveolar hypoventilation at 14.6, 8, and 7.8 years, respectively, leading to the diagnosis of ROHHAD syndrome.

The rarity of the syndrome, variable symptom presentation, and lack of specific diagnostic tests might explain why no previous cases have been reported from our country. The rapid onset of obesity was underestimated, resulting in misdiagnoses with other more common obesity syndromes. Therefore, we propose a questionnaire to assist physicians in identifying patients with ROHHAD syndrome.

### Switch of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a pilot study [^111ePDRe]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Obesity is a major worldwide public health issue. The main respiratory complication stemming from obesity is obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Most of the OHS patients diagnosed during an exacerbation are treated with noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Up until the time of writing, no prospective study has demonstrated in real-life conditions the feasibility of a systematic, protocoled switch of NIV to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), once stability is achieved.

- **Methods**: In this prospective study, we included stable patients with OHS, with moderate to severe concomitant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and without obstructive pulmonary disease, who had been undergoing NIV for more than two months. The following measurements were performed, first with NIV and then after the switch to CPAP: diurnal arterial blood gas measurements; nocturnal oximetry and capnometry; mean compliance and AHI; measures of quality of life and quality of sleep.

- **Results**: Twenty-two of thirty patients accepted to participate in the study, and fifteen of twenty-two patients completed the study. There were no significant differences for pooled data in diurnal alveolar blood gases, nocturnal capnometry (p = 0.534), nocturnal oximetry (p = 0.218), mean compliance (p = 0.766), mean AHI (p = 0.334), quality of life, or quality of sleep. Eighty percent of the patients treated in this study favored CPAP over NIV.

- **Conclusion**: This pilot study showed in real-life conditions the possibility of a systematic switch of NIV to CPAP in most stable patients with OHS, with similar efficacy on diurnal and nocturnal alveolar gas exchange, quality of life, and quality of sleep.

### Assessment and management of patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^117DgYHJ]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2008). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is characterized by obesity, daytime hypercapnia, and sleep-disordered breathing in the absence of significant lung or respiratory muscle disease. Compared with eucapnic morbidly obese patients and eucapnic patients with sleep-disordered breathing, patients with OHS have increased health care expenses and are at a higher risk of developing serious cardiovascular disease, leading to early mortality. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome, diagnosis and institution of effective treatment occur late in the course of the syndrome. Given that the prevalence of extreme obesity has increased considerably, it is likely that clinicians will encounter patients with OHS in their clinical practice. Therefore, maintaining a high index of suspicion can lead to early recognition and treatment, reducing the high burden of morbidity, mortality, and related health care expenditure associated with undiagnosed and untreated OHS.

In this review, we define the clinical characteristics of the syndrome and review the pathophysiology, morbidity, and mortality associated with it. Last, we discuss the currently available treatment modalities.

### Temporal trends of cardiac and respiratory responses to ventilatory challenges in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome [^114HrShv]. Pediatric Research (2004). Low credibility.

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) patients exhibit respiratory deficits in response to ventilatory challenges, diminished breathing drive during sleep, and a reduction in respiratory-related heart rate variation, while at least partially preserving peripheral chemoreception. We hypothesized that the integration of afferent activity with respiratory motor output is deficient in CCHS, rather than chemoreceptor failure. Examination of trends in heart and breathing rates, along with variabilities following ventilatory challenges, may clarify the deficient mechanisms.

Twelve children with CCHS and 12 age- and gender-matched control cases were subjected to hyperoxic hypercapnic, poikylocapnic hypoxic, and hyperoxic challenges while supine. Heart and respiratory rates and variabilities during 60-second baseline and 120-second challenge periods were assessed. Hypoxia and hypercapnia enhanced the breathing rate in control subjects; in CCHS cases, the increase differed during hypercapnia and did not occur in response to hypoxia. Hyperoxia showed initial transient patterns in breathing rate that differed between groups. A heart rate increase in response to hypoxia and a late decline in response to hyperoxia were muted in CCHS patients. In hypercapnia, heart rate followed similar rising patterns in both groups. Overall, CCHS heart rate variability was lower during baseline and challenge periods, primarily due to diminished respiratory-related variation, especially during hypercapnia. No heart rate variability group differences emerged in hypoxia, and only a late increase for CCHS cases developed in hyperoxia.

### The effect of supplemental oxygen in obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^116QLjcm]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Low flow supplemental oxygen is commonly prescribed to patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). However, there is a paucity of data regarding its efficacy and safety. The objective of this study was to assess the medium-term treatment efficacy of adding supplemental oxygen therapy to commonly prescribed treatment modalities in OHS.

- **Methods**: In this post hoc analysis of a previous randomized controlled trial, 302 sequentially screened OHS patients were randomly assigned to noninvasive ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, or lifestyle modification. Outcomes at two months included arterial blood gases, symptoms, quality of life, blood pressure, polysomnography, spirometry, 6-minute walk distance, and hospital resource utilization. Statistical analysis comparing patients with and without oxygen therapy in the three treatment groups was performed using an intention-to-treat analysis.

- **Results**: In the noninvasive ventilation group, supplemental oxygen reduced systolic blood pressure, although this reduction could also be explained by a reduction in body weight experienced in this group. In the continuous positive airway pressure group, supplemental oxygen increased the frequency of morning confusion. In the lifestyle modification group, supplemental oxygen increased compensatory metabolic alkalosis and decreased the apnea-hypopnea index during sleep. Oxygen therapy was not associated with an increase in hospital resource utilization in any of the groups.

- **Conclusions**: After two months of follow-up, chronic oxygen therapy produced marginal changes.

### A pilot randomized trial comparing CPAP vs bilevel PAP spontaneous mode in the treatment of hypoventilation disorder in patients with obesity and obstructive airway disease [^115RUH4D]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Both obesity and airway disease can lead to chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, which can be managed with positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. The efficacy of PAP has been studied in obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well as in chronic hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, but not in patients where both obesity and airway obstruction coexist. This pilot study aims to compare the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure vs. bilevel positive airway pressure spontaneous mode in the treatment of hypoventilation disorder with obesity and obstructive airways disease.

- **Methods**: We sequentially screened PAP-naïve patients with stable chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (PaCO₂ > 45 mm Hg), obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m²), and obstructive airways disease. Participants were randomized to continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure spontaneous mode treatment for 3 months. Participants were blinded to their PAP allocation. Change in awake PaCO₂ was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included change in lung function, daytime sleepiness, sleep quality, quality of life, PAP adherence, and neurocognitive function.

- **Results**: A total of 32 individuals were randomized (mean ± SD: age 61 ± 11 years, body mass index 43 ± 7 kg/m², PaCO₂ 54 ± 7 mm Hg, forced expiratory volume in 1 second 1.4 ± 0.6L, apnea-hypopnea index 59 ± 35 events/h). Sixteen participants in each PAP group were analyzed. Bilevel positive airway pressure yielded a greater improvement in PaCO₂ compared to continuous positive airway pressure.

### Cardiovascular disease in obesity hypoventilation syndrome - a review of potential mechanisms and effects of therapy [^115TPoje]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is common in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and partially accounts for their poor prognosis. This narrative review article examines the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in OHS, explores possible contributing factors, and the effects of therapy. All studies that included cardiovascular outcomes and biomarkers were considered. Overall, there is a higher burden of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors among patients with OHS. In addition to obesity and sleep-disordered breathing, several other pathophysiological mechanisms contribute to the higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in OHS. Emerging evidence suggests that positive airway pressure therapy and weight loss have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in OHS patients. However, further research is needed to clarify whether these effects translate to clinically important outcomes.

### The obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^1163MPSA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The obesity hypoventilation syndrome is defined as a combination of obesity and chronic hypoventilation, which ultimately results in pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and probable early mortality. Since the classical description of this syndrome nearly fifty years ago, research has led to a better understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in this disease process and to the development of effective treatment options. However, recent data indicate that the obesity hypoventilation syndrome is under-recognized and under-treated. Because obesity has become a national epidemic, it is critical that physicians are able to recognize and treat obesity-associated diseases.

- **Definitions and clinical presentation**: This article reviews definitions of the obesity hypoventilation syndrome, along with its clinical presentation and diagnosis.
- **Pathophysiology**: A present understanding of the pathophysiology is provided.

### Noninvasive ventilation in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure caused by obesity hypoventilation syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^113mAYkP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is widely used in episodes of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, there is no evidence on the efficacy of NIV during similar episodes in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS).

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy of NIV in episodes of AHRF caused by OHS and COPD.

- **Methods**: We prospectively assessed 716 consecutive patients (173 with OHS and 543 with COPD) with AHRF (arterial pH < 7.35, PaCO2 > 45 mm Hg) treated with a similar protocol of NIV. Successful NIV was defined as the avoidance of intubation and intensive care unit survival at least 24 hours in the ward. Hospital survivors were followed for 1 year to assess hospital readmission and survival.

- **Measurements and main results**: Both groups had similar (mean ± SD) baseline respiratory acidosis (arterial pH, 7.22 ± 0.08; PaCO2, 86 ± 21 mm Hg). Patients with OHS were older (74 ± 11 vs. 71 ± 10 years; P < 0.001) and were more frequently female (134, 77% vs. 66, 12%; P < 0.001). They had less late NIV failure (12, 7% vs. 67, 13%; P = 0.037), lower hospital mortality (10, 6% vs. 96, 18%; P < 0.001), and higher 1-year survival (odds ratio, 1.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.24–2.69; P = 0.002). However, when survival was adjusted for confounders (adjusted odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–2.83; P = 0.34), and considering NIV failure (11, 6% vs. 59, 11%; P = 0.11), length of stay, and hospital readmission, these factors were similar in both groups. Among patients with COPD, obesity was associated with less late NIV failure and hospital mortality.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and postsurgical outcomes in a bariatric surgery cohort [^113VBrxv]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Patients with obesity and elevated serum bicarbonate, suggesting obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), undergoing bariatric surgery may represent a unique subgroup. Information regarding surgical outcomes in this population remains limited. We sought to test the hypothesis that elevated bicarbonate would be an important predictor of perioperative complications (e.g. length of hospital stay) and postsurgical outcomes (e.g. weight loss at 1 year).

Consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgery between January 2015 and December 2018 were included in the study. Patients with a preoperative serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mEq/L were classified as suspected OHS.

Of the 297 patients, the prevalence of suspected OHS based on an elevated bicarbonate was 19.5% (95% CI: 15.3 to 24.6%). The length of hospital stay was similar in both the suspected OHS and non-OHS control groups (1.50 vs. 1.49 days, P = 0.98). The weight loss achieved from peak preoperative weight to 1 year post-surgery was less in the suspected OHS group compared to the control group (4.2% [95% CI: 1.6 to 6.8]; P = 0.002).

Patients with serum bicarbonate ≥ 27 mEq/L, used as a surrogate marker for OHS, experienced a weight loss that was significantly less than their normal serum bicarbonate counterparts, though still considered clinically important by guidelines. We observed no significant difference in the length of hospital stay at the time of surgery.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome and postsurgical outcomes in a bariatric surgery cohort [^116KjF7j]. Obesity Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Bariatric surgery can be safely performed in experienced medical centers. Preoperative elevated serum bicarbonate does not appear to be a major risk factor for perioperative complications or poor postoperative outcomes. Patients with elevated bicarbonate and suspected obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) may experience less weight loss but are still generally able to achieve clinically important outcomes. Our results suggest patients with elevated serum bicarbonate and suspected OHS should be encouraged to pursue bariatric surgery if appropriate for them, independent of preoperative serum bicarbonate levels. Further work is needed to identify high-risk patients and to optimize postoperative outcomes in people with obesity.

### Acute ventilatory failure complicating obesity hypoventilation: Update on a 'critical care syndrome' [^111sPdi8]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Obesity can result in serious complications, including obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Patients with OHS may present with acute-on-chronic ventilatory failure, necessitating acute care management. This review discusses the recent literature on acute ventilatory failure in patients with OHS.

Obese individuals can develop acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and sleep hypoventilation due to disorders in lung mechanics, ventilatory drive, and neurohormonal and neuromodulator imbalances of breathing. Although there are no clearly defined predictors for OHS patients likely to develop acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, most such patients are middle-aged (mid-50s), morbidly obese, and exhibit daytime hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and low serum pH values. Immediate ventilatory support, without sleep study confirmation, is necessary for most of these patients. Those with respiratory acidemia (pH < 7.30) or altered mental status may require monitoring in an intensive care unit. Noninvasive application of bilevel positive airway pressure therapy is the recommended initial ventilatory support under close monitoring. Prompt initiation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and rapidly improves blood gas levels.

Obese patients with sleep hypoventilation have an increased risk of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. Early diagnosis and implementation of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is recommended for these patients.

### Moderate concentrations of supplemental oxygen worsen hypercapnia in obesity hypoventilation syndrome: a randomised crossover study [^112TX9GR]. Thorax (2014). High credibility.

In people with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), breathing 100% oxygen increases carbon dioxide (PCO2), but its effect on pH is unknown. This study investigated the effects of moderate concentrations of supplemental oxygen on PCO2, pH, minute ventilation (VE), and physiological dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) among people with stable untreated OHS, compared to healthy controls.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind randomised crossover study, participants breathed oxygen concentrations (FiO2) of 0.28 and 0.50, each for 20 minutes, separated by a 45-minute washout period. Arterialised-venous PCO2 (PavCO2) and pH, VE, and VD/VT were measured at baseline and then every 5 minutes. Data were analyzed using general linear model analysis.

- **Results**: Twenty-eight participants were recruited (14 OHS, 14 controls). Among OHS participants (mean ± SD arterial PCO2 6.7 ± 0.5 kPa; arterial oxygen 8.9 ± 1.4 kPa), FiO2 levels of 0.28 and 0.50 maintained oxygen saturation between 98–100%. After 20 minutes of FiO2 0.28, PavCO2 change (ΔPavCO2) was 0.3 ± 0.2 kPa (p = 0.013), with minimal change in VE and a rise in VD/VT of 1 ± 5% (p = 0.012). FiO2 0.50 increased PavCO2 by 0.5 ± 0.4 kPa (p = 0.012), induced acidaemia, and increased VD/VT by 3 ± 3% (p = 0.012). VE fell by 1.2 ± 2.1 L/min within 5 minutes, then recovered individually to varying degrees. A negative correlation between ΔVE and ΔPavCO2 (r = -0.60, p = 0.024) suggested that ventilatory responses were the key determinant of PavCO2 rises. Among controls, FiO2 levels of 0.28 and 0.50 did not change PavCO2 or pH, but FiO2 0.50 significantly increased VE and VD/VT.

- **Conclusion**: In individuals with OHS, moderate concentrations of supplemental oxygen can worsen hypercapnia through changes in ventilatory response, without affecting healthy controls similarly.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1161FNyt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, specifically concerning weight loss, the ATS 2019 guidelines recommend considering weight loss interventions that produce sustained weight loss of 25–30% of actual body weight to achieve the resolution of hypoventilation in patients with OHS.

### Sex differences in sleep and sleep-disordered breathing [^111YEYYW]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The differences in the prevalence of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) between the sexes and the change in association with menopause have not been systematically investigated. However, as with OSA, OHS is underdiagnosed, and diagnosis is often delayed in women. Most patients with OHS have moderate to severe OSA. However, OHS with lone hypoventilation (without relevant OSA) is more common in women, which is also reflected in the patient populations of the Pickwick studies, where about 80% of OHS patients without severe OSA were women.

The prevalence of OHS increases after menopause, which could be explained both by the increase in upper airway collapsibility and OSA severity and by the decrease in progesterone as a stimulator of ventilation. In clinical practice, higher respiratory drive and lower CO2 partial pressure during sleep are often observed in younger obese premenopausal women compared to younger men in the same BMI range.

In addition, OSA may contribute less to hypoventilation during sleep in women due to the lower collapsibility of the upper airway. Furthermore, a more central fat distribution, as commonly observed in obese men, might have more negative effects on dynamic lung volumes and respiratory mechanics at the same BMI compared to a more peripheral distribution in women.

However, there is little epidemiologic data on sex differences in prevalence, symptom presentation, polysomnographic features, and treatment outcomes in OHS, and there is a need for future research.

### Non-invasive ventilation in obesity hypoventilation syndrome without severe obstructive sleep apnoea [^112Zrf9F]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Observational studies have reported a reduction in long-term healthcare resource utilization in patients with OHS treated with NIV. In our study, we found a clear trend towards a reduction in healthcare resource utilization with NIV treatment after only 2 months of follow-up, although this degree of improvement did not remain statistically significant in adjusted analysis. A longer period of follow-up is necessary to better assess outcomes such as healthcare resource utilization.

Our study has several limitations. Given the multiple comparisons of secondary outcomes, those with p-values close to the statistical significance limit should be interpreted with caution and taken as hypothesis-generating. With regard to the threshold of OSA severity, we strategically opted to exclude patients with severe OSA (AHI ≥ 30). Although we acknowledge that most of our patients had some degree of mild to moderate OSA (i.e. AHI 5–29), we believe that CPAP is more effective in improving hypercapnia in patients with OHS with severe OSA. Moreover, from a pragmatic standpoint, enrolling patients with OHS with minimal to no OSA would have been challenging, since the majority of patients with OHS do have some degree of OSA.

Although we recognize that our spirometric criteria may have allowed the inclusion of some patients with mild COPD, we believe that this degree of mild obstructive defect on spirometry is less likely to be a significant contributor to the development of chronic respiratory failure and hypercapnia, particularly with an FEV1 > 70% of predicted. Moreover, the low prevalence of COPD in our study population supports this assertion.

### Perioperative lung protective ventilation in obese patients [^111jc8B1]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Obese patients often present with additional pulmonary comorbidities, including airway hyper-reactivity, sleep apnea (SA), obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), and pulmonary hypertension. Obesity-induced airway hyper-reactivity is gaining attention as a specific type of bronchial hyper-reactivity that can be differentiated from other asthma etiologies in terms of age of onset and response to standard therapy or weight loss. Sleep apnea is distinguished by multiple interruptions of ventilation during sleep and their consequences, such as intermittent nocturnal hypoxemia and daytime tiredness. In obese patients, sleep apnea is usually caused by upper airway obstruction due to excessive soft pharyngeal tissue, rather than a central deregulation of the respiratory drive center. The fact that the time-consuming and expensive gold-standard diagnostic polysomnography is not routinely performed probably contributes to a high incidence of undiagnosed sleep apnea in surgical patients. Sleep apnea increases the risk of postoperative hypoxemia, other respiratory complications, and ICU admission, and if untreated, may also contribute to hypertension and other cardiovascular risks.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is the combination of daytime hypercapnia and sleep-disordered breathing in an obese patient, notably a condition not related to any other pulmonary or neuromuscular pathology. OHS is frequently undiagnosed (and untreated) until an acute-on-chronic respiratory failure occurs.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: Mechanisms and management [^1163G7xV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome describes the association between obesity and the development of chronic daytime alveolar hypoventilation. This syndrome arises from a complex interaction between sleep-disordered breathing, diminished respiratory drive, and obesity-related respiratory impairment, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therapy directed toward reversing these abnormalities leads to improved daytime breathing, with available treatment options including positive pressure therapy, weight loss, and pharmacological management. However, a lack of large-scale, well-designed studies evaluating these various therapies has limited the development of evidence-based treatment recommendations. Although treatment directed toward improving sleep-disordered breathing is usually effective, not all patients tolerate mask ventilation and awake hypercapnia may persist despite effective use. In the longer term, weight loss is desirable, but data on the success and sustainability of this approach in obesity hypoventilation are lacking. The review outlines the major mechanisms believed to underlie the development of hypoventilation in this subgroup of obese patients, their clinical presentation, and therapy options.

### Gender differences in outcomes of ambulatory and hospitalized patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^112ZpQjs]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, but there are limited data on whether gender differences affect outcomes.

- **Research question**: Do women with OHS experience worse outcomes in ambulatory and hospitalized settings compared to men?

- **Study design and methods**: Post hoc analyses were performed on two separate OHS cohorts: (1) stable ambulatory patients from the two Pickwick randomized controlled trials, and (2) hospitalized patients with acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure from a retrospective international cohort. Bivariate analyses of baseline characteristics and therapeutics between genders were first conducted. Variables of interest from these analyses were then grouped into linear mixed effects models, Cox proportional hazards models, or logistic regression models to assess the association of gender on various clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: The ambulatory prospective cohort included 300 patients (64% self-identified as women), and the hospitalized retrospective cohort included 1,162 patients (58% self-identified as women). In both cohorts, women were significantly older and more obese than men. Compared with men, baseline Paco2 was similar in ambulatory patients but higher in hospitalized women. In the ambulatory cohort, in unadjusted analysis, women had an increased risk of emergency department visits. However, gender was not associated with the composite outcome of emergency department visit, hospitalization, or all-cause mortality in the fully adjusted model. In the hospitalized cohort, prescription of oxygen therapy was significantly associated with improved survival irrespective of gender.

### A case of rapid-onset obesity with hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, autonomic dysregulation, and neural crest tumor: ROHHADNET syndrome [^113AwhsA]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Rapid-onset obesity with hypoventilation, hypothalamic dysfunction, and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare disorder that mimics both common obesity and genetic obesity syndromes along with several endocrine disorders during early childhood. We aim to present the clinical features, laboratory and imaging results, and treatment outcomes of a patient with ROHHAD syndrome.

In this case report, we describe a 26-month-old boy who was admitted to our emergency department with dyspnea and cyanosis and was suspected to have ROHHAD syndrome due to his rapid-onset obesity and alveolar hypoventilation.

A thoracal and abdominal magnetic resonance imaging was performed to demonstrate a possible accompanying neural crest tumor and it provided a yet asymptomatic retroperitoneal ganglioneuroblastoma. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with ROHHADNET syndrome.

Because of the high prevalence of cardiorespiratory arrest and probability of accompanying tumors, early recognition of ROHHAD syndrome is important. To prevent presumptive mortality and morbidity, ROHHAD syndrome should be considered in all cases of rapid and early-onset obesity associated with hypothalamic-pituitary endocrine dysfunctions.

### The obesity hypoventilation syndrome [^116SrcdN]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

We only need to look around us to see that we are in an epidemic of obesity and obesity-related medical problems. The obesity hypoventilation syndrome is a disorder in which an obese person with normal lungs chronically hypoventilates. Obesity impairs ventilatory mechanics, increases the work of breathing and carbon dioxide production, results in respiratory muscle dysfunction, and reduces ventilatory response to hypercapnia. Sleep-disordered breathing is present in most patients with the obesity hypoventilation syndrome. When noninvasive ventilation can be successfully introduced, hypoventilation can usually be corrected. Weight loss is the desirable long-term treatment for the obesity hypoventilation syndrome. This paper concisely overviews the physiologic factors that lead to the obesity hypoventilation syndrome and discusses therapies for it.

### Using intra-breath oscillometry in obesity hypoventilation syndrome to detect tidal expiratory flow limitation: A potential marker to optimize CPAP therapy [^117HtNQk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), a leading cause of chronic respiratory failure worldwide, is characterized by obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg·m⁻²) and hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide ≥ 45 mmHg) that typically worsens at night. The pathophysiology of OHS is complex; upper airway patency issues, disrupted control of breathing, and altered lung mechanics due to obesity may all contribute to the characteristic hypoventilation.

Due to this complex pathophysiology, optimal therapy for patients has not yet been clearly established. Clinical guidance advises continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy intended to achieve daytime normocapnia, and in cases of insufficient clinical improvement, progression to bilevel ventilation. CPAP counteracts the increased mechanical load on the respiratory system and the subsequent decrease in end-expiratory lung volume (EELV). Additionally, it manages upper airway patency issues, which are common in OHS patients. Bilevel ventilation may be useful in patients with exhausted respiratory drive or where upper airway obstruction is not prominent.

Despite this practice, it is unclear how the "ideal CPAP" level can be determined and whether CPAP failure can be managed with a more optimized CPAP setting. There are currently no official titration protocols in use. Recent studies have used protocols where a gradual increase of CPAP is continued even after obstructive events and flow limitation have ceased, if saturation goals are not reached. A recent study has shown the majority of patients with lower AHI.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome as a spectrum of respiratory disturbances during sleep [^111CCazG]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to identify the spectrum of respiratory disturbances during sleep in patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and to examine the response of hypercapnia to treatment of the specific ventilatory sleep disturbances.

- **Designs and methods**: Twenty-three patients with chronic awake hypercapnia (mean [± SD] PaCO(2), 55 ± 6 mm Hg) and a respiratory sleep disorder were retrospectively identified. Nocturnal polysomnography testing was performed, and flow limitation (FL) was identified from the inspiratory flow-time contour. Obstructive hypoventilation was inferred from sustained FL coupled with O₂ desaturation that was corrected with the treatment of the upper airway obstruction. Central hypoventilation was inferred from sustained O₂ desaturation that persisted after the correction of the upper airway obstruction. Treatment was initiated, and follow-up awake PaCO₂ measurements were obtained (follow-up range, 4 days to 7 years).

- **Results**: A variable number of obstructive sleep apneas/hypopneas, i.e. obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), were noted (range, 9 to 167 events per hour of sleep). Of the 23 patients, 11 demonstrated upper airway obstruction alone (apnea-hypopnea/FL), and 12 demonstrated central sleep hypoventilation syndrome (SHVS) in addition to a variable number of OSAHS. Treatment aimed at correcting the specific ventilatory abnormalities resulted in the correction of chronic hypercapnia in all compliant patients (compliant patients: pretreatment, 57 ± 6 mm Hg vs post-treatment, 41 ± 4 mm Hg [p < 0.001]).

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111dJYTF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

In specific circumstances related to obesity, particularly concerning patients with hypoventilation syndrome, the ATS 2019 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of serum bicarbonate levels to decide when to assess PaCO2 in patients with a low-to-moderate probability (< 20%) of having obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Measure PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate levels ≥ 27 mmol/L to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Conversely, avoid measuring PaCO2 in patients with serum bicarbonate levels < 27 mmol/L, as the diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome is highly unlikely in these cases.

### Late-onset hypoventilation without PHOX2B mutation or hypothalamic abnormalities [^115v6Q4P]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Most children with idiopathic central hypoventilation exhibit symptoms at birth or shortly thereafter and have mutations of the PHOX2B gene. Those whose symptoms appear later typically have obesity and hypothalamic abnormalities. Here, we describe a case of a boy who presented at 5 years of age with severe idiopathic central hypoventilation, without obesity or hypothalamic abnormalities, and who tested negative for mutation of the PHOX2B gene. This case illustrates the heterogeneity of childhood idiopathic central hypoventilation syndromes and indicates the multifactorial etiology of these syndromes.

### Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^116U8TzY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for obesity, more specifically concerning patients with hypoventilation syndrome (respiratory support), the ATS 2019 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of noninvasive ventilation before hospital discharge in hospitalized patients with respiratory failure suspected of having obesity hypoventilation syndrome. This should continue until they undergo outpatient workup and titration of positive airway pressure therapy in the sleep laboratory, ideally within the first 3 months after hospital discharge.

### Erratum: Evaluation and management of obesity hypoventilation syndrome. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1124uZbu]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

There is an error in the ATS clinical practice guidelines published in the August 1, 2019, issue of the journal. The ATS recommendations in response to Question 4 ("Should hospitalized adults suspected of having OHS, in whom the diagnosis has not yet been made, be discharged from the hospital with or without PAP treatment until the diagnosis of OHS is either confirmed or ruled out?") should begin with the words "We suggest". This correction should have been made to page e17 of the full document and page 287 of the Executive Summary. Table 1 in both documents does include the correct wording.

The full recommendation should read:

We suggest that hospitalized patients suspected of having OHS be started on NIV therapy before being discharged from the hospital and continued on NIV therapy until they undergo outpatient workup and titration of PAP therapy in the sleep laboratory, ideally during the first 3 months after hospital discharge (conditional recommendation, very low level of certainty in the evidence).
