## Question

Toddler constipation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about toddler constipation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining toddler constipation and applying diagnostic criteria. Then, I should verify red flags and when to investigate for organic disease. Next, I will review first-line management, including disimpaction, maintenance therapy, and behavioral strategies. After that, I need to examine the evidence for dietary modifications, including fiber, fluids, and specialized formulas. I will then consider second-line and adjunctive therapies, including stimulant laxatives and when to escalate. Finally, I should define therapy-resistant constipation, outline follow-up and prognosis, and summarize a practical algorithm with key takeaways, ensuring each step is supported by guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic framework. Toddler constipation is best understood as pediatric functional constipation using Rome criteria, with Rome IV now preferred, and in children under 4 years, diagnosis requires at least two of: ≤ 2 defecations per week, at least 1 episode of fecal incontinence per week after acquiring toileting skills, history of retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool retention, painful or hard bowel movements, presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum, or large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet, present for at least 1 month and occurring at least once per week, with diagnosis based on history and physical examination in the absence of red flags [^260e4942] [^232ef93f] [^1b87128c].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags and when to investigate. I should confirm that alarm features warrant evaluation for organic disease: onset in the first month of life, delayed passage of meconium beyond 48 hours, failure to thrive, explosive stools, severe abdominal distension, blood in stool, anal fissures, or neurologic deficits, which should prompt consideration of Hirschsprung disease, cystic fibrosis, spinal cord anomalies, celiac disease, or cow's milk protein allergy, and may require targeted testing or referral to pediatric gastroenterology [^c345e7e1] [^6f853691] [^6899f0fa].

> I will now examine first-line management principles. The cornerstone is a structured approach: treat fecal impaction first, then initiate maintenance therapy to prevent recurrence, and implement behavioral strategies to address stool withholding and toileting dynamics, with education about the chronic course and relapse risk to set expectations and improve adherence [^76b5d3b5] [^6f853691] [^c345e7e1].

> Let me think about disimpaction. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1–1.5 g/kg/day for 3–6 days is first-line for fecal impaction, with enemas once daily for 3–6 days if PEG is not available or tolerated, and I should double-check that this is supported by guidelines and that serious adverse events are uncommon in pediatric studies, which they are [^d3138e61] [^fbaf972f] [^4f18c9ed].

> Next, I should review maintenance therapy. PEG at 0.4 g/kg/day, titrated to clinical response, is first-line maintenance, with lactulose as an alternative if PEG is unavailable, and I need to ensure duration is adequate: continue for at least 2 months and taper only after symptoms have resolved for at least 1 month, recognizing that many children require longer courses and that relapse is common, which aligns with guideline recommendations and longitudinal data [^fdb52d29] [^2bb145dd] [^7e2e3587] [^d681215e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about behavioral therapy. I initially thought structured behavioral programs would be beneficial, but wait, I should verify the evidence. ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN advises against routine intensive behavioral protocols as adjuncts to conventional therapy, and more recent neurogastroenterology guidance emphasizes simple, developmentally appropriate measures such as scheduled postprandial toilet sits and optimizing toilet biomechanics rather than formal behavioral therapy, so I should correct my earlier assumption and recommend practical, low-burden behavioral supports instead of protocolized programs [^54c1d353] [^7b5ed695] [^eea3df9a].

> I need to check dietary recommendations carefully. Adequate fiber intake and normal fluid intake are advised, but increasing fiber beyond usual recommendations and adding probiotics do not provide additional benefit for treating functional constipation, and I should confirm that this is consistent with contemporary guidance, which it is, including the 2023 ESPGHAN position on probiotics and synbiotics [^dc0304be] [^dc0304be] [^6f853691] [^7c703cc2] [^3f03c0d1].

> But wait, what about specialized toddler formulas. Let me review the randomized trial data. In toddlers with functional constipation, after PEG-based disimpaction and a month of maintenance PEG, two different Comfort young child formulas maintained improved stooling parameters over 8 weeks with low percentages of hard stools and reduced stooling avoidance, and although between-group differences were modest and not always statistically significant, the overall trajectory was favorable and supports considering these formulas as part of maintenance in formula-fed toddlers, while acknowledging limitations such as open-label design and short duration [^b3b393b5] [^260b03ff] [^31cd229f] [^fe151a88].

> Next, I should review second-line and adjunctive therapies. If response to PEG is inadequate, stimulant laxatives such as senna or bisacodyl can be added, with the Cochrane review suggesting benefit though evidence quality is low, and contemporary guidance allows stimulants as rescue or second-line options, while mineral oil can be considered in older children who can safely swallow it, and I should confirm that these align with pediatric and surgical society recommendations, which they do [^4f18c9ed] [^a1ff43bc] [^051ab4b9].

> I should confirm when to escalate and how to define therapy-resistant constipation. Historically, intractable constipation meant no response to optimal conventional therapy for at least 3 months, but recent expert consensus proposes pediatric refractory constipation as ongoing Rome IV–defined symptoms after at least 3 months of age-appropriate conventional therapy including stimulant laxatives and behavioral measures with impaired quality of life, which operationalizes escalation criteria and supports referral for specialized testing such as anorectal manometry or colonic transit when indicated [^9be8540a] [^c2295341] [^7d5e8a2a].

> Let me consider follow-up and prognosis. Early follow-up at 2 weeks to assess disimpaction and adherence, then monthly until stable, with anticipatory guidance about relapse risk and the need for prolonged therapy is essential, and I should double-check that relapse rates are indeed high, which they are, with 40–50% experiencing at least one relapse over 5 years, reinforcing the need for sustained maintenance and gradual weaning only when symptoms have resolved for a month [^d681215e] [^2bb145dd] [^76b5d3b5].

> I will now synthesize a practical algorithm. First, confirm functional constipation with history and exam and screen for red flags. If impaction is present, disimpact with PEG 1–1.5 g/kg/day for 3–6 days or enemas if needed. Then start PEG maintenance at 0.4 g/kg/day, titrate to soft stools, and continue for at least 2 months with at least 1 month symptom resolution before taper. Implement scheduled toilet sits after meals and optimize toilet posture. Maintain normal fiber and fluid intake without excess. If inadequate response, add a stimulant laxative. If still refractory after 3 months of optimized therapy, evaluate for organic disease and consider specialized testing and referral, documenting impaired quality of life to meet refractory criteria [^76b5d3b5] [^fdb52d29] [^2bb145dd] [^7b5ed695] [^c2295341].

> Key takeaway, and let me reconsider to ensure internal consistency: toddler constipation is common, chronic, and multifactorial, but most cases are functional and respond to a structured approach of disimpaction, PEG-based maintenance, simple behavioral measures, and realistic expectations about duration and relapse. Dietary extremes and probiotics do not help, specialized Comfort formulas may aid maintenance in formula-fed toddlers, and escalation to stimulants and specialty evaluation is reserved for refractory cases after 3 months of optimized therapy, which aligns with contemporary pediatric guidelines and available evidence [^6f853691] [^4f18c9ed] [^0a88a589] [^c2295341].

Toddler constipation is **most often functional** [^6f853691] and diagnosed by history and exam using Rome IV criteria [^260e4942] [^232ef93f]; red flags warrant evaluation for organic causes [^c345e7e1] [^6899f0fa]. First-line management is **PEG disimpaction** [^d3138e61] followed by **PEG maintenance** [^fdb52d29] for at least 2 months [^2bb145dd], with behavioral strategies (regular toilet sits, reward systems) [^c345e7e1] and normal fiber/fluid intake [^c4ddd73d]; stimulant laxatives are reserved for refractory cases [^a1ff43bc] [^051ab4b9]. Most toddlers improve with this approach, but relapses are common and require ongoing maintenance and follow-up [^d681215e] [^6f853691].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

Functional constipation is defined by Rome IV as **≥ 2 of the following for ≥ 1 month** in children < 4 years [^1b87128c]:

- ≤ 2 defecations/week
- ≥ 1 episode/week of fecal incontinence after acquiring toileting skills
- History of retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool retention
- History of painful or hard bowel movements
- Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum
- History of large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet

---

## Prevalence and epidemiology

Constipation is common in toddlers, with a **global prevalence** of 0.7–29.6% [^8c54edb6] and a pooled estimate of 9.5% [^2a42b66d]. It often persists beyond toddlerhood, with 17–40% of cases starting in the first year of life [^1b632294].

---

## Etiology and risk factors

Functional constipation is **multifactorial**; key drivers include:

- **Withholding behavior**: After painful or frightening bowel movements [^bfa4470d].
- **Dietary factors**: Low fiber, inadequate fluids, formula composition [^c4ddd73d].
- **Behavioral factors**: Poor toilet training, stress, anxiety [^2a42b66d].
- **Family history**: Increased risk with parental constipation [^2a42b66d].

Organic causes (e.g. Hirschsprung's, hypothyroidism, celiac) are uncommon but must be considered when red flags are present [^c345e7e1] [^6899f0fa].

---

## Clinical evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, based on history and physical examination [^232ef93f]. Red flags warranting further evaluation include:

- Onset in infancy
- Delayed meconium passage
- Failure to thrive
- Blood in stool
- Severe abdominal distension
- Neurologic abnormalities [^c345e7e1] [^6899f0fa]

Routine laboratory tests or imaging are **not indicated** unless red flags are present [^c345e7e1] [^6f853691].

---

## Management strategies

### First-line management

- **Disimpaction**: Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1–1.5 g/kg/day for 3–6 days [^d3138e61].
- **Maintenance therapy**: PEG 0.4 g/kg/day, titrated to clinical response [^fdb52d29].
- **Duration**: Continue maintenance for at least 2 months, taper only after 1 month of symptom resolution [^2bb145dd] [^eb1448c3].
- **Behavioral interventions**: Regular toilet sits, reward systems, education on withholding [^c345e7e1] [^7b5ed695].
- **Dietary measures**: Normal fiber and fluid intake; avoid excess fiber or fluids [^c4ddd73d] [^dc0304be].

---

### Second-line management

If PEG is unavailable or not tolerated, **lactulose** is an alternative [^7e2e3587]. Stimulant laxatives (e.g. senna, bisacodyl) are reserved for **refractory cases** [^a1ff43bc] [^051ab4b9].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Functional constipation is **chronic and relapsing**; 40–50% of children experience at least one relapse within 5 years [^d681215e]. Persistent symptoms beyond puberty occur in about one-third of cases [^8c54edb6]. Prognosis is influenced by adherence, family support, and early intervention [^notfound].

---

## Parental education and support

Education is essential to **improve adherence and outcomes** [^c345e7e1]. Key messages include:

- Normal bowel movement frequency and stool consistency
- Importance of regular toilet sits and positive reinforcement
- Recognition of withholding behaviors
- Realistic expectations about treatment duration and relapse risk [^6f853691]

---

## When to refer to a specialist

Referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist is indicated for:

- Concern for organic disease
- Refractory constipation despite optimal therapy
- Need for specialized testing (e.g. anorectal manometry) [^c345e7e1] [^7d5e8a2a]

---

Toddler constipation is **common and multifactorial**; most cases are functional and respond to PEG-based therapy plus behavioral and dietary measures. Persistent or atypical cases need evaluation for organic causes, and ongoing maintenance is key to preventing relapse.

Discussion

Therapy-resistant constipation is a common and formidable challenge in paediatric clinical practice. It is crucial to have a clear and explicit definition of this clinical entity in order to implement appropriate management strategies at an early stage that may improve outcomes. The Rome criteria clearly define functional constipation in infants, toddlers and children. However, after an extensive review of the existing paediatric literature, we were unable to find a clear definition for therapy-resistant constipation for children, especially in terms of the duration of unresponsiveness to optimal medial management before being labelled as therapy-resistant constipation. Although the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE, UK) has defined therapy-resistant constipation, the duration of symptoms of constipation is, however, not included in their definition. Widely varying definitions found in our review show the lack of consensus among these definitions. We believe that it is imperative to use unambiguous terminology that includes, rigorous criteria of failure, type of therapeutic interventions and their precise duration in defining therapy-resistant constipation.

Terminology of therapy-resistant constipation

Several studies have used the term intractablewhile others have used the term refractory. It is interesting to note that some studies have used both terms. Although, it is clear that both terms are being used in the definition of medically unresponsive constipation, the literature shows no agreement on the terminology and use the terms refractory and intractable loosely and interchangeably. It is important for researchers and healthcare professionals to come to a consensus on the terminology used to describe therapy-resistant constipation as it helps to understand the pathophysiology, recognise symptomatology, use the correct diagnostic tools, compare treatment regimens and design clinical trials.

Time frame of therapy-resistant constipation

It is also evident that there is no clear agreement among studies on the duration of medical treatment before children are deemed to be considered as therapy-resistant constipation. Among the studies that provided an explicit definition for therapy-resistant constipation, there is no definitive time duration that can be used as a benchmark. Most studies with an explicit definition seem to believe that symptoms must persist for at least 3 months to meet the criteria for therapy-resistant constipationwhile some studies have set a longer time frame of 12 (4/47)or 24 months (2/47), respectively. Among those studies that do offer an explicit definition, there is still no consensus about how long symptoms need to persist in order to be considered as therapy resistant.

Background

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common health problems in infancy and early childhood. Even though they are mostly transient, they may be very distressing to a new parent as well as the child. Gastro-oesophageal reflux (regurgitation), functional constipation (FC) and infantile colic are among the most common FGIDs, and they can occur separately or combined. Both reflux and colic self-resolve by the age of 12 months, however FC often continues into toddlerhood, peaks when toilet training starts, and in extreme cases continues even to adulthood. The prevalence of paediatric FC is difficult to determine. It is a global issue, but it varies greatly across geographical regions. Most studies report it to range from 0.5 to 32%, with a global pooled prevalence of 9.5%. FC is characterized by infrequent bowel movements, hard and/or large stools, painful defecation, and faecal incontinence, and is often accompanied by abdominal pain. FC is not caused by anatomic abnormality, inflammation, or tissue damage, but the exact cause is still unclear. Its pathophysiology is thought to be multifactorial. Risk factors include stress, dietary habits, physical activity, obesity, family history of FC, poor toilet training, psychological difficulties, child maltreatment, and dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Stooling avoidance is seen as the key factor of paediatric FC.

FGIDs have been linked to both short- and long-term (negative) effects on health and quality of life of young children as well as their caregivers. For example, both children with FC as well as their families have lower health-related quality of life, while school aged- children had persistent fatigue with significant school absenteeism. Due to the magnitude of the problem, paediatric FC has also substantial impact on healthcare and medical costs.

Conventional treatment for FC consists of pharmacological intervention, i.e. laxatives for stool disimpaction, in combination with non-pharmacological measures such as education and toilet training. The prevailing consensus among experts is that paediatric FC should not be treated with dietary interventions. This is to a great extent due to the lack of sufficient high-quality data supporting efficacy of dietary treatments. However, experts also agree that proper balanced diets, with special focus on fibre and fluid intake, should be an integral part of the maintenance therapy of children that have been pharmacologically treated for FC.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^3b3f0826]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN guideline — consensus process, grading, and scope: Using the GRADE system, the quality of evidence for therapeutic interventions was graded, and three consensus meetings were held in September 2012, February 2013, and May 2013 using a 9-point scale (1 = strongly disagree to 9 = fully agree). Consensus was defined a priori as > 75% of members voting 6, 7, 8, or 9, and consensus was reached for all questions. The guideline presents 2 algorithms; one pertains to the infant from birth to 6 months (instead of 1 year) and the other to the older child, reflecting that infants < 6 months old have different diagnostic considerations. Both algorithms apply to any child presenting with constipation of at least 2 weeks' duration and include evaluation and treatment options for "intractable" constipation. This guideline should be revised every 3 to 5 years.

### The use of two comfort young child formulas in the dietary management of toddlers with functional constipation: a randomized controlled trial [^0a88a589]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Pharmacological intervention with laxatives is the conventional treatment for functional constipation (FC). Data to support the dietary management of FC is lacking. This study compared the efficacy of two Comfort young child formulas (YCFs) with regards to the maintenance of healthy stooling parameters in toddlers with a history of constipation. It was registered in the Netherlands Trial Registry [identifier: NL7420 (NTR7653)], registration date 20/09/2018.

Methods

Ninety-five healthy toddlers, aged 12 to 32 months, diagnosed with FC (Rome III criteria) were randomized to receive one of two study formulas after pharmacological treatment. For the first month of the intervention, subjects received a laxative in a decreasing maintenance dose alongside a test or control formula (maintenance phase). Subsequently, subjects only consumed formula for another month (post-maintenance phase). Stooling parameters were obtained weekly using the Bristol Stool Scale and the modified Rome III Questionnaire on Paediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms for infants and toddlers. Differences in percentages of hard stools (primary outcome) and other stooling parameters were analysed using analysis of covariance and Chi-Square methods.

Results

Both formulas resulted in similar overall percentage of hard stools during the intervention period, respectively 5.02% in the test and 2.99% in the control group (n.s.). In the test group, percentages dropped from 7.11% at the end of the maintenance phase, to 3.92% at the end of the post-maintenance phase. In contrast, the percentage of hard stools in the control group was similar at the end of the maintenance (3.18%) and post-maintenance phase (2.83%; n.s.). No difference was found in the overall stool frequency between groups. At the end of the maintenance phase, only 22% and 19% of toddlers consuming the test and control formulae, respectively, met 2 or more of the criteria for FC. At the end of the study, this percentage of subjects decreased further to 9% in the test group, which tended to be lower compared to the 21% found in the control (p = 0.107). No laxative use was reported in either study group during the post-maintenance phase.

Conclusion

Both Comfort YCF support the maintenance of improved stooling over time in toddlers with a history of constipation. The percentage of subjects suffering from functional constipation tended to be lower after the intervention period when receiving the formula with intact protein.

### Childhood constipation: evaluation and treatment [^4013858d]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Constipation is common in children. It is estimated that between 5% and 10% of pediatric patients have constipation and/or encopresis. Constipation is the second most referred condition in pediatric gastroenterology practices, accounting for up to 25% of all visits. In this article, a practical approach is laid out for those not familiar with constipation in children. Emphasis is placed on the evaluation and management options that are available to the treating practitioner. The diagnosis of constipation requires careful history taking and interpretation. Diagnostic tests are not often needed and are reserved for those who are severely affected. The daily bowel habits of children are extremely susceptible to any changes in routine environment. Constipation and subsequent fecal retention behavior often begins soon after a child has experienced a painful evacuation. Childhood constipation can be very difficult to treat. It often requires prolonged support by physicians and parents, explanation, medical treatment, and, most important, the child's cooperation.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^12a2b5f4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Functional constipation in children — search strategy and inclusion criteria are detailed as follows: Systematic literature searches were performed by a clinical librarian from inception to October 2011 in Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and PsycInfo. Questions 1 and 2 were answered based on expert opinions and earlier published guidelines (5–9), whereas questions 3 to 9 used systematic literature searches. Eligible studies included children of ages 0 to 18 years, had to provide a clear definition of functional constipation, and for diagnostic accuracy (question 3) had to define the reference standard using history and physical examination. For treatment/intervention effects (questions 6–8), inclusion required systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials and/or randomized controlled trials containing at least 10 individuals per arm. For outcome/prognosis (questions 4, 5, and 9), inclusion required systematic reviews of prospective or retrospective controlled studies and original studies with a follow-up of at least 8 weeks. Additional identification strategies included searching reference lists, and no language restriction was applied.

### How do we define therapy-resistant constipation in children aged 4–18 years old? A systematic review with meta-narrative synthesis [^230133db]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Background

Therapy-resistant constipation often is a frustrating clinical entity recognised by the persistence of infrequent and painful bowel movements faecal incontinence and abdominal pain despite intensive treatment. It is important to clearly define therapy-resistant constipation before children are subjected to invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

Aim

To conduct a systematic review determining how paediatric interventional studies define therapy-resistant constipation.

Method

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, WHO ICTR and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies that included patients with therapy-resistant constipation were identified. Data were extracted on criteria used for defining therapy-resistant constipation and reported using a meta-narrative approach highlighting areas of convergence and divergence in the findings.

Results

A total of 1553 abstracts were screened in duplicate, and 47 studies were included in the review. There were at least seven definitions used in the paediatric literature to define medically resistant constipation. The term intractable was used in 24 articles and 21 used the term refractory to describe therapy-resistant constipation. Out of them, only 14 articles have attempted to provide an explicit definition including a predefined time and prior therapy. There were 10 studies without a clear definition for therapy-resistant constipation. The duration before being diagnosed as therapy-resistant constipation varied from 1 months to 2 years among studies. Seven studies employed the Rome criteria (Rome III or Rome IV) to characterising constipation while five adopted the Rome III and European and North American paediatric societies definition of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition guideline of management of constipation in children.

Conclusion

The current literature has no explicit definition for therapy-resistant constipation in children. There is a need for a detailed consensus definition to ensure consistency of future research and to avoid unnecessary and maybe even harmful, invasive diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

### Management of constipation in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders [^a94cd557]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To develop a practical, readily applied algorithm for primary health care providers to identify, evaluate, and manage constipation in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).

Methods

The Gastroenterology Committee of the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network (ATN), a multisite consortium of centers dedicated to improving standards of medical care for children with ASDs, guided the development of the constipation algorithm through expert opinion and literature review. The algorithm was finalized based on results of field testing by nongastrointestinal, ATN autism medical specialists at 4 ATN sites. A systematic review and grading of the literature pertaining to constipation and children with ASDs was also performed.

Results

Consensus among the ATN Gastroenterology Committee identified that in children with ASDs, (1) subtle or atypical symptoms might indicate the presence of constipation; (2) screening, identification, and treatment through a deliberate approach for underlying causes of constipation is appropriate; (3) diagnostic-therapeutic intervention can be provided when constipation is documented; and (4) careful follow-up after any intervention be performed to evaluate effectiveness and tolerance of the therapy. Literature review revealed limited evidence for the clinical evaluation or treatment strategies of children with ASD and constipation.

Conclusions

Constipation and its underlying etiology have the potential to be effectively identified and managed using a systematic approach. Lack of evidence on this topic in the literature emphasizes the need for research.

### Evaluation and treatment of constipation in infants and children: recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition [^3474c4c8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

Constipation, defined as a delay or difficulty in defecation, present for 2 or more weeks, is a common pediatric problem encountered by both primary and specialty medical providers. The Constipation Guideline Committee of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) has formulated a clinical practice guideline for the management of pediatric constipation. The Constipation Guideline Committee, consisting of two primary care pediatricians, a clinical epidemiologist, and pediatric gastroenterologists, based its recommendations on an integration of a comprehensive and systematic review of the medical literature combined with expert opinion. Consensus was achieved through Nominal Group Technique, a structured quantitative method. The Committee developed two algorithms to assist with medical management, one for older infants and children and the second for infants less than 1 year of age. The guideline provides recommendations for management by the primary care provider, including evaluation, initial treatment, follow-up management, and indications for consultation by a specialist. The Constipation Guideline Committee also provided recommendations for management by the pediatric gastroenterologist.

### What is the role of stimulant laxatives in the management of childhood constipation and soiling? [^e0d89c88]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is extremely common in childhood and may lead to overflow soiling/encopresis. Standard treatment of the more severe case is to empty the bowels of impacted faeces by the use of oral or rectal laxatives and then maintain regular bowel movements by the continuation of osmotic and stimulant laxatives.

Objectives

The objective of the review was to determine the effect of stimulant laxative treatment in children with chronic constipation who may also suffer from soiling / encopresis.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane database of randomised controlled trials was searched. Additional citations were sought by hand searching of paediatric journals and from contact with known professionals in the field.

Selection Criteria

All identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compare the administering of stimulant laxatives to children with either placebo or alternative treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

No trials were found that met the selection criteria.

Main Results

No trials were found that adequately met the selection criteria.

Reviewer's Conclusions

The need exists to establish a secure footing for treatment decisions and adequately sized trials are required to provide comparative data on commonly used drugs.

### The use of two comfort young child formulas in the dietary management of toddlers with functional constipation: a randomized controlled trial [^b3b393b5]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Results showed that, during the post-maintenance phase, the overall reported percentage of hard stools (BSS) was around 3–4% in both study groups, affecting between 22.2 and 29.8% of subjects. In addition, 26.7% of subjects in the test group and 35.4% of subjects in the control group met 2 or more of the Rome III criteria for FC at some point during the last 4 weeks of the study. Previous research has shown that after two months of primarily (87%) pharmacological treatment, around 37% of young children with FC remained constipated. In addition, Mill et al. stated that, even after 5 years of intensive treatment, 50% of children with FC remain symptomatic.

As introduced, experts believe that stooling avoidance is likely to be the most important factor for FC in toddlers and young children. This is due to the fact that this conditioned habitual response to painful bowel movement leads to stools becoming harder and larger and thus more painful evacuation, thus perpetuating the vicious cycle. Additionally, retained stools cause chronic distention of rectum, which will in turn lead to overflow incontinence. Amongst other individual items from the QPGS-RIII questionnaire related to FC, stooling avoidance improved significantly over time in both study groups. At diagnosis, around 80–90% of toddlers were reported to avoid stooling. At the end of the 2-month intervention, only 21–33% of all subjects were reported to exhibit stooling avoidance, of which most only once per week.

### Constipation in childhood [^bfa4470d]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Constipation in children is an often long-lasting pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorder with a worldwide prevalence varying between 0.7% and 29.6%, and estimated health-care costs of US$3.9 billion per year in the USA alone. The pathophysiology of childhood constipation is multifactorial and remains incompletely understood; however, withholding of stools, starting after an experience of a hard, painful, or frightening bowel movement is the most common cause found in children. A thorough medical history and physical examination, including a rectal examination in combination with a bowel diary, is sufficient in the majority of cases to diagnose constipation. The current standard treatment consists of education, toilet training, disimpaction, maintenance therapy and long-term follow-up. In the past decade, well-designed treatment trials in the pediatric population have emerged and long-term outcome studies have been completed. This Review summarizes the current knowledge of the clinical aspects of childhood constipation, including pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment, with particular emphasis on the latest available data.

### Evaluation and treatment of constipation in children and adolescents [^c345e7e1]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Childhood constipation is common and almost always functional without an organic etiology. Stool retention can lead to fecal incontinence in some patients. Often, a medical history and physical examination are sufficient to diagnose functional constipation. Further evaluation for Hirschsprung disease, a spinal cord abnormality, or a metabolic disorder may be warranted in a child with red flags, such as onset before one month of age, delayed passage of meconium after birth, failure to thrive, explosive stools, and severe abdominal distension. Successful therapy requires prevention and treatment of fecal impaction, with oral laxatives or rectal therapies. Polyethylene glycol-based solutions have become the mainstay of therapy, although other options, such as other osmotic or stimulant laxatives, are available. An increase in dietary fiber may improve the likelihood that laxatives can be discontinued in the future. Education is equally important as medical therapy and should include counseling families to recognize withholding behaviors; to use behavior interventions, such as regular toileting and reward systems; and to expect a chronic course with prolonged therapy, frequent relapses, and a need for close follow-up. Referral to a subspecialist is recommended only when there is concern for organic disease or when the constipation persists despite adequate therapy.

### Assessment and management of pediatric constipation for the primary care clinician [^d681215e]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Constipation is a common problem in pediatrics and accounts for 3–5% of all pediatric office visits and 10–25% of all pediatric gastroenterology referrals. Functional constipation accounts for about 95% of constipation cases, but "red flag" symptoms that suggest organic causes need to be considered. A diagnosis of functional constipation can be made in absence of "red flag" symptoms and a normal physical assessment. Physical assessment should focus on growth, abdominal exam, inspection of the perianal region, and examination of the lumbosacral region. Abdominal x-rays are generally not useful to differentiate between functional and organic causes of constipation. Treatment of constipation includes dietary changes, medication use, and behavioral modification. Osmotic laxatives are used as first-line treatment, and stimulant laxatives can be added if there is no improvement with osmotic laxatives. Despite improvement with laxatives, 40–50% of children with constipation experience at least 1 relapse in 5 years. Quality improvement opportunities exist for improving care of children with functional constipation by specialists partnering with primary care.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^67f3f88d]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation is a pediatric problem commonly encountered by many health care workers in primary, secondary, and tertiary care. To assist medical care providers in the evaluation and management of children with functional constipation, the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition were charged with the task of developing a uniform document of evidence-based guidelines.

Methods

Nine clinical questions addressing diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic topics were formulated. A systematic literature search was performed from inception to October 2011 using Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and PsychInfo databases. The approach of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation was applied to evaluate outcomes. For therapeutic questions, quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Grading the quality of evidence for the other questions was performed according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. During 3 consensus meetings, all recommendations were discussed and finalized. The group members voted on each recommendation, using the nominal voting technique. Expert opinion was used where no randomized controlled trials were available to support the recommendation.

Results

This evidence-based guideline provides recommendations for the evaluation and treatment of children with functional constipation to standardize and improve their quality of care. In addition, 2 algorithms were developed, one for the infants < 6 months of age and the other for older infants and children.

Conclusions

This document is intended to be used in daily practice and as a basis for further clinical research. Large well-designed clinical trials are necessary with regard to diagnostic evaluation and treatment.

### Evaluation and treatment of functional constipation in infants and children: evidence-based recommendations from ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN [^3abb5279]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2014). Medium credibility.

Functional constipation in children — outcome prioritization and evidence grading were standardized: The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to identify outcomes, and members rated outcome importance on a 9-point scale: limited (1–3), important but not critical (4–6), or critical (7–9) for decision making. Based on these ratings and patient preferences, 8 outcome measures were selected: pain during defecation, defecation ≥ 3 times per week, fecal incontinence frequency, difficulty with defecation, worsening constipation, quality of life, possible harm from laxatives (tolerance, adverse effects), and abdominal pain. For grading, diagnostic and prognostic questions used the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine classification, and therapeutic questions used GRADE; if no therapeutic studies were found, the quality of evidence was defined as "low".

### How do we define therapy-resistant constipation in children aged 4–18 years old? A systematic review with meta-narrative synthesis [^dab4ab02]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2024). High credibility.

Studies with description with prior medical therapy

11 studies with an explicit definition have considered prior medical therapy before being considered as therapy-resistant constipation. These therapies include maximum doses of osmotic and stimulant laxatives, and extensive behavioural therapy and toilet training. All three guidelines published by NICE, ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN, and Indian Academy of Paediatrics have defined the standard management. High-dose polyethylene glycol is used to evacuate the rectal faecal mass as the first step and rectal enemas and suppositories are used when there is poor response to polyethylene glycol. All three guidelines agreed on polyethylene glycol-based therapy as the first-line maintenance therapy for childhood constipation and stimulant laxatives are added when there is a poor response. Therefore, we believe that there should be consensus on the choice of drugs, their dosages, the order of usage of different laxatives, both oral and rectal laxatives and the duration of therapy. The recommended therapy in these guidelines can be used as a steppingstone in defining the optimal medical intervention before being labelled as therapy-resistant constipation.

Previous literature on defining therapy-resistant constipation

A previous systematic review analysing adult literature has also attempted to define pharmacologically therapy-resistant constipation in adults. In this study, 61 papers were reviewed to define pharmacologically therapy-resistant constipation. Similar to our findings, they also found the terminology of severe, refractory and intractable interchanging being used without consensus. In addition, the duration of therapy for constipation prior to be labelled as therapy resistant varied from 6 to 12 months with some studies not specifying the duration but only mentioning several years.

### ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN 2024 protocol for paediatric functional constipation treatment guidelines (standard operating procedure) [^1512778d]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

Approach to technical review

The technical reviews will be completed in line with methods guidance from Cochrane, the GRADE handbook, JCE (Journal of Clinical Epidemiology) GRADE guidelinesand our previously developed approaches to such guidelines:

Studies against placebo, no treatment and all active comparators will be considered. Network Meta-analysis will be deployed to triangulate findings and where certainty is high, moderate or low and clinical homogeneity exists, be presented as additional data with the use of appropriate Graphics On Recommendations Diagram Of Network Meta-analysis Plots. Subgroup analyses will be performed for outcome measures in the case of different comparator groups, given that heterogeneity and a sufficient volume of studies exist.
Outcome measures were based on the previous publication of a core outcome set for defining the treatment effects of FC in children. Following the GRADE handbook, outcomes were defined as critical, important or not important through a Delphi process and a face-to-face meeting held to agree on the final set of outcomes in May 2024 (stated below).
The GDG will complete a Delphi process to prospectively agree on the critical (primary) and important (secondary) outcomes of focus for the guideline and the decision thresholds for the outcome measures before proceeding to data analysis. The threshold ranges will be trivial, small, moderate and large treatment effects. These ranges will be identified for each of the included outcome measures separately. The limit of the small treatment effect will represent the minimally important clinical difference for GDG decision-making.
Key to the refinement of the specific questions will be to prioritise outcomes for use that were a reflection of the most clinically relevant and meaningful, as well as always balancing efficacy with safety.
Therapy delivered in all settings and by all professionals, as well as self-administered therapies will be considered but detailed extraction will gather such data to consider as a source of heterogeneity and to aid clinical interpretation.

Study selection

Types of studies

All published, unpublished and ongoing RCTs that compared interventions for the management of FC RC with other active interventions or standard therapy, placebo or no therapy will be considered for inclusion. Studies that described 'faecal impaction' will be considered in separate searches.

Observational studies could be considered for inclusion and GRADE only if they met the following criteria: large sample size, clear control of confounding factors and very large differences in effect between groups. Observational studies are not included in formal searches and the GDG will include these based on their knowledge of the field and reference searching of included studies.

Results

A total of 1535 studies were identified on a search conducted on the 3 November 2022, 1466, of which were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review. 69 studies were screened for eligibility. 25 studies were excluded: duplicates (16), opinion pieces (3) and literature/systematic reviews (3). A total of 47 studies (28 full papers, 16 abstracts and 3 trial registrations) were included and downloaded for data extraction as PDF files (figure 1).

Description and characteristics of included studies

The 47 studies included in the systematic review comprised 28 full papers, 3 clinical trial registrations and 16 abstracts. The year of publication of the studies was from 1996 to 2022. The studies came from diverse geographical regions; from North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, South America. Online supplemental table 1 provides study characteristics including design, definition of therapy-resistant constipation used by the researchers, terminology used to define therapy resistant constipation, duration of treatment before being diagnosed with therapy-resistant constipation and the source of reference.

Definitions of therapy-resistant constipation

There were at least seven clear definitions of therapy- resistant constipation for children in the published literature included in this review. Most of these variations are due to the duration of therapeutic interventions before labelling children as having therapy-resistant constipation and the terminology used to define therapy-resistant constipation. Some of them included refractory constipation: symptoms not responsive to conventional therapy, functional constipation unresponsive to optimal conventional treatment for at least 3 months, chronic constipation not responding to maximum laxative therapy, behavioural therapy and toilet-training programme with duration of symptoms of > 2 years, and all children presenting with chronic constipation and showing no response to rigorous medical management over a period of 1 month or more. It is important to note that 10 articles had no clear definition at all.

Terminology (refractory or intractable)

21 studiesused the word refractory while 24 studiesused the word intractable to describe treatment resistant constipation. Two studies used refractory and intractable interchangeably.

### Variability in the management of childhood constipation [^cd343341]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

To assist primary care providers, the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) published clinical practice guidelines for management of childhood constipation. A cross-sectional survey of pediatricians from across the United States was conducted to assess pediatricians' constipation management strategies, whether pediatricians are familiar with the NASPGHAN constipation guidelines, and reasons pediatricians refer constipated patients to a pediatric gastroenterologist. Overall, 75% of pediatricians used polyethylene glycol without electrolytes to treat childhood constipation, 8% of pediatricians were aware NASPGHAN had published constipation guidelines, and parental pressure was just one reason pediatricians referred constipated patients to a pediatric gastroenterologist.

### The use of two comfort young child formulas in the dietary management of toddlers with functional constipation: a randomized controlled trial [^c9e7fc22]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Method

Study design and population

This was a multi-centre, randomised, controlled, open-label trial, where randomization of study participants to each of the two treatment arms was based on a computer-generated sequence in blocks of 10, performed by a third-party. A total of 95 subjects were included in the study. Inclusion criteria were: I) full-term, healthy toddlers, II) with a birth weight between the 10 th and 90 th percentile, III) between 12 and 32 months of age, IV) formula-fed before and during the entire intervention period, V) with a history of hard stools, VI) with functional constipation (based on Rome III criteria), VII) parents willing to sign the written informed consent. Toddlers were not eligible for the study if they met any of the following criteria: I) diagnosed with other gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. coeliac or Hirschsprung's disease, etc.), II) severe acquired or congenital disease, mental, metabolic of physical diseases, III) cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA), or parents/siblings with documented CMPA, IV) perceived lactose intolerance, V) with constipation attributable to organic or anatomic causes, VI) unwillingness to stop usage of supplemented with fibres, probiotics and/or prebiotics two weeks before and during the study period, VII) considered to be a non-responder to laxatives, i.e. more than 5 times unsuccessful treatment with laxatives, VIII) medication use known or suspected to affect fat digestion, absorption and/or metabolism, IX) participation in another clinical trial, X) breastfeeding 1 month before study enrolment.

Sample size

The sample size was calculated based on the estimated difference of 30% fewer hard stool occasions in the test group. During a two-tailed test, with an α of 5% and β of 20%, each group ideally comprised 42 subjects. Taking into account a dropout rate of 15%, 48 subjects were required per group.

Given some evidence showing early therapy favorably affects outcome, the algorithms use children who fulfill the Rome III criteria for constipation, except for the duration, and "the group agreed that the 2-month interval listed in the Rome III criteria for older children may unduly delay treatment in some children with defecation".

### The use of two comfort young child formulas in the dietary management of toddlers with functional constipation: a randomized controlled trial [^31cd229f]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The study reported here assessed the efficacy of two different commercially available Comfort young child formulas (YCFs) in Mexico in 2019 with regards to their applicability in the dietary management of toddlers with functional constipation (FC). Despite differences in the composition of the two study formulae (e.g. different protein fractions, fat blends, lactose and fibre content, and presence/absence of a probiotic), both study groups showed significant improvements in FC symptoms over time. As expected, total percentages of hard stools, as well as other symptoms related to FC decreased after initial pharmacological treatment with PEG. During the intervention, stooling parameters assessed in this study improved even further, and, most importantly, did not relapse throughout the post-maintenance phase. During the post-maintenance phase, none of the subjects were prescribed any laxatives. In contrast, in a study by Modin et al. (2018), on the use of PEG in maintenance treatment for childhood FC, the median time to the use of rescue medication in the control group, which discontinued use of PEG, was 27 days (range: 3–64 days). Therefore, lack of laxative use in our study, supports the benefits of study formulas for maintenance of good stooling parameters beyond the pharmacological treatment period. No significant differences were observed between groups. However, a tendency towards a lower percentage of subjects suffering from FC was found at the end of the study for the test group compared to the control group, respectively 9 vs 21% (p = 0.107). This is further substantiated by the number needed to treat (NNT) for FC, which was 8.3 in favour of the test formula at the end of the study period. NNT estimates the effectiveness of a treatment, and in this case it indicates that 8.3 patients need to be given treatment formula to get one more patient better, compared to control treatment.

Bristol Stool Scale (BSS)

There were no significant between-group differences in any of the stooling parameters throughout the study. Overall, number and percentages of hard stools were low in both groups (see Fig. 3). The overall percentage of hard stools in the test group was similar to that of the control group (respectively 5.02 ± 10.06 vs 2.99 ± 5.21, p = 0.350). The percentage of hard stools in the control group was 3.18 ± 5.79 and 7. ± 15. in the test group during the maintenance phase (p = 0.154), while in post-maintenance phase it was 2.83 ± 7.22 in the control versus 3.92 ± 10.43 in the test group (p = 0.829). The mixed model analysis did not show any differences in stool frequency between the study groups (p = 0.754), nor in time (p = 0.434), or in the interaction between group and visit (p = 0.777). On average the weekly stool frequency was 9.58 ± 3.84 in the test group and 9.64 ± 3.49 in the control group. In addition, the percentage of subjects who were reported to have a hard stool on one or more occasions throughout the intervention were similar for the test (55.6%) and control (55.3%) groups. Although not significantly different, during the post-maintenance phase, the percentage of subjects reported to have hard stools was lower for the test compared to the control group (22.2% vs. 29.8%; p = 0.409).

Results

Study population

96 subjects were enrolled in the study and randomized to a treatment, as shown in Fig. 2. One subject was excluded from analysis, as it did not meet the inclusion criteria regarding age. Two toddlers, of the test group, were lost to follow-up, as their parents decided not to continue with the study. The analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, which included n = 47 subjects of the test group, and n = 48 subjects of the control group.

Participants flow-chart, from potential enrolment until study completion

The demographics of both study groups are presented in Table 2. Groups were well matched with regards to gestational age, birthweight, and baseline age and anthropometrics. In addition, similar numbers of subjects in each group attended childcare or had other significant caregivers, such as grandparents, siblings, and aunts.

In addition to the study groups being well matched at baseline, assessment of the simplified FFQ as showed no significant differences in feeding practices (i.e. estimated fibre and fluid intake). Moreover, no antibiotic use was reported at any point throughout the intervention and none of the subjects were reported to use any laxatives during the post-maintenance period.

### Novel and alternative therapies for childhood constipation [^aeb7cb54]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common and distressing pediatric problem. Even if prevalence of this disorder has increased, treatment of constipation in children is still largely based on clinical experience rather than on evidence-based studies. The currently recommended treatment includes education, disimpaction, and maintenance therapy, consisting of dietary changes, behavioral modification, and use of laxatives. Among osmotic agents, polyethylene glycol solutions appear to be the first-line drug to use in pediatrics. Although these measures are effective in the majority of children, a sizable proportion needs long-term therapy. Chronicity may significantly interfere with the child's emotional growth and development. Advances in the understanding of the gastrointestinal enteric nervous system and epithelial function have led to the development of new classes of drugs. These include substances that bind to serotonin receptors or are chloride channel activators. Further studies are needed to assess the benefits and the risks of these new drugs.

### Osmotic and stimulant laxatives for the management of childhood constipation [^4f18c9ed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Constipation within childhood is an extremely common problem. Despite the widespread use of osmotic and stimulant laxatives by health professionals to manage constipation in children, there has been a long standing paucity of high quality evidence to support this practice.

Objectives

We set out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of osmotic and stimulant laxatives used to treat functional childhood constipation.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Trials Register from inception to 10 March 2016. There were no language restrictions. We also searched the references of all included studies, personal contacts and drug companies to identify studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compared osmotic or stimulant laxatives to placebo or another intervention, with participants aged 0 to 18 years old were considered for inclusion. The primary outcome was frequency of defecation. Secondary endpoints included faecal incontinence, disimpaction, need for additional therapies and adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Relevant papers were identified and two authors independently assessed the eligibility of trials, extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The primary outcome was frequency of defecation. Secondary endpoints included faecal incontinence, disimpaction, need for additional therapies and adverse events. For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI using a fixed-effect model. The Chi(2) and I(2) statistics were used to assess statistical heterogeneity. A random-effects model was used in situations of unexplained heterogeneity. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

Twenty-five RCTs (2310 participants) were included in the review. Fourteen studies were judged to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective reporting. Meta-analysis of two studies (101 patients) comparing polyethylene glycol (PEG) with placebo showed a significantly increased number of stools per week with PEG (MD 2.61 stools per week, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.08). Common adverse events in the placebo-controlled studies included flatulence, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea and headache. Participants receiving high dose PEG (0.7 g/kg) had significantly more stools per week than low dose PEG (0.3 g/kg) participants (1 study, 90 participants, MD 1.30, 95% 0.76 to 1.84). Meta-analysis of 6 studies with 465 participants comparing PEG with lactulose showed a significantly greater number of stools per week with PEG (MD 0.70, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.31), although follow-up was short. Patients who received PEG were significantly less likely to require additional laxative therapies. Eighteen per cent (27/154) of PEG patients required additional therapies compared to 31% (47/150) of lactulose patients (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.83). No serious adverse events were reported with either agent. Common adverse events in these studies included diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and pruritis ani. Meta-analysis of 3 studies with 211 participants comparing PEG with milk of magnesia showed that the stools per week were significantly greater with PEG (MD 0.69, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.89). However, the magnitude of this difference was quite small and may not be clinically significant. One child was noted to be allergic to PEG, but there were no other serious adverse events reported. One study found a significant difference in stools per week favouring milk of magnesia over lactulose (MD -1.51, 95% CI -2.63 to -0.39, 50 patients), Meta-analysis of 2 studies with 287 patients comparing liquid paraffin (mineral oil) with lactulose revealed a relatively large statistically significant difference in the number of stools per week favouring liquid paraffin (MD 4.94, 95% CI 4.28 to 5.61). No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events included abdominal pain, distention and watery stools. No statistically significant differences in the number of stools per week were found between PEG and enemas (1 study, 90 patients, MD 1.00, 95% CI -1.58 to 3.58), dietary fibre mix and lactulose (1 study, 125 patients, P = 0.481), senna and lactulose (1 study, 21 patients, P > 0.05), lactitol and lactulose (1 study, 51 patients, MD -0.80, 95% CI -2.63 to 1.03), hydrolyzed guar gum and lactulose (1 study, 61 patients, MD 1.00, 95% CI -1.80 to 3.80), PEG and flixweed (1 study, 109 patients, MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.33), PEG and dietary fibre (1 study, 83 patients, MD 0.20, 95% CI -0.64 to 1.04), and PEG and liquid paraffin (2 studies, 261 patients, MD 0.35, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.95).

Authors' Conclusions

The pooled analyses suggest that PEG preparations may be superior to placebo, lactulose and milk of magnesia for childhood constipation. GRADE analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (number of stools per week) was low or very low due to sparse data, inconsistency (heterogeneity), and high risk of bias in the studies in the pooled analyses. Thus, the results of the pooled analyses should be interpreted with caution because of quality and methodological concerns, as well as clinical heterogeneity, and short follow-up. There is also evidence suggesting the efficacy of liquid paraffin (mineral oil). There is no evidence to demonstrate the superiority of lactulose when compared to the other agents studied, although there is a lack of placebo controlled studies. Further research is needed to investigate the long term use of PEG for childhood constipation, as well as the role of liquid paraffin. The optimal dose of PEG also warrants further investigation.

Pediatric refractory constipation (RC) — definition and criteria: The authors recommend that pediatric RC be defined by the presence of 4 specific clinical criteria, explicitly requiring ongoing constipation symptoms in children who meet Rome IV criteria for pediatric FC with failure to improve after a minimum of 3 months, usage of age- and developmentally appropriate conventional constipation therapies, and impaired QoL. Ongoing symptoms are defined by ≤ 2 voluntary defecations per week and/or ≥ 1 episode of fecal incontinence per week. Conventional constipation therapies should include the use of daily stimulant laxatives at appropriate dosages in addition to behavioral and biomechanical interventions (Agreement 8/8). The authors agreed upon a 3-month duration of ongoing symptoms per these parameters.

### Constipation in children and adolescents: evaluation and treatment [^6f853691]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Constipation in children is usually functional constipation without an organic cause. Organic causes of constipation in children, which include Hirschsprung disease, cystic fibrosis, and spinal cord abnormalities, commonly present with red flag signs and symptoms. A history and physical examination can diagnose functional constipation using the Rome IV diagnostic criteria. The first goal of managing constipation is to treat fecal impaction, and then maintenance therapy is used to prevent a recurrence. Polyethylene glycol is the first-line treatment for constipation. Second-line options include lactulose and enemas. Increasing dietary fiber and fluid intake above usual daily recommendations and adding probiotics provide no additional benefits for treating constipation. Frequent follow-up visits and referrals to a psychologist can assist in reaching some treatment goals. Clinicians should educate caregivers about the chronic course of functional constipation, frequent relapses, and the potential for prolonged therapy. Clinicians should acknowledge caregivers' specific challenges and the negative effects of constipation on the child's quality of life. Referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist is recommended when there is a concern for organic causes or constipation persists despite adequate therapy.

Introduction

Prevalence of childhood constipation has been estimated at 0.7% to 29.6% in the general population worldwide; most children have no obvious aetiological factors. One third of children with chronic constipation continue to have problems beyond puberty. Half of children with chronic faecal impaction and faecal incontinence have experienced an episode of painful defecation, and many children with chronic constipation exhibit withholding behaviour.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for children with chronic constipation? What are the effects of treatments for clearing the bowel in children with faecal impaction? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 14 systematic reviews and RCTs that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: anal dilatation, behavioural treatments (biofeedback, diaries, or toilet training), bulk-forming laxatives, enemas, faecal softeners, fibre, macrogols, oral fluids, osmotic laxatives, prebiotics, probiotics, stimulant laxatives, and surgical disimpaction.

QPGS-RIII (section E)

Prior to the intervention, all subjects met two or more diagnostic criteria for FC (Rome III). As shown in Fig. 4, the percentage of subjects meeting at least 2 of the Rome III criteria dropped significantly after medical treatment with PEG and the first week of intervention (p < 0.0001). At the end of the maintenance phase (i.e. week 4), this percentage was even reduced further, 22% in the test group and 19% in the control group, but not different between study groups (p = 0.718). Overall, weekly percentages of subjects meeting 2 or more criteria for FC remained low throughout the post-maintenance phase, which varied between 7 and 18% in the test group, and 13 and 23% in the control group. In the test group, the percentage of toddlers meeting two or more FC criteria at the end of the study (week 8) tended to be lower compared to the control group (9% vs. 21%, p = 0.107).

Similar results were found when looking at individual items listed in QPGS-RIII related to FC. No significant differences between groups were observed, but all individual items significantly improved with time (p < 0.05), as can be seen in Table 3.

Bristol Stool Scale (BSS)

The Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) is a validated, visual scale, which enables parents to provide doctors and researchers with an accurate description of characteristics of their toddler's stools. The scale allows classification of stool form in 7 types, ranging from "separate hard lumps like nuts" (type 1) to "watery, no solid pieces" (type 7). Type 1 and type 2 ("sausage-shaped, but lumpy") stools are considered to be 'hard stools' and a sign of constipation. Parents were asked to complete the BSS every time their child defecated throughout the course of the study. If on any day the BSS was not completed, it was assumed that the subject did not have any bowel movements on that particular day. The BSS was used to assess overall frequency (%) of reported hard stools (type 1 and 2), overall stooling frequency, and percentage (%) of toddlers with hard stools. The frequency of hard stools was calculated as the number of hard stools divided by the number of total stools times 100.

QPGS-RIII (section E)

The validated Rome III Questionnaire on Paediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms (QPGS-RIII) for infants and toddlers is a parent-reported questionnaire of their child's symptoms, useful for diagnosing Rome III diagnoses for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), like FC (section E). In the QPGS-RIII (section E), the Rome III criteria were reworded in questions about symptoms which are understandable by parents/caregivers. The translated Rome III criteria are: defecation frequency of two or less times per week, hard or very hard stools, passing of stools during sleep, pain during defecation, large stools, stool present in rectum (as diagnosed by health care professional). For the purpose of this study, the QPGS-RIII (section E) was modified to ask parents about the past week, and parents were asked to complete the questionnaire at the end of every week during the intervention period. To be diagnosed with FC, a child should meet at least two of the Rome III criteria.

### The use of two comfort young child formulas in the dietary management of toddlers with functional constipation: a randomized controlled trial [^fe151a88]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

In this research we used the BSS as well as the QPGS-RIII (section E). Results showed overall low percentages of hard stools using the BSS as well as percentage of children with FC based on Rome III criteria. Whilst neither assessment tool showed significant differences between groups, there were some discrepancies in results from both measures. The number of subjects meeting two or more Rome III criteria for FC as well as the frequency of hard stools were slightly lower in the test group based on the QPGS-RIII, whilst overall percentage of hard stools was slightly lower in the control group based on the BSS. A study assessing the agreement of both measures in relation to stool consistency as well as the prevalence of FC found similar differences. Authors reported fair agreement between the two methods with regards to stool consistency (κ = 0.335, p < 0.001). However, they did report excellent agreement between the BSS and Rome III criteria for assessing the prevalence of FC. Differences in parental reports of stool consistency using these two measures might be due to the fact that the BSS provides a visual stimulus, making it easier for parents to identify the consistency of their toddler's stool. In addition, using the BSS, consistency for every stooling occasion is recorded, whereas in the case of the QPGS-RIII, parents are presented with multiple choice answers to best describe the usual appearance of their child's stool (e.g. "hard or very hard", "not too hard and not too soft"). The current study had several limitations. First, the intervention period, especially the post-maintenance phase, was relatively short. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn with regards to the long-term efficacy of Comfort YCF. Furthermore, the study was only blinded to the statistician, but not the principal investigators or parents/caregivers of the subjects, as commercial products were used. The effects observed in this study maybe specific to the tested formulas, and therefore should not be generalised to other products available on the market. Additionally, although detailed data on formula adherence were not available, the significant improvements observed over the course of the study and specifically after the laxative treatment, indicate that the consumed products were effective. In future studies, milk intake data, as well as parents satisfaction with the treatment and willingness to continue with the formula are interesting outcomes to take along. In this study a questionnaire based on Rome III criteria was used, whilst a questionnaire based on Rome IV criteria is nowadays also available. However, the criteria for FC are very similar. As also indicated by Russo et al. who compared the Rome III and Rome IV criteria for the diagnosis of FC, and showed that the different criteria have a good alignment in the number of diagnoses. So we believe that the results of this study are still valid in light of Rome IV, which only shows small differences with Rome III criteria. Finally, one of the three study sites, in addition to providing study formulas, educated parents and caregivers on ways to increase dietary fibre intake, whereas the other two sites did not. This did not lead to any differences in study outcomes, as neither 'study site' or 'estimated fibre intake' were found to have a significant effect in data analysis. Lack of finding any effect of potential differences in fibre intake could also be contributed to the use of a simplified FFQ, which was inadequate to properly assess dietary fibre intake.

### Systematic literature review and meta-analysis on therapeutic management of faecal impaction in the paediatric population [^50dec72d]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2025). High credibility.

When considering the review itself, one of the potential limitations is related to the lack of definitions for FI. We chose to use the studies reporting of this as the key criteria for considering the patients, rather than considering the full range of childhood constipation literature. There may be an overlap with some studies offering therapy for impaction as part of a constipation protocol and essentially in combination with long-term therapy, but we have not included these. It is also important to note that the nature of the interventions in this review is such that many do not support viable blinding. This leads to difficult decisions within GRADE and is a source of potential subjectivity. Finally, the reporting within the primary studies was limited in a number of ways that hampered the review. Despite best efforts to use methods that minimised the impact, such as contacting primary authors.

Currently, there are no clear implications for practice from this review and this is a reflection of the many issues we have raised in this discussion. This does not mean therapies should not be used, but rather that no high-quality evidence exists to guide choices or a specific therapy in this context. This is despite how common this clinical paradigm presents and how often these therapies are used in the clinical setting.

There are substantial implications for research. A consensus definition on FI is vital. It is possible that this chooses to view the condition as standalone or as a symptom of constipation but defining how long symptoms need to occur and how to diagnose is vital to support research. Once a definition exists, key outcomes of interest can also be agreed. This is contentious and a source of heterogeneity in this review and needs a consensus to support future investigation. The combination of clear definitions and critical outcomes will then support further research. Issues with risk of bias must be addressed. We would also suggest the choice of interventions for study should be made with formal consultation with stakeholders, including patients, in line with other approaches in the field. This will not only ensure relevance of studies but that a focus on key interventions will allow a high certainty outcome to be achieved with good precision.

Rome III diagnostic criteria — functional constipation in children require that "In the absence of organic pathology, ≥ 2 of the following must occur". For a child "with a developmental age < 4 years", qualifying features include " ≤ 2 defecations per week", "At least 1 episode of incontinence per week after the acquisition of toileting skills", "History of excessive stool retention", "History of painful or hard bowel movements", "Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum", and "History of large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet". For a child "with a developmental age ≥ 4 years with insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome†", features include " ≤ 2 defecations in the toilet per week", "At least 1 episode of fecal incontinence per week", "History of retentive posturing or excessive volitional stool retention", "History of painful or hard bowel movements", "Presence of a large fecal mass in the rectum", and "History of large-diameter stools that may obstruct the toilet". Timeframes specify that children "up to 4 years have to fulfill ≥ 2 of the criteria for at least 1 month, whereas those > 4 years need to fulfill ≥ 2 of the criteria for at least 2 months", and for the older group, "Criteria fulfilled at least once per week for at least 2 months before diagnosis". The document notes that "Abdominal pain is a frequent associated symptom, but its presence is not considered a criterion for functional constipation".

Functional constipation prognostic factors — Table 7 indicates there is limited/insufficient evidence for prognostic value of several demographics/history factors (age at presentation, age at onset, duration of symptoms < 3 mo before presentation, treatment duration < 2 mo before presentation, premature birth, delayed passage of meconium, history of constipation in the first year of life), clinical symptoms (defecation frequency, presence of fecal incontinence, abdominal pain at presentation/history of abdominal pain, large stools, urinary tract infection, nighttime urinary incontinence, stool withholding), and physical examination (absence of a rectal or abdominal mass), with additional examination findings (balloon defecation, relaxation of external sphincter, megarectum and/or megacolon at diagnosis) also limited. There is limited evidence for a negative prognostic value for prolonged CTT, and there is strong evidence that sex and positive family history have no prognostic value.

### Constipation: beyond the old paradigms [^7d5e8a2a]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Constipation is a common problem in children. Although most children respond to conventional treatment, symptoms persist in a minority. For children with refractory constipation, anorectal and colonic manometry testing can identify a rectal evacuation disorder or colonic motility disorder and guide subsequent management. Novel medications used in adults with constipation are beginning to be used in children, with promising results. Biofeedback therapy and anal sphincter botulinum toxin injection can be considered for children with a rectal evacuation disorder. Surgical management of constipation includes the use of antegrade continence enemas, sacral nerve stimulation, and colonic resection.

### Prevalence, symptoms and outcome of constipation in infants and toddlers [^4385d947]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of constipation in children ≤ 2 years, describe the symptoms of constipation, and review how often specific interventions were effective.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Results

Of 4,157 children < 2 years of age, 185 children had constipation. The prevalence rate for constipation in the first year of life was 2.9%, and in the second year of life, the rate was 10.1%. Functional constipation was the cause in 97% of the children. Boys and girls were affected with equal frequency. Constipation was caused by an underlying organic disease in 1.6% of cases, and 97% of the children had functional constipation. Dietary changes and corn syrup were the initial treatment suggestions for 116 children; 93% of these children underwent follow-up examinations, and the constipation resolved in 25% of the children. Of 100 children treated with milk of magnesia or polyethylene glycol 3350 without electrolytes, 93 children underwent follow-up examinations, and the constipation was resolved with treatment in 92% of the children.

Conclusions

Dietary changes, corn syrup, or both resolved constipation in 25% of children, and laxatives resolved constipation in 92% of children. Both milk of magnesia and polyethylene glycol were efficient and safe in infants and toddlers.
