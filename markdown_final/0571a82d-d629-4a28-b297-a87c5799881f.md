## Question

Blood pressure goal post tnk for acute stroke

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate blood pressure goals after tenecteplase (TNK) for acute ischemic stroke, including whether they differ from alteplase and how reperfusion status modifies targets. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline anchors for IV thrombolysis. Then, I should verify whether TNK-specific guidance aligns with alteplase or diverges. Next, I will examine how endovascular therapy (EVT) and reperfusion status change targets. After that, I should review randomized and mechanistic evidence to justify stricter targets in reperfused patients. Finally, I will synthesize practical, time-based recommendations and note exceptions and monitoring requirements, making sure I reconcile any conflicting data before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the core guideline anchor. The AHA/ASA 2019 guideline states that after IV alteplase, blood pressure should be maintained at less than 180/105 mmHg for at least the first 24 hours, and this threshold traces back to the RCT protocols that required SBP less than 185 mmHg and DBP less than 110 mmHg before treatment and less than 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours after treatment, which establishes the default post-thrombolysis target many centers adopt [^117LPTUw] [^115ocfJi].

> Wait, let me verify whether TNK-specific guidance differs. The AHA/ASA 2019 update positions tenecteplase as a reasonable alternative to alteplase in eligible patients, including those proceeding to thrombectomy, but it does not prescribe a different post-thrombolysis BP target for TNK; operationally, the same less than 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours framework is applied, and contemporary interventional society guidance explicitly recommends SBP less than 185 mmHg and DBP less than 110 mmHg for 24 hours after IV TNK or alteplase, reinforcing harmonization of targets across fibrinolytics [^112DGYXR] [^1132mxzB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about EVT patients. I initially thought the post-EVT target was uniformly less than 140/90 mmHg, but I should double-check that. The BEST-II randomized trial tested SBP targets less than 140 mmHg and less than 160 mmHg versus less than or equal to 180 mmHg after successful reperfusion and found no signal favoring lower targets and even suggested potential harm with very low targets; thus, my earlier inclination toward a universal less than 140 mmHg target was too aggressive and not supported by BEST-II, so I need to correct that and avoid overgeneralization [^114UQuVP]. Let me reconsider: current guidance suggests it is reasonable to consider lower BP parameters after successful EVT, but the evidence is limited and inconsistent, so any stricter target should be individualized and cautiously applied rather than adopted as a blanket rule [^1132mxzB].

> Next, I should review the mechanistic and observational signals that motivate tighter control after reperfusion. Post hoc analyses from ENCHANTED show that lower attained SBP and less SBP variability over the first 24 hours correlate with better functional outcomes and fewer intracranial hemorrhages, with favorable shifts seen even when mean SBP is around 110–120 mmHg, although the randomized comparison of intensive versus guideline targets did not show improved functional outcomes despite fewer ICH events, underscoring that correlation does not equal causation and that trial design limitations may have blunted effect detection [^111hhTJV] [^113o4Bi6] [^115iD2Rm]. But wait, what if we apply this to EVT patients specifically? The BP-TARGET trial in successfully reperfused EVT patients did not show clinical benefit from intensive SBP lowering to 100–129 mmHg versus 130–185 mmHg, and BEST-II likewise failed to show benefit of lower SBP targets, so I should be cautious not to extrapolate ENCHANTED's IVT signals directly to post-EVT care without supportive RCT outcomes [^111S9ekU] [^114UQuVP].

> I will now examine how reperfusion status should modify targets in practice. For patients who achieve successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b/3), many centers reasonably aim for a stricter SBP target, often 120–160/70–90 mmHg, to mitigate reperfusion hemorrhage risk, but I need to ensure this is framed as expert consensus rather than definitive guideline mandate; indeed, interventional guidance allows consideration of lower parameters after successful reperfusion, while acknowledging the evidence gap, and BEST-II cautions against overly aggressive lowering, so any such stricter target should be balanced against hypotension risk and individualized to perfusion needs [^116mGyeG] [^1132mxzB] [^114UQuVP]. Conversely, in patients with incomplete reperfusion or persistent large-vessel occlusion, maintaining higher perfusion pressures may be necessary to protect the penumbra, so a less stringent SBP ceiling near the less than 180/105 mmHg default may be appropriate while definitive reperfusion is pursued, with close neurologic and hemodynamic monitoring guiding adjustments [^1166pEAi].

> Let me synthesize practical, time-based recommendations while keeping the evidence hierarchy in mind. For the first 24 hours after IV TNK, maintain SBP less than 185 mmHg and DBP less than 110 mmHg, using labetalol, nicardipine, or clevidipine with frequent monitoring, and escalate therapy promptly if thresholds are exceeded; this aligns with AHA/ASA and interventional guidance and is the most defensible default given RCT protocol precedents and safety considerations [^1132mxzB]. After successful EVT with mTICI 2b/3, it is reasonable to consider a lower SBP target such as 120–160 mmHg if the patient tolerates it and there is no evidence of hypoperfusion, recognizing that BEST-II did not demonstrate benefit of lower targets and that hypotension must be avoided; if there is any neurologic decline or concern for hypoperfusion, allow higher pressures to preserve collateral flow while reassessing reperfusion status [^114UQuVP] [^116mGyeG]. For patients without reperfusion or with incomplete recanalization, maintain SBP less than 180/105 mmHg and avoid aggressive lowering that could compromise penumbral perfusion pending further reperfusion efforts, adjusting as the clinical picture evolves [^1166pEAi].

> I should confirm monitoring cadence and safety checks. During and after IV thrombolysis, measure BP every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then hourly to 24 hours, with increased frequency if SBP exceeds 180 mmHg or DBP exceeds 105 mmHg, and obtain a follow-up CT or MRI at 24 hours before initiating antithrombotics; hold antiplatelets and anticoagulants for 24 hours and treat hyperglycemia, as these steps reduce hemorrhagic complications and are standard across thrombolysis protocols [^113239ng] [^112Nxgov]. But wait, what if symptoms worsen or headache develops? I need to ensure emergent neuroimaging is obtained and the infusion or adjuncts are paused if hemorrhage is suspected, consistent with alteplase-era safety practices that remain applicable to TNK given shared hemorrhagic risks [^113239ng].

> Next, I should review special populations and edge cases. In patients with minor stroke and no large-vessel occlusion, tenecteplase 0.4 mg/kg has been studied but has not proven superiority and may carry more bleeding risk, so if used, the same less than 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours target still applies; in patients with unknown onset selected only by noncontrast CT, ESO advises against TNK outside trials, so BP management should follow nonreperfused stroke principles rather than post-thrombolysis targets until imaging selection is clarified [^111vUHRt] [^112GDghr] [^1133MTDE]. For patients not receiving reperfusion therapy with markedly elevated BP, consider cautious lowering by about 15% in the first 24 hours if SBP is 220 mmHg or higher or DBP is 120 mmHg or higher, balancing ischemia risk against acute hypertensive complications, and avoid routine antihypertensive initiation in stable patients with BP less than 220/120 mmHg in the first 48–72 hours [^114rDHyQ] [^1165n1d2].

> Let me reconsider the overall hierarchy to ensure internal consistency. Default post-TNK target for 24 hours is SBP less than 185 mmHg and DBP less than 110 mmHg, harmonized with alteplase protocols and contemporary interventional guidance; after successful reperfusion, it is reasonable to individualize toward 120–160 mmHg if tolerated, acknowledging the absence of definitive RCT benefit and the potential harm of excessive lowering; with incomplete reperfusion, avoid aggressive BP reduction and maintain less than 180/105 mmHg to protect penumbral flow while pursuing recanalization, with all adjustments grounded in frequent neurologic assessments and imaging when indicated [^1132mxzB] [^114UQuVP] [^1166pEAi].

The blood pressure goal after tenecteplase (TNK) for acute ischemic stroke is to **maintain BP < 180/105 mmHg for at least 24 hours** [^117LPTUw] following thrombolysis, consistent with alteplase protocols [^113hzwmU]. If the patient undergoes successful endovascular thrombectomy (mTICI 2b/3), **consider a lower SBP target of 120–160 mmHg** [^116mGyeG] to reduce reperfusion hemorrhage risk, balancing ischemia risk [^111S9ekU]. Avoid **SBP < 120 mmHg** or rapid drops > 15% to prevent hypoperfusion and infarct expansion [^1137f5dX]. Monitor BP every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then hourly for 16 hours; treat elevations with IV labetalol or nicardipine to stay within target ranges [^113239ng].

## Recommended blood pressure targets after tenecteplase administration

### General guideline for all patients receiving tenecteplase

Maintain **BP < 180/105 mmHg for at least 24 hours** [^117LPTUw] after TNK, consistent with alteplase protocols [^116Hcn7S].

---

### Special consideration: patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy (EVT)

After successful reperfusion (mTICI 2b/3), **consider a lower SBP target of 120–160 mmHg** [^116mGyeG] to reduce reperfusion hemorrhage risk, balancing ischemia risk [^1132mxzB].

---

## Evidence supporting blood pressure targets

- **ENCHANTED trial**: Intensive SBP lowering to 130–140 mmHg reduced ICH but did not improve functional outcomes vs < 180 mmHg [^113o4Bi6]; supports avoiding aggressive lowering below 120 mmHg [^notfound].

- **BEST-II trial**: Lower SBP targets (< 140 or < 160 mmHg) after EVT did not improve outcomes vs ≤ 180 mmHg, suggesting caution with overly aggressive targets [^114UQuVP].

- **BP-TARGET trial**: Intensive SBP lowering to 100–129 mmHg after EVT did not reduce radiographic ICH vs 130–185 mmHg, indicating no clear benefit from very low targets [^111S9ekU].

---

## Risks associated with deviating from recommended blood pressure targets

### Elevated blood pressure

Higher SBP increases **ICH risk** and worsens outcomes after thrombolysis [^115ocfJi]; strict control is essential [^113hzwmU].

---

### Excessive blood pressure lowering

Rapid or excessive BP lowering can cause **hypoperfusion**, infarct expansion, and neurological deterioration; avoid SBP < 120 mmHg or drops > 15% [^1137f5dX].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring individualized blood pressure management

- **Large vessel occlusion (LVO)**: Tailor BP to balance perfusion and hemorrhage risk [^1166pEAi].

- **High NIHSS**: Consider stricter control to limit reperfusion injury [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Adjust targets for cardiac or renal disease as indicated [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

- **Monitoring frequency**: Every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then hourly for 16 hours [^113239ng].

- **Antihypertensive agents**: Use IV labetalol or nicardipine to maintain targets; avoid rapid fluctuations [^notfound].

- **Neurological assessments**: Perform concurrent with BP checks to detect deterioration early [^113239ng].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended bp target** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| General post-TNK | < 180/105 mmHg | ≥ 24 hours [^113hzwmU] |
| Successful EVT (mTICI 2b/3) | 120–160 mmHg (SBP) | 24 hours [^116mGyeG] |
| Avoid rapid BP drops | Avoid SBP < 120 mmHg or > 15% decrease | First 24 hours [^notfound] |

---

The BP goal after TNK is **< 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours** [^notfound]; after successful EVT, consider 120–160 mmHg SBP while avoiding SBP < 120 mmHg or rapid drops. Individualize based on LVO, NIHSS, and comorbidities, and monitor closely to balance hemorrhage and ischemia risks.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase during thrombectomy for acute stroke (BRETIS-TNK II): rationale and design [^112RoYLM]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Our recent pilot study suggests intra-arterial tenecteplase (TNK) during the first pass of endovascular treatment (EVT) seems safe, may increase first-pass reperfusion and good outcome in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients with large-vessel occlusion (LVO).

Aims

To determine the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial TNK administration during EVT in AIS-LVO patients presenting up to 24 hours from symptom onset.

Sample size estimates

A maximum of 380 patients are required to test the superiority hypothesis with 80% power according to a two-side 0.05 level of significance, stratified by age, gender, baseline systolic blood pressure, prestroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS), baseline National Institute of Health stroke scale, baseline ASPECTS, time from onset to groin puncture, intravenous thrombolysis before EVT, stroke territory and stroke aetiology.

Design

Intra-arterial TNK during thrombectomy for acute stroke (BRETIS-TNK II) study is a prospective, randomised, adaptive enrichment, open-label, blinded end point, multicentre study. Eligible AIS-LVO patients are randomly assigned into the experimental group and control group with a ratio of 1:1. The experimental group will be treated with intra-arterial infusion of TNK during EVT. The control group will be treated with standard EVT.

Outcome

The primary end point is a favourable outcome, defined as an mRS score of 0–2 at 90 days. The primary safety end point is symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 48 hours, which is defined as an increase in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of ≥ 4 points as a result of the intracranial haemorrhage.

Conclusions

The results of BRETIS-TNK II will provide evidence for the efficacy and safety of intra-arterial TNK administration during EVT in AIS patients with LVO.

To minimise the risk of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), several strategies are in place: (1) Aside from procedurally administered heparinised saline (a continuous drip of 2000 IU heparin in 1000 mL saline into femoral artery sheaths), which will be used if intravenous thrombolysis was not given before EVT, intravenous heparin is prohibited until after the 24 hours after EVT when neuroimaging has been performed; (2) Blood pressure will be tightly controlled to less than 185/110 mm Hg during the first 24 hours. If TICI > 2 b reperfusion is achieved and the systolic blood pressure is persistently above 140 mm Hg, a blood pressure of 120–160/70–90 mm Hg would be targeted by continuous monitoring after EVT; (3) Blood glucose level will be controlled to less than 160 mg/dL; (4) If contrast extravasation occurs during the procedure which may indicate active bleeding, the TNK infusion will be stopped immediately; (5) If ICAD-LVO is highly suspected and rescue balloon angioplasty and/or stenting will be performed, the dose of intra-arterial TNK will be reduced to half of the recommended dose, or stop, as determined by the local investigator and (6) If there is a concern for change in the patient's neurological condition, a CT scan (flat panel CT in the angio suite permitted) will be performed to rule out haemorrhage and if present, TNK will be immediately stopped. Hypotension and hypovolaemia will be corrected or avoided according to current guidelines. A CT scan will be performed before and after the EVT procedure in all patients.

### Development of tenecteplase for stroke thrombolysis: Japan's endeavor [^111J9mhX]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke is strongly recommended based on high-level evidence. However, the efficacy of the currently approved drug, alteplase, is not necessarily sufficient. Thrombolysis can trigger intracranial hemorrhage, that is a critical issue that cannot be overlooked, especially for Asians, who are generally hypertensive and prone to bleeding, making strict blood pressure control essential. Based on clinical trial results of a new thrombolytic agent, tenecteplase, several guidelines now recommend its use, and the off-label use has become common in many countries. As of 2024, regulatory approval has been granted in Western countries. Approval is also expected in major Asian countries between 2025 and 2026. In Japan, approval requires clinical data specific to Japanese patients, but no domestic pharmaceutical company currently handles the drug. We are conducting an investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, masked-endpoint, superiority trial, T-FLAVOR, comparing tenecteplase at 0.25mg/kg (international standard dose) with alteplase at 0.6mg/kg (a unique low dose approved in Japan). The target population consists of patients with ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion within 4.5h of onset, who are also eligible for mechanical thrombectomy within 6h. The primary efficacy outcome is successful early reperfusion assessed via catheter angiography after drug administration. Enrollment of the planned 220 participants was complete, and results are expected to be published in 2025. This is the only clinical trial using tenecteplase in Japan and the world's first to directly compare tenecteplase and low-dose alteplase (0.6mg/kg).

### Intensive blood pressure reduction with intravenous thrombolysis therapy for acute ischaemic stroke (ENCHANTED): an international, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint, phase 3 trial [^113o4Bi6]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

Systolic blood pressure of more than 185 mm Hg is a contraindication to thrombolytic treatment with intravenous alteplase in patients with acute ischaemic stroke, but the target systolic blood pressure for optimal outcome is uncertain. We assessed intensive blood pressure lowering compared with guideline-recommended blood pressure lowering in patients treated with alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke.

Methods

We did an international, partial-factorial, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial of thrombolysis-eligible patients (age ≥ 18 years) with acute ischaemic stroke and systolic blood pressure 150 mm Hg or more, who were screened at 110 sites in 15 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1, by means of a central, web-based program) within 6 h of stroke onset to receive intensive (target systolic blood pressure 130–140 mm Hg within 1 h) or guideline (target systolic blood pressure < 180 mm Hg) blood pressure lowering treatment over 72 h. The primary outcome was functional status at 90 days measured by shift in modified Rankin scale scores, analysed with unadjusted ordinal logistic regression. The key safety outcome was any intracranial haemorrhage. Primary and safety outcome assessments were done in a blinded manner. Analyses were done on intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01422616.

Findings

Between March 3, 2012, and April 30, 2018, 2227 patients were randomly allocated to treatment groups. After exclusion of 31 patients because of missing consent or mistaken or duplicate randomisation, 2196 alteplase-eligible patients with acute ischaemic stroke were included: 1081 in the intensive group and 1115 in the guideline group, with 1466 (67.4%) administered a standard dose among the 2175 actually given intravenous alteplase. Median time from stroke onset to randomisation was 3.3 h (IQR 2.6–4.1). Mean systolic blood pressure over 24 h was 144.3 mm Hg (SD 10.2) in the intensive group and 149.8 mm Hg (12.0) in the guideline group (p < 0.0001). Primary outcome data were available for 1072 patients in the intensive group and 1108 in the guideline group. Functional status (mRS score distribution) at 90 days did not differ between groups (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.01, 95% CI 0.87–1.17, p = 0.8702). Fewer patients in the intensive group (160 [14.8%] of 1081) than in the guideline group (209 [18.7%] of 1115) had any intracranial haemorrhage (OR 0.75, 0.60–0.94, p = 0.0137). The number of patients with any serious adverse event did not differ significantly between the intensive group (210 [19.4%] of 1081) and the guideline group (245 [22.0%] of 1115; OR 0.86, 0.70–1.05, p = 0.1412). There was no evidence of an interaction of intensive blood pressure lowering with dose (low vs standard) of alteplase with regard to the primary outcome.

Interpretation

Although intensive blood pressure lowering is safe, the observed reduction in intracranial haemorrhage did not lead to improved clinical outcome compared with guideline treatment. These results might not support a major shift towards this treatment being applied in those receiving alteplase for mild-to-moderate acute ischaemic stroke. Further research is required to define the underlying mechanisms of benefit and harm resulting from early intensive blood pressure lowering in this patient group.

### Acr-asnr-sir-snis practice parameter for the performance of endovascular thrombectomy and revascularization in acute stroke [^1132mxzB]. SIR (2024). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke endovascular therapy — blood pressure parameters state that the recommended BP target post-IV tPA or IV Tenecteplase (TNK) is systolic BP < 185 mmHg and diastolic BP < 110 mmHg for 24 hours, and after successful endovascular treatment (mTICI 2b/c and 3) it seems reasonable to consider lower BP parameters despite the lack of evidence because higher BP parameters may increase the theoretical risk of hemorrhage.

### Tenecteplase for acute ischemic stroke at 4.5 to 24 hours: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114xBC57]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether TNK (tenecteplase) benefits patients with acute ischemic stroke treated within 4.5 to 24 hours remains uncertain, and no previous meta-analysis has differentiated between clinical settings where endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is unavailable or permitted, leading to pooled distinct clinical contexts and obscuring a clear estimation of TNK's net effect.

Methods

We searched for randomized controlled trials comparing intravenous TNK of 0.25 mg/kg with standard care or placebo in adults within 4.5 to 24 hours after acute ischemic stroke onset. The primary outcome was excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–1) at 90 days, with additional efficacy and safety end points. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed both overall and within predefined subgroups, stratified by whether EVT was permitted in individual studies (non-EVT versus EVT-permitted).

Results

Four multicenter randomized controlled trials enrolling 1278 patients were included. TNK significantly increased excellent functional outcome (odds ratio [OR], 1.34 [95% CI, 1.06–1.71]; P = 0.02) at 90 days and recanalization (OR, 3.30 [95% CI, 1.59–6.84]; P = 0.001) compared with the control group, whereas good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–2), reperfusion, and early neurological improvement did not differ significantly. Subgroup analyses of 596 patients in the non-EVT subgroup showed that TNK significantly improved excellent functional outcome (OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.02–2.08]; P = 0.04), good functional outcome (OR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.07–2.09]; P = 0.02), recanalization (OR, 6.17 [95% CI, 3.36–11.33]; P < 0.00001), and early neurological improvement (OR, 3.21 [95% CI, 1.82–5.66]; P < 0.0001). However, in the EVT-permitted subgroup of 682 patients, TNK only improved recanalization (OR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.34–4.17]; P = 0.003). No significant differences were observed between TNK and control in the risks of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or 90-day mortality, either in the overall or subgroup analyses.

Conclusions

TNK improves excellent functional outcomes and recanalization in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated within 4.5 to 24 hours, without increasing the risks of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or mortality. Notably, extended-window TNK provides greater additional benefits when EVT is inaccessible, establishing its role as an alternative reperfusion strategy in resource-limited settings.

In hospitalised patients with acute ischaemic stroke and undergoing intravenous thrombolysis (with or without mechanical thrombectomy), does blood lowering with any vasodepressor drug compared to control improve outcome?

Analysis of current evidence

Based on data from small, uncontrolled, non-randomised pilot studies, – elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels before (> 185/110 mm Hg) and during (> 180/105 mm Hg) alteplase infusion of AIS patients are contraindications to IVT based upon the protocol for the original National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS)-recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) Stroke Study. AHA/ASA and ESO guidelines endorse these thresholds and advocate against treating AIS patients with intravenous IVT, when blood pressure is uncontrolled before or during thrombolysis treatment.

There are no randomised data to support these recommended blood pressure thresholds, and since elevated blood pressure is common in patients with AIS, IVT can be delayed or even denied in a substantial number of patients whose blood pressure is above this threshold and unresponsive to antihypertensive treatment. In addition, there is appropriate concern that aggressive blood pressure reduction, may reduce viable penumbral tissue, result in expansion of the cerebral infarction and contribute to neurological deterioration. –

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase before stroke thrombectomy: outcomes after system-wide transitions in Pennsylvania [^1125iUi3]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Randomized controlled trial data established intravenous tenecteplase (TNK) non-inferior to intravenous alteplase (TPA) in acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 h of symptom-onset. Real-world clinical experience demonstrated that replacing TPA with TNK in acute ischemic stroke treatment appears safe and effective. Many stroke systems in the United States have switched or are considering switching from TPA to TNK based on the recent trial data, guideline recommendations as well as the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic advantages of TNK over TPA. Notably, TNK features a single bolus injection, which results in practical clinical advantages and improved workflow times. The European Stroke Organisation (ESO) has issued a strong recommendation favoring TNK over TPA for thrombolysis-eligible patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke within 4.5 h of stroke-onset (moderate quality of evidence). The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines suggest that the use of TNK over TPA may be reasonable (weak recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Despite the recent thrombolytic landscape change, U.S. multicenter real-world data from patients receiving TNK prior to emergent endovascular treatment for LVO stroke is lacking. Here, we assessed the safety and effectiveness of switching to TNK before endovascular treatment of LVO stroke.

### Evidence that tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase for acute ischemic stroke: meta-analysis of 5 randomized trials [^1145VUx3]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- TNK (tenecteplase), a newer fibrinolytic agent, has practical delivery advantages over ALT (alteplase) that would make it a useful agent if noninferior in acute ischemic stroke treatment outcome. Accordingly, the most recent US American Heart Association/American Stroke Association acute ischemic stroke guideline recognized TNK as an alternative to ALT, but only based on informal consideration, rather than formal meta-analysis, of completed randomized control trials. Methods- Systematic literature search and formal meta-analysis were conducted per PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), adapted to noninferiority analysis. The primary outcome of freedom from disability (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–1) outcome at 3 m, and additional efficacy and safety outcomes, were analyzed. Results- Systematic search identified 5 trials enrolling 1585 patients (828 TNK, 757 ALT). Across all trials, mean age was 70.8, 58.5% male, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale mean 7.0, and time from last known well to treatment start mean 148 minutes. All ALT patients received standard 0.9 mg/kg dosing, while TNK dosing was 0.1 mg/kg in 6.8%, 0.25 mg/kg in 24.6%, and 0.4 mg/kg in 68.6%. For the primary end point, crude cumulative rates of disability-free (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–1) 3 m outcome were TNK 57.9% versus ALT 55.4%. Informal, random-effects meta-analysis, the risk difference was 4% (95% CI, -1% to 8%). The lower 95% CI bound fell well within the prespecified noninferiority margin. Similar results were seen for the additional efficacy end points: functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0–2): crude TNK 71.9% versus ALT 70.5%, risk difference 2% (95% CI, -3% to 6%); and modified Rankin Scale shift analysis, common odds ratio 1.21 (95% CI, 0.93–1.57). For safety end points, lower event rates reduced power, but point estimates were also consistent with noninferiority Conclusions- Accumulated clinical trial data provides strong evidence that TNK is noninferior to ALT in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. These findings provide formal support for the recent guideline recommendation to consider TNK an alternative to ALT.

Table 1
Baseline Characteristics

The baseline characteristics of the patients in the cohort lost to follow‐up (n = 38, 3.7%) are reported in Table S2. A higher proportion of patients with hypertension (82%), severe stroke (31.6%), and thrombolytic therapy administered beyond 4.5 hours (7.9%) were part of the loss to follow‐up group compared with the IRIS‐TNK study cohort from which complete data were available.

A total of 737 (72.6%), 232 (22.8%), and 46 (4.5%) patients were given tenecteplase within 3 hours, between 3 and 4.5 hours, and beyond 4.5 hours of symptom onset, respectively. The small proportion of patients (4.5%) who reported stroke symptom onset beyond 4.5 hours were administered tenecteplase based on magnetic resonance imaging perfusion‐diffusion mismatch by study investigators. The baseline and demographic data of these different subgroups are summarized in Table S3.

Clinical Outcomes

Symptomatic ICH within 2 days of thrombolysis occurred in 6 patients (0.6% [95% CI, 0.2–1.3]) (Table 2). Of these 6 cases, 3 (50%) died during the study. Asymptomatic ICH occurred in 13 (1.3% [95% CI, 0.7–2.2]) patients, and 1 (0.1% [95% CI, 0–0.6]) case each of hematuria and gum bleeding was observed. Two (0.2% [95% CI, 0–0.7]) cases of recurrent stroke occurred in the study. A total of 10 deaths (1% [95% CI, 0.5–1.9]) were reported during the follow‐up period of 3 months. Of these 10 deaths, 3 (30%) were considered to be related to the tenecteplase treatment by study investigators.

### Blood pressure goals in acute stroke [^112f2PQY]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The ENCHANTED trial enrolled 2,196 thrombolysis-eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours of stroke onset and elevated systolic blood pressure (≥ 150 mm Hg) to compare intensive (target systolic blood pressure 130–140 mm Hg within 1 hour) with guideline-based (target systolic blood pressure < 180 mm Hg) blood pressure lowering treatment over 72 hours.2,175 of the 2,196 randomized patients actually received intravenous alteplase. Median time from stroke onset to randomization was 3.3 hours. Mean systolic blood pressure over 24 hours was 144.3 mm Hg and 149.8 mm Hg in the intensive and guideline groups, respectively. The primary outcome (functional status at 90 days measured by shift in modified Rankin scale scores) did not differ between the 2 groups (intensive versus guideline-based treatment, odds ratio 1.01, P = 0.87). However, fewer patients in the intensive group than in the guideline group had an intracranial hemorrhage (odds ratio 0.75, P = 0.01). The results of a post hoc analysis of ENCHANTED showed that lower blood pressure variability and lower achieved blood pressure level might be associated with a favorable outcome (Figure 4).

### Comprehensive review of tenecteplase for thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke [^115bQ5D7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Stroke is the second‐leading cause of death globally and ischemic stroke constituted more than 60% of all incident strokes in 2019. Intravenous alteplase thrombolysis was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1996, and has become the first‐line treatment for ischemic stroke due to its high‐quality evidence for nearly 30 years, but there are concerns including hemorrhagic complications, restricted fibrinolytic efficacy, and achieving arterial recanalization in less than 40% of patients. Tenecteplase (TNK–tissue‐type plasminogen activator) has a longer half‐life, with more fibrin specificity and possibly a lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage than alteplase, which may make it a better thrombolytic agent. When compared with alteplase, tenecteplase is easier to administer, which reduces the potential for medication errors, dose interruption, and time delays. This improved ease of administration also facilitates interhospital transfer.

Admit the patient to an intensive care or stroke unit for monitoring, and if severe headache, acute hypertension, nausea, vomiting, or a worsening neurological examination occurs, discontinue the infusion and obtain emergency head computed tomography (CT) scan. Measure blood pressure (BP) and perform neurological assessments every 15 min during and after IV alteplase infusion for 2 h, then every 30 min for 6 h, then hourly until 24 h after IV alteplase treatment. Increase the frequency of BP measurements if SBP is > 180 mm Hg or if DBP is > 105 mm Hg, give antihypertensive medications to maintain BP at or below these levels, delay placement of nasogastric tubes, indwelling bladder catheters, or intraarterial pressure catheters if safely possible, and obtain a follow-up CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at 24 h after IV alteplase before starting anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to management of BP, acute treatment, indications and BP targets, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend initiating or reinitiating treatment of hypertension within the first 48–72 hours in patients with BP ≥ 220/120 mmHg who did not receive IV alteplase or mechanical thrombectomy and not having comorbid conditions requiring urgent antihypertensive treatment. Consider lowering BP by 15% during the first 24 hours after the onset of stroke.

### Tenecteplase versus alteplase before thrombectomy for ischemic stroke [^116iLv3P]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study EXTEND-IA TNK was published by Bruce C V Campbell and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute ischemic stroke. In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the trial question was: what is the role of tenecteplase among patients with ischemic stroke who are eligible to undergo thrombectomy? In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the population was: 202 patients (92 female, 110 male). The inclusion criteria were patients within 4.5 hours after onset of ischemic stroke who had occlusion of the internal carotid, basilar, or middle cerebral artery and who were eligible to undergo thrombectomy. The key exclusion criteria were severe preexisting disability with mRS score > 3, pregnancy, ICH, rapidly improving symptoms at the discretion of the investigator. In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the interventions were: n = 101 tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg of body weight with a maximum dose of 25 mg) n = 101 alteplase (at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg with a maximum dose of 90 mg). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in reperfusion of > 50% of the involved ischemic territory or an absence of retrievable thrombus at the time of the initial angiographic assessment (22% vs. 10%; IR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.4). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median mRS score at 90 days (2 points vs. 3 points; OR 1.7, 95% CI 1 to 2.8) Borderline significant increase in incidence of recovery to independent function; mRS score of 0–2 at 90 days (64% vs. 51%; IR 1.2, 95% CI 1 to 1.5) No significant difference in early neurologic improvement at 72 hours (71% vs. 68%; IR 1, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.2). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, parenchymal hematoma. significant difference in death (10% vs. 18%). In the EXTEND-IA TNK study, the conclusion was: in patients within 4.5 hours after onset of ischemic stroke who had occlusion of the internal carotid, basilar, or middle cerebral artery and who were eligible to undergo thrombectomy, tenecteplase was superior to alteplase with respect to reperfusion of > 50% of the involved ischemic territory or an absence of retrievable thrombus at the time of the initial angiographic assessment.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115ocfJi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous alteplase in acute ischemic stroke — blood pressure targets and evidence: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IV alteplase required the SBP to be < 185 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 110 mm Hg before treatment and SBP < 180 mm Hg and DBP < 105 mm Hg for the first 24 hours after treatment. Observational studies and meta-analyses suggest that the risk of hemorrhage after administration of alteplase is greater in patients with higher BPs and in patients with more BP variability, and the exact BP at which the risk of hemorrhage after IV alteplase increases is unknown; it is thus reasonable to target the BPs used in the RCTs of IV alteplase. ENCHANTED showed that antihypertensive treatment to target SBP 130 to 140 mm Hg within 6 hours of stroke onset in patients treated with IV thrombolytic did not show improvement in outcome.

Acute ischaemic stroke — In patients receiving i.v. thrombolysis, BP should be lowered and maintained at < 180/105 mmHg for at least the first 24 h after thrombolysis. The benefit of acute BP lowering in patients with acute ischaemic stroke who do not receive thrombolysis is uncertain; in such patients clinical judgement should define whether to interfere with drug therapy, in which case a reasonable goal may be to lower BP by 15%, with close monitoring, during the first 24 h after the stroke onset. For stable patients with no thrombolytic therapy (≥ 140/90 mmHg) ≥ 3 days after an acute ischaemic stroke, initiation or reintroduction of BP-lowering medication should be considered.

ASSENT-2

The Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic (ASSENT-2) study was an international, randomized, double-blind trial that compared 30-day mortality rates in 16,949 patients assigned to receive an IV bolus dose of TNKase or an accelerated infusion of Activase®(alteplase). Eligibility criteria included onset of chest pain within 6 hours of randomization and ST-segment elevation or left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram (ECG). Patients were to be excluded from the trial if they received GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors within the previous 12 hours. TNKase was dosed using actual or estimated weight in a weight-tiered fashion as described in Dosage and Administration (2.1). All patients were to receive 150–325 mg of aspirin administered as soon as possible, followed by 150–325 mg daily. Intravenous heparin was to be administered as soon as possible: for patients weighing ≤ 67 kg, heparin was administered as a 4000-unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 800 U/hr; for patients weighing > 67 kg, heparin was administered as a 5000-unit IV bolus followed by infusion at 1000 U/hr. Heparin was continued for 48 to 72 hours with infusion adjusted to maintain aPTT at 50–75 seconds. The use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors was discouraged for the first 24 hours following randomization. The results of the primary endpoint (30-day mortality rates with non-parametric adjustment for the covariates of age, Killip class, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and infarct location) along with selected other 30-day endpoints are shown in Table 2.

Rates of mortality and the combined endpoint of death or stroke among pre-specified subgroups, including age, gender, time to treatment, infarct location, and history of previous myocardial infarction, demonstrate consistent relative risks across these subgroups. There was insufficient enrollment of non-Caucasian patients to draw any conclusions regarding relative efficacy in racial subsets.

Rates of in-hospital procedures, including percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stent placement, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) use, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, were similar between the TNKase and Activase (alteplase) groups.

### Blood pressure management in reperfused ischemic stroke [^116uHCmF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Current recommendations in the guidelines for ischemic stroke management suggest maintaining blood pressure below 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours after endovascular thrombectomy. Similar blood pressure values are recommended in cases of systemic thrombolysis. However, the evidence supporting these recommendations stems from non‐randomized studies with low‐certainty evidence. Some studies have suggested that achieving lower values of systolic blood pressure (reducing to less than 160 mmHg) after the procedure would be beneficial in achieving the best functional outcome and reducing the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

Considering the global incidence of ischemic strokes, the investments made in procedures for achieving cerebral reperfusion, the recognized efficacy of reperfusion as a treatment for ischemic stroke, and the crucial significance of blood pressure management during the acute phase, along with the existing uncertainties in current recommendations and recent clinical trials aiming to provide clarity, it becomes essential to establish the appropriate blood pressure management for this population. This is crucial to minimize the risk of hemorrhage and complications, confine the ischemic area, and thereby optimize the functional outcome, resulting in an improved quality of life for individuals and a reduced burden on individuals, families, healthcare systems, and society as a whole.

### Management of blood pressure after acute ischemic stroke: an evidence-based guide for the hospitalist [^117KWAf4]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Hospitalists are frequently called upon to manage blood pressure after acute ischemic stroke. A review of both post infarction cerebral perfusion physiology and the data from randomized trials of antihypertensive therapy is necessary to explain why consensus guidelines for blood pressure management after stroke differ from those of other hypertensive emergencies. The peri-infarct penumbra is the central concept in understanding post ischemic cerebral perfusion. This area of impaired cerebral blood flow is dependent on mean arterial blood pressure and acute reduction of blood pressure may expand the area of infarction. Review of clinical trials fails to show benefit from reduction of blood pressure after ischemic stroke and current guidelines suggest antihypertensive therapy be employed if the systemic blood pressure is greater than 180/105 mmHg after tPA is employed, or 220/120 mmHg when tPA is not used. Induced hypertension remains a promising but unproven therapy in the acute setting, but the evidence for long term control of blood pressure to less than 140/80 mmHG for secondary prevention of stroke is strong. Adherence to guidelines is poor but it is recognized that current evidence is limited by a lack of trials in which blood pressure is titrated to a pre-specified goal, as is common in clinical practice.

### Associations of early systolic blood pressure control and outcome after thrombolysis-eligible acute ischemic stroke: results from the ENCHANTED study [^111hhTJV]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

In thrombolysis-eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke, there is uncertainty over the most appropriate systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering profile that provides an optimal balance of potential benefit (functional recovery) and harm (intracranial hemorrhage). We aimed to determine relationships of SBP parameters and outcomes in thrombolyzed acute ischemic stroke patients.

Methods

Post hoc analyzes of the ENCHANTED (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study), a partial-factorial trial of thrombolysis-eligible and treated acute ischemic stroke patients with high SBP (150–180 mmHg) assigned to low-dose (0.6 mg/kg) or standard-dose (0.9 mg/kg) alteplase and intensive (target SBP, 130–140 mmHg) or guideline-recommended (target SBP < 180 mmHg) treatment. All patients were followed up for functional status and serious adverse events to 90 days. Logistic regression models were used to analyze 3 SBP summary measures postrandomization: attained (mean), variability (SD) in 1–24 hours, and magnitude of reduction in 1 hour. The primary outcome was a favorable shift on the modified Rankin Scale. The key safety outcome was any intracranial hemorrhage.

Results

Among 4511 included participants (mean age 67 years, 38% female, 65% Asian) lower attained SBP and smaller SBP variability were associated with favorable shift on the modified Rankin Scale (per 10 mmHg increase: odds ratio, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.71–0.82]; P < 0.001 and 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76–0.98]; P = 0.025) respectively, but not for magnitude of SBP reduction (0.98, [0.93–1.04]; P = 0.564). Odds of intracranial hemorrhage was associated with higher attained SBP and greater SBP variability (1.18 [1.06–1.31]; P = 0.002 and 1.34 [1.11–1.62]; P = 0.002) but not with magnitude of SBP reduction (1.05 [0.98–1.14]; P = 0.184).

Conclusions

### Tenecteplase, 0.4 mg / kg, in moderate and severe acute ischemic stroke: a pooled analysis of NOR-TEST and NOR-TEST 2A [^112GDghr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The convenience of tenecteplase in clinical practice, and its pharmacologic superiority, makes tenecteplase a desirable thrombolytic drug in acute stroke therapy. A lower tenecteplase dose may have a better safety profile but might also have lower efficacy. The ENCHANTED Study (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study) did not show noninferiority of low‐dose alteplase compared with standard‐dose alteplase for death and disability at 90 days, but showed significantly fewer symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages with low‐dose alteplase. However, in a general stroke population, the recently published alteplase compared to tenecteplase trial testing tenecteplase, 0.25 mg/kg, compared with standard‐dose alteplase showed noninferiority in terms efficacy but a positive shift in the safety profile. In patients with large‐vessel occlusion treated with intravenous tenecteplase before EVT, the EXTEND‐IA TNK part 2 trial suggests that tenecteplase, 0.40 mg/kg, does not confer an advantage over the 0.25‐mg/kg dose. Thus, tenecteplase. 0.25 mg/kg, seems to be a reasonable alternative to alteplase for all patients presenting with AIS and meeting standard criteria for thrombolysis.

There are limitations of the presented study. The post hoc analysis may be misleading because of the different power estimates of the 2 trials and the nonrandomized character of the study. The subgroup analyses included in the study, stratifying subjects by age and stroke severity, may be biased because of the smaller populations in each group. Type 1 error may lead to higher likelihood of by chance observation.

In conclusion, the pooled analysis of NOR‐TEST and NOR‐TEST 2A indicates a worse safety profile of tenecteplase, 0.4 mg/kg, compared with standard‐dose alteplase in AIS within 4.5 hours after stroke onset, and predominantly so in patients with severe stroke.

Table 5 summarises the design of five RCTs that evaluate different blood pressure targets below the pre-specified cut-off of 180/105 mm Hg after the end of MT. – The only completed RCT is the Blood Pressure Target in Acute Stroke to Reduce Haemorrhage After Endovascular Therapy (BP-TARGET) trial, a multicentre, prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label, blinded endpoint clinical trial conducted in France. The study enrolled AIS patients with large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation who had successful reperfusion (defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) grades of 2 b or 3) following MT. The enrolled patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to have intensive (systolic blood pressure target 100–129 mm Hg) or a conservative (systolic blood pressure target 130–185 mm Hg) blood pressure control in the following 24 hours, with the primary efficacy endpoint of radiographic intraparenchymal haemorrhage at 24–36 hours and the primary safety endpoint of hypotension occurrence. Secondary endpoints included the rate of the sICH, the overall distribution of the mRS scores at 90 days, good functional outcome (90–day mRS scores of 0–2), functional improvement (90-day decrease by 1 point across all 90-day mRS grades), infarct volume at follow-up CT scan at 24–36 h, change in NIHSS-scores at 24 hours, and all-cause mortality at 90 days. A total of 158 and 160 patients were randomised to the intensive and conservative systolic blood pressure groups respectively, with similar proportions of the primary endpoint (any ICH: 42% in the intensive group vs. 43% in the conservative group) and hypotension in the two treatment groups (8% in the intensive group vs. 3% in the conservative group). All secondary endpoints including three-month functional improvement (common OR for 1-point improvement across all mRS categories: 0.86; 95%CI: 0.57–1.28), three-month good functional outcome (mRS scores 0–2; 44% vs. 45%) and three-month mortality (19% vs. 14%) were similar in the two treatment groups. The main methodological shortcoming of this RCT included: (i) modest systolic blood pressure difference (10 mm Hg) between the randomised groups; (ii) one third of the individuals in the conservative arm having systolic blood pressure measurements < 130 mm Hg; (iii) moderate sample size; (iv) primary endpoint being imaging, rather than clinical, (v) non-invasive modality of blood pressure assessment every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours and every 1 hour for the remaining 16 hours.

Initial Investigation in the Optimal Dose of Tenecteplase

In 2005, a pilot dose‐escalation safety studywas conducted on 88 patients with AIS within 3 hours of symptom onset. The study evaluated the safety of tenecteplase doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg, with the primary end point being symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). However, the study did not determine the optimal dose for achieving favorable functional outcomes at 3 months. A phase IIB/III randomized, multicenter, double‐blind trialwas conducted on 112 patients to determine the optimal dose of tenecteplase among 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 mg/kg. The study used an adaptive, sequential dose selection procedure. However, the trial was prematurely terminated as the 0.4 mg/kg dose displayed a high sICH rate. Furthermore, it was not possible to distinguish between the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg doses as neither showed clear efficacy. It should be noted that these findings represent early results that informed subsequent studies. In 2012, the Australian‐TNK (Low‐Dose Tenecteplase Versus Standard‐Dose Alteplase for Acute Ischemic Stroke) trial, another phase IIB trial based on a perfusion imaging mismatch and a proximal vessel occlusion within 6 hours after onset, demonstrated that tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg was superior to tenecteplase 0.1 mg/kg and alteplase 0.9 mg/kg for recanalization and 24‐hour clinical improvement, with no additional risk of hemorrhage. A longer‐term clinical benefit (0–2 score of the modified Rankin Scale [mRS] at 90 days) was also seen in the 0.25 mg/kg tier (72% versus 40%, P = 0.02). Although the sample size was very small, it was the first trial with no truncation to test the optimal dose for tenecteplase. Multimodal computed tomography (CT) imaging selection criteria in the trial resulted in exclusion of 79% (477/604) of patients who were otherwise eligible for intravenous alteplase. Instead, The ATTEST (Alteplase‐Tenecteplase Trial Evaluation for Stroke Thrombolysis) phase 2 trial, using imaging criteria as exploratory outcome measures rather than selection criteria, found a similar percentage of penumbral salvage on CT perfusion imaging when comparing 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase and standard 0.9 mg/kg alteplase (68% versus 68%) administered within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. This was the first study comparing 1 dose of tenecteplase against alteplase with patients selected by criteria currently used in clinical practice to assess eligibility for thrombolysis in a 4.5‐hour window. The application of advanced imaging for outcome assessment rather than patient selection avoided restrictions of generalizability and some delay in treatment initiation. However, the use of advanced imaging did reveal some baseline imbalances, such as differences in the proportion of patients with large artery occlusion and baseline ischemic core volume. Although these imbalances were not statistically significant, they could potentially affect the interpretation of the neutral results. As a result, larger sample size phase 3 trials are warranted. The pooled analysis of these 3 trials (Haley et al, Parsons et al, and ATTEST) found that a dose of 0.25 mg/kg tenecteplase had the greatest odds of achieving early neurological improvement (odds ratio [OR], 3.3 [95% CI, 1.5–7.2], P = 0.093) and excellent functional outcome (mRS score 0–1) at 3 months (OR, 1.9 [95% CI, 0.8–4.4], P = 0.28), with reduced odds of ICH (OR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.2–1.8], P = 0.43) compared with alteplase.

The Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED) investigated the safety and efficacy of blood pressure lowering strategies in AIS patients treated with IVT according to guideline criteria (blood pressure levels < 185/110 mm Hg).2196 patients with systolic blood pressure > 150 mm Hg who were eligible for IVT with alteplase were randomised to intensive blood pressure lowering (target systolic blood pressure 130–140 mm Hg within 1 hour) or to a standard target systolic blood pressure (< 180 mm Hg), and for maintenance of such levels over 72 hours. Mean systolic blood pressure over 24 hours was 144 ± 10 mm Hg in the intensive group and 150 ± 12 mm Hg in the control group. Functional outcome at 90 days did not differ between groups (unadjusted common OR per 1-point improvement across all mRS scores: 1.01, 95%CI: 0.87–1.17, p = 0.87). However, fewer patients in the intensive group (14.8%) than in the control group (18.7%) had any ICH (OR 0.75, 0.60–0.94, p = 0.01). Blood pressure reduction was also associated with a non-significant decrease in type 2 parenchymal haemorrhage (OR 0.71, 95%CI 0.50–1.01, p = 0.05). The health-related quality of life was assessed as an overall health utility score (EQ-5D) and no differences were observed between the two treatment groups.

Certain methodological concerns need to be taken into account when interpreting ENCHANTED findings. First, the study design was open-label and blinded-endpoint adjudication. Second, the mean difference in systolic blood pressure levels during the first 24 hours between the active and control treatment group was modest differing by < 7 mm Hg rather than the planned 15 mm Hg; this may have limited the possibility to detect significant treatment effects between groups. Third, included patients already had blood pressure controlled below the 185/110 mm Hg thresholds and may have received blood pressure lowering treatment prior to inclusion. Fourth, almost three quarters of randomised patients were from Asia where the pattern of cerebrovascular disease differs from the West. Finally, advanced imaging was not included in the selection of patients, and thus the potential of exclusion of patients with higher risk of sICH who may have benefited the most from intensive blood pressure lowering treatment strategies.

### Intra-arterial tenecteplase after successful reperfusion in large vessel occlusion stroke: a randomized clinical trial [^1129d2rJ]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Current trials, such as Adjunctive Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase Following Near-Complete to Complete Reperfusion for Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke (POST-TNK), Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase After Successful Endovascular Therapy (ANGEL-TNK), and Adjunctive Intra-Arterial Tenecteplase Following Mechanical Thrombectomy (ALLY), explored various dosing regimens of intra-arterial tenecteplase, specifically 0.0625 mg/kg, 0.1250 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg to 4.5 mg, respectively. These doses were selected based on established fractions of the intravenous alteplase dose used in previous studies like the CHOICE trial, or through recommendations from trial steering committees, rather than through systematic dose-escalation studies. The insights gained from the DATE study accordingly provide important data for empirically defining the optimal dose to enhance patient safety and patient outcomes and refine stroke treatment protocols. This systematic approach may ultimately contribute to a more effective management of acute ischemic stroke in the context of EVT.

The advent of studies of dosing strategies for intra-arterial lytic agents after successful EVT highlights a gap in our pharmacologic understanding of optimal dosing for intra-arterial administration. Unlike intravenous thrombolytic administration of drug, where dosing has been extensively studied and standardized, intra-arterial administration requires careful consideration of distinct pharmacokinetics, local drug concentration at the site of occlusion, and patient-specific factors. The intricacies of intra-arterial drug delivery may necessitate a more tailored approach to determine the most effective and safe dose.

Blood pressure management in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) includes that hypotension and hypovolemia should be corrected to maintain systemic perfusion levels necessary to support organ function. Patients who have elevated BP and are otherwise eligible for treatment with IV alteplase should have their BP carefully lowered so that their systolic BP is < 185 mm Hg and their diastolic BP is < 110 mm Hg before IV fibrinolytic therapy is initiated; the RCTs of IV alteplase required the BP to be < 185 mm Hg systolic and < 110 mm Hg diastolic before treatment and < 180/105 mm Hg for the first 24 hours after treatment. The usefulness of drug-induced hypertension in patients with AIS is not well established.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) — IV alteplase administration and monitoring are as follows: Infuse 0.9 mg/kg (maximum dose 90 mg) over 60 min, with 10% of the dose given as a bolus over 1 min. Admit the patient to an intensive care or stroke unit for monitoring. If the patient develops severe headache, acute hypertension, nausea, or vomiting or has a worsening neurological examination, discontinue the infusion (if IV alteplase is being administered) and obtain emergency head CT scan. Measure blood pressure (BP) and perform neurological assessments every 15 min during and after IV alteplase infusion for 2 h, then every 30 min for 6 h, then hourly until 24 h after IV alteplase treatment. Increase the frequency of BP measurements if SBP is > 180 mm Hg or if DBP is > 105 mm Hg; administer antihypertensive medications to maintain BP at or below these levels. Delay placement of nasogastric tubes, indwelling bladder catheters, or intra-arterial pressure catheters if the patient can be safely managed without them. Obtain a follow-up CT or MRI scan at 24 h after IV alteplase before starting anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents.

### Periprocedure management of blood pressure after acute ischemic stroke [^116jfurj]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

The management of acute ischemic stroke primarily revolves around the timely restoration of blood flow (recanalization/reperfusion) in the occluded vessel and maintenance of cerebral perfusion through collaterals before reperfusion. Mechanical thrombectomy is the most effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusions in appropriately selected patients. Judicious management of blood pressure before, during, and after mechanical thrombectomy is critical to ensure good outcomes by preventing progression of cerebral ischemia as well hemorrhagic conversion, in addition to optimizing systemic perfusion. While direct evidence to support specific hemodynamic targets around mechanical thrombectomy is limited, there is increasing interest in this area. Newer approaches to blood pressure management utilizing individualized cerebral autoregulation-based targets are being explored. Early efforts at utilizing machine learning to predict blood pressure treatment thresholds and therapies also seem promising; this focused review aims to provide an update on recent evidence around periprocedural blood pressure management after acute ischemic stroke, highlighting its implications for clinical practice while identifying gaps in current literature.

### Treatment and outcome of hemorrhagic transformation after intravenous alteplase in acute ischemic stroke: a scientific statement for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116z6Ao4]. Stroke (2017). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure management after alteplase-associated hemorrhage — In general acute stroke care a systolic blood pressure goal of < 180 mm Hg lacked clear efficacy, and in patients with symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) targets are unclear with the goal to balance ischemic perfusion and limiting hematoma expansion. Observational data are mixed: a drop in mean arterial pressures by > 40% was associated with poor neurological outcomes; in 1128 thrombolysis-treated patients in China, a systolic blood pressure of < 140 mm Hg was associated with improved neurological outcomes and lower rates of sICH; and in ECASS II higher systolic blood pressure was associated with worse functional outcomes and sICH with no clear evidence that lower blood pressure in alteplase-treated patients led to worse functional outcomes. For alteplase-associated hemorrhage, healthcare providers should weigh the risk of worsening ischemia against sICH severity and expansion risk to decide on goals; among patients with HI-1 and HI-2 and incomplete recanalization, higher targets may be necessary, whereas in full recanalization stricter blood pressure control measures may be reasonable, and among patients with parenchymal hematoma at high risk for expansion, stricter control is hypothesized to cause more benefit and perhaps less harm.

Additional information

The ENCHANTED trial observed no significant heterogeneity of the treatment effect (shift on 3-month mRS score) in subgroups including demographics (age, sex, ethnicity), pre-treatment with antiplatelets, dose of alteplase (low vs. standard), stroke severity stratified by NIHSS scores and stroke subgroups where large vessel occlusion might be anticipated, AIS subtypes classified on the basis of clinician diagnosis of large vessel atherosclerosis, cardioembolism or lacunar stroke. Notably, in the prespecified subgroup analysis of severe stroke defined by computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiogram confirmation of large vessel occlusion, receipt of endovascular therapy, final diagnosis of large artery atherosclerotic disease, or high (> 10) baseline NIHSS score there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of death or disability at three months in the two treatment arms. However, intensive blood pressure lowering significantly increased three-month mortality (OR 1.52, 95%CI: 1.09–2.13; p = 0.014) compared with guideline blood pressure lowering, despite significantly lower clinician-reported ICH (OR0.63, 95%CI: 0.43–0.92; p = 0.016). The findings of the aforementioned post-hoc analysis may only serve for hypothesis generation and deserve further validation in future RCTs.

### Blood pressure excursion on admission and intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke [^1137vjjW]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

The role of elevated BP and the best target level of BP in acute ischemic stroke and thrombolysis remained unclear. A meta-analysis enrolled 26 nonrandomized studies found that the proportion of good outcome decreased by 9% and the risk of sICH increased by 8% per 10 mmHg increase of pretreatment BP levels. One retrospective study of an international stroke thrombolysis registry showed a positive and linear association of SBP and independence after thrombolysis when the SBP was above 140 mmHg. Whereas, in the ENCHANTED trial, which was the first international randomized study comparing intensive BP lowering with guideline recommended BP lowering, controlling postthrombolysis SBP below 140–150 mmHg did not lead to better outcomes.

The prior discrepant findings revealed an unsolved question whether the high BP causes poor outcome, or just be an 'expression' of stroke severity. Moreover, if high BP causes poor outcome, the effect works temporarily or last for a long duration even after the high BP has been corrected? In our study, patients with admission BP excursion suffered worse outcome than patients without BP excursion, which indicated a harmful effect of high BP on admission. Nevertheless, as the differences of stroke severities and pretreatment BP levels existed between groups, our results were still unable to answer the above questions. A randomized trial evaluating active BP-lowering strategies for acute ischemic stroke is in progress and may provide more evidences.

Ischemic Stroke

Trials in patients with an acute ischemic stroke are divergent in the recruitment of study participants, such as the time window after stroke or the use of arterial mechanical thrombectomy. The Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED) enrolled patients with a very acute ischemic stroke within 6 hours, and the other 3 trials enrolled patients with an acute ischemic stroke within 12or 48 hoursor after successful reperfusion by arterial mechanical thrombectomy.

The China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke (CATIS) enrolled 4,071 patients with an acute ischemic stroke within 48 hours of onset and elevated systolic blood pressure (140–219 mm Hg) to investigate whether blood pressure reduction (targeting systolic blood pressure for a reduction by 10% to 25% within the first 24 hours after randomization and to 140/90 mm Hg within 7 days) would prevent death and disability (modified Rankin Scale ≥ 3) at 14 days or at discharge. Mean time from stroke onset to randomization was 15 hours. Mean systolic blood pressure was reduced from 166.7 mm Hg at randomization to 144.7 mm Hg (−12.7%) within 24 hours and to 137.3 mm Hg at 7 days after randomization in the antihypertensive treatment group. The corresponding values in the non-antihypertensive treatment control group were 165.6 mm Hg, 152.9 mm Hg (−7.2%) and 146.5 mm Hg, respectively. The between-group differences were 9.1 mm Hg within 24 hours and 9.3 mm Hg at 7 days. The 2 groups did not differ for death and major disability at 14 days or hospital discharge (primary outcome, odds ratio 1.00, P = 0.98)) nor at 3-month post-treatment follow-up (secondary outcome, odds ratio 0.99, P = 0.93).

Importance

The effects of moderate systolic blood pressure (SBP) lowering after successful recanalization with endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke are uncertain.

Objective

To determine the futility of lower SBP targets after endovascular therapy (< 140 mm Hg or 160 mm Hg) compared with a higher target (≤ 180 mm Hg).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, open-label, blinded end point, phase 2, futility clinical trial that enrolled 120 patients with acute ischemic stroke who had undergone successful endovascular therapy at 3 US comprehensive stroke centers from January 2020 to March 2022 (final follow-up, June 2022).

Intervention

After undergoing endovascular therapy, participants were randomized to 1 of 3 SBP targets: 40 to less than 140 mm Hg, 40 to less than 160 mm Hg, and 40 to 180 mm Hg or less (guideline recommended) group, initiated within 60 minutes of recanalization and maintained for 24 hours.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prespecified multiple primary outcomes for the primary futility analysis were follow-up infarct volume measured at 36 (± 12) hours and utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (range, 0 [worst] to 1 [best]) at 90 (± 14) days. Linear regression models were used to test the harm-futility boundaries of a 10-mL increase (slope of 0.5) in the follow-up infarct volume or a 0.10 decrease (slope of -0.005) in the utility-weighted mRS score with each 20-mm Hg SBP target reduction after endovascular therapy (1-sided α = .05). Additional prespecified futility criterion was a less than 25% predicted probability of success for a future 2-group, superiority trial comparing SBP targets of the low- and mid-thresholds with the high-threshold (maximum sample size, 1500 with respect to the utility-weighted mRS score outcome).

Results

Among 120 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 69.6 [14.5] years; 69 females [58%]), 113 (94.2%) completed the trial. The mean follow-up infarct volume was 32.4 mL (95% CI, 18.0 to 46.7 mL) for the less than 140-mm Hg group, 50.7 mL (95% CI, 33.7 to 67.7 mL), for the less than 160-mm Hg group, and 46.4 mL (95% CI, 24.5 to 68.2 mL) for the 180-mm Hg or less group. The mean utility-weighted mRS score was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.63) for the less than 140-mm Hg group, 0.47 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.60) for the less than 160-mm Hg group, and 0.58 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.71) for the high-target group. The slope of the follow-up infarct volume for each mm Hg decrease in the SBP target, adjusted for the baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, was -0.29 (95% CI, -0.81 to ∞; futility P = 0.99). The slope of the utility-weighted mRS score for each mm Hg decrease in the SBP target after endovascular therapy, adjusted for baseline utility-weighted mRS score, was -0.0019 (95% CI, -∞ to 0.0017; futility P = 0.93). Comparing the high-target SBP group with the lower-target groups, the predicted probability of success for a future trial was 25% for the less than 140-mm Hg group and 14% for the 160-mm Hg group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with acute ischemic stroke, lower SBP targets less than either 140 mm Hg or 160 mm Hg after successful endovascular therapy did not meet prespecified criteria for futility compared with an SBP target of 180 mm Hg or less. However, the findings suggested a low probability of benefit from lower SBP targets after endovascular therapy if tested in a future larger trial.

### Incidence and predictors of bleeding events after fibrinolytic therapy with fibrin-specific agents: a comparison of TNK-tPA and rt-PA [^114Stmgj]. European Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Fibrinolytic therapy increases the risk of bleeding events. TNK-tPA (tenecteplase) is a variant of rt-PA with greater fibrin specificity and reduced plasma clearance that can be given as a single bolus. We compared the incidence and predictors of bleeding events after treatment with TNK-tPA and rt-PA.

Methods and Results

In the Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic (ASSENT)-2 trial, 16 949 patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned a single weight-adjusted bolus of TNK-tPA or a 90-min infusion of rt-PA. A total of 4.66% of patients in the TNK-tPA group experienced major non-cerebral bleeding, in comparison with 5.94% in the rt-PA group (P = 0.0002). This lower rate was associated with a significant reduction in the need for blood transfusion (4.25% vs 5.49%, P = 0.0003) and was consistent across subgroups. Independent risk factors for major bleeding were older age, female gender, lower body weight, enrolment in the U.S. A. and a diastolic blood pressure < 70 mmHg. Females at high risk (age > 75 years and body weight < 67 kg) were less likely to have major bleeding when treated with TNK-tPA even after other risk factors were taken into account. A total of 0.93% of patients in the TNK-tPA and 0.94% of patients in the rt-PA group experienced an intracranial haemorrhage. Female patients > 75 years of age who weighed < 67 kg tended to have lower rates of intracranial haemorrhage when treated with TNK-tPA (3/264, 1.14% vs 8/265, 3.02%).

Conclusions

The increased fibrin specificity and single bolus administration of TNK-tPA do not increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage but are associated with less non-cerebral bleeding, especially amongst high-risk patients.

### Issues in the assessment of the safety and efficacy of tenecteplase (TNK-tPA) [^111yKJuv]. Clinical Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

While thrombolytic agents have demonstrated improved mortality over the use of placebo, this has come at the expense of bleeding complications such as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Tenecteplase (TNK-tPA) is a novel thrombolytic agent engineered to improve upon the ease of use and safety of alteplase (t-PA). Given its longer half-life, TNK-tPA can be administered as a single bolus. The dosing of TNK-tPA has been weight optimized to enhance both safety and efficacy outcomes. Weight-optimized TNK-tPA dosing requires body weight estimation, which may introduce the potential for medication error. However, data from TNK-tPA clinical trials suggest that body weight estimates can err by up to 20 kg (44 lb) without an increased risk of ICH or death. Furthermore, the results of TNK-tPA clinical trials showed that even at the highest weight-optimized dosage of 50 mg, ICH rates were among the lowest reported in clinical trials of thrombolytics for acute myocardial infarction. In elderly female patients of low body weight, the use of weight-optimized TNK-tPA lowered the risk of ICH compared with the use of t-PA, expanding the potential use of thrombolytics to this high-risk patient population. Tenecteplase has demonstrated clinical equivalence to t-PA, but with a wider therapeutic margin of safety.

### Effect of intravenous tenecteplase dose on cerebral reperfusion before thrombectomy in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke: the EXTEND-IA TNK part 2 randomized clinical trial [^1139vxYA]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Intravenous thrombolysis with tenecteplase improves reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic stroke compared with alteplase.

Objective

To determine whether 0.40 mg/kg of tenecteplase safely improves reperfusion before endovascular thrombectomy vs 0.25 mg/kg of tenecteplase in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial at 27 hospitals in Australia and 1 in New Zealand using open-label treatment and blinded assessment of radiological and clinical outcomes. Patients were enrolled from December 2017 to July 2019 with follow-up until October 2019. Adult patients (N = 300) with ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid, \basilar, or middle cerebral artery were included less than 4.5 hours after symptom onset using standard intravenous thrombolysis eligibility criteria.

Interventions

Open-label tenecteplase at 0.40 mg/kg (maximum, 40 mg; n = 150) or 0.25 mg/kg (maximum, 25 mg; n = 150) given as a bolus before endovascular thrombectomy.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was reperfusion of greater than 50% of the involved ischemic territory prior to thrombectomy, assessed by consensus of 2 blinded neuroradiologists. Prespecified secondary outcomes were level of disability at day 90 (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score; range, 0–6); mRS score of 0 to 1 (freedom from disability) or no change from baseline at 90 days; mRS score of 0 to 2 (functional independence) or no change from baseline at 90 days; substantial neurological improvement at 3 days; symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours; and all-cause death.

Results

All 300 patients who were randomized (mean age, 72.7 years; 141 [47%] women) completed the trial. The number of participants with greater than 50% reperfusion of the previously occluded vascular territory was 29 of 150 (19.3%) in the 0.40 mg/kg group vs 29 of 150 (19.3%) in the 0.25 mg/kg group (unadjusted risk difference, 0.0% [95% CI, -8.9% to -8.9%]; adjusted risk ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.66–1.61]; p = 0.89). Among the 6 secondary outcomes, there were no significant differences in any of the 4 functional outcomes between the 0.40 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg groups nor in all-cause deaths (26 [17%] vs 22 [15%]; unadjusted risk difference, 2.7% [95% CI, -5.6% to 11.0%]) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (7 [4.7%] vs 2 [1.3%]; unadjusted risk difference, 3.3% [95% CI, -0.5% to 7.2%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke, a dose of 0.40 mg/kg, compared with 0.25 mg/kg, of tenecteplase did not significantly improve cerebral reperfusion prior to endovascular thrombectomy. The findings suggest that the 0.40-mg/kg dose of tenecteplase does not confer an advantage over the 0.25-mg/kg dose in patients with large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke in whom endovascular thrombectomy is planned.

### A pilot dose-escalation safety study of tenecteplase in acute ischemic stroke [^1118xH8Z]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the only approved treatment in acute ischemic stroke. However, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) occurs in 6.4% of patients treated with rtPA and limits its use. Tenecteplase (TNK) is a modified form of rtPA, with longer half-life and greater fibrin specificity. Patients after myocardial infarction had fewer systemic hemorrhages when treated with TNK compared with rtPA. This open-label, dose-escalation safety study was conducted to develop initial experience with TNK in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

Methods

Eligible patients were treated with an intravenous bolus infusion of TNK within 3 hours of stroke onset. The dose escalation was conducted in tiers of 25 patients, starting at 0.1 mg/kg, to a planned maximum of 0.6 mg/kg. The primary endpoint was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 36 hours of treatment. All patients were followed-up for 3 months.

Results

Eighty-eight (88) patients were treated in 4 dosing tiers. In the first 3 tiers (0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg/kg) of 25 patients each, no symptomatic and 2 (8%), 8 (32%), and 7 (28%) asymptomatic ICHs occurred. Enrollment into the fourth tier at 0.5 mg/kg was closed after 2 of 13 patients (15%) had symptomatic and 3 (23%) had asymptomatic ICHs. Overall, modified Rankin scores at 3 months were similar to those of historical controls treated with rtPA and not significantly different between treatment groups.

Conclusions

TNK doses of 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg are safe in ischemic stroke. Future trials are needed to compare the effect of TNK on neurological outcome and safety as compared with rtPA.

### Blood pressure management in reperfused ischemic stroke [^117LGFaS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We will follow the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews when conducting the review, and PRISMA 2000 for the reporting.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster‐RCTs. Following the guidelines in Chapter 23 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, we will exclude cross‐over trials, because they may have a potential withdrawal, rebound, or carry‐over effect during or after the wash‐out period. We will exclude quasi‐RCTs (controlled trials that used inappropriate strategies of allocating interventions) and non‐randomized clinical trials, following the algorithm outlined in Chapter 24 of the Cochrane Handbook due to the availability of RCTs that address our research questions.

Types of participants

We will include adults (aged older than 18 years) with acute ischemic stroke (computed tomography or magnetic resonance scanning having excluded intracranial hemorrhage before randomization) reperfused by systemic thrombolysis or endovascular thrombectomy. Systemic thrombolysis could be performed with different drugs, doses, and administration routes (intravenous or intra‐arterial) established by the studies, while endovascular thrombectomy could involve thromboaspiration, stent retriever thrombectomy, aspiration, or a combination of techniques. We will include any postprocedure reperfusion status defined by the authors as inclusion criteria for the study.

If we identify studies in which only a subset of participants is relevant to this review, we will include these studies if data are available separately for the relevant subset, or if more than 80% of participants meet the inclusion criteria.

Figure 3
Distribution of outcome and hemorrhage based on severity of stroke on admission in the per‐protocol analysis.

ALT indicates alteplase; ICH, intracranial hemorrhage; mild stroke, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≤ 5; moderate stroke, NIHSS score 6 to 14; mRS, modified Rankin Scale; OR, odds ratio; severe stroke, NIHSS score ≥ 15; sICH, symptomatic ICH; and TNK, tenecteplase.

Compared with the main analysis, there was no significant change in the primary or secondary outcomes after exclusion of patients with unknown stroke onset (Table S2). In the separate analysis of patients undergoing endovascular treatment, patients treated with alteplase achieved more often major neurologic improvement (OR, 0.34 [95% CI, 0.12–0.93]; P = 0.035) and experienced less often any ICH (OR, 1.70 [95% CI, 1.7–14.65]; P = 0.003) (Table S3).

In the pooled population with moderate and severe stroke, the ITT analysis showed a trend toward higher rates of any ICH and sICH in patients treated with tenecteplase (OR, 1.53 [95% CI, 0.99–2.66]; P = 0.051 and OR, 2.51 [95% CI, 0.98–6.44]; P = 0.054, respectively). In the alteplase arm, ordinal shift analysis of mRS at 3 months showed better functional outcome (OR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.18–2.18]; P = 0.002) as well as better functional outcome at 3 months using mRS cutoff 0 to 2 (OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.33–0.78]; P = 0.002). Major neurologic improvement at 24 hours, expressed by NIHSS score, was more common in the alteplase arm (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.49–0.99]; P = 0.05). Mortality at 3 months was more common in the tenecteplase arm (OR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.28–4.59]; P = 0.007) (Table 3).

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) expedited recommendation on tenecteplase for acute ischaemic stroke [^112pF2QV]. European Stroke Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to intravenous tenecteplase, ESO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider administering tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg as an alternative to alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in patients with AIS of < 4.5 hours duration eligible for IV thrombolysis.
Consider preferring tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg over alteplase 0.9 mg/kg in these patients in light of safety and efficacy data and because tenecteplase can be administered with a single bolus rather than a 1-hour infusion.
Do not use tenecteplase at a dose of 0.40 mg/kg.

### Effect of time to thrombolysis on clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with tenecteplase compared to alteplase: analysis from the AcT randomized controlled trial [^113oD8CM]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The AcT (Alteplase Compared to Tenecteplase) randomized controlled trial showed that tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase in treating patients with acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The effect of time to treatment on clinical outcomes with alteplase is well known; however, the nature of this relationship is yet to be described with tenecteplase. We assessed whether the association of time to thrombolysis treatment with clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke differs by whether they receive intravenous tenecteplase versus alteplase.

Methods

Patients included were from AcT, a pragmatic, registry-linked, phase 3 randomized controlled trial comparing intravenous tenecteplase to alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Eligible patients were > 18 years old, with disabling neurological deficits, presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, and eligible for thrombolysis. Primary outcome was modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1 at 90 days. Safety outcomes included 24-hour symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and 90-day mortality rates. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to assess the following: (a) the association of stroke symptom onset to needle time; (b) door (hospital arrival) to needle time with outcomes; and (c) if these associations were modified by type of thrombolytic administered (tenecteplase versus alteplase), after adjusting for age, sex, baseline stroke severity, and site of intracranial occlusion.

Results

Of the 1538 patients included in this analysis, 1146 (74.5%; 591 tenecteplase and 555 alteplase) presented within 3 hours versus 392 (25.5%; 196: TNK and 196 alteplase) who presented within 3 to 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Baseline patient characteristics in the 0 to 3 hours versus 3- to 4.5-hour time window were similar, except patients in the 3- to 4.5-hour window had lower median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Severity Scale (10 versus 7, respectively) and lower proportion of patients with large vessel occlusion on baseline CT angiography (26.9% versus 18.7%, respectively). Type of thrombolytic agent (tenecteplase versus alteplase) did not modify the association between continuous onset to needle time (P interaction = 0.161) or door-to-needle time (P interaction = 0.972) and primary clinical outcome. Irrespective of the thrombolytic agent used, each 30-minute reduction in onset to needle time was associated with a 1.8% increase while every 10 minutes reduction in door-to-needle time was associated with a 0.2% increase in the probability of achieving 90-day modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 1, respectively.

Conclusions

The effect of time to tenecteplase administration on clinical outcomes is like that of alteplase, with faster administration resulting in better clinical outcomes.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Intravenous (IV) alteplase — pre- and post-treatment blood pressure thresholds and outcomes. The RCTs of IV alteplase required the SBP to be < 185 mm Hg and DBP < 110 mm Hg before treatment and SBP < 180 mm Hg and DBP < 105 mm Hg for the first 24 hours after treatment. Observational studies and meta-analyses suggest that the risk of hemorrhage after administration of alteplase is greater in patients with higher BPs and in patients with more BP variability. The exact BP at which the risk of hemorrhage after IV alteplase increases is unknown. It is thus reasonable to target the BPs used in the RCTs of IV alteplase. ENCHANTED (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study) showed that antihypertensive treatment to target SBP 130 to 140 mm Hg within 6 hours of stroke onset in patients treated with IV thrombolytic did not show improvement in outcome.

### Blood pressure management for ischemic stroke in the first 24 hours [^1163ojjL]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is common after ischemic stroke and associated with a poor functional outcome and increased mortality. The conundrum then arises on whether to lower BP to improve outcome or whether this will worsen cerebral perfusion due to aberrant cerebral autoregulation. A number of large trials of BP lowering have failed to change outcome whether treatment was started prehospital in the community or hospital. Hence, nuances on how to manage high BP are likely, including whether different interventions are needed for different causes, the type and timing of the drug, how quickly BP is lowered, and the collateral effects of the drug, including on cerebral perfusion and platelets. Specific scenarios are also important, including when to lower BP before, during, and after intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular therapy/thrombectomy, when it may be necessary to raise BP, and when antihypertensive drugs taken before stroke should be restarted. This narrative review addresses these and other questions. Although further large trials are ongoing, it is increasingly likely that there is no simple answer. Different subgroups of patients may need to have their BP lowered (eg, before or after thrombolysis), left alone, or elevated.

ASSENT 4 PCI

The Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Treatment Strategy with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (ASSENT 4 PCI) was a phase IIIb/IV study designed to assess the safety and effectiveness of a strategy of administering full dose TNKase with a single bolus of 4000 U of unfractionated heparin in patients with STEMI, in whom primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was planned, but in whom a delay of 1–3 hours was anticipated before PCI. The trial was prematurely terminated with 1667 randomized patients (75 of whom were in the United States) due to a numerically higher mortality in the patients receiving TNKase prior to primary PCI versus PCI without TNKase (median time from randomization to balloon was 115 minutes in patients who were treated with TNKase plus PCI versus 107 minutes in patients who were treated with PCI alone). The incidence of the 90-day primary endpoint, a composite of death or cardiogenic shock or congestive heart failure (CHF) within 90 days, was 18.6% in patients treated with TNKase plus PCI versus 13.4% in those treated with PCI alone (p = 0.0045; RR 1.39 (95% CI 1.11–1.74)).

There were trends toward worse outcomes in the individual components of the primary endpoint between TNKase plus PCI versus PCI alone (mortality 6.7% vs. 4.9%, respectively; cardiogenic shock 6.3% vs. 4.8%, respectively; and CHF 12.0% vs. 9.2%, respectively). In addition, there were trends towards worse outcomes in recurrent MI (6.1% vs. 3.7%, respectively; p = 0.03) and repeat target vessel revascularization (6.6% vs. 3.4%, respectively; p = 0.004) in patients receiving TNKase plus PCI versus PCI alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

There was no difference in in-hospital major bleeding between the two groups (5.6% vs. 4.4% for TNKase plus PCI vs. PCI alone, respectively). For patients treated with TNKase plus PCI, in-hospital rates of intracranial hemorrhage and total stroke were similar to those observed in previous trials (0.97% and 1.8%, respectively); however, none of the patients treated with PCI alone experienced a stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic or other).

Acute ischemic stroke — blood pressure recommendations: Under COR 3: No Benefit (A), in patients with BP < 220/120 mm Hg who do not receive intravenous (IV) thrombolysis or endovascular treatment and do not have a comorbid condition requiring urgent antihypertensive treatment, initiating or reinitiating treatment of hypertension within the first 48 to 72 hours after an acute ischemic stroke is not effective to prevent death or disability. Under COR 3: Harm (A), in patients undergoing successful brain reperfusion with endovascular treatment for a large vessel occlusion, lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 mm Hg within the first 24 to 72 hours after reperfusion can worsen long-term functional outcome.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on blood pressure management in acute ischaemic stroke and intracerebral haemorrhage [^116wD4gz]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

There is no randomised evidence of the safety and efficacy of blood pressure lowering therapies in AIS patients treated with IVT that exceed guideline-recommended blood pressure thresholds (> 185/110 mm Hg before alteplase bolus and > 180/105 mm Hg during and 24 hours after alteplase infusion). However, there is considerable observational data showing that blood pressure protocol violations are common among AIS patients treated with IVT. In particular, a single-centre observational study reported that pre-treatment blood pressure violations (> 185/110 mm Hg) occurred in 12% of AIS treated with IVT in everyday clinical practice and were independently associated with higher likelihood of sICH (OR: 2.59, 95%CI: 1.07–6.25). Moreover, in a recent retrospective analysis of the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke (SITS) thrombolysis registry in regard to 11 off-label criteria related to the European license for alteplase, elevated pre-treatment blood pressure levels represented the only off-label criterion that was independently associated with a higher odds of sICH (OR: 1.39; 95%CI: 1.08–1.80). Finally, a post-hoc analysis of a phase III RCT of sono-thrombolysis that implemented a robust blood pressure control protocol using serial blood pressure recordings before during and after alteplase infusions reported a high rate (34%) of blood pressure excursions above the prespecified thresholds among AIS patients treated with IVT. Most notable was that blood pressure excursions above guideline thresholds were associated with adverse clinical (neurological worsening at 24 hours, functional dependence or death at 3 months) and imaging (any ICH at 24 hours) outcomes. The heterogeneity of the study populations needs to be considered when interpreting these results: patients had different AIS subtypes (large vessel occlusion vs. lacunar stroke), different medical histories (with or without history of hypertension) and received different blood-pressure lowering therapies (b-blockers vs. calcium channel blockers vs. central acting antihypertensives). Finally, no specific antihypertensive agent has been tested for controlling elevated blood pressure levels (exceeding the recommended thresholds before or during IVT for AIS).

Hypertension with acute stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) — blood pressure (BP) management and secondary prevention are specified as follows: In acute intracerebral haemorrhage, "Immediate BP lowering is not recommended for patients with SBP < 220 mmHg", while "In patients with SBP ≥ 220 mmHg, careful acute BP lowering with i.v. therapy to < 180 mmHg should be considered". In acute ischaemic stroke, "routine BP lowering with antihypertensive therapy is not recommended", except that in candidates for i.v. thrombolysis "BP should be carefully lowered and maintained at < 185/105 mmHg for at least the first 24 h after thrombolysis", and in those not receiving fibrinolysis with markedly elevated BP, drug therapy "may be considered… to reduce BP by 15% during the first 24 h after the stroke onset". For hypertensive patients with an acute cerebrovascular event, antihypertensive treatment "is recommended:

- Immediately for TIA.
- After several days in ischaemic stroke". For longer-term secondary prevention after ischaemic stroke or TIA, "an SBP target range of 120–130 mmHg should be considered", and "The recommended antihypertensive drug treatment strategy for stroke prevention is a RAS blocker plus a CCB or a thiazide-like diuretic".

Highlights

The clinical management of ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases comprises a total of 287 recommendations, including 136 new recommendations and 15 revised recommendations from the version in 2019. These highlights reflect significant new therapeutic options developed in recent times that will impact the daily management of patients with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS).

Reperfusion therapy

Tenecteplase (TNK) 0.25 mg/kg intravenous push has been proven non-inferior to intravenous standard dosage of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to treat patients with AIS with < 4.5 hours of onset (Section 3.1).
For patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) type of AIS who present within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, the efficacy of intravenous TNK (0.25 mg/kg) is non-inferior to intravenous rt-PA (0.9 mg/kg) before intra-arterial (IA) mechanical thrombectomy (MT). The TNK might offer better reperfusion outcomes, while the incidence of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH) remains similar (Section 3.1).
For patients with AIS with anterior circulation LVO and a large core infarct within 24 hours of onset and who meet the inclusion criteria of the RESCUE-Japan LIMIT, ANGEL-ASPECT and SELECT 2 trials, IA MT is recommended (Section 3.2).
For patients with acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) within 6 hours of onset who meet the inclusion criteria of the ATTENTION trial, IA MT is recommended (Section 3.2).
Patients with acute BAO within 6–12 hours of onset are recommended for IA MT when they meet the inclusion criteria of the ATTENTION or BAOCHE trials (Section 3.2).
Patients with acute BAO within 12–24 hours of onset are recommended for MT when they meet the inclusion criteria of the BAOCHE trial (Section 3.2).

Other IV fibrinolytics — tenecteplase 0.4-mg/kg in minor neurological impairment — Tenecteplase administered as a 0.4-mg/kg single IV bolus has not been proven to be superior or noninferior to alteplase but might be considered as an alternative to alteplase in patients with minor neurological impairment and no major intracranial occlusion. IV tenecteplase has been compared with IV alteplase up to 6 hours after stroke onset in 3 phase II and 1 phase III superiority trials; in the largest trial of 1100 subjects, tenecteplase at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg failed to demonstrate superiority and had a safety and efficacy profile similar to that of alteplase in a population with minor neurological impairment (median NIHSS score, 4) and no major intracranial occlusion. Tenecteplase is given as a single IV bolus as opposed to the 1-hour infusion of alteplase.

Participants

Individual deidentified participant data used in these analyzes can be shared by request from any qualified investigator following approval of a protocol and signed data access agreement sent to the Research Office of the George Institute for Global Health, Australia.

ENCHANTED was an international, multicenter, 2×2 quasifactorial, prospective, randomized open‐label, blinded end point trial that assessed the effects of low‐ versus standard‐dose intravenous alteplase, and intensive versus guideline‐recommended blood pressure (BP) lowering, in thrombolysis‐eligible patients with AIS, the details of which are outlined elsewhere. In brief, ENCHANTED recruited a total of 4587 patients with AIS, which included 3310 randomly assigned to low‐dose (0.6 mg/kg; 15% as bolus, 85% as infusion over 1 hour) or standard‐dose (0.9 mg/kg; 10% as bolus, 90% as infusion over 1 hour) intravenous alteplase and 2227 were randomly assigned to intensive BP lowering (target systolic BP, 130–140 mm Hg) or guideline‐recommended BP lowering (target systolic BP, < 180 mm Hg). The study protocol was approved by the appropriate ethics committee at each participating center, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient or an appropriate surrogate. The study is registered at(unique identifier: NCT01422616). This article follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline.

Ischemic Stroke

The number of observational studies for acute ischemic strokewas much greater than for acute hemorrhagic stroke. These studies were mostly prospectively designed and dealt with 2 different situations of treatment, i.e. without or with intravenous thrombolysis and arterial mechanical thrombectomy.

In the absence of the interventional revascularization therapy, J- or U-shaped relationship between blood pressure and clinical outcomes after an acute ischemic stroke was observed in almost all studies, including the US Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry with a huge number of patients (n = 309,611). Both high and low blood pressures at admission and the initial hours after an acute ischemic stroke were associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. However, the nadir was different between these studies from 120 to 185 mm Hg of systolic blood pressure, but mostly around 150–160 mm Hg. The difference might have been influenced by several factors. Among others, the timepoint of blood pressure measurement might be crucial. The nadir was higher in the analysis on admission blood pressure than mean blood pressure during the first 24- or 48-hours after stroke onset. There was often a spontaneous blood pressure decline after admission even without any blood pressure lowering medication.

Alteplase postinfusion monitoring and antithrombotic precautions — acute ischemic stroke: Guidelines recommend close monitoring during and for at least 24 hours after infusion in an intensive care or acute stroke unit, with blood pressure and neurological checks every 15 minutes for the first 2 hours, every 30 minutes for the next 6 hours, and every hour for the next 16 hours; a blood pressure goal of < 180/105 mm Hg is recommended for 24 hours. An emergent brain computed tomography (CT) is recommended if headache, nausea, vomiting, or neurological worsening occurs; if such symptoms develop during the infusion, we suggest stopping the infusion temporarily and resuming if the emergent CT shows no ICH. Current AHA/American Stroke Association recommendations include avoiding antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants for 24 hours after infusion (after repeat neuroimaging confirms no asymptomatic blood products); for asymptomatic hemorrhage on the 24-hour image, the timing of antiplatelet initiation should weigh hematoma expansion risk against stroke recurrence risk.

### Antihypertensive therapy in acute ischemic stroke: where do we stand? [^113eJ376]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the proven benefits of strict blood pressure (BP) control on primary and secondary prevention of stroke, management of acute hypertensive response in the early post-stroke period is surrounded by substantial controversy. Observational studies showed that raised BP on ischemic stroke onset is prognostically associated with excess risk for early adverse events and mortality. By contrast, randomized controlled trials and recent meta-analyses showed that although antihypertensive therapy effectively controls elevated BP in the acute stage of ischemic stroke, this BP-lowering effect is not translated into improvement in the risk of death or dependency. On this basis, acute and aggressive BP responses within 24h of stroke onset should be avoided and antihypertensive therapy is recommended only for patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke and BP > 220/120mmHg or those with BP > 185/110mmHg who are eligible for therapy with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator. By contrast, recent clinical trials showed that intensive BP lowering to levels < 140mmHg for systolic BP is safe and lowers the risk of hematoma expansion in patients with acute intra-cerebral hemorrhage and this BP target is recommended by current international guidelines. Herein, we provide an overview of randomized trials and recent meta-analyses on the management of hypertension during the acute stage of ischemic stroke. We discuss several areas of uncertainty and conclude with perspectives for future research.

Overall, this trial failed to achieve the intended target in the valsartan group (defined as a 15% decrease from baseline or to 145 mmHg), (SBP 146.8 mmHg in the valsartan group vs 147.1 mmHg in the control group on the second day. The difference in primary outcome, death or dependency at 90 days, between the treatment and control groups (24.6% vs 22.6%) was not statistically significant. However, reducing BP with valsartan during this acute period was associated with an elevated risk of early neurological deterioration (END) during the first 7 days (secondary outcome).

The Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED) assessed intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering compared with guideline-recommended BP lowering, in patients treated with alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke. The design was a partial-factorial, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial of thrombolysis-eligible patients (age ⩾ 18 years) with acute ischaemic stroke and SBP ⩾ 150 mmHg. Eligible patients were randomly assigned within 6 h of stroke onset to receive intensive (target SBP 130–140 mmHg within 1 h) or guideline (target SBP < 180 mmHg) BP lowering treatment over 72 h. Mean time from stroke onset to randomisation was 3 h. In total, 2196 patients (74% Asian) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (1081 in the intensive group and 1115 in the guideline group), of whom 623 with lacunar ischaemic stroke (333 in the intensive group and 290 in the guideline group), defined based on TOAST criteria. The average achieved SBP difference between randomised groups was of 6 mmHg, much smaller than the envisaged 15 mmHg.

Overall, at 3 months, intensive BP lowering compared with current guideline-recommended BP management after IV alteplase therapy was not associated with a significant difference in functional recovery, as assessed by a shift in the distribution of mRS scores. It was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of intracranial haemorrhage.
