## Question

Warfarin reversal

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about warfarin reversal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and urgency stratification. Then, I should verify the mechanism of warfarin and the pharmacologic goals of reversal. Next, I will review reversal options and their comparative evidence, including vitamin K, 4-factor PCC, FFP, and rFVIIa. After that, I should align dosing strategies to INR and clinical scenario, including ICH, major non-ICH bleeding, and supratherapeutic INR without bleeding. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring and safety, and synthesize a practical algorithm with explicit caveats and evidence strength.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and urgency categories, because the reversal strategy hinges on this. Life-threatening bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage demands immediate reversal, major non-ICH bleeding requires rapid correction, and supratherapeutic INR without bleeding can often be managed more conservatively with close monitoring, acknowledging that the risk of bleeding rises sharply as INR exceeds 4.5 and doubles with each 0.5-unit increment above 4.0, which justifies a lower threshold for action in high-risk patients [^1174t4EA] [^114RkyCW].

> I need to check the pharmacology next. Warfarin inhibits vitamin K epoxide reductase, depleting the hepatic synthesis of factors II, VII, IX, and X, with protein C and S also reduced; clinically meaningful hemostasis generally requires INR around 1.5 or lower, and because warfarin's effect persists for days, durable reversal requires both immediate factor repletion and vitamin K to restore endogenous synthesis, so I should confirm that any plan pairs a fast-acting factor source with vitamin K unless the situation is truly low risk [^117C6G3c] [^112v8KVh] [^115zTNvs].

> Now, let me review reversal options and their evidence. Vitamin K1 is the definitive therapy but slow, with IV onset in roughly 4–6 hours and oral in 18–24 hours; it is essential for sustained reversal and should accompany PCC in urgent settings, while subcutaneous vitamin K is notably less effective and should be avoided, which I should double-check before recommending it [^116eWgBY] [^113JzKC6] [^113NHhBh]. Four-factor PCC is preferred for rapid reversal because it contains II, VII, IX, X plus proteins C and S, achieves faster and more reliable INR correction than FFP, and is associated with lower volume and fewer transfusion-related complications; multiple guidelines endorse 4F-PCC over plasma in life-threatening bleeding or urgent surgery, and meta-analytic data show higher rates of INR normalization with PCC versus FFP, with similar or lower thrombotic event rates, which supports choosing 4F-PCC when available [^111xqKWw] [^116eWgBY] [^1122L9Ly] [^116URsgW]. FFP remains an alternative when PCC is unavailable or contraindicated, but it requires large volumes, thawing time, and is less effective at normalizing INR; I should confirm that FFP is reserved as second-line in this context [^111B1mCo] [^116eWgBY]. Recombinant factor VIIa is not recommended for routine warfarin reversal due to incomplete thrombin generation restoration and thrombotic risk; I should avoid suggesting it outside of exceptional, last-resort scenarios [^117QQqiN] [^116eWgBY].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing strategies and reconcile any discrepancies. The ACC expert consensus provides INR-based 4F-PCC dosing: 25 IU/kg for INR 2– < 4, 35 IU/kg for INR 4–6, and 50 IU/kg for INR > 6, with a maximum of 5,000 units regardless of weight, which is the regimen most commonly cited in contemporary pathways; I initially thought the cap was 100 kg, but wait, let me verify — yes, the cap is 5,000 units total, not tied to a weight ceiling, so I should correct that misstatement now [^116eWgBY]. Some centers use fixed lower-dose regimens, and a retrospective study suggested similar INR correction with lower total PCC exposure, but given the strength of guideline support, I should prioritize the INR-based ACC dosing unless local protocols dictate otherwise [^116TWfcD] [^116eWgBY]. For vitamin K, 5–10 mg IV by slow infusion is standard in urgent settings, with oral vitamin K reserved for nonurgent supratherapeutic INR without bleeding; I need to ensure I specify slow IV infusion to mitigate anaphylactoid risk [^116eWgBY] [^113JzKC6].

> Next, I should review intracranial hemorrhage, where time-to-reversal is critical. ICH accounts for a substantial fraction of anticoagulant-associated hemorrhages and carries high early mortality; rapid reversal with 4F-PCC plus IV vitamin K is strongly recommended, with repeat INR 15–60 minutes after PCC and serial checks every 6–8 hours for 24–48 hours, and FFP reserved only if PCC is unavailable; faster door-to-treatment times correlate with better outcomes, reinforcing the need for pre-specified protocols and rapid administration [^113w1W4D] [^117QQqiN] [^115uGhBK]. Let me reconsider whether subtherapeutic INR obviates reversal; emerging observational data suggest uncertain functional benefit from reversing subtherapeutic warfarin in ICH, though mortality signals have been variably reported, so I should avoid overgeneralization and tailor decisions to hematoma size, expansion risk, and neurosurgical input [^113gxuBN].

> For major non-ICH bleeding, I should confirm that the same principles apply: 4F-PCC plus IV vitamin K achieves rapid, sustained correction and is preferred over FFP; in gastrointestinal bleeding specifically, contemporary gastroenterology guidance supports PCC over FFP when reversal is indicated, and although one retrospective study associated PCC use with higher mortality, confounding by severity is likely, so I should interpret that signal cautiously and not let it delay appropriate reversal in unstable patients [^116eWgBY] [^112Nxfti] [^112A2XgL]. But wait, what if the patient is volume depleted and could benefit from plasma's colloid? In that narrow circumstance, FFP may be reasonable as a bridge while arranging PCC, but I should be explicit that this is a compromise strategy, not first-line [^116eWgBY].

> For supratherapeutic INR without bleeding, I need to ensure I do not over-treat. With INR 4.5–10 and no bleeding, simply holding warfarin is often sufficient, and routine vitamin K does not clearly improve clinically relevant outcomes; if rapid correction is needed for procedures or high bleeding risk, 1–2.5 mg oral vitamin K is reasonable, whereas IV vitamin K is reserved for more urgent needs or higher INR, and I should double-check that subcutaneous routes remain discouraged due to erratic absorption [^115n2bb9] [^113JzKC6] [^114RkyCW]. If INR exceeds 10 or there is serious bleeding risk, 2.5–5 mg oral or 5–10 mg IV vitamin K is appropriate, with the understanding that IV acts faster but carries a small anaphylactoid risk if infused too rapidly [^116eWgBY] [^113JzKC6].

> I will now examine special populations and edge cases. In trauma, early PCC plus 5 mg IV vitamin K is a grade 1A recommendation, and I should confirm that 3-factor PCC is generally inferior for INR correction when factor VII is depleted, favoring 4-factor products when available [^115zTNvs]. In LVAD patients, full-dose PCC may overshoot and increase thrombosis risk; low-dose, partial reversal strategies have been described, but I need to emphasize that this is off-label and should be coordinated with the heart failure team and local protocols [^111SCbgZ]. In intentional overdose without an anticoagulation indication, delayed peaks of warfarin effect can occur, so I should consider early vitamin K with serial INRs rather than waiting for very high values, balancing bleeding risk against unnecessary reversal [^116WihxC] [^111nHXMm].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. After PCC, I need to check INR within 15–60 minutes and then every 6–8 hours for 24–48 hours, watching for rebound coagulopathy and thrombotic complications; if INR remains 1.4 or higher in the first day, adding FFP is reasonable, and I should avoid repeat PCC dosing unless absolutely necessary due to thrombosis risk [^117QQqiN]. I should confirm that patients receiving more than 2.5 mg of vitamin K for reversal may have delayed resumption of therapeutic anticoagulation for weeks, so bridging with heparin may be needed when rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated after procedures [^115N48Fg].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, but I will keep verifying each step against guidelines. Stop warfarin immediately, then stratify: if there is life-threatening bleeding or ICH, give 4F-PCC per INR-based dosing plus 5–10 mg IV vitamin K and recheck INR in 15–60 minutes; if PCC is unavailable, use FFP 10–20 mL/kg with IV vitamin K as a bridge while obtaining PCC. For major non-ICH bleeding, use 4F-PCC plus IV vitamin K when rapid reversal is needed, reserving FFP if PCC is not available. For INR 4.5–10 without bleeding, hold warfarin and observe; consider 1–2.5 mg oral vitamin K if faster correction is needed, escalating to 2.5–5 mg orally or 5–10 mg IV if INR is very high or bleeding risk is high. Throughout, avoid subcutaneous vitamin K, avoid rFVIIa except in extraordinary circumstances, and coordinate with the procedural team and pharmacy for timely product administration [^116eWgBY] [^111xqKWw] [^117QQqiN] [^115zTNvs].

> Finally, I should double-check the strength of evidence and acknowledge uncertainties. The core recommendations for 4F-PCC plus IV vitamin K in life-threatening bleeding are supported by multiple guidelines and comparative data showing faster INR correction and favorable safety versus FFP, though much of the evidence is graded low to moderate and not always mortality-proven; nonetheless, in ICH and trauma, faster reversal correlates with improved surrogate and some clinical outcomes, which justifies adhering to these standards while continuing to individualize care and monitor closely for thrombotic events [^111xqKWw] [^116eWgBY] [^1122L9Ly] [^115uGhBK].

Warfarin reversal requires **rapid INR correction** and **durable hemostasis** [^112v8KVh]. The standard approach is **4-factor PCC plus IV vitamin K** for major bleeding or urgent procedures, achieving rapid INR reduction and sustained correction [^115nLRBT] [^116aoit1]. FFP is a second-line option when PCC is unavailable or contraindicated, and rFVIIa is reserved for life-threatening bleeding when other options fail [^116eWgBY] [^115AAK3U]. For minor bleeding or elevated INR without bleeding, hold warfarin and give 1–2.5 mg oral vitamin K; use 2.5–5 mg IV vitamin K for INR > 10 or rapid correction needs [^113JzKC6]. Monitor INR 15–60 minutes after PCC and repeat every 6–8 hours for 24–48 hours; watch for thrombotic events and adjust anticoagulation resumption accordingly [^117QQqiN].

---

## Indications for warfarin reversal

Warfarin reversal is indicated in the following clinical scenarios:

- **Major bleeding**: Gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, retroperitoneal bleeding, or any bleeding causing hemodynamic instability [^notfound].

- **Life-threatening bleeding**: Active bleeding with hemodynamic instability or organ compromise [^111aRLHb].

- **Urgent surgery or invasive procedures**: Procedures that cannot be delayed beyond 6–12 hours [^116uUnaS].

- **Supratherapeutic INR without bleeding**: INR > 10 or INR 4.5–10 with high bleeding risk [^111nHXMm].

---

## Reversal agents and strategies

Several **reversal agents and strategies** are available, each with distinct pharmacological properties, onset of action, and clinical indications:

| **Reversal agent** | **Mechanism of action** | **Onset of action** | **Clinical indications** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Vitamin K (phytonadione) | - Restores hepatic synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) <br/> - Sustained reversal | - Oral: 18–24 hours <br/> - IV: 4–6 hours | - Minor bleeding <br/> - Supratherapeutic INR without bleeding <br/> - Adjunct to PCC for sustained reversal [^116eWgBY] |
| 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) | - Replenishes vitamin K-dependent clotting factors <br/> - Rapid INR correction | 15–30 minutes | - Major bleeding <br/> - Life-threatening bleeding <br/> - Urgent surgery/invasive procedures [^111xqKWw] |
| Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) | Provides all clotting factors, including vitamin K-dependent factors | 30–60 minutes | Second-line when PCC is unavailable or contraindicated [^111B1mCo] |
| Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) | - Directly activates coagulation cascade <br/> - Bypasses vitamin K-dependent factors | 10–15 minutes | Reserved for life-threatening bleeding refractory to other therapies [^115AAK3U] |

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), American College of Cardiology (ACC), and European Stroke Organisation (ESO) provide clear recommendations on warfarin reversal:

- **Major bleeding or urgent procedures**: Use 4-factor PCC plus IV vitamin K (5–10 mg) [^111xqKWw] [^116eWgBY].

- **Minor bleeding or elevated INR without bleeding**: Hold warfarin and administer oral vitamin K (1–2.5 mg) [^113JzKC6].

- **INR > 10 or rapid correction needed**: Use IV vitamin K (2.5–5 mg) [^notfound].

- **PCC dosing**: INR-based dosing (INR 2–4: 25 IU/kg; INR 4–6: 35 IU/kg; INR > 6: 50 IU/kg; max 5,000 IU) [^116eWgBY].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

After reversal, **close monitoring** is essential:

- **INR monitoring**: Check INR 15–60 minutes after PCC and every 6–8 hours for 24–48 hours [^117QQqiN].

- **Clinical monitoring**: Watch for recurrent bleeding and thrombotic events [^notfound].

- **Resumption of anticoagulation**: Restart warfarin when hemostasis is secure and bleeding risk is acceptable; consider bridging with LMWH or UFH if high thrombotic risk [^112Nxfti].

---

## Risks and complications

Warfarin reversal carries potential risks, including **thrombotic events** — such as stroke, pulmonary embolism, or myocardial infarction — particularly with PCC or rFVIIa [^116eWgBY], and **allergic reactions**, including rare anaphylaxis with IV vitamin K or FFP. Volume overload may occur with FFP, especially in patients with limited cardiac reserve [^1128EJLJ].

---

## Special considerations

- **Mechanical heart valves**: High thrombotic risk; minimize time off anticoagulation and consider bridging therapy [^notfound].

- **Renal impairment**: No dose adjustment needed for vitamin K or PCC [^notfound].

- **Liver disease**: Increased bleeding risk; monitor closely and adjust therapy as needed [^notfound].

---

Warfarin reversal is a **structured process** that balances bleeding control with thrombotic risk. Use **4-factor PCC plus IV vitamin K** for major bleeding or urgent procedures, and tailor vitamin K dosing to INR and bleeding severity. Monitor INR and clinical status closely, and resume anticoagulation thoughtfully once hemostasis is secure.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios-is there a general consensus? [^114w3gkj]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation is key to the treatment/prevention of thromboembolic events. The primary complication of anticoagulation is serious or life-threatening hemorrhage, which may necessitate prompt anticoagulation reversal; this could also be required for nonbleeding patients requiring urgent/emergent invasive procedures. The decision to reverse anticoagulation should weigh the benefit-risk ratio of supporting hemostasis versus post-reversal thrombosis. We appraise the available guidelines/recommendations for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) reversal in the management of major bleeding, and also assess recent clinical data that may not yet be reflected in official guidance. In general, available guidelines are consistent in their recommendations, advocating administration of vitamin K and 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCCs) rather than fresh frozen plasma to patients with VKA-associated intracranial hemorrhage and life-threatening bleeding, and specific reversal agents as essential therapy for DOAC reversal in those same severe conditions. However, guidelines also recommend off-label use of PCCs for DOAC reversal when specific reversal agents are unavailable. Limited recent evidence generally support the latter recommendation, but guidelines are likely to evolve as more data become available.

3 Consensus and divergence between the recommendations

3.1. Methodology of guideline development

Methodologies employed by guideline authors to generate recommendations on anticoagulant reversal strategies are summarized in Table 1. Most recommendations are based on a systematic review of the literature and acknowledge the lack of irrefutable evidence to fully support their recommendations, as specific reversal agents were either still in development or only recently approved at the time the guidance was developed. While clinical trial data support recommendations for PCC use in VKA reversal, recommendations for PCC use in DOAC reversal were mainly based on expert opinion extrapolated from a small evidence base primarily in animal and in vitro models, healthy volunteers, and two small prospective cohorts of bleeding patients.

3.2. Anticoagulant reversal recommendations

3.2.1. Vitamin K antagonists

All guidelines recommend or suggest administering PCCs for VKA reversal only in cases of severe and life-threatening bleeding or prior to emergency surgery (Table 2).

1 Introduction

Anticoagulant therapy is fundamental for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases. With an aging population, the number of people requiring chronic oral anticoagulation to manage conditions such as atrial fibrillation is increasing. Options for anticoagulation have been increasing – currently available options include vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, primarily warfarin) and the newer direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, and betrixaban). However, several studies describe the risk of hemorrhage in patients taking anticoagulants. VKA use has been associated with more than double the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) versus non-use, while patients receiving DOAC therapy have a lower or comparable risk of ICH or major bleeding compared with VKA therapy. While DOACs have significantly changed the anticoagulation therapy landscape, DOAC-treated patients remain at some risk of major bleeding (up to 5% of patients, based on clinical trial data).

Prompt anticoagulation reversal during severe/life-threatening bleeding events is a key component of multimodal therapy in these complex and fortunately rare clinical scenarios. However, the decision to reverse anticoagulation should weigh the benefit–risk ratio of supporting hemostasis and potentially promoting post-reversal thrombosis. The advisability of administering reversal agents depends upon several clinical factors, including patient stability, timing of last anticoagulant dose, baseline coagulation assays (particularly international normalized ratio [INR] in the case of VKA-related hemorrhage), and product availability. Reversal and other management strategies are often administered sequentially if required to obtain adequate control of bleeding.

VKA reversal can be achieved by various treatment approaches including fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs; including 3- or 4-factor PCC [3F-PCC or 4F-PCC] and activated PCC [aPCC]). Historically, clinicians used FFP for VKA reversal, but PCCs have taken precedence in this setting. In contrast to FFP, PCCs require a lower infusion volume and shorter infusion time, are associated with a lower risk of pathogen transmission, and have a more rapid impact on INR. Several clinical trials have found 4F-PCCs to be effective agents for urgent VKA reversal in patients with major bleeding or prior to emergency surgery. The potential for increased post-treatment risk of thromboembolic events (TEEs) with 4F-PCCs is a concern, though several studies have shown this risk to be similar to that with FFP.

### Warfarin reversal [^114zn2FV]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Warfarin is the most commonly used oral anticoagulant in the UK. It is associated with few side effects apart from haemorrhage. The most appropriate way to reverse the anticoagulant effect of warfarin depends on the clinical circumstances. In serious bleeding, rapid reversal is required, whereas in minor bleeding or asymptomatic over anticoagulation, a more leisurely approach is usually appropriate. This review discusses the current approaches to warfarin reversal in clinical practice. The development of a uniform approach to warfarin reversal in the Northern Region is described.

### Reversing vitamin K antagonists: making the old new again [^117C6G3c]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are commonly used for the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders. The response to VKAs is highly variable due to their specific interaction with the vitamin K cycle, and hence interference with hepatic synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Monitoring the anticoagulant effect of VKAs by assessing the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is essential because complications are closely related to the intensity of anticoagulation. Treatment with VKAs contains a substantial risk of bleeding with a high case fatality rate. Reversal of VKAs is required in case of bleeding or a supratherapeutic INR, but also prior to high-risk surgery or interventions. Choice of methods to reverse VKAs depends on whether or not the patient is bleeding or is in need of an urgent procedure, and has to be based on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the VKA. Reversal strategies include withholding the VKA, administration of vitamin K 1, and substitution of vitamin K-dependent procoagulant factors, and need to be combined with measures according to general bleeding management.

2 Methodology

This is a narrative review based on relevant US and international anticoagulation management and reversal guidelines published prior to April 2020; these were identified through PubMed and Internet searches, using the search terms "(anticoagulant reversal guidelines) OR anticoagulation reversal guidelines". Where appropriate, the authors supplemented the searches according to their own understanding of the subject area. Clinical studies and reviews/meta-analyses published after January 1, 2018 were identified using similar search terms in PubMed: ((anticoagulant reversal) OR anticoagulation reversal) AND ("2018/01/01"[Date - Publication]: "3000"[Date - Publication]). Clinical studies and key reviews/meta-analyses focusing on the efficacy/safety of non-specific anticoagulation reversal agents in VKA and DOAC reversal were included, as were articles focusing on the efficacy/safety of idarucizumab in dabigatran reversal and the efficacy/safety of andexanet alfa in rivaroxaban/apixaban reversal. We selected the Jan. 1, 2018 cut-off, to capture recent important studies reported after the guidelines were published and thus not considered by those panels.

### Systemic anticoagulation and reversal [^116FZfgk]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

An increasing number of patients are on anticoagulation for a variety of indications. Patients on anticoagulation who present to the hospital with life-threatening hemorrhage, whether trauma related or not, must be assessed for the reversal of anticoagulation. Identification of the type of anticoagulation, the timing of the most recent usage of anticoagulation, and the efficacy of the anticoagulation all have an impact on whether reversal agents should be used. There are a variety of reversal agents, both nonspecific and specific, that could be used for reversal; however, not all reversal agents work for all anticoagulation medication. As more anticoagulation medications are used and indications expand, providers must be aware of the reversal agents available and the efficacy and indications for these reversal agents.

### Vitamin K for reversal of excessive vitamin K antagonist anticoagulation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115n2bb9]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) with an international normalized ratio (INR) between 4.5 and 10 are at increased risk of bleeding. We systematically reviewed the literature to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of administering vitamin K in patients receiving VKA therapy with INR between 4.5 and 10 and without bleeding. Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant randomized controlled trials in April 2018. Search strategy included terms vitamin K administration and VKA-related terms. Reference lists of relevant studies were reviewed, and experts in the field were contacted for relevant papers. Two investigators independently screened and collected data. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated, and certainty of the evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Six studies (1074 participants) were included in the review and meta-analyses. Pooled estimates indicate a nonsignificant increased risk of mortality (RR = 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.62–2.47), bleeding (RR = 2.24; 95% CI, 0.81–7.27), and thromboembolism (RR = 1.29; 95% CI, 0.35–4.78) for vitamin K administration, with moderate certainty of the evidence resulting from serious imprecision as CIs included potential for benefit and harm. Patients receiving vitamin K had a nonsignificant increase in the likelihood of reaching goal INR (1.95; 95% CI, 0.88–4.33), with very low certainty of the evidence resulting from serious risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. Our findings indicate that patients on VKA therapy who have an INR between 4.5 and 10.0 without bleeding are not likely to benefit from vitamin K administration in addition to temporary VKA cessation.

### Coagulation assessment with the new generation of oral anticoagulants [^117BC8Le]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Reversal of OACs

The effects of warfarin on coagulation extend over the drug's half-life of several days; hence, simply stopping warfarin will not rapidly reverse the anticoagulated state. Emergency management of patients treated with warfarin is discussed in depth in many clinical guidelines that advise on interventions according to INR status, the need for invasive procedures and bleeding risk or severity; these are reviewed in table 3. Vitamin K 1 (phytonadione), administered orally or intravenously, can be used to accelerate warfarin reversal to some extent by counteracting its effects on vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor synthesis. The effect of vitamin K 1 on reversal of VKA-based anticoagulation is not immediate but will progress over 18–24 h or more as the liver synthesises sufficient quantities of vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins (factors II, VII, IX and X) to re-establish effective clotting, a process that takes even longer in the presence of liver disease or other metabolic or nutritional problems.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios-is there a general consensus? [^115XYwiB]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Since DOACs have shorter half-lives compared with warfarin, many non-life-threatening bleeding events are adequately controlled through supportive care (e.g. temporarily withholding DOAC therapy, blood product transfusion, etc). However, during a life-threatening bleed, DOAC reversal may become necessary in addition to supportive therapy and, in the recently dosed patient, oral activated charcoal administration. Vigorous resuscitation encompasses surgical control of bleeding when direct pressure cannot be applied, along with other stabilizing measures, such as FFP, 3F- or 4F-PCCs, and aPCCs. Emergency hemodialysis may remove dabigatran from the circulation but is often logistically challenging or not available; dialysis is not effective for anti-FXa anticoagulants.

Unlike VKA reversal, DOAC reversal has, until recently, been a clinical challenge due to limited availability of/access to specific reversal agents. Two specific reversal agents are now available: idarucizumab for dabigatran, and andexanet alfa for apixaban and rivaroxaban. Idarucizumab was approved in 2015 (US and Europe). Data from a large clinical study show that idarucizumab was associated with cessation of bleeding and normal periprocedural hemostasis in the majority of patients with major bleeding/requirement for urgent surgery, respectively. Andexanet alfa (approved in the US in 2018 and approved conditionally in Europe in 2019) is a relatively recent addition to the reversal agent armamentarium and is not mentioned in a majority of current guidelines. Limited availability and high cost may have constrained its use in clinical practice. Clinical trial evidence suggests that andexanet alfa reduces anti-factor Xa activity by > 90% in patients with major bleeding events.

In this narrative review, we appraise available guidelines and recommendations on bleeding management for VKA and DOAC reversal, and examine recent efficacy and safety data supporting use of reversal agents in this setting.

### Acute intracerebral haemorrhage: diagnosis and management [^111YXMSF]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

If the patient takes anticoagulant treatment, how do I reverse it?

Anticoagulation-associated ICH accounts for nearly 20% of all cases. The haemorrhage in this setting is of larger volume, is more likely to exhibit haematoma expansionand is associated with higher morbidity and mortalitycompared with ICH not associated with anticoagulation. Stopping antithrombotic therapy and reversing anticoagulation immediately after the diagnosis of ICH is, therefore, crucial. Although ICH risk associated with the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) was around half that of warfarin in randomised trials, a previous lack of specific reversal agents for DOACs prompted concerns that DOAC-associated ICH may be associated with poorer outcomes. In fact, the prognosis of ICH associated with DOACs is likely betteror at least no worsethan that of warfarin, and the availability of approved specific reversal agents for DOACs has improved. Table 2 provides a guide to the reversal of anticoagulation.

Table 2
Strategies and rationale for anticoagulation reversal in acute ICH

Poorer outcomes are also seen for ICH associated with antiplatelet therapy, but platelet transfusions increase rather than decrease morbidity and mortality in this group, and therefore should not be used.

Patients with ICH in the context of coagulation factor deficiencies or thrombocytopenia should undergo replacement, with input from a haematologist. Several trials have assessed the efficacy of coagulation factors more generally in the management of acute ICH but found that the risk of thromboembolic complications outweighed the benefits. A trial of early administration of factor VIIa in an identified subgroup of patients most likely to benefit, however, has been approved (FASTEST, NCT03496883). Antifibrinolytic drugs, on the other hand, have proven promising. A large trial of intravenous tranexamic acid (TICH-2) showed a significant reduction in haematoma growth and early mortality, but there was no overall benefit for the primary outcome of later functional recovery, and it is thus not recommended as part of current care. A further study focusing on effects on early mortality and targeting earlier treatment is planned, and an ongoing trial is evaluating tranexamic acid in hyperacute presentations of ICH including mobile units (STOP-MSU, NCT03385928). Randomised evidence on associations of tranexamic acid in anticoagulation-associated ICH is lacking, although a trial in DOAC-associated ICH is currently underway (TICH-NOAC, NCT02866838).

### Indications and methods of anticoagulation reversal [^111dfhr5]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The use of anticoagulation in the prevention of strokes due to atrial fibrillation or the treatment of venous thromboembolic disease has been on the rise. With the advent and proliferation of direct oral anticoagulation medications, the management of anticoagulation reversal has become increasingly complex, especially when urgent or emergent reversal is required. This review details the commonly used parenteral and oral anticoagulants, the treatment strategies necessary for their reversal, and therapies still in development.

### Reversing anticoagulants: influence of anticoagulation stewardship and key considerations for optimizing outcomes [^112ATUzv]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

The reversal of anticoagulants can be a complex process with limited data describing the optimal overall approach beyond a specific reversal agent. Recent advances in anticoagulation stewardship have created opportunities to standardize and optimize the reversal of anticoagulants, especially in urgent life-threatening bleeding events. This article explores how pharmacists provided anticoagulation stewardship activities positively impact outcomes related to urgent anticoagulation reversal.

Warfarin is a commonly prescribed anticoagulant that may, in selected situations, require rapid reversal of its effects. Several approaches to achieve reversal have been explored, including the administration of prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), Many factors can influence determination of an appropriate PCC dose and the resulting effects. Considerations on the use of PCC products to expedite the reversal of warfarin are described.

4 Recent evidence for anticoagulant reversal

To identify any gaps between the available guidelines and currently available clinical evidence, we conducted a search to identify key clinical studies and reviews/metanalyses, focusing on efficacy/safety of non-specific and specific anticoagulation reversal agents for VKAs and DOACs. Key data for all articles are provided in Supplementary Table 1. There is recent evidence that 4F-PCCs effectively reduce INR in patients with VKA-associated bleeding, with TEE rates ranging from 1.8 to 6.5% data from a meta-analysis of PCC use in VKA-associated ICH support these findings. 4F-PCC was shown to reduce INR more effectively compared with 3F-PCC alone, but not compared with 3F-PCC + rFVIIa; however, 4F-PCC has also been associated with a significantly lower rate of TEEs compared with 3F-PCC + rFVIIa. In contrast, one recent retrospective study of emergency department data reported an increased rate of TEEs in patients on warfarin who received 4F-PCC compared with FFP. aPCC appears to be similarly effective to 4F-PCC, and more effective than FFP, in reversing INR in patients with hemorrhage and traumatic ICH, respectively, with no significant different in TEE rate between treatments. One meta-analysis assessed the use of vitamin K for VKA reversal in patients with elevated INR (4.5–10) but no bleeding, concluding that vitamin K administration was not significantly associated with achieving the goal of timely INR reduction in this population.

### Anticoagulation reversal [^1129D4x5]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Today a variety of anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are available on the market. Given the propensity for bleeding among patients prescribed these medications, the emergency medicine physician must be equipped with a working knowledge of hemostasis, and anticoagulant and antiplatelet reversal. This article reviews strategies to address bleeding complications occurring secondary to warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin, and direct oral anticoagulant therapy.

### Role of prothrombin complex concentrates in reversing warfarin anticoagulation: a review of the literature [^1114be4B]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Over-anticoagulation is a common problem with warfarin therapy and can lead to major or life-threatening bleeding. The goal of urgent warfarin reversal is to elevate or replace vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. In the United States, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is considered the standard of care for warfarin reversal. Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) offer an alternative to FFP for rapidly replacing deficient clotting factors and correcting the international normalized ratio (INR). However, few prospective clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these concentrates relative to other treatment modalities. A review of the published literature over the last 30 years found that PCCs offer a rapid and specific method for replacing vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and restoring normal hemostasis in the context of over-coagulation. In those studies in which PCCs were compared with FFP, PCCs were found more effective in shortening the time to INR correction and were associated with a low risk of thrombotic adverse events. Evidence-based treatment guidelines are needed to optimize the use of PCCs for warfarin reversal.

### Anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation: should warfarin be temporarily stopped or continued after acute cardioembolic stroke? [^117TqQXR]. Age and Ageing (2010). Low credibility.

Despite anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, some patients still suffer an ischaemic stroke. The issue of whether to stop or continue warfarin, or possibly to reverse the anticoagulation is an area of uncertainty. Continued anticoagulation may, however, increase haemorrhagic transformation of the infarct. In this article we review the published evidence in an attempt to quantify the risks and benefits of each treatment strategy and identify areas for further research.

5 Discussion/summary

While VKAs have traditionally been the mainstay for anticoagulation, DOACs represent a major development in treating and preventing venous thromboembolic disease and in suppressing stroke risk in atrial fibrillation. Interest in DOAC therapy has increased significantly over time, with prescription claims rising from 15.4% to 31.0% of all oral anticoagulant claims between 2013 and 2015, according to US Medicare data. Google Trend data also indicate an increasing global interest in DOAC therapy; the greatest number of searches for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban between 2012 and 2017 were conducted in North America, central/eastern Europe, and Australia. Interest in edoxaban was less pronounced and restricted to Germany, Japan, and the United States. Interest in warfarin therapy, in contrast to DOAC therapy, has decreased significantly over time.

A key issue with guidelines is that they become out of date as soon as they are published, due to the continuous publication of new clinical data. This is especially relevant for DOAC reversal, with several current guidelines published prior to the approval of andexanet alfa. Attempts are being made to update guidelines to address use of this agent. Recent clinical data support the use of 4F-PCC in VKA reversal and also DOAC reversal if specific agents are not available, while currently available clinical data on idarucizumab and andexanet alfa supports their use in specific DOAC reversal. It is likely that anticoagulation reversal guidelines will continue to evolve, particularly in the case of specific DOAC reversal agents, as more evidence becomes available on their appropriate use.

### European Stroke Organisation guideline on reversal of oral anticoagulants in acute intracerebral haemorrhage [^113w1W4D]. European Stroke Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

The aim of the present European Stroke Organisation guideline document is to provide clinically useful evidence-based recommendation on reversal of anticoagulant activity VKA (warfarin, phenprocoumon and acenocoumarol), direct factor II (thrombin) inhibitors (dabigatran etexilat) and factor-Xa-inhibitors (apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) in patients with acute intracerebral haemorrhage. The guideline was prepared following the Standard Operational Procedure for a European Stroke Organisation guideline document and according to GRADE methodology. As a basic principle, we defined use of oral anticoagulation pragmatically: oral anticoagulation use is assumed by positive medical history unless relevant anticoagulant activity is regarded unlikely by medical history or has been ruled out by laboratory testing. Overall, we strongly recommend using prothrombin complex over no treatment and fresh-frozen plasma in patients on VKA plus vitamin K. We further strongly recommend using idarucizumab in patients on dabigatran and make a recommendation for andexanet alfa in patients on rivaroxaban and apixaban over no treatment. We make a weak recommendation on using high-dose prothrombin complex concentrate (50 IU/kg) for all patients taking edoxaban and for patients on rivaroxaban or apixaban in case andexanet alfa is not available. We recommend against using tranexamic acid and rFVIIa, outside of trials. The presented treatment recommendations aim to normalise coagulation, there is no or only indirect data on effects on functional outcome or mortality, and only little data from randomised controlled trials.

### Thromboembolic events after vitamin K antagonist reversal with 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate: exploratory analyses of two randomized, plasma-controlled studies [^116D7o8K]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Background

Health care providers prescribe warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, to more than 3.4 million patients annually in the United States for various prothrombotic conditions. The Food and Drug Administration describes warfarin as among the top 10 drugs with the largest number of serious adverse drug reactions submitted during the 1990s and 2000s.

Vitamin K antagonists reduce the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with prothrombotic conditions by inhibiting the synthesis of functional vitamin K–dependent clotting factors (factor [F] II, VII, IX, and X) and proteins C and S. Patients receiving vitamin K antagonists who are actively bleeding or in need of an urgent surgical procedure need rapid reversal of anticoagulation by prompt replenishment of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors. In the current literature and guidelines, a combination therapy of vitamin K and either plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate is recommended for acute reversal of oral anticoagulation. –

### Novel oral anticoagulants: efficacy, laboratory measurement, and approaches to emergent reversal [^112EiJjk]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Warfarin, the most commonly used of the vitamin K antagonists, has been a mainstay of oral anticoagulation for decades. However, its usage is limited by morbidity and mortality secondary to bleeding as well as a cumbersome therapeutic monitoring process. In the past several years, a number of competing novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed, each of which aspires to match or exceed warfarin's effectiveness while mitigating bleeding risk and eliminating therapeutic monitoring requirements. At present, 1 oral direct thrombin inhibitor and 2 direct factor Xa inhibitors are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Here, we compare the clinical efficacy and safety profiles of these new drugs. In addition, we discuss various laboratory assays that may be useful to measure these drugs in certain clinical circumstances. Finally, we discuss emerging strategies to reverse these agents in an emergency. The purpose of this article is to provide a framework for practicing pathologists to advise clinicians on NOAC laboratory measurement and management of NOAC-associated bleeding.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios-is there a general consensus? [^1123WpAp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Various studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of 4F-PCCs in DOAC reversal, in settings including major bleeding and requirement for urgent surgery. 4F-PCC was generally effective in achieving hemostasis in patients with major bleeding, with TEE rates ranging from 0% to 8%, and appeared to be associated with a mortality benefit versus no reversal treatment in patients with traumatic ICH. However, one meta-analysis (including 10 case series) reported that it was difficult to assess whether the addition of 4F-PCCs was more effective in managing major bleeding compared with cessation of DOAC therapy alone. Another meta-analysis compared anticoagulant reversal rates for non-specific and specific reversal agents, reporting that patients on Factor Xa inhibitors generally experienced higher reversal rates compared with patients on dabigatran; reversal rates were highest in each case when a specific reversal agent was used. Activated PCC was also shown to be effective in reversing DOAC anticoagulation due to bleeding or requirement for urgent surgical intervention, with TEE rates ranging from 8 to 10%.

A retrospective study investigated the safety and efficacy of 4F-PCC in patients with major bleeding, comparing outcomes according to baseline anticoagulation therapy (warfarin, rivaroxaban, or apixaban). Here, 4F-PCC effectively reversed warfarin, rivaroxaban, and apixaban anticoagulation, with < 6% of patients experiencing TEEs; no between-group difference was observed in terms of either efficacy or safety for any treatment. Another retrospective study of 4F-PCC in patients on warfarin or DOAC therapy with major bleeding/requiring emergent surgery supported these results, but reported a higher overall TEE rate (10.4%). Findings from a systematic review of studies including patients on VKA or DOAC therapy who received acute reversal management favored the use of PCC (particularly 4F-PCC) for VKA reversal, noting that TEE rates were higher in VKA patients receiving FFP versus those who received 4F-PCC; the authors did not recommend any particular therapy for DOAC reversal.

### A surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part one: warfarin and new direct oral anticoagulant medications [^1128EJLJ]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

Urgent warfarin reversal: Fortunately, the anticoagulant effect of warfarin is reversible. The reversal strategy should be tailored to the clinical scenario (active bleeding or impending risk of bleeding from procedure vs no active or impending bleeding risk) and the level of the INR. The remaining section addresses the rapid reversal of warfarin for clinical scenarios in which ongoing therapeutic anticoagulation provides a major risk to the patient.

The reversal strategy is based on warfarin's mechanism of action. As a vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibitor, warfarin competitively inhibits the hepatic synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. To immediately reverse the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, replacement of the depleted vitamin K-dependent clotting factors is the first course of action. Therapeutic options for factor replacement include fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs). Other prohemostatic agents, such as activated factor VII and anti-inhibitor coagulant complex (FEIBA), are not recommended for this purpose. To maintain reversal of warfarin, which has an effective half-life of 20–60 hours exceeding some components of FFP and PCC, supplemental vitamin K should be administered. Supplemental vitamin K allows for the resumption of native hepatic synthesis of the vitamin K-dependent factors by overcoming the competitive inhibition of warfarin on the reductase enzyme.

Fresh frozen plasma: Although FFP is commonly used in the United States to reverse warfarin, evidence for its effectiveness with respect to INR correction in the setting of hemorrhage, intracranial, or otherwise is poor. In a study of nearly 5000 FFP transfusions for varying indications, the median reduction in INR was 0.2.FFP is a component of whole blood that contains all of the coagulation factors and is stored frozen to preserve the function of the heat-labile factors V and VIII. As such, it cannot be administered quickly because of the time required to thaw. Each unit is ∼200 mL in volume, and the recommended initial dose is 15 mL/kg, which translates to roughly four units for a 70 kg patient. This relatively large volume may be of benefit in situations of significant blood loss, where intravascular volume is depleted. In situations where intravascular volume is not depleted (such as an intracranial bleed or a situation where warfarin needs to be reversed prior to an operation), however, the relatively large volume of plasma required to reverse warfarin can be deleterious, potentially contributing to transfusion-associated circulatory overload in patients with limited cardiac reserve.

Regarding specific circumstances for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, more specifically with respect to warfarin reversal before surgery, BSH 2013 guidelines recommend to correct INR by giving prothrombin complex concentrate and intravenous vitamin K for surgery that requires reversal of warfarin and which cannot be delayed for vitamin K to have time to take effect.

### Treatment of warfarin-associated coagulopathy: a physician survey [^111gsmvc]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

(1) To determine physician preferences in the management of warfarin-induced excessive anticoagulation (AC); and (2) to assess compliance with the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for the reversal of excessive AC.

Design

Cross-sectional physician survey.

Participants

Members of the Canadian Society of Internal Medicine practicing in Ontario, Canada.

Measurements and Results

Physicians were asked to provide management preferences in six clinical scenarios describing warfarin-induced excessive AC. The scenarios represent various combinations of international normalized ratio (INR) value, treatment setting, and presence and severity of bleeding. In scenarios with INRs < 5.2 without bleeding, conservative approaches complying with the ACCP guidelines, such as withholding warfarin or reducing its dose, were most common. In scenarios with high INRs (ie, > 7.1) and/or bleeding, the selection of vitamin K in any form ranged between 71% and 82%. However, compliance with the ACCP-recommended doses and the routes of vitamin K administration ranged from 1 to 10%. In five of the six scenarios, subcutaneous injection, a route not recommended by the ACCP, was the most common method of vitamin K delivery.

Conclusions

Physician preferences for the reversal of warfarin-induced excessive AC were highly variable and, in most cases, did not follow the recommendations of the ACCP consensus guidelines. Furthermore, the widespread reported use of subcutaneous vitamin K is concerning because this route of vitamin K administration has been demonstrated to be less effective than IV administration of vitamin K. These findings highlight the need for randomized controlled trials to compare the efficacy of different routes of administration of vitamin K for warfarin-associated coagulopathy.

### Reversal of oral anticoagulation in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^1137yqgL]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists

Over the decades, VKA have been the mainstay for anticoagulant treatment in patients with atrial fibrillation (A-fib). A dose-response relationship between bleeding complications and supra-therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) levels has been documented with a sharp incidence increase for INR levels above 4. Nevertheless, ICH occurs commonly at therapeutic INR levels exemplified by the largest available VKA-associated ICH cohort (n = 1176) reporting a median INR level of 2.8 with an interquartile range between 2.3 and 3.5. While DOACs are currently replacing VKA as the primary drug in A-fib-patients, VKA remains the primary anticoagulant for several patient populations with high thromboembolic risk. Current American and International Guidelines for the management of ICH patients do not provide specific recommendations on how to treat VKA-associated ICH in terms of a specific reversal strategy. Particularly, INR values representing full reversal, timing of reversal, and reversal agents to be used are not addressed. However, guidelines are currently being revised as several high-quality publications have substantially added knowledge to the field.

### Pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^113NHhBh]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). It describes the antithrombotic effect of the VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, and the clinical applications of VKA therapy and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 recommendations suggest that the individual patient's values may lead to different choices. (For a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S.) Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we recommend the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy, with doses between 5 mg and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 1B); we suggest against pharmacogenetic-based dosing until randomized data indicate that it is beneficial (Grade 2C); and in elderly and other patient subgroups who are debilitated or malnourished, we recommend a starting dose of ≤ 5 mg (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with nontherapeutic INRs, with INRs above the therapeutic range, and with bleeding whether the INR is therapeutic or elevated. For the use of vitamin K to reverse a mildly elevated INR, we recommend oral rather than subcutaneous administration (Grade 1A). For patients with life-threatening bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, we recommend the use of prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa to immediately reverse the INR (Grade 1C). For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we recommend a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. We recommend that physicians who manage oral anticoagulation therapy do so in a systematic and coordinated fashion, incorporating patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and good patient communication of results and dose adjustments [Grade 1B]. In patients who are suitably selected and trained, patient self-testing or patient self-management of dosing are effective alternative treatment models that result in improved quality of anticoagulation management, with greater time in the therapeutic range and fewer adverse events. Patient self-monitoring or self-management, however, is a choice made by patients and physicians that depends on many factors. We suggest that such therapeutic management be implemented where suitable (Grade 2B).

### Preclinical and clinical data for factor Xa and "Universal" reversal agents [^111PZHGb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

At the present time, there are no specific reversal agents available for the direct oral FXa inhibitors. Emerging data from early-phase studies of andexanet alfa and ciraparantag are encouraging, and phase 3 studies in patients who require reversal for significant bleeding or urgent invasive procedure/surgery are eagerly anticipated. Approximately 50 years elapsed before there were randomized controlled trial data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a rapid onset reversal agent for warfarin. Current developments are encouraging that patients taking oral anti-FXa anticoagulants will not have to wait as long.

### Massive warfarin overdose management in an adolescent patient [^111nHXMm]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Warfarin is a widely used oral anticoagulant with established reversal guidelines in the setting of a supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR). Limited literature exists on managing acute warfarin overdoses in patients who are not chronically anticoagulated.

Case

A 15-year-old male, with no indication for anticoagulation, presented to a pediatric emergency department after an acute 1,000mg warfarin ingestion. He had no significant complaints upon presentation aside from a mild intermittent headache. His past medical history was significant for anxiety, depression, Tourette syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and polysubstance misuse. Computed tomography of his head was unremarkable and serum acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol concentrations were negative. Approximately 16h post-ingestion, his INR was 1.9 with an increase to 3.3 by 26h. The regional poison center was consulted and recommended, consistent with the CHEST guidelines, holding treatment with vitamin K until INR was > 10 or if signs or symptoms of bleeding occurred. The patient was admitted for monitoring and by hospital day (HD) #4, his INR had risen to > 11.8 at which point oral vitamin K 10mg was administered. On HD #7, the patient was deemed stable for transfer to inpatient psychiatry after repeat INRs of 2.9 and 3.4.

Discussion

Case reports have demonstrated early administration of vitamin K can temporarily lower INR and prevent detection of rebound. The CHEST warfarin reversal guidelines describe the risks and benefits with respect to bleeding and thrombosis in the non-intentional overdose patient. Application and extrapolation of these guidelines to acute overdose in patients who lack an indication for anticoagulation may or may not be warranted.

Conclusion

While established clinical guidance exists on reversing a supratherapeutic INR in patients chronically anticoagulated with warfarin, the risks and benefits of extrapolating this approach are unclear in those who lack an indication for anticoagulation.

### Reversal of direct oral anticoagulants: guidance from the anticoagulation forum [^1144apad]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Two specific reversal agents for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been approved in the United States: idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal and andexanet alfa for apixaban and rivaroxaban reversal. Non-specific prohemostatic agents such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and activated PCC have also been used for DOAC reversal. The goal of this document is to provide comprehensive guidance from the Anticoagulation Forum, a North American organization of anticoagulation providers, regarding use of DOAC reversal agents. We discuss indications for reversal, provide guidance on how the individual reversal agents should be administered, and offer suggestions for stewardship at the health system level.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reversal by interruption — expected INR decline: Interruption of VKAs may be sufficient in patients who need an elective invasive procedure or in asymptomatic patients with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and a low risk for bleeding, and it takes approximately 2.5 days for an INR between 6.0 and 10.0 to decline to < 4.0; with acenocoumarol, the decline is probably no more than 1 day for most patients, phenprocoumon will probably result in a much slower decline, and fluindione is similar to warfarin so a similar decline should be expected.

### Surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part two: antiplatelet agents and perioperative management of long-term anticoagulation [^115HqUkf]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

For decades, aspirin and warfarin have been the predominant antiplatelet and anticoagulant alternatives. Beginning with the introduction of the antiplatelet agent clopidogrel in 2002, several more potent oral antiplatelet and oral anticoagulant agents have been approved for use. The increase in the number of therapeutic agents and the population at risk requires that surgeons have an understanding of the risks and benefits of reversing these agents in various settings and an understanding of the most appropriate methods for doing so. In part one of this practice management overview (in the prior issue of the journal), warfarin and the urgent reversal of warfarin-induced coagulopathy were reviewed and an overview of the newer direct oral anticoagulant agents was provided. Part two, contained herein, addresses the management of antiplatelet agents in the surgical setting, followed by general recommendations for the management of anticoagulated patients in the perioperative setting.

### Novel oral anticoagulants and reversal agents: considerations for clinical development [^1129SxDt]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

This white paper provides a summary of presentations and discussions that were held at an Anticoagulant-Induced Bleeding and Reversal Agents Think Tank co-sponsored by the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the FDA's White Oak Headquarters on April 22, 2014. Attention focused on a development pathway for reversal agents for the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs). This is important because anticoagulation is still widely underused for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. Undertreatment persists, although NOACs, in general, overcome some of the difficulties associated with anticoagulation provided by vitamin K antagonists. One reason for the lack of a wider uptake is the absence of NOAC reversal agents. As there are neither widely accepted academic and industry standards nor a definitive regulatory policy on the development of such reversal agents, this meeting provided a forum for leaders in the fields of cardiovascular clinical trials and cardiovascular safety to discuss the issues and develop recommendations. Attendees included representatives from pharmaceutical companies; regulatory agencies; end point adjudication specialist groups; contract research organizations; and active, academically based physicians. There was wide and solid consensus that NOACs overall offer improvements in convenience, efficacy, and safety compared with warfarin, even without reversal agents. Still, it was broadly accepted that it would be helpful to have reversal agents available for clinicians to use. Because it is not feasible to do definitive outcomes studies demonstrating a reversal agent's clinical benefits, it was felt that these agents could be approved for use in life-threatening bleeding situations if the molecules were well characterized preclinically, their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles were well understood, and showed no harmful adverse events in early human testing. There was also consensus that after such approval, efforts should be made to augment the available clinical information until such time as there is a body of evidence to demonstrate real-world clinical outcomes with the reversal agents. No recommendations were made for more generalized use of these agents in the setting of non-life-threatening situations. This article reflects the views of the authors and should not be construed to represent FDA's views or policies.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios-is there a general consensus? [^113sbBBq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

3.2.1.2. Life-threatening bleeding/surgery.

PCCs (primarily 4F-PCCs) are recommended or preferred for VKA reversal (Table 2), and several guidelines support usage of FFP for VKA reversal in life-threatening bleeding only if PCCs are unavailable. The majority of guidelines also recommend co-administration of vitamin K. The European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) guideline recommends that patients on oral anticoagulant therapy should be given PCCs and vitamin K before any other coagulation management steps for severe perioperative bleeding. This guideline specifies 4F-PCC administration at a dose of 20–40 IU/kg for VKA reversal. Due to their thrombogenic profile, aPCCs are not indicated for VKA reversal, even in emergency bleeding situations. Guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland also recommend against administration of rFVIIa in this setting (Table 2).

3.2.2. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants

Most guidelines advocate using specific reversal agents as treatment, where available, and particularly in life-threatening situations. Several guidelines recommend the use of PCCs for non-specific DOAC reversal when specific reversal agents are not available (Table 3).

### Modified version of the American college of cardiology's recommendation for low-dose prothrombin complex concentrate is effective for warfarin reversal [^116TWfcD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Dosing of four factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4PCC) for warfarin reversal remains controversial. Recently, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommended a low-dose PCC regimen as an option for warfarin reversal in acute major bleeding. We performed a retrospective study evaluating if a modified version of the ACC guideline recommendations was effective for warfarin reversal in acute major bleeds when compared to traditional variable dosing.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who received 4PCC for warfarin reversal in a 12 month period. We included patients that were ≥ 18 years of age, received 4PCC for warfarin reversal, and had an initial International Normalized Ratio (INR) of > 2. Our primary outcome was the number of patients who had a post-4PCC infusion INR of < 1.6.

Results

A total of 60 patients were included in the final analysis with 30 patients stratified to the traditional dosing and low-dose groups, respectively. Patient demographics were similar between both groups. We found no difference in the number of patients who had a post-4PCC infusion INR < 1.6 between the traditional dosing and low dosing group (90.0% vs. 86.7%; p = 0.68). Additionally, we found no difference between post-infusion median INRs in each group (1.35 vs. 1.30; p = 0.16). Approximately 1000 units per patient were spared when utilizing the low-dose regimen.

Conclusion

A modified version of the ACC's low-dose 4PCC option for warfarin reversal achieves similar outcomes for lowering INR values compared to traditional variable dosing regimens.

### A review of guidelines on anticoagulation reversal across different clinical scenarios-is there a general consensus? [^116aoit1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

3.2.1.1. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).

The European Stroke Organisation guideline recommends PCC at 30 IU/kg (along with vitamin K) for VKA reversal in ICH without distinguishing between 3- and 4-factor products. The Neurocritical Care Society and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (NCS/SCCM), recommend discontinuation of VKAs and administration of vitamin K at a dose of 10 mg intravenously (IV) in cases of ICH. Furthermore, these guidelines indicate the limited utility of FFP-based strategies in ICH due to the prolonged time to INR reversal, and acknowledge the low cost of FFP and its use in circumstances where PCCs are contraindicated (e.g. allergies or known adverse reaction to PCCs or their components). Treatment with FFP and vitamin K is recommended only if no other treatments are available. FFP should be administered at 10–20 mL/kg IV in combination with one dose of vitamin K 10 mg IV. The NCS/SCCM guidelines recommend 4F-PCC over 3F-PCC, with co-administration of vitamin K generally advised to ensure durable INR reversal. Initial reversal with PCCs alone rather than use in combination with FFP or recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is also recommended. The dose of PCC should be weight-based and vary according to admission INR and type of PCC used.

Due to low-quality evidence and its association with thrombosis, rFVIIa is currently not recommended for VKA reversal in patients presenting with ICH (Table 2). Furthermore, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines state that although rFVIIa administration rapidly reduces INR, it may not restore thrombin generation effectively as it does not replenish all of the vitamin-K dependent factors.

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^113uV4uG]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Reversal of anticoagulants — warfarin management — directs: For urgent reversal of warfarin, administer PCCs in consultation with the appropriate specialist, or administer FFP. Administer vitamin K for selected patients for nonurgent reversal of warfarin, except when rapid restoration of anticoagulation after surgery is required.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium tablets must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Atrial Fibrillation

In patients with non-valvular AF, anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0).

3. Conclusions

At the present time, there are no specific reversal agents available for the direct oral FXa inhibitors. Emerging data from early-phase studies of andexanet alfa and ciraparantag are encouraging, and phase 3 studies in patients who require reversal for significant bleeding or urgent invasive procedure/surgery are eagerly anticipated. Approximately 50 years elapsed before there were randomized controlled trial data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a rapid onset reversal agent for warfarin. Current developments are encouraging that patients taking oral anti-FXa anticoagulants will not have to wait as long.

### NOACs versus warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with AF: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116sZSrz]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

It is, however, unclear whether cessation of long-term therapy for surgical and invasive procedures may show a similar trend and highlights the need for timely cessation of NOACs prior to procedures and vigilant reporting of any thromboembolic or bleeding events.

While warfarin remains an effective drug, the NOACs do confer the additional advantages of fewer interactions with drugs and foods as well as no requirement for routine monitoring, indeed the notion of taking a drug manufactured solely for therapeutic use could also be preferable to taking 'a rat poison'.

Of course warfarin does still retain some advantages, it has been in use for routine clinical practice for many years and is well understood. Testing INR allows for specific tailoring of doses for the individual and perhaps crucially, the administration of vitamin K effectively reverses warfarin's anticoagulant effect. Conversely the action of NOACs cannot be quickly and effectively reversed, which with their increasing use in clinical practice may leave clinicians almost helpless to intervene when their patients experience incidental trauma.

### Reversal of antithrombotic agents [^115bNhtK]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

Anticoagulants are the mainstay of therapy for thromboembolic diseases. In addition to the more traditional agents, new oral anticoagulants, including dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have been shown to be effective across several indications. Bleeding is a serious complication associated with any anticoagulant, but many of the traditional parenteral and new oral agents do not currently have specific antidotes. This review describes available and future options for the reversal of the effects of anticoagulants, in particular the new oral agents and discusses current management strategies for bleeding events in clinical practice.

Reversal protocols: Despite the evidence in favor of PCC and intravenous vitamin K, evidence from clinical trials suggests national guidelines are not being followed in practice. Analysis of major bleeding events in patients receiving warfarin in five separate phase III trials comparing warfarin with dabigatran demonstrated only 1.2% of patients received PCC and only 27% received vitamin K. To maximize outcomes in high-risk patients, the surgeon must be familiar with the approach to rapid warfarin reversal and prepared to implement it quickly. Rapid correction of warfarin anticoagulation may be facilitated by predefined protocols. A treatment algorithm for warfarin reversal in the emergency setting is demonstrated in figure 1. Clinical consensus guidelines universally support the use of PCC over plasma for exogenous factor replacement due to the more rapid and consistent reversal with lower fluid volumes. Table 1 demonstrates the dosing protocol for vitamin K and PCC at the Elvis Presley Trauma Center, Memphis, Tennessee.

Bleeding risk and management context with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) on warfarin: "The risk of bleeding increases significantly when the INR exceeds 4.5". In patients with mechanical heart valves, adverse events increased from "two per 100 patient-years at INR 2.5 to 4.9, to 4.8 per 100 patient-years for INR 5 to 5.5, then to 7.5 per 100 patient-years for INR ≥ 6.5", and intracerebral bleeding doubled "for every 0.5-s increment in prothrombin time". When supratherapeutic INR occurs without bleeding, strategies include withholding VKA, adjusting VKA dose, or giving vitamin K, and a 2006 meta-analysis found vitamin K "was more likely to reverse overanticoagulation (INR > 4) at 24 h compared with simply withholding VKA".

### Current evidence of oral anticoagulant reversal: a systematic review [^1122L9Ly]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 4–6% of patients treated with oral anticoagulants (OAC) will suffer from major hemorrhage or be in need of urgent surgery necessitating anticoagulant reversal therapy. Several new oral anticoagulants and reversal agents have been introduced that make it difficult for physicians to stay updated on the current evidence of reversal management. This study aims to review the recent literature on oral anticoagulation reversal therapy and to present the current evidence in an easily approachable manner.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed and EMBASE to identify the latest publications on both vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) reversal strategies. All studies on humans who received any acute reversal management of VKA treatment were included, except case studies. Since only two studies on acute reversal of DOAC treatment have been published, clinical trials on healthy volunteers were also included.

Results

Twenty-one studies with a total of 4783 VKA treated patients, and 12 studies with a total of 529 DOAC treated patients were included. Elevated INR values due to VKA treatment could be reversed (INR ≤ 1.5) in 63.1% (95% CI: 61.0–65.2) of study subjects after treatment with 4F-PCC, as compared with 12.2% (95% CI: 8.2–16.2) after treatment with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), (p < 0.001). Thromboembolism occurred in 1.6% (95% CI: 1.2–2.1) of VKA-patients treated with 4F-PCC, and in 4.5% (95% CI: 2.3–6.7) of FFP-treated patients. To date, reversal of laboratory parameters has been demonstrated for two reversal agents specific to DOACs: idarucizumab for dabigatran reversal and andexanet-alfa for factor Xa-inhibitor reversal.

Conclusions

This review supports the use of PCC for VKA reversal, specifically for 4F-PCC over FFP for laboratory reversal. There are no studies on clinical efficacy of non-specific agents for DOAC reversal and the evidence for laboratory reversal is not consistent.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^116eWgBY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (warfarin) reversal — Several options exist for reversal of VKAs, including administration of vitamin K, PCCs, and plasma; vitamin K can be given orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously, and slow intravenous administration (in 25 to 50 mL normal saline over 15 to 30 minutes) effects a more predictable and rapid reduction in the INR (4 to 6 hours) compared with oral (18 to 24 hours), although the administration of vitamin K does not result in immediate correction of coagulopathy and for a major bleed warranting reversal must be accompanied by a repletion strategy (if 4F-PCC is unavailable, PCCs or plasma may be used). PCCs contain purified vitamin K-dependent clotting factors; nonactivated 3-factor PCCs contain FII, FIX, and FX with negligible FVII, protein C, and S, whereas nonactivated 4F-PCCs contain FII, FVII, FIX, FX, and proteins C and S, and only 4F-PCCs are licensed for rapid VKA reversal. For VKA reversal, 4F-PCCs are dosed on the basis of INR and body weight (INR 2 to < 4 at 25 U/kg, INR 4 to 6 at 35 U/kg, and INR > 6 at 50 U/kg; max dose 5,000 units capped at 100 kg body weight), and per unit volume 4F-PCCs contain approximately 25 times (25 U/mL) the concentration of vitamin K-dependent factors as compared with plasma (1 U/mL); therefore, PCC can be given in a much smaller volume at a much faster infusion rate (8×) compared with plasma and is preferred.

### Management of anticoagulant-related intracranial hemorrhage: an evidence-based review [^112v8KVh]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Reversal of anticoagulation

Most authorities consider rapid and adequate reversal of anticoagulation as the cornerstone of therapy in AICH, despite the lack of evidence showing that correction of coagulopathy reduces the incidence of hematoma growth or improves outcome. In certain situations, however – such as the presence of a mechanical valve, INR < 3, small hemorrhage, or no surgical intervention needed – some authorities advocate holding warfarin without actively reversing coagulopathy. Antidotes specific to each anticoagulant are presented in Table 1. Although warfarin remains the most commonly used oral anticoagulant, newer agents are gaining popularity. The exact mechanism of the occurrence of WRICH remains speculative, but potentially involves a local vasculopathy and/or systemic factors (for example, higher prevalence of the apolipoprotein E ϵ2 allele in patients with WRICH). Preventative measures to mitigate WRICH could therefore be relatively inefficient, and the onus is on rapid coagulopathy reversal. The same probably holds true for AICH related to newer anticoagulants. Hence, the first step in any AICH is to discontinue the offending drug, administer an antidote (if available) and monitor adequate reversal of anticoagulation. In the case of warfarin, theoretically adequate hemostasis is restored at an INR of ~1.5 since adequate quantities of the factors needed for ex vivo coagulation are restored. However, an optimal INR value is unknown. Unfortunately, parameters for adequate reversal with newer anticoagulants are yet to be defined. Despite concern among physicians for reversing anticoagulation in a prothrombotic state, available evidence with WRICH, albeit meager, supports correcting the coagulopathy in such cases.

Vitamin K

Vitamin K 5 to 10 mg intravenously by slow infusion over 30 minutes is administered to all patients with WRICH. Anaphylactic reactions are uncommon, and are mitigated by a slow infusion rate. The subcutaneous route for the administration of vitamin K is less effective because of erratic absorption, and the enteral route provides slow absorption although it has an equivalent bioavailability to the intravenous route. The action of vitamin K is slow; it takes 6 to 24 hours to replenish adequate concentrations of factors II, VII, IX and X and to restore hemostasis. This warrants the administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and/or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) to rapidly replenish deficient factors. One should note that these agents have a short half-life, and are practically used as bridging therapy until vitamin K becomes effective.

### Warfarin overdose in an adolescent not dependent on anticoagulation: reversal strategy and kinetics [^116WihxC]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Warfarin induces coagulopathy. Guidelines protocolize reversal of supratherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) in patients dependent on anticoagulation, but practices vary for reversing warfarin-induced coagulopathy after overdose in non-warfarin-dependent patients.

Case Report

This is the report of a 15-year-old female who ingested her father's warfarin (100–200 mg) in a self-harm attempt. At hour 24 post-ingestion, her INR was 2.00 and she was admitted for monitoring. Reversal of coagulopathy was initially deferred pending the INR trend. The INR was 5.10 at hour 60 and 2.5 mg oral vitamin K 1 (VK1) was given. At hour 85, the INR peaked at 6.67 and she received a second oral dose of 2.5 mg VK1. On day 8, she was medically cleared with an INR of 1.31. On day 11, she developed lower abdominal pain and diarrhea. Imaging revealed a duodenal hematoma, and symptoms improved spontaneously. She was again medically cleared 13 days post-ingestion. Her serum warfarin concentration peaked at 19 mcg/mL at hour 46. Serial warfarin concentrations were obtained, demonstrating first-order elimination kinetics and a 30-hour half-life.

Conclusion

A restrictive approach to coagulopathy reversal in non-warfarin-dependent patients with intentional warfarin overdose may result in worsening coagulopathy, bleeding, and lengthy hospital stay. Given the risk for significant, prolonged coagulopathy, these patients should be treated early with VK1, with subsequent serial INR monitoring and probable additional VK1 dosing. Delayed peak warfarin concentrations support consideration of gastrointestinal decontamination in late presenters.

### Safety of a four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate versus plasma for vitamin K antagonist reversal: an integrated analysis of two phase IIIb clinical trials [^116URsgW]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In the United States, clinicians prescribe the vitamin K antagonist (VKA) warfarin to 3.4 million patients each year for the treatment and prophylaxis of various prothrombotic conditions. 1 Although effective for this indication, its use is often associated with adverse drug‐related events; data collected between 2007 and 2009 implicate warfarin as the medication associated with the largest number of adverse drug events requiring emergency treatment in patients over 65 years of age. 2 These events most commonly manifest as acute bleeding 3 and result in an estimated 33,000 hospitalizations per year. 2

Patients receiving VKAs often require rapid anticoagulation reversal when they present with major bleeding or require urgent surgical or invasive procedures. Treatment options include vitamin K (oral or intravenous [IV]) concomitant with plasma or prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs). 4 PCCs are lyophilized concentrates of vitamin K‐dependent coagulation factors (F) either activated or nonactivated. 5 Many treatment guidelines recommend the use of nonactivated PCCs rather than plasma for rapid VKA reversal in case of major bleeding or prior to urgent surgery or other invasive procedure. 6, 7, 8, 9 Currently, plasma is the most commonly used agent for VKA reversal in many countries, particularly in those where PCCs are not licensed for use.

Recently, two phase IIIb clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a nonactivated four‐factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F‐PCC) versus plasma for urgent VKA reversal. 10, 11 The patients enrolled in the two studies had similar baseline characteristics, comorbidities, and reasons for receiving VKA therapy and thus may be considered to have been at similar risk of AEs when anticoagulation was reversed. The similarity of the two studies in terms of patient populations, treatment regimens and safety outcomes affords the opportunity to pool safety data. Compared with the single studies, this provides a larger data set with which to assess the safety profile of the two interventions and allows a wider evaluation of the full safety data set, including rare events such as thromboembolic events, fluid overload events, viral transmission, and deaths. Here, we present the first full analysis of the integrated safety data from the two randomized, controlled trials comparing 4F‐PCC and plasma for urgent VKA reversal. Patient‐level data on thromboembolic events and an in‐depth analysis of fluid overload events have been published previously; 14, 15 the present analyses aim to assess the overall safety profile of this 4F‐PCC versus plasma, including deaths, viral transmission, and all other adverse events (AEs), when used in this setting.

### Management of patients with acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding: an updated ACG guideline [^111aRLHb]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Anticoagulation reversal for hemodynamic instability and severe bleeding — options and evidence for vitamin K antagonist reversal include that reversal of anticoagulation may be warranted and options for reversal include vitamin K, FFP, and 4-factor PCC; European guidelines recommend administering vitamin K along with PCC (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence) or FFP if PCC is unavailable (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), while joint ACG–Canadian Association of Gastroenterology guidance suggests against the routine use of vitamin K and suggests PCC administration as compared with FFP for those who require reversal (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Among patients with GIB on warfarin or dabigatran in 3 phase III trials, 26% were managed with discontinuation only, and in another study of patients with GIB on warfarin in the ARISTOTLE trial, 76% had drug interruption during admission. In a multicenter observational cohort of warfarin-associated bleeding (52% GIB), 31% received FFP vs 23% PCC. In an RCT of urgent VKA reversal (n = 202; 63% with GIB/defined nonvisible bleeding), treatment with PCC was shown to be noninferior to FFP in achieving effective hemostasis, with overall 42% (n = 71/98) achieving effective hemostasis with PCC vs 65.9% (n = 68/104) with FFP; another RCT found PCC superior to FFP in effective hemostasis (90% vs 75%) and rapidity of INR reduction (55% in PCC group vs 10% in FFP group) with a similar safety profile. A post hoc analysis limited to 42 patients with acute severe GIB found PCC associated with reduced time to the first endoscopic procedure with no difference in hemostatic efficacy, and another study of 40 patients on warfarin reported PCC normalized INR more rapidly than FFP and was associated with less active bleeding on endoscopy. Meta-analyses reported PCC was associated with a low risk of thromboembolic complications compared with FFP and, for VKA reversal as compared with FFP, was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, more rapid INR reduction, and less volume overload.

### Principles of reversal of anticoagulation in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage related to oral anticoagulants [^116D6vJR]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

The incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) associated with oral anticoagulants (OAC) is about one in five cases of ICH and associated with severe clinical presentation, frequently rapid clinical deterioration, and 30-days mortality of app 50%. This narrative review gives an overview of presentation and acute treatment of OAC-ICH. Oral anticoagulants do not cause ICH but lead to prolongation of bleeding and higher risk of hematoma expansion (HE). Clinicoradiological characteristics of oral anticoagulant associated ICH are not different from ICH in general. The therapeutic principle of reversal is to prevent or limit HE. The mode of action of the reversal agents for vitamin K antagonists, direct oral thrombin inhibitor and direct oral factor Xa inhibitors are described in the main text. We also discuss the principles of blood pressure lowering in the setting of acute OAC-ICH as it may be the second driving force of HE. Stroke unit care is needed to prevent further complications. Data from randomized controlled trials and observational data from unselected patients are needed to make stronger and more precise recommendations on acute therapy.

### Management of bleeding in patients treated with direct oral anticoagulants [^117RLVb4]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Anticoagulants are frequently prescribed agents for the prevention and treatment of a myriad of cardiovascular conditions. Conventional anticoagulant agents, such as vitamin K antagonists (VKAs; warfarin, phenprocoumon, or coumadin) and heparin or low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, are increasingly replaced by direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) directly inhibiting factor Xa (e.g. rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) or factor IIa (e.g. dabigatran). This new generation of anticoagulants is termed novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) or DOACs. A large number of clinical studies have shown that these agents can prevent or treat acute or chronic thromboembolic diseases.

The most important complication of treatment with anticoagulant agents is hemorrhage, which may be serious, may cause long-term debilitating disease, or may even be life-threatening. Bleeding in a patient on anticoagulants may require specific (additional) management; if the bleeding situation is sufficiently severe, swift reversal of the anticoagulant effect of the anticoagulant agent may even be required. Depending on the clinical situation, including the site and/or the severity of the bleeding, this reversal may take place in a few hours, but in some cases immediate reversal is needed. Generally, each (immediate) reversal of anticoagulant treatment needs also to take into consideration the indication for the antithrombotic agents. For example, the immediate interruption of anticoagulants in a patient with recent venous thromboembolism will markedly increase the short-term risk of recurrent venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Likewise, in a patient with advanced heart disease and atrial fibrillation, interruption of anticoagulants may increase the risk of cerebral or systemic embolism. Each of these specific clinical settings requires a careful and balanced individual assessment of the benefits and dangers of reversing anticoagulants (and potential strategies to keep the period of reversal as brief as possible). Here we will briefly describe the epidemiology of bleeding complications due to anticoagulants and various strategies to reverse the anticoagulant effect of antithrombotic agents, focusing on the new generation of anticoagulants (DOACs).

### Anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease: from guidelines to clinical practice [^115zVpCK]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health problem, being closely connected to cardiovascular disease. CKD involves an elevated thromboembolic risk and requires anticoagulation, but the high rates of hemorrhage render it quite challenging.

Hypothesis

There are no consensus recommendations regarding anticoagulation in CKD. Due to the currently limited data, clinicians need practical clues for monitoring and optimizing the treatment.

Methods

Based on the available data, this review outlines the benefit‐risk ratio of all types of anticoagulants in each stage of CKD and provides practical recommendations for accurate dosage adjustment, reversal of antithrombotic effect, and monitoring of renal function on a regular basis.

Results

Evidence from randomized controlled trials supports the efficient and safe use of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in mild and moderate CKD. On the contrary, the data are poor and controversial for advanced stages. DOACs are preferred in CKD stages 1 to 3. In patients with stage 4 CKD, the choice of warfarin vs DOACs will take into consideration the pharmacokinetics of the drugs and patient characteristics. Warfarin remains the first‐line treatment in end‐stage renal disease, although in this case the decision to use or not to use anticoagulation is strictly individualized. Anticoagulation with heparins is safe in nondialysis‐dependent CKD, but remains a challenge in the hemodialysis patients.

Conclusions

Although there is a need for cardiorenal consensus regarding anticoagulation in CKD, adequate selection of the anticoagulant type and careful monitoring are some extremely useful indications for overcoming management challenges.

Warfarin reversal and bridging after restart — high-risk warfarin patients receiving high doses of vitamin K for reversal (> 2.5 mg) appear to have similar time and magnitude of INR reduction, but the vitamin K will likely delay warfarin's therapeutic effect for several weeks after restart; in such cases, anticoagulation using LMWH or unfractionated heparin is needed until the effects of the vitamin K have worn off.

### Urgent reversal of warfarin with prothrombin complex concentrate [^115agfrz]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

Background

When life-threatening bleeding occurs in patients on warfarin, timely reversal becomes imperative. In the United States, warfarin effect is commonly reversed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The use of FFP is complicated by delays in correction, volume overload and often, inadequate correction.

Objective

Evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a protocol for rapid administration of prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in the setting of the urgent need for reversal of warfarin.

Methods/Patients

We instituted a policy for rapid delivery and administration of PCC. Appropriate patients received 25–50 U kg(-1) of PCC. The prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratios (INR) was recorded before and immediately after dosing, and 24 h postdosing. Patients requiring surgical interventions were cleared for the operating room (OR) immediately. Fifty-eight patients were treated, with a median age of 75.5 years (range 26–92).

Results

The median INR on presentation was 3.8 (1.4–52.8). Immediately following PCC administration the median INR was 1.3 (0.9–5.7), only two patients with INRs exceeding 2.0. The benefit was maintained at 24 h with a median INR of 1.5 (1.1–3.4). Four patients experienced thrombotic events during their hospitalization, (two deep vein thrombosis, two non-q-wave myocardial infarction) although none was attributed to PPC therapy.

Conclusions

PCC administration is an effective treatment modality for the correction of warfarin anticoagulation in the urgent setting. Advantages over FFP include more timely correction, absence of volume overload and potentially more complete correction. Broader use of PCC in this setting appears to be appropriate.

### Reversal agents for the direct oral anticoagulants [^111AssW3]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are associated with a significant rate of major and fatal bleeding complications. The new direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), even though having a better bleeding profile than the VKAs, are still associated with serious bleeding. The anticoagulation induced by the VKAs can be reversed with both vitamin K and prothrombin complex concentrates, whereas the DOACs were developed without specific reversal agents. Although there is controversy around the necessity of a reversal agent, most clinicians agree that having a reversal agent for the DOACs would be beneficial. Three reversal agents are currently in development.

### Intracerebral hemorrhage outcomes after reversal of subtherapeutic warfarin: analysis of data from GWTG-stroke [^113gxuBN]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend reversal of warfarin anticoagulation in intracranial hemorrhages. The benefit of reversing subtherapeutic warfarin anticoagulation in acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage is uncertain.

Methods

An observational cohort from the entire Get With The Guidelines Stroke registry between January 2015 and January 2022 was used to determine the association of reversal with outcomes for subtherapeutic anticoagulation (international normalized ratio, 1.5–1.9). Inclusion required current warfarin use. Exclusions included thrombolytics, direct oral anticoagulants, transferring out, or leaving against medical advice. The prespecified primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 to 3 at discharge. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between reversal and the mRS score of 0 to 3. Propensity scores with overlap weighting were used to control treatment selection bias. Information on the dose and timing of reversal agents was unknown.

Results

Initial cohort 239681 patients, 18419 on warfarin. Excluded were 15712 with an international normalized ratio ≤ 1.5, ≥ 1.9, or missing, and 701 missing mRS. Final cohort 1868 (mean age 73, 42% female). Reversal occurred in 894 (47.9%). Primary outcome occurred in 188/894 (21.0%) versus 225/974 (23.1%) with reversal versus without (adjusted odds ratio, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.63–1.005]). Ordinal analysis showed higher odds of mRS score of 0 to 4 versus 5 to 6 (52.7% versus 42.5% [adjusted odds ratio, 1.21 [1.001–1.48]). Outcomes not requiring mRS were analyzed among 2569 patients. Mortality or discharge to hospice was lower 30.6% versus 41.5% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.63–0.89]). Hospital length of stay was longer (median, 6 versus 4 days; adjusted risk ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.13–1.37]). There was no difference in venous thromboembolism (2.9% versus 2.3%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.47 [0.88–2.46]).

Conclusions

Reversal of subtherapeutic warfarin with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and international normalized ratio 1.5 to 1.9 was not associated with improvement in functional outcome based on discharge mRS score of 0 to 3 versus 4 to 6. Patients receiving reversal agents had 25% lower odds of dying in hospital or being discharged to hospice, but had a longer hospital stay. This exploratory data has limitations inherent to not being a randomized controlled trial.

Reversal of vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants

Recommendation 33

In the bleeding trauma patient, we recommend the emergency reversal of vitamin K-dependent oral anticoagulants with the early use of both PCC and 5 mg i.v. phytomenadione (vitamin K 1). (Grade 1A)

Rationale

Coumarin (more accurately, 4-hydroxycoumarin) derivatives are VKAs and are still widely used, despite the growing use of DOACs. Warfarin is the most commonly used VKA in the world, and the coumarins have a similar effect but a shorter (acenocoumarol) or longer (phenprocoumon) half-life. The most common use for VKAs is the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Other indications include prevention of thrombosis in those with previous venous or arterial thromboembolism or with mechanical heart valves. There are three therapeutic options for the reversal of VKAs such as warfarin: vitamin K, PCC and FFP.

The biochemical reversal of VKA can be achieved rapidly with the administration of PCC. All modern guidelines on warfarin use advise the rapid restoration of a normal INR, although evidence that this reduces intracranial haematoma growth in those with ICH or improves clinical outcome is limited to case series., one suggesting more improvement if PCC was administered rapidly.

For immediate reversal of VKAs, the missing coagulation factors, FII, FIX and FX, can be replaced with PCC. However, in the past, there has been significant variability in the FVII content of different formulations and three-factor PCC has very little FVII. Modern PCC formulations contain significant amounts of FVII and can completely reverse the effect of VKAs upon infusion. Unfortunately, some countries only have access to three-factor PCC, which achieves poor correction of the INR, and is therefore not recommended if four-factor PCC is available. Because the half-life of administered FVII is only about 6 h, it is important that phytomenadione (vitamin K 1) is administered with PCC to stimulate physiological generation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors after this time.

### Comparison of anticoagulation reversal strategies for warfarin associated acute gastrointestinal bleeding [^112A2XgL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common complication associated with warfarin use. However, the optimal approach for anticoagulation reversal-whether with prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma (FFP), vitamin K (intravenous or oral), or no reversal-remains unclear as current literature and society guidelines do not provide definitive recommendations.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of emergency department patients with warfarin-associated GIB who presented to an academic health system was performed, comparing reversal with PCC, FFP, vitamin K only, or no reversal agent. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included rebleeding events and 30-day thrombotic events. Standardized guidelines for reporting were followed (STROBE).

Results

Of 815 patients, within 12 h of presentation, 10.7% received reversal with PCC (with or without vitamin K), 12.9% with FFP (with or without vitamin K), and 34.9% with vitamin K alone; 41.5% of patients received no reversal agent. Compared to all other groups, patients receiving PCC had significantly higher 30-day mortality (18.4% [PCC] vs 5.7% [FFP] vs 4.6% [vitamin K] vs 5.6% [no reversal], p < 0.001), which remained significant after adjusting for hemodynamic instability and ICU admission. There were no significant differences in rates of thrombotic event within 30 days (3.4% vs 3.8% vs 1.4% vs 1.2%, p = 0.20).

Conclusions

Patients who received PCC had a threefold increase in mortality compared to FFP, vitamin K alone, or no reversal, even after adjusting for severity of the bleeding. Further research is necessary to understand factors leading to this observed mortality difference among patients with warfarin related GIB.

### Interruption and reversal of direct oral anticoagulants in preprocedural and acute settings [^115oT3E4]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

With increasing physician and patient awareness, the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has been steadily increasing in recent years. Unfortunately, given their recent introduction, the reversal of anticoagulation attained with DOACs is not well studied. Given the diverse mechanisms of action of these newer agents, no universal antidote is available for reversal. Laboratory assays that can accurately quantify the anticoagulation status of patients on DOAC therapy are not readily available, which presents a challenge in situations demanding rapid reversal. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of reversal agents have not been extensively investigated in the clinical setting. This review briefly summarizes commercially available DOACs, delineates current knowledge related to reversal of DOAC agents in specific clinical settings, and identifies areas of future study.

Warfarin reversal with plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC), and recombinant activated factor VII is characterized as follows: Fresh frozen plasma is "the most widely used coagulation factor replacement product for urgent reversal of warfarin anticoagulation", but "requires a cross-match" and "takes a prolonged period of time to thaw and administer", and "phytonadione must also be given to restore the adequate endogenous production of VKA-sensitive anticoagulant proteins"; adverse effects include that anaphylaxis occurs "in about one in 20,000 transfusion episodes" and transfusion-related acute lung injury "is estimated to occur in about one in 5,000 plasma-containing transfusions". Nonactivated PCCs "are probably more effective than plasma in correcting INR", "do not require a cross-match", are "virally inactivated", "do not pose a risk of volume overload", and "can be infused in 15 to 30 min", with products "classified as three-factor products… and four-factor products", while "four-factor PCCs are currently not available in some countries (eg, United States)". Recombinant activated factor VII "has been used to control bleeding", but "evidence supporting its use in VKA-associated bleeding is currently limited, and its use cannot be recommended except in the setting of life-threatening bleeding when more effective agents are not available", and it "may cause thrombosis".

### Warfarin reversal in anticoagulant-associated intracerebral hemorrhage [^112isUZo]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Anticoagulant-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease, causing death in half of patients and permanent disability in the majority of survivors. The finding that patients often continue bleeding after hospital presentation offers the possibility that emergency warfarin reversal may improve outcomes. As no clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of any one treatment strategy, various treatment options are available. Intravenous vitamin K is the definitive therapy; however, as monotherapy it can require many hours to take effect. Therefore, it is often considered an adjunct agent. Coagulation factors can be repleted with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which is widely available and relatively low cost, but can require substantial time to deliver in real-world settings. A number of coagulation factor products collectively termed prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) are widely available that can rapidly provide many or all the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. Recombinant activated factor VII is used in many centers for this purpose, as it is thought to provide a procoagulant effect that may compensate for the lack of the other critical factors. Until clinical trials demonstrate the superiority of any one means of warfarin reversal, a number of expert guidelines from national organizations are available to help local providers guide therapy. At our institution, we have focused on improving the rapid and reliable delivery of a combination of intravenous vitamin K and FFP, with continued re-dosing until the desired INR lowering is achieved.

### Clinical prediction model for time in therapeutic range while on warfarin in newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation [^117Xpefg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing public health and clinical problem, as an aging population, prolonged survival of patients with cardiac conditions predisposing to AF, enhanced detection of more sporadic forms of AF, and other factors have collectively served to expand the number of AF diagnoses. 1 AF portends a 5‐fold increased risk of thromboembolic events; thus, any new AF diagnosis requires assessment of thromboembolic risk and in many cases, proper oral anticoagulation (OAC) to mitigate excess risk. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Though warfarin and other vitamin K antagonists (VKA) have been the primary OACs for several decades, the recent introduction of 4 non–vitamin K antagonists, direct OACs (DOACs), has expanded the therapeutic options for thromboprophylaxis in AF. Meta‐analyses have reported small improvements in efficacy and safety with DOACs compared with warfarin; however, these modest improvements must be considered with the higher cost of DOACs, which have created uncertainty about their overall cost‐effectiveness. 7, 8, 9, 10 Other concerns limiting more widespread use of DOACs include an inability to monitor their anticoagulation effects, short half‐lives that increase thrombosis risk when doses are missed, and lack of experience with reversal agents that may be needed in urgent settings. 11 Alternatively, warfarin is an inexpensive, long‐used, well‐researched, and effective therapeutic, associated with a 64% reduction in ischemic stroke in nonvalvular AF compared with placebo. 12, 13 However, warfarin possesses multiple untoward attributes complicating its use, including a narrow therapeutic range, numerous drug and dietary interactions, and a metabolism strongly dependent on multiple genetic polymorphisms that make warfarin's ultimate pharmacologic effects difficult to predict. 9, 12, 13, 14

### Anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease: from guidelines to clinical practice [^112tQyeu]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health problem, being closely connected to cardiovascular disease. CKD involves an elevated thromboembolic risk and requires anticoagulation, but the high rates of hemorrhage render it quite challenging.

Hypothesis

There are no consensus recommendations regarding anticoagulation in CKD. Due to the currently limited data, clinicians need practical clues for monitoring and optimizing the treatment.

Methods

Based on the available data, this review outlines the benefit-risk ratio of all types of anticoagulants in each stage of CKD and provides practical recommendations for accurate dosage adjustment, reversal of antithrombotic effect, and monitoring of renal function on a regular basis.

Results

Evidence from randomized controlled trials supports the efficient and safe use of warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in mild and moderate CKD. On the contrary, the data are poor and controversial for advanced stages. DOACs are preferred in CKD stages 1 to 3. In patients with stage 4 CKD, the choice of warfarin vs DOACs will take into consideration the pharmacokinetics of the drugs and patient characteristics. Warfarin remains the first-line treatment in end-stage renal disease, although in this case the decision to use or not to use anticoagulation is strictly individualized. Anticoagulation with heparins is safe in nondialysis-dependent CKD, but remains a challenge in the hemodialysis patients.

Conclusions

Although there is a need for cardiorenal consensus regarding anticoagulation in CKD, adequate selection of the anticoagulant type and careful monitoring are some extremely useful indications for overcoming management challenges.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^114Y8EyQ]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Perioperative warfarin (VKA) restart dose — PICO 3: In patients requiring VKA (warfarin) interruption for an elective surgery/procedure, we suggest resuming the first post-operative VKA dose at the patient's usual dose over resuming VKA with double the usual dose (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low Certainty of Evidence). One randomized trial of 98 patients compared post-operative resumption of warfarin at patients' usual dose vs doubling the warfarin dose for the first 2 post-operative days, finding by the fifth post-operative day an INR ≥ 2.0 in 13% of the usual-dose group and 50% of the doubling dose group (RR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.60) and by the tenth post-operative day 68% and 87% (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.00). A 40-patient randomized trial reported median days to reach an INR ≥ 2.0 of 7.8 vs 9.0 days (95% CI: −3.1 to 4.9), and observational studies reported mean durations to attain an INR ≥ 2.0 of 4.6 and 5.1 days, respectively. Implementation notes caution that although doubling for 1 to 2 days may lead to a more rapid attainment of an INR ≥ 2.0 in some patients, there are concerns in applying this approach in practice, including in patients expected to be hospitalized for > 1 day.

### A surgeon's guide to anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications part one: warfarin and new direct oral anticoagulant medications [^116jxZQX]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

Until recently, four-factor PCC has not been available in the United States; therefore, three-factor PCC had been used 'off-label' to reverse warfarin. Although a perceived disadvantage of three-factor PCC is the lack of factor VII, proposed advantages compared with four-factor PCC include a lower cost and potentially lower risk of thromboembolic complications. The two formulations of PCC have not, however, been compared to date in a clinical trial. The observational experience with these agents, either alone or in retrospective comparison, is mixed, with some studies suggesting greater efficacy associated with four-factor PCC and others suggesting no difference in efficacy between the two formulations. However, there is a recurring observation among many of these studies that three-factor PCC, which does not provide factor VII replenishment, is less effective at normalizing INR > 4. This may be explained by the fact that only 10–20% level of factor VII activity is required for coagulation, and an INR > 4 reflects factor VII activity under 5–10%. Therefore, three-factor PCC may be sufficient for factor replacement when there is sufficient native factor VII activity (> 10% or INR < 4). Should a patient's baseline INR be > 4, it would be reasonable to administer plasma in addition to three-factor PCC to provide exogenous replacement of factor VII.

Vitamin K: Vitamin K is an important adjunct to warfarin reversal. While factor replacement with either FFP or PCC provides immediate exogenous factor replacement, vitamin K supplementation results in native factor synthesis which will sustain the normalization of coagulation. As the half-lives of factors VII and IX are relatively short compared with the half-life of warfarin, the administration of vitamin K prevents recurrence of coagulopathy following the initial factor replacement and diminishes the need for ongoing exogenous factor replacement. When rapid reversal of warfarin is indicated, intravenous vitamin K is recommended over oral or subcutaneous injection, as it has the fastest onset and results in a lower INR 4–6 hours after infusion. There is a risk of an anaphylactoid reaction with intravenous administration that is related predominately to the rate of administration. A total of 5–10 mg of vitamin K should be diluted in 50 mL of intravenous fluid and given over 20 min. Patients should be monitored during administration.

### A French multicenter randomised trial comparing two dose-regimens of prothrombin complex concentrates in urgent anticoagulation reversal [^115XkqMv]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Strong evidence supports the use of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) in primary and secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism and in patients with prothrombotic factors such as atrial fibrillation and prosthetic heart valves. An estimated 1 to 1.5% of the western population has undergone OAT, including mainly vitamin K antagonists (VKA), following the publication of guidelines in favour of anticoagulation.

However, VKAs carry a significant risk of life-threatening haemorrhage including intracerebral and subdural haemorrhage. Thirty-day acute mortality for VKA-associated intracranial haemorrhage is high, ranging from 40 to 60%. Most survivors are neurologically impaired and suffer from severe disability. Haematoma volume and lower level of consciousness are major determinants of a poor prognosis in these patients and up to 50% of patients develop secondary volume enlargement.

Timely medical management of VKA-associated intracranial haemorrhage, including immediate discontinuation and rapid reversal of the anticoagulant therapy, is crucial to improve patient prognosis by reducing haematoma growth. OAT reversal is achieved by replacing depleted coagulation factors by using fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) and by administering vitamin K. The goal of these measures is to decrease the international normalised ratio (INR) values to ≤ 1.4 and preferably ≤ 1.2.

Four of the current guidelines recommend PCC rather than FFP as the first-choice treatment to increase levels of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors. A review of the published literature found that PCCs, compared to FFP, were more effective in shortening the time to INR correction and were associated with a low risk of thrombotic adverse events.

### Direct-acting oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in relation to risk of gastrointestinal bleeding: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Cu5Ue]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of vitamin K antagonists (mainly warfarin) is characterized by frequent visits to the clinic for monitoring the international normalized ratio (INR) to assess therapeutic efficacy, in addition to concurrent heparin use for bridging, and the disadvantage of drug-drug and drug-food interactions requiring dose adjustments. Given these drawbacks, the use of warfarin is cumbersome and can lead to low adherence. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have the distinct advantage of fixed dosing and do not require continuous laboratory monitoring. These features, combined with the availability of FDA-approved reversal agents, have made them desirable anticoagulants.

Several studies have shown equivalent therapeutic efficacy of DOACs compared with warfarin in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, there are few specific guidelines available to guide physicians about the individualized use of a particular DOAC for patients. Most choices rely on healthcare providers' preference, the patient's risk status, and the cost of the drugs, through a shared decision-making process.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the overall safety profile of DOACs, emphasizing overall risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and, more specifically, risk of fatal GIB. In addition, we compared individual DOACs to warfarin regarding the risk of GIB and safety in light of the variability of INR controls, i.e. the time in therapeutic range (TTR).

Gastrointestinal bleeding — warfarin reversal and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) use — The ACCP recommends that warfarin (Coumadin) be held and rapid reversal of anticoagulation with 4-factor PCC be used for vitamin K antagonist–associated major bleeding rather than fresh frozen plasma; they also suggest the additional use of vitamin K (5–10 mg by slow IV) rather than reversal with coagulation factors alone; PCC contains the vitamin K–dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X, with nonactivated and partially activated formulations, and some nonactivated PCCs are referred to as 3-factor PCCs; in 2012 the FDA approved a 4-factor PCC (Kcentra) for vitamin K antagonist reversal in patients with acute major bleeding or need for an urgent surgery/invasive procedure; for warfarin reversal, the 4-factor PCC is the appropriate reversal agent, and a combination of 3-factor PCC and low dose recombinant factor VIIa can be used when the 4-factor agent is unavailable.

### Assessment of the efficacy of a novel tailored vitamin K dosing regimen in lowering the international normalised ratio in over-anticoagulated patients: a randomised clinical trial [^115YLxsj]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Current guidelines advocate using fixed-doses of oral vitamin K to reverse excessive anticoagulation in warfarinised patients who are either asymptomatic or have minor bleeds. Over-anticoagulated patients present with a wide range of International Normalised Ratio (INR) values and response to fixed doses of vitamin K varies. Consequently a significant proportion of patients remain outside their target INR after vitamin K administration, making them prone to either haemorrhage or thromboembolism. We compared the performance of a novel tailored vitamin K dosing regimen to that of a fixed-dose regimen with the primary measure being the proportion of over-anticoagulated patients returning to their target INR within 24 h. One hundred and eighty-one patients with an index INR > 6·0 (asymptomatic or with minor bleeding) were randomly allocated to receive oral administration of either a tailored dose (based upon index INR and body surface area) or a fixed-dose (1 or 2 mg) of vitamin K. A greater proportion of patients treated with the tailored dose returned to within target INR range compared to the fixed-dose regimen (68·9% vs. 52·8%; P = 0·026), whilst a smaller proportion of patients remained above target INR range (12·2% vs. 34·0%; P < 0·001). Individualised vitamin K dosing is more accurate than fixed-dose regimen in lowering INR to within target range in excessively anticoagulated patients.

### Perioperative hemostatic management of patients treated with vitamin K antagonists [^113SRUW5]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Clinicians, including anesthesiologists, surgeons, and intensivists, are frequently called on to correct coagulopathy in patients receiving oral anticoagulation therapy. Before elective surgery, anticoagulation reversal may be undertaken over several days by discontinuing warfarin or vitamin K treatment, but rapid correction is required in an emergency. European and American guidelines recommend prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) for anticoagulation reversal in patients with life-threatening bleeding and an increased international normalized ratio. Compared with human fresh frozen plasma, PCCs provide quicker correction of the international normalized ratio and improved bleeding control. Although there are historic concerns regarding potential infectious and thrombotic risks with PCCs, current PCC formulations are much improved. Recombinant activated factor VII is a potential alternative to PCCs, but preclinical comparisons suggest that PCCs are more effective in correcting coagulopathy. Although many patients who require rapid reversal of warfarin are currently treated with fresh frozen plasma, PCCs should be considered as an alternative therapy.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of warfarin sodium must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's International Normalized Ratio (INR) response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines regarding the duration and intensity of anticoagulation for the indicated conditions.

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

### Guideline for reversal of antithrombotics in intracranial hemorrhage: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and Society of Critical Care Medicine [^117QQqiN]. Neurocritical Care (2016). Medium credibility.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reversal — We recommend repeating INR testing soon after PCC administration (15–60 min), and serially every 6–8 h for the next 24–48 h, with subsequent treatment guided by follow-up INR and awareness that repeat PCC dosing may increase thrombotic complications and risk of DIC. If the repeat INR is still elevated ≥ 1.4 within the first 24–48 h after initial PCC dosing, we suggest further correction with FFP. We recommend against administration of rFVIIa for the reversal of VKA. If PCCs are not available or contraindicated, alternative treatment is recommended over no treatment and treatment choice may be guided by available therapies and patient-specific factors. Treatment with FFP and Vitamin K is recommended over no treatment, and we suggest initial or further treatment of anticoagulation reversal using FFP (rather than no treatment), along with one dose of vitamin K 10 mg IV.

Anticoagulation reversal agents — geriatric trauma management: The table specifies key reversal details by agent. For vitamin K inhibitor warfarin, time from last dose to full reversal is 7–8 days, testing is PT/INR, and reversal options include FFP, vitamin K, PCC 3 factor (Profilnine), and PCC 4 factor (Kcentra). For low-molecular-weight and unfractionated heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, nadroparin), time is 6–7 days with PTT/INR testing and reversal agents protamine sulfate and ciraparantag (still investigational). For factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux, time is 3–4 days with recombinant factor VIIa (off label) listed. For parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban, bivalirudin), time is 4–5 hours with PTT and plasma-diluted thrombin time testing and the note: "No reversal agent approved. Discontinue therapy. Supportive care". For the oral direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, time is 2.5–3.5 days, prolonged PTT shows presence only (normal PTT excludes drug), and the specific reversal agent is idarucizumab (Praxbind). For antiplatelet agents, the table states that no direct reversal agents currently exist, 1-deamino-(8-D-arginine) vasopressin (DDAVP) may be useful, and platelet transfusion cannot be recommended for routine use. A footnote clarifies that anticoagulation is considered to have resolved fully after 5 half-lives of the drug have elapsed, given normal renal function.

Warfarin interaction mitigation — The most effective method to avoid adverse outcomes associated with drug interactions is to try to avoid, when feasible, concurrent use of potentially interacting drugs and to use noninteracting alternatives instead; when noninteracting alternatives are not available, adverse outcomes can be avoided by increasing the frequency of monitoring and adjusting warfarin doses based on INR response, and prospective dosing adjustments are inappropriate because of the unpredictable nature of patient response to drug interactions.

Prothrombin complex concentrate: PCCs comprise a group of products containing vitamin K-dependent factors. Initially indicated for the replacement of factor IX in patients with hemophilia B, PCCs have become approved for warfarin reversal in many parts of the world. Although plasma remains the first-line factor replacement therapy in clinical practice within the United States, current practice guidelines from around the world, including the American College of Chest Physicians, recommend PCC as the first-line factor replacement therapy rather than plasma. In the United States, one particular PCC, Kcentra, has recently been approved for warfarin reversal by the FDA. All of the available PCCs contain high doses of plasma-derived vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors II, IX, and X. The presence of significant concentration of factor VII in a PCC formulation distinguishes four-factor PCCs, such as Kcentra, from three-factor PCCs with negligible factor VII content.

### Temporarily reversing warfarin with low-dose 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate in left ventricular assist device patients undergoing an invasive procedure [^111SCbgZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC4) is effective at achieving rapid, temporary reversal of warfarin. Data and experience on using PCC4 to temporarily reverse the INR without precipitating thrombotic complications in patients with LVADs undergoing procedures are lacking. Currently, PCC4 has Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved indication for warfarin reversal in patients with acute major bleeding or who need for an urgent surgery/invasive procedure. Manufacturer recommended weight-based dosing depends on the pretreatment INR, with one of 3 recommended doses ranging from 25 units/kg to 50 units/kg (maximum 5000 units) with the intent for full reversal. However, FDA-approved dosing and related studies did not take into account patients with LVADs. Given the procoagulant effects of PCC4, the desire for limited or partial short-term reversal of warfarin's anticoagulant effects, and the thrombotic concerns with LVADs, recommended doses for non-LVAD patients could potentiate thrombotic events when applied to the LVAD population. Based on initial requests from physicians, including our heart failure specialist, to provide a temporary reversal and limit the duration of hospital stay to re-establish adequate anticoagulation coupled with our extensive bedside experience with using concentrated clotting factors including the effectiveness of lower doses, we initiated this low-dose approach using PCC4 and developed an internal guideline to guide the process when requested. The purpose of this study is to assess our approach to using low-dose PCC4 for temporary warfarin reversal in LVAD patients undergoing invasive procedures.

The objective of this article is to summarize the published literature concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral anticoagulant drugs that are currently available for clinical use and other aspects related to their management.

Methods

We carried out a standard review of published articles focusing on the laboratory and clinical characteristics of the vitamin K antagonists; the direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran etexilate; and the direct factor Xa inhibitor, rivaroxaban

Results

The antithrombotic effect of each oral anticoagulant drug, the interactions, and the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity are described in detail and discussed without providing specific recommendations. Moreover, we describe and discuss the clinical applications and optimal dosages of oral anticoagulant therapies, practical issues related to their initiation and monitoring, adverse events such as bleeding and other potential side effects, and available strategies for reversal.

Conclusions

There is a large amount of evidence on laboratory and clinical characteristics of vitamin K antagonists. A growing body of evidence is becoming available on the first new oral anticoagulant drugs available for clinical use, dabigatran and rivaroxaban.

### Warfarin-induced bleeding complications-clinical presentation and therapeutic options [^114fn2Kf]. Thrombosis Research (2008). Low credibility.

Acute bleeding during oral anticoagulant therapy is a major challenge in medicine -with millions of patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy worldwide, the frequency of severe bleeding episodes ranges from 2% to 13%, according to clinical trial data. The major risk associated with the use of oral anticoagulants is haemorrhage, which might be severe or even life-threatening. Treatment decisions for the reversal of oral anti-coagulation (OAC) depend on factors such as urgency of the situation, as determined by the international normalised ratios (INR), location and seventy of bleeding, and indication for anticoagulation. Currently available therapeutic options for the reversal of OAC include vitamin K for non-emergency situations and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and coagulation factor concentrates such as prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) for urgent situations. Complete and rapid reversal of warfarin-induced bleeding can be achieved more successfully with PCC than with FFP. In addition, PCC is associated with a more rapid normalisation of the INR and a better clinical outcome due to the balanced ratio of four vitamin-K-dependent clotting factors plus the coagulation inhibitors protein C and Protein S. PCC products containing four factors are the preferred option for the emergency reversal of OAC, according to some clinical treatment guidelines. Other advantages of PCC over FFP include smaller infusion volumes, no blood group testing and virus-inactivated blood product.

### An update on the bleeding risks associated with DOACs [^112UeCSH]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), also referred to as novel (or non-vitamin K antagonist) oral anticoagulants (NOACs), represent a major development in anticoagulation therapy due to their rapid onset of action, predictable dose-response with fixed doses and limited interactions with food and drugs. 1,2 However, these agents have been in widespread clinical use for less than a decade and, compared with extensive experience with warfarin, there is uncertainty relating to optimal laboratory monitoring of anticoagulation, perioperative management and treatment of bleeding.3 In addition, there is currently only one drug licensed in the UK for rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect of a DOAC. Here, we review DOAC-related bleeding and the role of drugs to reverse the anticoagulant action of DOACs.

### New trends in anticoagulation therapy [^1151wobY]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation pharmacy has been dramatically altered with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of 5 direct oral anticoagulants, 1 novel reversal agent and, a second designated for fast-track approval. Trial data surrounding current trends in anticoagulant choice for VTE, reversal, and bridging are constantly redefining practice. Extended therapy for unprovoked VTE has expanded to include low-dose direct oral anticoagulants, aspirin, and the use of the HERDOO2 system to identify women who can stop anticoagulant therapy without increased risk of recurrent VTE. Trends in thromboprophylaxis include extended duration low-dose direct oral anticoagulants to prevent VTE in high-risk patients.

### Vitamin K2 for the reversal of warfarin-related coagulopathy [^114qgYrG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation recommends vitamin K1 for warfarin-related coagulopathy. In Japan, vitamin K2 is used more commonly for such purpose. The difference between vitamins K1 and K2 in reversing warfarin-related coagulopathy has not been discussed. Herein, we report a case that was reversed with vitamin K2; alterations in vitamins K1 and K2 levels and coagulation markers are also presented.

Anticoagulant treatment

Patients on anticoagulants have an inherent underlying thrombotic risk that must be balanced against the bleeding risk in UGIB. In cases of severe UGIB, both European and US guidelines suggest that patients on warfarin have the drug withheld, together with anticoagulant reversal. Vitamin K should be given in addition to the faster acting four factor prothrombin complex. This method is preferred over fresh frozen plasma because of the lower volume required. In less severe UGIB, the risk versus benefit balance of continuing anticoagulation must be assessed. Rebleeding after endotherapy does not appear to be affected by a moderately elevated International Normalised Ratio, based on a case series of 233 patients, where anticoagulation was defined as an International Normalised Ratio greater than or equal to 1.3. Ninety seven (95%) of 102 patients who were anticoagulated had an International Normalised Ratio of between 1.3 and 2.7, with a rebleeding rate (after initial haemostasis) of 23% (23/102) noted in patients who had anticoagulation, and 21% (28/131) in those with International Normalised Ratio less than 1.3. In the absence of large randomised controlled trials, the US guidelines suggest that endotherapy is appropriate in patients with an International Normalised Ratio of less than 2.5.

Data are limited to guide timing of reintroduction of warfarin. A retrospective cohort study of 442 patients suggested that early reintroduction lowers the risk of thromboembolic events (hazard ratio 0.05, 95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.58) and death (0.31, 0.15 to 0.62). Current European guidance advises reintroduction of warfarin after haemostasis is achieved and within seven days, taking patient factors into consideration. Unlike warfarin, the direct oral anticoagulants have a rapid onset of action and short half-life of 12–24 h. Various reversal agents have been identified, including andexanet alfa and idarucizumab. Although effective, these drugs are expensive and concerns exist regarding a possible procoagulant effect. European and British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines suggest that given their short half-life, apart from life threatening bleeds, simply withholding the direct oral anticoagulant is an appropriate course of action.

### Time course of reversal of anticoagulant effect of warfarin by intravenous and subcutaneous phytonadione… [^114RkyCW]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

% were below and 9% above this range. 1 In another study, in patients with mechanical heart valves, the INR was within target range of 3. 6 to
4. 8 for 61% of the total patient-time, below 3. 6 for 31% of the time, and above
4. 8 for 8% of the time.
2. Cannegieter et al reported a steep rise in the rate of adverse events, from 2 per 100 patient-years with an INR of
2. 5 to 4. 9 to
4. 8 per 100 patient-years with an INR of 5. 0 to
5. 5 and 75 per 100 patient-years when the INR was 6. 5 or above. 2 In another study of 6814 patients, 162 major bleeding complications occurred during a 12-month period. Every 1-point increment in INR above 4. 0 resulted in a 42% increase in risk of bleeding.
3. In one retrospective study in which 48 patients with a mean INR of 11. 1 were treated conservatively, the mean INR had decreased to
7. 4 after a mean follow-up of 6 days.

4 Except for 1 patient who developed gross hematuria within 24 hours of the high initial INR, all other patients did well. Warfarin was withheld for at least 24 hours after administration of phytonadione, and longer if the INR at 24 hours was still greater than 6.
0. The investigators were blinded to the treatment assignment; administration of phytonadione and follow-up visits were done by the study nurse. The INR values at baseline and 8 and 24 hours after phytonadione administration were compared between the 2 groups by repeated-measures analysis of variance using the Student-Newman-Keuls adjustment. Five tests were conducted at the. 01 level of significance to achieve a. 05 overall level of significance. The Fisher exact test was used to examine the association between the route of administration and achieving an INR of 5 or less at 8 and 24 hours. Odds ratios were calculated for these times as well.

### Direct oral anticoagulant reversal in intracranial hemorrhage… [^111VYsyC]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

For 4F-PCC, anticoagulation reversal was 77%; all-cause mortality, 26%, and thromboembolic events, 8%. Idarucizumab for reversal of dabigatran had an anticoagulation reversal rate of 82%, all-cause mortality, 11%, and thromboembolic events, 5%. A direct retrospective comparison of 4F-PCC and AA showed no differences in anticoagulation reversal, proportional mortality, or thromboembolic events. All-cause mortality among patients with ICH who received 4F-PCC was 26%. Idarucizumab, the reversal agent specific to dabigatran, achieved anticoagulation reversal in 82% of patients with ICH, with low mortality and thromboembolic complications.

The FDA approved idarucizumab in 2015 to reverse the anticoagulant effects of oral dabigatran. RE-VERSE AD12 was a multicentered, prospective cohort study of idarucizumab use in 98 patients with dabigatran-related ICH. They reported 100% anticoagulation reversal, with a 16. 4% mortality rate and a
6. 1% thromboembolic event rate. 12 The rates of thrombosis were lower than those reported in 4F-PCC studies. On the other hand, 4F-PCC is a nonspecific reversal agent studied predominantly in the reversal of FXaI. Overall, the proportion of anticoagulation reversed, mortality, and thromboembolic event rates appear similar between 4F-PCC and AA for FXaI reversal. However, the lack of head-to-head comparison warrants cautious interpretation.

### Time to anticoagulation reversal and outcomes after intracerebral hemorrhage… [^115uGhBK]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

For supplementary analysis for NOAC and warfarin subgroups, continuous INR was included in the warfarin models. For the DTT time and outcome analysis, deep vein thrombosis, smoking history, sleep apnea, and arrival via emergency medical services were excluded from the models. Reversal interventions were performed in 4616 of 5429 taking warfarin and 2856 of 4069 taking NOACs prior to the ICH. For the 5224 patients receiving a reversal intervention with documented workflow times, the median onset-to-treatment time was 232 minutes, and the median DTT time was 82 minutes. Similar estimates appeared for the subgroup taking anticoagulation before ICH onset. The mortality benefit was significant in patients with anticoagulation-associated ICH exposed to warfarin.

Table 2 shows the results of the binary analysis within the reversal intervention group among patients who received treatment within and after 60 minutes. Nevertheless, the German multicenter study observations are consistent with other observational studies and the International Normalized Ratio Normalization in Coumadin Associated Intracerebral Haemorrhage trial, which demonstrated that PCC was superior to FFP in quickly reversing INR and reducing ICH expansion. 5 The population of patients with anticoagulation-associated ICH receiving reversal intervention in the current study, which includes both warfarin-associated and NOAC-associated coagulopathy, is 5-fold as large as the German multicenter analysis and 100-fold larger than the sample of the INCH trial. With regard to optimal timing, our analysis focused on DTT times because emergency department–based acute care is an established environment for time-dependent quality improvement in stroke.

8 Indeed, 2 recent studies in the UK and Eastern hemisphere incorporated warfarin reversal strategies into a quality improvement bundle intervention within 90 and 60 minutes, respectively. 6, 17 In the present analysis, DTT times of less than 60 minutes most clearly demonstrated a time-dependent effect of coagulopathy reversal, but we cannot exclude an even greater effect with earlier initiation.

### Comparing different routes and doses of phytonadione for reversing excessive anticoagulation… [^113JzKC6]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Background Significant controversy exists concerning how best to reverse excessive anticoagulation with phytonadione while avoiding overcorrection in patients who need to have anticoagulation therapy maintained. Methods. The recommendations further indicate that a significant reduction in the INR can be anticipated within 6 to 8 hours. Intravenous phytonadione administration is probably not encouraged because, in rare instances, it causes a severe allergic reaction. A careful literature search, however, failed to identify data on the use of SC administration of phytonadione for reversing the effects of warfarin sodium. Pengo et al found that the administration of phytonadione corrected the INR to less than 5. 0 at 24 hours more effectively than did simply withholding the warfarin dose. 6 More recently, Weibert et al reported that 2.

5 mg of PO phytonadione reversed excessive anticoagulation in almost all patients within 24 or 48 hours and induced only limited overcorrection in a few patients. The IV administration of phytonadione has been shown to be effective in reversing the effects of warfarin in 5 studies. 8–12 Shetty et al11 suggested that low doses of IV phytonadione can reverse the effects of excessive anticoagulation and possibly lead to less overcorrection in the INR than that seen with larger doses. Other information collected for each patient included age and sex, indication for warfarin therapy, and whether low- or high-intensity anticoagulation was indicated. The dose of warfarin taken 1 week before phytonadione administration, the reason for an increase in the INR, and the presence and severity of bleeding complications also were recorded.

Our study has several limitations in that it was retrospective and involved a relatively small number of patients who were not randomly assigned to different therapies. In addition, we could not determine whether resistence to warfarin was less likely to develop in patients receiving phytonadione by a particular route or dose. Because of these limitations and the scarcity of clinical trials, we agree with other authors that randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the best method of using phytonadione to reverse excessive warfarin-induced anticoagulation.
