## Question

propranolol use during pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about propranolol use during pregnancy across trimesters, including risks, benefits, alternatives, and monitoring plans. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the regulatory baseline and labeling language. Then, I should verify evidence for maternal indications and efficacy. Next, I will assess teratogenicity and organ-specific malformation signals, followed by fetal growth restriction risk. After that, I need to examine peripartum and neonatal complications, compare propranolol with alternative agents, and map trimester-specific risk–benefit strategies. Finally, I will outline monitoring protocols, special scenarios, and a practical synthesis while double-checking data quality and confounding issues.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory framework. Propranolol labeling consistently uses a cautionary approach in pregnancy, citing absence of adequate human trials, animal embryotoxicity at high doses, and the principle that use should be reserved when potential maternal benefit justifies fetal risk, with emphasis on neonatal β-blockade effects near delivery, including bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression [^116oiLhE] [^1173XxSo]. I should double-check that multiple propranolol formulations and labels align on this message and the practical need for neonatal monitoring at birth, which they do, and several also note excretion in breast milk requiring caution during lactation [^1173XxSo] [^112rJUQM].

> Next, I should review maternal indications and benefits to avoid jumping to conclusions about class effects. For hypertension and related cardiovascular conditions in pregnancy, beta-blockers reduce progression to severe hypertension and the need for additional agents, though they do not clearly improve hard perinatal outcomes; this has been shown in Cochrane analyses of mild-to-moderate hypertension, while severe hypertension regimens typically prefer labetalol or nifedipine in practice and trials [^113dZmTK] [^116QKbkV] [^117DDZLA]. Let me verify non-hypertensive indications: propranolol remains reasonable for maternal arrhythmias and thyrotoxicosis during pregnancy in cardiovascular guidelines, and may be considered for migraine prophylaxis when symptoms substantially impair quality of life after weighing alternatives [^115RpoPr] [^114sCRLx].

> Hold on, I should confirm teratogenic risk rather than assume class safety. A meta-analysis of first-trimester beta-blocker exposure found no increase in overall major congenital anomalies but signaled higher odds of certain organ-specific defects, with substantial heterogeneity and potential confounding, while decades of propranolol experience in labeling have not identified a drug-associated increase in major birth defects or miscarriage, so causal teratogenicity remains unproven at the class and molecule level, warranting cautious interpretation especially in early gestation [^111MZiRG] [^116oiLhE]. I need to ensure the reader knows atenolol is the outlier with consistently worse data; avoidance is recommended when alternatives exist, and this does not generalize to propranolol [^112vaaMb] [^111jX9g9].

> Let me now examine fetal growth restriction and SGA, since this is the most consistent concern. Beta-blockers are associated with increased SGA risk in randomized and observational data, and term infants exposed in utero often have lower average birth weights, with risks appearing higher with prolonged exposure in the second and third trimesters; mechanistic hypotheses include placental perfusion effects and altered vascular tone, although disease confounding remains a challenge [^113dZmTK] [^115PeWaA] [^11584B1x] [^1142Eua2]. I should double-check comparative data: some cohorts with β1-selective agents like metoprolol or bisoprolol show elevated SGA versus methyldopa, whereas reports with propranolol are inconsistent regarding uteroplacental flow effects, underscoring the need for serial growth surveillance when therapy is continued [^117Ki6jo] [^11584B1x].

> I will now examine peripartum and neonatal risks so we plan ahead. Labels consistently report fetal and neonatal bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression when propranolol is used near delivery, and they recommend that facilities for monitoring newborns be available with observation for β-blockade symptoms for at least the immediate postpartum period, typically 24–48 hours in practice, with risk increasing if maternal dosing continues to delivery [^116oiLhE] [^1173XxSo]. Wait, let me verify dose timing recommendations: while labels do not mandate a standardized taper, expert practice often considers dose reduction prior to planned delivery when feasible, balanced against maternal indication severity, to mitigate neonatal effects [^116oiLhE] [^113FV7SY].

> But before we decide to continue or switch, I should compare propranolol's profile to alternatives. For hypertension in pregnancy, labetalol and long-acting nifedipine are generally preferred first-line agents based on effectiveness and experience, while methyldopa remains a long-standing option; propranolol is typically not first-line for hypertension but remains appropriate for specific arrhythmias and thyrotoxicosis where clinical efficacy is compelling [^116QKbkV] [^117DDZLA] [^115RpoPr]. I should confirm the atenolol signal again and emphasize avoidance due to fetal growth effects and neonatal hypoglycemia and bradycardia, reinforcing that propranolol's risk–benefit calculation is distinct from atenolol [^111jX9g9] [^112vaaMb].

> Let me think about trimester-specific decisions, because risks evolve across gestation. In the first trimester, available data do not show an increase in overall major malformations with class exposure, so continuation can be reasonable if indications are strong, while remaining vigilant about the possible, but unproven, organ-specific signals and considering alternatives if the indication is weak [^111MZiRG] [^113FV7SY]. In the second trimester, growth risk becomes more salient, so I should confirm a plan for serial ultrasounds about every four weeks and consider switching to labetalol or nifedipine if the primary indication is hypertension without a strong propranolol-specific need [^115PeWaA] [^116QKbkV]. In the third trimester and peripartum, I need to ensure neonatal monitoring plans for β-blockade effects and consider dose reduction or holding near a planned delivery when clinically safe, with contingency for urgent delivery if maternal indications preclude tapering [^116oiLhE] [^113FV7SY].

> Next, I should review a structured monitoring and counseling protocol to avoid gaps. I need to ensure documentation of individualized risk–benefit discussion, schedule serial fetal growth assessments from approximately 20 weeks at four-week intervals, coordinate delivery planning with neonatology for postnatal observation of heart rate and glucose, and provide lactation counseling given breast milk excretion with caution rather than prohibition, adjusting for maternal indication and infant risk [^1173XxSo] [^115PeWaA] [^116oiLhE]. Wait, I labeled a "Step 10 Insight" earlier in my notes, but that was a mistake; this structured protocol logically follows as Step 8 or 9 in the sequence, and I should correct that numbering to maintain clarity in the clinical workflow without changing the substance of the plan [^113FV7SY].

> But wait, what about special scenarios where propranolol may be uniquely useful or has evolving data. For maternal arrhythmias, long QT syndromes, and thyrotoxicosis, propranolol can be justified when alternatives are less effective or contraindicated, while still committing to growth surveillance and neonatal monitoring, and evidence in LQTS cohorts highlights both the necessity of beta-blockade and the growth tradeoffs that require careful follow-up and agent selection, usually favoring β1-selective agents when effective [^115RpoPr] [^1178un6L]. Emerging uses include congenital chylothorax case series showing prenatal resolution with maternal propranolol, whereas randomized data for labor augmentation do not show reductions in cesarean delivery and suggest no clear obstetric outcome benefit, so I should avoid extrapolating off-label peripartum uses into routine practice [^116GDyPd] [^113mVfVu].

> I should confirm practical prescribing details and peripartum tactics. For ongoing treatment into late gestation, coordinate timing of the last dose before planned induction or cesarean when the maternal condition allows, and ensure the newborn has early glucose checks and heart rate monitoring for at least the first day, extending observation if symptomatic or if high maternal doses were taken close to delivery, in line with label cautions about bradycardia and hypoglycemia [^116oiLhE] [^1173XxSo]. Regarding breastfeeding, I need to counsel that propranolol is present in breast milk and may be used with caution, monitoring the infant for excess somnolence, poor feeding, bradycardia, or hypoglycemia, while balancing maternal cardiovascular control needs and alternative therapies when concerns arise [^116oiLhE] [^1173XxSo].

> Hold on, let me not ignore the quality of evidence and confounding, because that shapes counseling. Many associations between beta-blockers and adverse fetal outcomes are limited by heterogeneity, confounding by indication, and inconsistent control of maternal disease, so I should frame risk estimates as probabilistic signals rather than deterministic outcomes and emphasize optimization of the underlying maternal condition to reduce baseline obstetric risk [^114mXoYY] [^113L17Mv]. This means documenting disease severity, control parameters, and adherence, and reevaluating the agent choice if the primary indication is hypertension where labetalol or nifedipine may achieve similar maternal goals with a more favorable fetal growth profile in aggregate analyses and guidelines [^116QKbkV] [^117DDZLA].

> Final synthesis, let me double-check the throughline so I do not miss a key step. Propranolol in pregnancy is acceptable when the maternal indication is strong and alternatives are less suitable, with low likelihood of major congenital malformations overall, a class signal for SGA and growth restriction with prolonged exposure, and predictable neonatal β-blockade effects near delivery that are mitigated by anticipatory planning, monitoring, and, when feasible, dose adjustments before scheduled birth, while for hypertension per se, labetalol or nifedipine are usually preferred first-line agents [^111MZiRG] [^113dZmTK] [^113FV7SY] [^116QKbkV]. I need to ensure a structured plan: confirm indication and alternatives, implement serial growth ultrasounds, coordinate peripartum neonatal monitoring, and provide lactation counseling, updating decisions each trimester as risk–benefit shifts and maintaining transparency about evidence limitations and confounding in shared decision-making [^115PeWaA] [^116oiLhE] [^114mXoYY].

---

Propranolol is not first-line in pregnancy but is **acceptable when benefits outweigh risks** for arrhythmias, thyrotoxicosis, or essential tremor [^115RpoPr] [^112rJUQM]. It crosses the placenta and is associated with **fetal bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression**, especially with late-pregnancy or peripartum exposure [^1142Eua2] [^116oiLhE]. There is **no clear increase in major congenital anomalies**, but beta-blockers may increase small-for-gestational-age risk [^111MZiRG] [^113dZmTK] [^114mXoYY]. Use the lowest effective dose, avoid abrupt withdrawal, and monitor fetal growth and neonatal vitals after birth; **prefer labetalol or nifedipine** for hypertension unless propranolol is specifically indicated [^111gcqpr] [^113FV7SY] [^115RpoPr] [^116QKbkV].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and placental transfer

Propranolol **crosses the placenta**, resulting in fetal exposure to pharmacologic effects [^11584B1x] [^1142Eua2]. Fetal exposure can **approach maternal levels**, particularly with chronic or high-dose use.

---

## Fetal and neonatal risks

- **Fetal bradycardia**: Propranolol can cause fetal bradycardia, especially with late-pregnancy or peripartum exposure [^113FV7SY] [^116oiLhE].

- **Neonatal hypoglycemia**: Neonates exposed in utero may develop hypoglycemia due to beta-blockade of glycogenolysis [^116oiLhE] [^113FV7SY].

- **Respiratory depression**: Neonatal respiratory depression has been reported with peripartum exposure [^1173irx2] [^1173XxSo].

- **Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)**: Beta-blockers, including propranolol, have been associated with increased risk of IUGR and small-for-gestational-age infants [^113dZmTK] [^113FV7SY].

- **Congenital anomalies**: No clear increase in major congenital anomalies overall, but some studies suggest possible increases in cardiovascular defects, cleft lip/palate, and neural tube defects with first-trimester beta-blocker exposure [^111MZiRG].

---

## Maternal risks and considerations

Propranolol can cause **maternal bradycardia and hypotension**, so careful monitoring is required; it may also mask hypoglycemia symptoms, complicating diabetes management [^111gcqpr]. Avoid abrupt withdrawal, which can precipitate rebound hypertension or angina; taper gradually if discontinuation is necessary [^115AsvkX].

---

## Clinical indications and recommendations

- **Arrhythmias**: Propranolol is acceptable for maternal arrhythmias during pregnancy when benefits outweigh risks [^115RpoPr] [^112rJUQM].

- **Thyrotoxicosis**: Propranolol is acceptable for thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy [^115RpoPr] [^112rJUQM].

- **Essential tremor**: Propranolol may be used for essential tremor if benefits outweigh risks [^112rJUQM].

- **Hypertension**: Propranolol is not first-line for hypertension in pregnancy; labetalol, methyldopa, or nifedipine are preferred [^115RpoPr] [^116QKbkV].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Regular **fetal growth monitoring** and antenatal surveillance are recommended; after birth, monitor neonates for bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression [^113FV7SY]. Use the **lowest effective dose** and adjust based on maternal and fetal response [^112rJUQM].

---

## Alternative medications

- **Labetalol**: Preferred beta-blocker for hypertension in pregnancy due to favorable safety profile [^115RpoPr] [^116QKbkV].

- **Methyldopa**: Long-standing safety record for hypertension in pregnancy [^112pCAbj].

- **Nifedipine**: Calcium channel blocker alternative for hypertension in pregnancy [^117DDZLA].

### 2018 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy [^115RpoPr]. European Heart Journal (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the use of propranolol hydrochloride PO (also known as Hemangeol) in pregnant patients across all trimesters: use only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans, so it is crucial to monitor for fetal bradycardia. Additionally, neonates should be monitored for hypoglycemia and respiratory depression. Patients being managed for hypertension may continue treatment during pregnancy unless contraindications exist. Propranolol can also be used for maternal arrhythmias during pregnancy. Its use is acceptable for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy. Propranolol hydrochloride PO is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. The drug, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Oral beta-blockers for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^113dZmTK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Antihypertensives, such as beta-blockers, are used for pregnancy hypertension in the belief that these will improve outcomes for both mother and baby.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether oral beta-blockers are better than placebo or no beta-blocker, and have advantages over other antihypertensives for women with mild to moderate pregnancy hypertension.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (May 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2002), bibliographies of retrieved papers, and personal files.

- **Selection criteria**: Trials comparing beta-blockers with placebo, no therapy, or other antihypertensives for women with mild to moderate pregnancy hypertension.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We extracted the data independently and were not blinded to trial characteristics or outcomes. Whenever possible, we contacted authors for missing data.

- **Main results**: Twenty-nine trials (approximately 2500 women) are included. Thirteen trials (1480 women) compared beta-blockers with placebo or no beta blocker. Oral beta-blockers decrease the risk of severe hypertension (relative risk (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 0.53; 11 trials, N = 1128 women) and the need for additional antihypertensives (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.62; 7 trials, N = 856 women). There are insufficient data for conclusions about the effect on perinatal mortality or preterm birth. Beta-blockers seem to be associated with an increase in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.82; 12 trials; N = 1346 women). Maternal hospital admission may be decreased.

### The risk of congenital malformations associated with exposure to β-blockers early in pregnancy: a meta-analysis [^111MZiRG]. Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

β-blockers are commonly used during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, data about the risks of congenital anomalies in offspring have not been summarized. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the teratogenicity of β-blockers in early pregnancy. A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Clinical Trials, and hand searching.

Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models based on odds ratios (ORs). Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity. Randomized controlled trials or observational studies examining the risks of congenital malformations associated with first-trimester β-blocker exposure compared with no exposure were included. Thirteen population-based case-control or cohort studies were identified.

Based on the meta-analyses, first-trimester oral β-blocker use showed no increased odds of all or major congenital anomalies (OR = 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.91–1.10; 5 studies).

- **Organ-specific malformations**: Increased odds of cardiovascular defects (OR = 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.18–3.42; 4 studies), cleft lip/palate (OR = 3.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.79–5.43; 2 studies), and neural tube defects (OR = 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.19–10.67; 2 studies) were observed.

The effects on severe hypospadias were nonsignificant (1 study). Causality is difficult to interpret given the small number of heterogeneous studies and the possibility of biases. Given the frequency of this exposure in pregnancy, further research is needed.

### Inderal XL [^113FV7SY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Prolonged experience with propranolol in pregnant women over several decades, based on published interventional and observational studies, has not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or other adverse maternal outcomes. Bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression have been observed with the use of beta-blockers, including propranolol, in utero near the time of delivery. There are inconsistent reports of intrauterine growth restriction with beta-blocker use, including propranolol, during pregnancy. Untreated hypertension during pregnancy can lead to serious adverse outcomes for the mother and the fetus (see Clinical Considerations and Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**:

	- **Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g. need for cesarean section and postpartum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

### Fetoplacental vascular effects of maternal adrenergic antihypertensive and cardioprotective medications in pregnancy [^11584B1x]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Low credibility.

Adrenergic therapies are prescribed in pregnancy to improve maternal cardiovascular function. Amongst these medications, β-AR antagonists are the most commonly prescribed to reduce maternal blood pressure and/or heart rate in the context of impaired left ventricular function. These drugs can cross the placental barrier and it is possible they have a detrimental effect on placental vascular function and fetal growth and development. Chronic exposure to β-AR antagonists has been shown to increase the risk of fetal hypoglycemia, bradycardia, and cardiovascular defects in the newborn, and has been associated with an increased risk of fetal growth restriction (FGR). However, it is unknown whether these effects are mediated through impaired fetoplacental vascular function or are attributable to the underlying maternal disease.

- **Major adrenergic medications prescribed in pregnancy**: Clinical studies have reported an association between maternal administration of labetalol, propranolol, metoprolol, or atenolol and low birthweight. In addition, atenolol has been demonstrated to reduce fetal heart rate and umbilical blood flow and is no longer recommended for use in pregnancy. Contrasting evidence, based mainly on the lack of adverse effects on uteroplacental blood flow, has shown that labetalol, methyldopa, metoprolol, and propranolol are well tolerated for the fetus. In contrast, an observational cohort study reported reduced birthweight in pregnancies exposed to bisoprolol during the first trimester.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^1173irx2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2015). Low credibility.

Propranolol hydrochloride was investigated in several reproductive and developmental toxicology studies. In these studies, propranolol hydrochloride was administered to rats by gavage or in their diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At doses of 150 mg/kg/day, but not at 80 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose on a body surface area basis), treatment was linked to embryotoxicity (manifested as reduced litter size and increased resorption rates) and neonatal toxicity (including deaths). Propranolol hydrochloride was also provided to rabbits through feed during pregnancy and lactation at doses up to 150 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 5 times the maximum recommended human oral daily dose; no evidence of embryo or neonatal toxicity was identified.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Reports indicate intrauterine growth retardation, small placentas, and congenital abnormalities in neonates whose mothers received propranolol during pregnancy. Neonates whose mothers were administered propranolol at parturition displayed bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and/or respiratory depression. Hence, adequate facilities for monitoring such infants at birth should be available. Propranolol should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

- **Nursing mothers**: Propranolol is excreted in human milk. Caution is advised when administering propranolol to a nursing woman.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of propranolol in pediatric patients have not been established.

Bronchospasm and congestive heart failure have been reported coincident with the administration of propranolol.

### SPL drug information for sotalol hydrochloride [^114Nh1V9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of sotalol hydrochloride IV (also known as Betapace) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. Both the use of sotalol and the untreated underlying condition in pregnancy can cause adverse outcomes to the mother and fetus/neonate. The incidence of VT is increased and may be more symptomatic during pregnancy. Furthermore, breakthrough arrhythmias may occur during pregnancy as therapeutic drug concentrations may be difficult to maintain due to the increased volume of distribution and increased drug metabolism during pregnancy. Sotalol crosses the placenta and is found in amniotic fluid.

From published observational studies, potential fetal adverse effects include growth restriction, transient fetal bradycardia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia, maternal uterine contractions, and intrauterine death. Sotalol may have a greater effect on QT prolongation in the immature heart, and therefore, there may be an increased risk of serious fetal arrhythmia and/or intrauterine death. It is essential to monitor exposed neonates for symptoms of β-blockade, as well as to continuously monitor mothers treated with sotalol during labor and obstetric delivery, given that the risk of arrhythmias increases during the labor and delivery process.

The drug sotalol hydrochloride IV (also known as Betapace) is classified under category C in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate.

### Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^112pCAbj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, thereby improving pregnancy outcomes. This Cochrane Review is an update of an earlier review, first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2007 and 2014.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), as of 13 September 2017, as well as reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy were included. Mild to moderate hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure of 140 to 169 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons were made between one or more antihypertensive drugs with placebo, no antihypertensive drug, or another antihypertensive drug, with treatment planned to continue for at least seven days.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy.

- **Main results**: For this update, we included 63 trials (data from 58 trials, 5909 women), with a moderate to high risk of bias overall. We conducted GRADE assessments for the main comparison of 'antihypertensive drug versus placebo/no antihypertensive drug' only. Evidence was graded from very low to moderate certainty, with downgrading of main endpoints.

### Propranolol therapy for congenital chylothorax [^116GDyPd]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Congenital chylothorax is a rare and often severe anomaly without well-established medical therapies. Previously, propranolol use in patients with lymphatic malformations and secondary chylothorax was associated with improvement in clinical signs. We hypothesized that propranolol treatment would be beneficial for severe congenital chylothorax. We reviewed medical records of neonates born from 2015 to 2019 at our tertiary center with a prenatal diagnosis of congenital chylothorax for whom either prenatal or postnatal propranolol therapy was initiated.

Inclusion was limited to fetuses diagnosed with severe congenital chylothorax without significant genetic, infectious, or cardiac anomalies, and who underwent prenatal interventions to mitigate the consequences of the condition. Propranolol was administered orally to pregnant women at 20 mg four times daily and increased to a maximum dose of 40 mg four times daily, or to infants at 0.3 mg/kg/day and increased to 1 to 2 mg/kg/day. Primary outcomes were the time course of resolution of ultrasonographical, clinical, and/or radiologic signs of chylothorax after treatment with propranolol.

Four neonates met the inclusion criteria. In two cases, prenatal initiation of propranolol led to the resolution of the chylothoraxes before delivery (38 and 32 days after treatment) on a dose of 40 mg/day four times daily. Neonates had a normal postnatal course. Postnatal propranolol was initiated in two neonates with respiratory failure when chylothoraces were refractory to standard management. Stabilization and improvement of their pleural effusion was observed by imaging.

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^116oiLhE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

In a series of reproductive and developmental toxicology studies, propranolol hydrochloride was administered to rats by gavage or in the diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At doses of 150 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 80 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the MRHD on a body surface area basis), treatment was associated with embryotoxicity, including reduced litter size and increased resorption rates, as well as neonatal toxicity, such as deaths. Propranolol hydrochloride was also administered in the feed to rabbits throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses as high as 150 mg/kg/day (about 5 times the maximum recommended human oral daily dose), with no evidence of embryo or neonatal toxicity noted.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Intrauterine growth retardation has been reported for neonates whose mothers received propranolol hydrochloride during pregnancy. Neonates whose mothers received propranolol hydrochloride at parturition have exhibited bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression. Adequate facilities for monitoring such infants at birth should be available. Propranolol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

- **Nursing mothers**: Propranolol is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when propranolol is administered to a nursing woman.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness of propranolol in pediatric patients have not been established.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of intravenous propranolol did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over.

### Mother and child: Medication use in pregnancy and lactation [^113dwrQ8]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding pose unique challenges to drug development and clinical application. In addition to concerns about drug toxicity to the fetus in utero and to infants through breastfeeding, alterations in pharmacokinetics in these women also require careful attention. How do we address the general lack of drug efficacy and toxicity information for pregnant and breastfeeding women?

### SPL drug information for atenolol / chlorthalidone [^112F1Rzy]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of atenolol / chlorthalidone PO (also known as Tenoretic) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^1169NTMK]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for infantile hemangioma, particularly concerning oral beta-blockers, AAP 2019 guidelines recommend offering oral propranolol as first-line therapy for patients with infantile hemangiomas requiring systemic treatment. Propranolol should be administered at 2–3 mg/kg/day unless there are comorbidities, such as PHACE syndrome, or adverse effects, like sleep disturbance, that necessitate a lower dose.

### In-utero exposure to antihypertensive medication and neonatal and child health outcomes: A systematic review [^114mXoYY]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

The results are further confounded by the lack of information describing the types of hypertension treated in women included in the exposed groups. It is likely that the risk profiles and outcomes associated with chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia are different; therefore, knowledge of the underlying condition is important and should be considered and reported. Only 16 of 47 studies reported in this review provided such information, and the majority of these studies assessed beta-blocker exposure.

Although it is recognized that the results of cohort studies should be reported as relative risk (RR), ten of the cohort studies used logistic regression analysis and reported results as odds ratio (OR) values. Although the OR may represent a close approximation to the RR when the outcome of interest is rare (< 10% of the general population/unexposed group), OR values may exaggerate the risk posed by the exposure studied and open the study to misinterpretation.

Treatment of hypertension during pregnancy and assessing the potential risks to the offspring is further complicated by the underlying disease. Untreated hypertension results in preterm birth, low birth weight, and increased mortality. It would therefore be reasonable to suggest that poorly controlled hypertension may carry the same risks as untreated hypertension. Case-control and cohort studies reviewed in this paper have failed to determine whether hypertension was appropriately treated and controlled, and failed to assess adherence. Several studies reviewed used an untreated hypertensive group to identify.

### Inderalla [^1173XxSo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In a series of reproductive and developmental toxicology studies, propranolol was given to rats by gavage or in the diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. At doses of 150 mg/kg/day, but not at doses of 80 mg/kg/day (equivalent to the MRHD on a body surface area basis), treatment was associated with embryotoxicity, including reduced litter size and increased resorption rates, as well as neonatal toxicity, such as deaths. Propranolol hydrochloride was also administered (in the feed) to rabbits throughout pregnancy and lactation at doses as high as 150 mg/kg/day (about 5 times the maximum recommended human oral daily dose). No evidence of embryo or neonatal toxicity was noted.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Intrauterine growth retardation, small placentas, and congenital abnormalities have been reported in neonates whose mothers received propranolol during pregnancy. Neonates whose mothers are receiving propranolol at parturition have exhibited bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and/or respiratory depression. Adequate facilities for monitoring such infants at birth should be available. Inderal LA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

- **Nursing mothers**: Propranolol is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when Inderal LA is administered to a nursing woman.

- **Pediatric use**: Safety and effectiveness of propranolol in pediatric patients have not been established.

Bronchospasm and congestive heart failure have been reported coincident with the administration of propranolol.

### Antihypertensive drugs during pregnancy [^115GBxBk]. Seminars in Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypertensive disorders are the most common medical disorders during pregnancy. Their presence is associated with increased adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, both acute and long-term. Antihypertensive agents are widely used in the management of these pregnancies despite the absence of evidence demonstrating either benefits or harms from this therapy.

Multiple agents are available, and various guidelines recommend different agents, doses, and regimens, despite a lack of information on the pharmacokinetics, disposition, and pharmacodynamic effects of these drugs during pregnancy. Randomized trials comparing antihypertensive therapy to a placebo are lacking. The available data have not shown clinical benefits, largely due to inadequate sample sizes that fail to rule out moderate to large effects on perinatal outcomes.

In addition, data on teratogenic effects, adverse fetal-neonatal effects, and long-term infant outcomes are scant. These issues stem from a lack of interest and support from the government and pharmaceutical companies in conducting research on pregnant women, due to regulatory and medico-legal concerns. Consequently, there is an urgent need to conduct clinical research in this area.

### SPL drug information for propranolol hydrochloride ER [^115AsvkX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of propranolol hydrochloride ER PO (also known as Inderal XL, Inderal LA):

- **Bradycardia**: Use extreme caution in patients with WPW syndrome.
- **Cardiac failure**: Maintain a high level of suspicion as propranolol can cause depression of myocardial contractility and may precipitate heart failure and cardiogenic shock.
- **Decreased drug efficacy**: Use caution in patients being treated with epinephrine, as patients on beta-blockers may experience a reduced response to epinephrine.
- **Exacerbation of Raynaud's phenomenon**: Use caution in patients with pre-existing Raynaud's phenomenon or peripheral vascular disease.
- **Hypertensive crisis**: Use extreme caution in patients with pheochromocytoma.
- **Mask symptoms of hypoglycemia**: Use caution in patients with diabetes mellitus, as propranolol may mask the initial signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia.
- **Mask symptoms of thyrotoxicosis**: Use caution in patients with hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis.
- **Myocardial infarction**: Do not discontinue abruptly, as rapid dose reduction or withdrawal may cause withdrawal effects including myocardial infarction.
- **Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, urticaria**: Maintain a high level of suspicion for cutaneous reactions triggered by the use of propranolol.

### Fetoplacental vascular effects of maternal adrenergic antihypertensive and cardioprotective medications in pregnancy [^1142Eua2]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

The effect of adrenergic medications on the fetoplacental vasculature, with regard to the regulation of vascular tone, is unknown. One key aim of this review was to predict the likely vasoactive effects mediated by adrenergic medications on the fetoplacental vasculature by accounting for the intrinsic response of the drugs binding to the adrenergic receptors expressed on the systemic vasculature, and their plasma levels. To interpret the pharmacokinetic data for prediction of pharmacodynamic effects, we included information on the drug levels found in the fetal plasma or, in the absence of this evidence, we accounted for the fetal:maternal (F:M) plasma level ratios. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the most commonly prescribed adrenergic medications are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

Prediction of potential vasoactive effects mediated by adrenergic medications on the fetoplacental vasculature is mainly based on nonfetoplacental and animal studies. Except for labetalol and propranolol, there are currently insufficient human data to predict the likely net vasoactive effect of adrenergic medications on fetoplacental vascular tone. Importantly, data collected from nonpregnant individuals suggest that levels of labetalol may exceed 10⁻⁶ mol/l when the drug is administered intravenously. As such, a potential intravenous administration of labetalol in pregnant women may increase peak fetal venous plasma to a concentration, which is likely to increase fetoplacental vascular tone based on ex-vivo studies.

### Intrauterine growth retardation in pregnant women with long QT syndrome treated with beta-receptor blockers [^1178un6L]. Neonatology (2021). Low credibility.

Pregnant women with inherited long QT syndrome (iLQTS) face increased risks such as preterm delivery and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) due to their underlying condition. They are also susceptible to arrhythmogenic events, particularly during the postpartum period, due to physiological changes and increased emotional and physical stress. Beta-receptor blockers are effective in preventing life-threatening Torsades de Pointes ventricular tachycardia and are the preferred treatment for iLQTS. Despite this, IUGR is often reported in infants prenatally exposed to these medications, which can lead to adverse neonatal outcomes, especially in preterm infants.

This review aims to assist clinicians in selecting appropriate beta-receptor blocker treatments for pregnant women with iLQTS by:

- **Summarizing the available literature**: It addresses the impact of different beta-receptor blockers on IUGR.
- **Reporting additional aspects**: Factors that might influence the selection of beta-receptor blockers are discussed.

Generally, nonselective beta-receptor blockers such as nadolol and propranolol are recommended for managing iLQTS because they are considered to be more effective. However, beta-1-selective receptor blockers, like bisoprolol or metoprolol, are less likely to affect uterine contraction and peripheral vasodilation, and they are associated with lower rates of IUGR and fetal hypoglycemia. Therefore, except for atenolol, these are recommended as first-line therapy for pregnant women. Additionally, maternal factors such as the iLQTS genotype and other underlying comorbidities should be considered in treatment decisions.

### Pharmacological management of hypertension in pregnancy [^115Nh6Lx]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Hypertension in pregnancy remains a significant public health problem. The pharmacological management of blood pressure in pregnancy is impacted by changes in maternal drug disposition and the pharmacodynamic effects of specific agents. This article reviews the impact of pregnancy on pathways of drug elimination and the associated clinical implications. It also examines the pharmacodynamic effects of specific drugs and classes of drugs in pregnancy and the data at the time of writing on the impact of antihypertensive therapy on mothers and their fetuses.

### SPL drug information for levobunolol hydrochloride [^117Nd26P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of levobunolol hydrochloride OPHTH in pregnant patients for all trimesters, use it only if clearly needed. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. It is essential to monitor neonates for signs and symptoms of β-blockade. The drug levobunolol hydrochloride OPHTH is classified under category C in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Efficacy of propranolol to reduce cesarean delivery in prolonged labor: A randomized controlled trial [^113mVfVu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

The study PROPEL, published by Jennifer A. McCoy and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, is related to the following conditions: labor dystocia, shoulder dystocia, and cesarean delivery. The trial question in the PROPEL study was: What is the role of propranolol in patients with prolonged labor?

The study design was a multicenter, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, involving a population of 164 female patients. The inclusion criteria required patients to have a singleton gestation of ≥ 36 weeks and experience prolonged labor. Key exclusion criteria included severe preeclampsia, maternal heart rate < 70 beats/min, maternal blood pressure < 90/50 mmHg, asthma, diabetes requiring insulin during labor, and cardiac contraindication to β-blockade.

- **Interventions**
- **Propranolol group**: n = 84 (intravenous dose of 2 mg).
- **Placebo group**: n = 80 (intravenous dose of 2 mL normal saline).

- **Primary outcome**: Propranolol did not significantly reduce the rate of cesarean delivery compared to placebo (57.1% vs. 57.5%; RR 0.99, 99% CI 0.76 to 1.29).

- **Secondary outcomes**
- No significant difference in maternal morbidity (12% vs. 6%; RR 2, 95% CI -1.12 to 5.12).
- No significant difference in shoulder dystocia (4% vs. 5%; RR 0.8, 95% CI -3.23 to 4.83).
- No significant difference in neonatal morbidity (8% vs. 5%; RR 1.6, 95% CI -3.38 to 6.58).

- **Conclusion**: In patients with singleton gestation at ≥ 36 weeks and experiencing prolonged labor, propranolol was not superior to placebo in reducing cesarean delivery rates.

### Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^111QZHHo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is common. Antihypertensive drugs are often used with the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease and thereby improve the outcome.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials evaluated any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy, defined, whenever possible, as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons involved one or more antihypertensive drugs with placebo, no antihypertensive drug, or another antihypertensive drug, and the treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data.

- **Main results**: Forty-nine trials (4723 women) were included. Twenty-nine trials compared an antihypertensive drug with placebo/no antihypertensive drug (3350 women). There is a halving in the risk of developing severe hypertension associated with the use of antihypertensive drugs (20 trials, 2558 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.60; risk difference (RD) -0.10 (-0.13 to -0.07); number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 10 (8 to 13)), but there is little evidence of a difference in the risk of pre-eclampsia.

### Verapamil hydrochloride [^112XYVaR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects

Pregnancy Category C. Reproduction studies have been performed in rabbits and rats at oral verapamil doses up to 1.5 (15 mg/kg/day) and 6 (60 mg/kg/day) times the human oral daily dose, respectively, and have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. In rats, this multiple of the human dose was embryocidal and retarded fetal growth and development, probably due to adverse maternal effects reflected in reduced weight gains of the dams. This oral dose has also been shown to cause hypotension in rats. However, there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

- **Labor and delivery**: There have been few controlled studies to determine whether the use of verapamil during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, or whether it prolongs the duration of labor or increases the need for forceps delivery or other obstetric intervention. Such adverse experiences have not been reported in the literature, despite a long history of use of intravenous verapamil HCl in Europe for treating cardiac side effects of beta-adrenergic agonist agents used to treat premature labor.

- **Nursing mothers**: Verapamil crosses the placental barrier and can be detected in umbilical vein blood at delivery. Additionally, verapamil is excreted in human milk. Due to the potential for adverse reactions in nursing infants from verapamil, nursing should be discontinued while verapamil is administered.

### Oral antihypertensive regimens (nifedipine retard, labetalol, and methyldopa) for management of severe hypertension in pregnancy: an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^116QKbkV]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension is the most common medical disorder in pregnancy, complicating one in ten pregnancies. Treatment of severely increased blood pressure is widely recommended to reduce the risk of maternal complications. Regimens for the acute treatment of severe hypertension typically include intravenous medications. Although effective, these drugs require venous access and careful fetal monitoring and might not be feasible in busy or low-resource environments. We therefore aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of three oral drugs: labetalol, nifedipine retard, and methyldopa for the management of severe hypertension in pregnancy.

- **Methods**: In this multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we compared these oral antihypertensives in two public hospitals in Nagpur, India. Pregnant women were eligible for the trial if they were aged at least 18 years, pregnant with fetuses that had reached a gestational age of at least 28 weeks, required pharmacological blood pressure control for severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg), and were able to swallow oral medications. Women were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg oral nifedipine, 200 mg oral labetalol (hourly, in both of which the dose could be escalated if hypertension was maintained), or 1000 mg methyldopa (a single dose, without dose escalation). Masking of participants, study investigators, and care providers to group allocation was not possible because of different escalation protocols in the study groups.

### Norpramin [^113FYL8G]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants, including Norpramin, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants.

Safe use of Norpramin during pregnancy and lactation has not been established; therefore, if it is to be given to pregnant patients, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential, the possible benefits must be weighed against the possible hazards to mother and child. Animal reproductive studies have been inconclusive.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of Norpramin did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Lower doses are recommended for elderly patients (see dosage and administration).

	- The ratio of 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine may be increased in the elderly, most likely due to decreased renal elimination with aging. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

### Study protocol: Safety and efficacy of propranolol in newborns with retinopathy of prematurity (PROP-ROP): ISRCTN18523491 [^116GLA52]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The disease pathogenesis of ROP (Retinopathy of Prematurity) is a multifactorial neovascularizing disease that affects premature infants, characterized by perturbation of the normal vascular development of the retina. In the human fetus, retinal blood vessel development begins during the fourth month of gestation, and this process usually occurs in the hypoxic uterine environment. Therefore, in very premature infants, the retina is nearly avascular at birth, and premature birth usually stops the process of retinal vascular development that normally occurs in the hypoxic uterine environment.

The pathogenesis of ROP is hypothesized to consist of two distinct phases. The exposure to extra-uterine relative hyperoxia, amplified by supplemental oxygen delivery, retards or blocks the normal retinal vascular growth (first phase of ROP), decreasing the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) expression and endothelial cell proliferation. The loss of the placenta contributes to the reduced vascularization of the retina due to the reduction of the Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, largely produced by the placenta. Therefore, this first phase of ROP is characterized by cessation of vessel growth and loss of vessels.

The second phase of ROP begins at 32–34 weeks of postmenstrual age and is characterized by hypoxia-induced retinal neovascularization, similar to that observed in other proliferative retinopathies such as diabetic retinopathy or age-related macular degeneration. The shift to this proliferative phase of ROP is usually explained by the imbalance between the poorly developed blood vessels and the increasing metabolic demand of the developing retina.

### Neonatal effects of intrauterine metoprolol/bisoprolol exposure during the second and third trimester: a cohort study with two comparison groups [^117Ki6jo]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Our aim was to evaluate the effects of beta-blockers during the second and third trimester on fetal growth, length of gestation, and postnatal symptoms in exposed infants.

- **Methods**: The prospective observational cohort study compares 294 neonates of hypertensive mothers on metoprolol or bisoprolol during the second and/or third trimester with 225 methyldopa-exposed infants and 588 infants of nonhypertensive mothers. The risks for reduced birth weight, prematurity, neonatal bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory disorders were analyzed.

- **Results**: The rate of small-for-gestational-age children was significantly higher in long-term beta-blocker exposed infants (24.1%) compared with the methyldopa cohort (10.2%, odds ratio [OR]adj 2.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2–5.2) and the nonhypertensive cohort (9.9%, ORadj 4.3, 95% CI 2.6–7.1). The risk for preterm birth was significantly increased compared with nonhypertensive pregnancies (ORadj 2.2, 95% CI 1.3–3.8) but not compared with the methyldopa cohort. Neonatal adverse outcomes occurred more frequently in the study cohort (11.5%) compared with the nonhypertensive comparison group (6.5%) and the methyldopa cohort (8.4%), but without statistical significance (ORadj 1.5, 95% CI 0.7–3.0 and ORadj 1.5, 95% CI 0.7–3.3, respectively).

- **Conclusion**: Long-term intrauterine exposure to metoprolol or bisoprolol may increase the risk of being born small-for-gestational-age. It is still a matter of debate to what extent maternal hypertension contributes to the lower birth weight. Serious neonatal symptoms are rare.

### Maxalt-MLT [^114wqRP8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Dosage adjustment for patients on propranolol**: In adult patients taking propranolol, only the 5-mg dose of rizatriptan benzoate is recommended, up to a maximum of 3 doses in any 24-hour period (15 mg) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

For pediatric patients weighing 40 kg (88 lb) or more and taking propranolol, only a single 5-mg dose of rizatriptan benzoate is recommended, with a maximum dose of 5 mg in a 24-hour period. Rizatriptan benzoate should not be prescribed to propranolol-treated pediatric patients who weigh less than 40 kg (88 lb) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Safety of antihypertensive medications in pregnancy: Living with uncertainty [^113L17Mv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The practitioner is faced with the challenge of prescribing (or continuing) antihypertensive medications, which may be beneficial for the mother but are of unclear benefit for the fetus. The drugs most commonly used — methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine — are widely accepted as safe in pregnancy, based on many years of experience, observational data from large databases, and meta-analyses of multiple small clinical trials.

A recent comprehensive systematic review of published studies addressing adverse outcomes in children with in utero exposure to antihypertensive medications found 47 studies eligible for inclusion, and only 5 were considered of excellent quality. Although several studies reported increased odds of preterm birth, low birth weight, and congenital malformations in treated patients compared with normotensive untreated reference groups, these adverse effects were not uniformly observed in different studies within the same class of medication. Similar adverse events were also observed in untreated hypertensive women.

The conclusions of the authors were that although there is no compelling evidence for the teratogenicity of most antihypertensive agents, the methodological weakness of the evidence prevents definitive answers about the safety of these drugs, even when including studies with hundreds of thousands of participants.

### SPL drug information for atenolol [^112vaaMb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Year). High credibility.

Regarding the use of atenolol IV (also known as Tenormin) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: avoid use. Consider safer alternatives, as there is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for bradycardia and hypoglycemia. Atenolol IV is classified under category C in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Assessment of severity of long QT syndrome phenotype and risk of fetal death [^115PeWaA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Women were receiving β‐blocker (BB) therapy throughout pregnancy in 44 of 64 cases (69%). Sixteen pregnancies occurred while taking metoprolol (36%), 16 while taking atenolol (36%), and fewer while taking bisoprolol (n = 6, 14%), nadolol (n = 5, 11%), and propranolol (n = 1, 2%). The number of women with pregnancies taking BB therapy was not statistically significant between women with pregnancies that resulted in live birth versus fetal death (34 of 51 [67%] versus 10 of 13 [77%], respectively; P = 0.739).

- **Effect on IUGR**: Ten (20%) newborns had intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). All babies with IUGR were exposed during pregnancy to BB therapy: 5 to atenolol, 3 to nadolol, and 2 to metoprolol. Only one of those babies was born preterm (34 weeks) after an urgent cesarean section for fetal distress (1900 g, 6th percentile), whereas the remaining nine were born at term (mean birth weight, 2719 ± 235 g).

- **Effect on birth weight**: Babies born at term to mothers taking BBs had statistically significant lower birth weight than those born to mothers who had not taken BBs during pregnancy (2973 ± 298 g versus 3470 ± 338 g, respectively; P = 0.002). The difference remained statistically significant even after exclusion of the patients treated with atenolol (3040 ± 294 g versus 3470 ± 338 g, P = 0.011). In addition, babies born at term to mothers taking BBs with a QTc > 500 ms had a significantly lower birth weight compared with women taking BBs with a QTc < 500 ms (2783 ± 283 g versus 3084 ± 256 g, P = 0.029).

### Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^113nT9Q8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is common, and antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, thereby improving outcomes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: Relevant trials were identified in the register of trials maintained by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group. Additional searches were conducted in the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. The last search date was October 2000.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy were considered. This condition was defined, whenever possible, as systolic blood pressure of 140–169 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of 90–109 mmHg. Comparisons were made among one or more antihypertensive drugs, placebo, no antihypertensive drugs, or another antihypertensive drug, with treatment planned to continue for at least seven days.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers.

- **Main results**: Overall, this review includes 40 studies involving 3,797 women. Twenty-four studies compared an antihypertensive drug with placebo or no antihypertensive drug (2,815 women). There is a halving in the risk of developing severe hypertension associated with the use of antihypertensive drugs [17 trials, 2,155 women; relative risk (RR) 0.52 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.64); risk difference (RD) -0.09 (-0.12 to -0.06)].

### Hemangeol [^115XFF1k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Plasma concentration of 4-OH-propranolol, the main metabolite, was about 5% of total plasma exposure of propranolol.

- **Sex**: There is no known dependence of pharmacokinetics of propranolol by sex in infants.

- **Race**: There is little information on dependence of pharmacokinetics of propranolol by race in infants. A study conducted in 12 Caucasian and 13 African-American adult male subjects taking propranolol showed that at steady state, the clearance of R(+)- and S(-)-propranolol were about 76% and 53% higher in African-Americans than in Caucasians, respectively. Chinese adult subjects had a greater proportion (18% to 45% higher) of unbound propranolol in plasma compared to Caucasians, which was associated with a lower plasma concentration of alpha1 acid glycoprotein.

- **Drug interaction studies**:
	- **Impact of propranolol on co-administered drugs**: The effect of propranolol on plasma concentration of co-administered drugs.
	- **Impact of co-administered drugs on propranolol**: The effect of co-administered drugs on propranolol plasma concentration.

### In utero beta 2 adrenergic agonist exposure and adverse neurophysiologic and behavioral outcomes [^113QPFZ5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Beta 2 adrenergic receptor overstimulation during critical periods of prenatal development can induce a permanent shift in the balance of sympathetic-to-parasympathetic tone. This is a biologically plausible mechanism whereby beta 2 adrenergic agonists can induce functional and behavioral teratogenesis, which explains their association with increases in autism spectrum disorders, psychiatric disorders, poor cognitive and motor function, school performance, and changes in blood pressure in the offspring.

Use of beta 2 adrenergic agonists should be limited to proven indications when alternate drugs are ineffective or unavailable; the risks of untreated disease to the mother and fetus are greater than the risk of the beta 2 adrenergic agonist.

### Study protocol: Safety and efficacy of propranolol 0.2% eye drops in newborns with a precocious stage of retinopathy of prematurity (DROP-ROP-0.2%): A multicenter, open-label, single arm, phase II trial [^113RPvnn]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

For a long time, an oxygen saturation level lower than 90% has been suggested to reduce ROP risk. However, the recent demonstration that a higher oxygen saturation (91–95%) correlates with improved survival represents an actual dilemma because, unfortunately, it induces a higher risk of ROP development. Apart from oxygen tension, which is the main factor promoting the expression of angiogenic growth factors in proliferative retinopathies, other mechanisms are involved in the vascular response to ischemia/hypoxia. These include the activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, oxidative stress, and the production of nitric oxide. Genetic factors might also affect the risk for ROP, even though no one has been identified thus far. The disease progresses more often in white than black infants and in boys than girls.

- **The role of the β-adrenergic system**: Propranolol is a non-selective β-adrenoreceptor (β-AR) antagonist. For many years, it has been largely used in the pediatric population affected by cardiovascular diseases (i.e. arterial hypertension, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Fallot tetralogy, and arrhythmia), hyperthyroidism (i.e. neonatal thyrotoxicosis), migraine, and portal hypertension with gastroesophageal varices at risk of bleeding. Propranolol is also effective and sufficiently safe in treating infantile hemangioma (IH) in childhood. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recently authorized the use of propranolol for life-threatening IH, at risk of ulceration or permanent deformation. The working mechanisms of propranolol in reducing proliferative IH are yet to be fully elucidated.

### Exposure to medication for neurological disease in pregnancy - time to consider the long-term implications [^114sCRLx]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

Where migraine continues to significantly impact quality of life despite adequate acute treatments, prophylactic medication is often considered. A range of treatments is used, each with differing risk profiles in pregnancy. Women established on migraine prophylaxis who are considering pregnancy face a choice regarding treatment continuation. Unlike conditions such as MS, where stopping treatment in pregnancy may risk long-term disability for the mother, cessation of prophylactic medication in migraine does not have the same long-term risks. Thus, exposure to migraine prophylaxis is less common during pregnancy compared to drug exposure in other neurological diseases discussed in this review. However, in some cases, the impact of migraine on quality of life is so significant that treatment continuation is considered.

- **Oral prophylactic treatments for migraine**: Pizotifen is commonly prescribed as a migraine prophylactic. A case series of children exposed to pizotifen in utero found a congenital malformation rate of < 5%, not significantly different from the background rate. No published data reports longer-term outcomes at the time of writing. Amitriptyline is also commonly used and has a well-described safety profile but is limited in terms of its longer-term follow-up data. In utero exposure to tricyclic antidepressants has not been shown to negatively impact cognition, linguistic development, or behavior in preschool and early age school children.

- **Additional treatment considerations**: Aside from its use as a treatment for maternal hypertension and dysrhythmias, propranolol is often recommended for migraine prophylaxis during pregnancy.

### Oral antihypertensive regimens (nifedipine retard, labetalol, and methyldopa) for management of severe hypertension in pregnancy: An open-label, randomised controlled trial [^117DDZLA]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Hypertension is the most common medical disorder in pregnancy, complicating one in ten pregnancies. Treatment of severely increased blood pressure is widely recommended to reduce the risk of maternal complications. Regimens for the acute treatment of severe hypertension typically include intravenous medications. Although effective, these drugs require venous access and careful fetal monitoring and might not be feasible in busy or low-resource environments. Therefore, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of three oral drugs: labetalol, nifedipine retard, and methyldopa for the management of severe hypertension in pregnancy.

In this multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial, we compared these oral antihypertensives in two public hospitals in Nagpur, India. Pregnant women were eligible for the trial if they met the following criteria:

- **Inclusion criteria**:
	- Aged at least 18 years.
	- Pregnant with fetuses that had reached a gestational age of at least 28 weeks.
	- Required pharmacological blood pressure control for severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg).
	- Ability to swallow oral medications.

Women were randomly assigned to receive:

- **Intervention groups**:
	- 10 mg oral nifedipine with the option for dose escalation if hypertension persisted.
	- 200 mg oral labetalol, also with potential dose escalation if required.
	- 1000 mg methyldopa as a single dose without dose escalation.

Masking of participants, study investigators, and care providers to group allocation was not possible due to different escalation protocols in the study groups.

### Propranolol therapy for hemangiomas in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome may produce intolerable side effects [^1171Yecs]. Pediatric dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

We report three infants with infantile hemangioma who experienced severe agitation and diarrhea following propranolol administration. Propranolol, a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor blocker, is the first-line treatment for infantile hemangiomas. All three infants were exposed to opioids in utero and experienced neonatal abstinence syndrome at birth. We hypothesize that chronic opioid exposure in utero may cause protracted upregulation of β2-adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system, resulting in increased susceptibility to adverse reactions to propranolol.

### An update on maternal medication-related embryopathies [^1156Pvv9]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

There is a general perception that any exposure to medication during pregnancy poses a potential risk to the fetus. Most available data about teratogenic drugs is derived from animal studies, case reports, or cohort studies. As a result, counseling women and their partners about the safety of drugs during pregnancy can be difficult due to limited information about efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and teratogenicity of some drugs. However, this should always be done in the context of weighing up potential teratogenic risks with the perinatal risks of an untreated medical or psychiatric condition.

Ideally, this counseling should occur prior to a planned pregnancy so that medications and treatment of chronic medical conditions can be optimized. It is important that clinicians providing antenatal care are able to confidently manage women including utilizing appropriate resources. This paper aims at reviewing a selected (non-exhaustive) list of the most commonly prescribed medications considered significant human teratogens and provides recommendations for pre-conception and antenatal counseling.

### Safety of antihypertensive medications in pregnancy: Living with uncertainty [^112sDUXY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The study by Mito et al. is small — a weakness acknowledged by the authors; however, its importance is that it adds incrementally to the evidence regarding the safety of amlodipine. In addition, it confirms previous reports of comparable rates of malformations associated with both treated and untreated hypertension, which are slightly higher than the baseline of 1% to 3% in women without exposure to hypertension, with or without medication use. In their retrospective cohort, the authors leveraged information obtained from electronic medical records and excluded patients who did not meet established guidelines criteria for chronic (preexisting) hypertension. There was a higher prevalence of fetal growth restriction in a prior pregnancy in women who were exposed to amlodipine compared with other antihypertensive therapies or no therapy (10/48 versus 5/54 or 7/129); however, no evidence showed lower birth weight in the index pregnancy. The rates of preeclampsia were similar across treatment groups (17/60 with amlodipine versus 14/57 with other medications versus 43/129 without medication). As reported previously, preeclampsia was common in pregnancies complicated by fetal malformations (5/11).

Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been used to treat hypertension in pregnancy for approximately 30 years, with most of the published literature and guidelines focusing on extended-release nifedipine (nifedipine XL). The experience with nifedipine has been favorable; although not licensed specifically for pregnancy, most guidelines recommend it along with labetalol and methyldopa for pregnant women with hypertension.

### Anesthetic management for cesarean section in two parturient with ascending aortic aneurysm: a case-based discussion [^113Zp9nE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Low credibility.

In both of our cases, management during pregnancy focused on the reduction of arterial pressure and control of heart rate with the use of a beta-blocker, while anesthesia for cesarean section aimed to mitigate the neuroendocrine response to intubation, thus maintaining hemodynamic stability and minimizing the risks of aortic aneurysm rupture or dissection.

Beta-blockers have been shown to successfully control blood pressure and heart rate and slow the progression of aortic root enlargement. However, not all beta-blockers are safe for use during pregnancy. For instance, atenolol has been associated with fetal malformations and hypospadias when used during the first trimester, whereas metoprolol, propranolol, and bisoprolol are deemed safe for use during pregnancy, although regular fetal growth monitoring is recommended.

The management of pregnant patients with aortic aneurysm is probably best conducted through a multidisciplinary approach at a tertiary center, involving an obstetrician, cardiologist, anesthesiologist, and preferably a medical geneticist. Close monitoring, strict blood pressure control, and regular heart ultrasound examinations to evaluate the aortic root diameter every 4–8 weeks are crucial. Echocardiography is considered to be a safe method, so both of our patients had monthly cardiac evaluations that included cardiac ultrasound examination in addition to regular obstetric checkups.

On the other hand, CT angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing acute aortic dissection, with the benefits of an accurate diagnosis outweighing the risks of radiation exposure.

### Propranolol treatment for hemangioma of infancy: Risks and recommendations [^116x4vrj]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Hemangioma of infancy is a condition that may be associated with significant morbidity. While evidence most supports the use of corticosteroids, there is no well-defined or Federal Drug Administration (FDA)-approved systemic therapy for hemangioma of infancy. All currently used treatments have significant risks. Dramatic improvement of complicated hemangioma of infancy with propranolol was recently reported, but details for initiating therapy, monitoring, and potential risks were not included. We present two infants treated with propranolol who suffered complications and propose a treatment protocol to minimize potential adverse events.

### A pilot study to compare propranolol and misoprostol versus misoprostol and placebo for induction of labor in primigravidae; a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial [^112PSWxd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

The induction of labor is the most common obstetric procedure in daily practice. Introducing propranolol as a new drug to augment the action of prostaglandins could aid in the induction process and potentially decrease cesarean section (CS) rates. Several researchers have explored the use of propranolol in labor augmentation.

- **Aim**: This pilot study compares propranolol and misoprostol versus misoprostol alone for labor induction in primigravidae.

- **Methods**: This is a randomized clinical trial, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, conducted at Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital. The study included 128 pregnant, full-term primigravid women who were candidates for labor induction, randomized into two groups. All candidates underwent labor induction with 25 µg of vaginal misoprostol. Group I received 20 mg of oral propranolol tablets, while Group II received sugary pills as a placebo. Candidates who responded successfully to induction were assessed for possible augmentation of labor by amniotomy or oxytocin infusion. The primary outcome was the induction-to-delivery interval, while the secondary outcomes included the duration of the latent phase, mode of delivery, and APGAR score of the neonate.

- **Results**: The induction-delivery time was significantly shorter in the group receiving misoprostol and propranolol (11.8 ± 8.1 h vs. 12.6 ± 8.9 h, P value = 0.027) as well as the duration of the latent phase of labor (7.9 ± 5.6 h vs. 9.2 ± 6.03 h, P value = 0.017) compared to the group receiving misoprostol and placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between both groups in terms of mode of delivery and indications for cesarean section.

### Drug treatment of hypertension in pregnancy: A critical review of adult guideline recommendations [^116T597X]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

This review evaluates the guideline recommendations for the management of hypertension in pregnancy as presented by 25 national and international guidelines developed for the management of arterial hypertension in adults. There is a general consensus that oral α-methyldopa and parenteral labetalol are the drugs of choice for nonsevere and severe hypertension in pregnancy, respectively. Long-acting nifedipine is recommended by various guidelines as an alternative for first-line and second-line therapy in nonsevere and severe hypertension.

The safety of β-blockers, atenolol in particular, in early and late stages of pregnancy is unresolved; their use is contraindicated according to several guidelines. Diuretic-associated harmful effects on maternal and fetal outcomes are controversial, and their use is discouraged in pregnancy. It is important to develop specific guidelines for treating hypertension in special groups such as adult females of childbearing age and sexually active female adolescents to minimize the risk of adverse effects of drugs on the fetus.

In several guidelines, the antihypertensive classes, recommended drug(s), intended drug formulation, and route of administration are not explicit. These omissions should be addressed in future guideline revisions to enhance the guidelines' utility and credibility in clinical practice.

### SPL drug information for dorzolamide hydrochloride / timolol maleate [^114n3KKf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of dorzolamide/timolol OPHTH (also known as Cosopt, Cosopt PF) during all trimesters of pregnancy, it should be used only if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm has been observed in animal studies. The drug dorzolamide/timolol OPHTH is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This classification indicates that the drug, due to its pharmacological effects, may cause harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate without causing malformations. Importantly, these effects may be reversible.

### Exposing fetal drug exposure [^114EwTzs]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Pregnancy neither protects women from susceptibility to illness nor generally decreases drug dosage requirements of preexisting pharmacotherapy. Thus, a major concern of drug use during pregnancy is maintenance of maternal health while minimizing fetal drug exposure. An important assumption in reproductive medicine is that fetal exposure to any medication can present risks in pregnancy — because not all risks are known, as little exposure as possible is desirable.

### SPL drug information for propranolol hydrochloride ER [^112rJUQM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of propranolol hydrochloride ER PO (also known as Inderal XL, Inderal LA) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. It is important to monitor for fetal bradycardia, and neonates should be observed for hypoglycemia and respiratory depression. Patients managed for hypertension may continue treatment during pregnancy unless contraindications exist. Propranolol can be used for maternal arrhythmias in pregnancy, and it is acceptable for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy. The drug propranolol hydrochloride ER PO is classified under category C in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, due to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Atenolol and chlorthalidone [^111jX9g9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Atenolol can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman as it crosses the placental barrier and appears in cord blood. Administration during the second trimester is associated with infants being small for gestational age. No studies have been conducted on the first-trimester use; hence, the possibility of fetal injury cannot be excluded. If used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while on this drug, they should be informed of the potential risk to the fetus.

Neonates born to mothers receiving atenolol at parturition or breastfeeding may risk hypoglycemia and bradycardia. Caution is advised when administering atenolol and chlorthalidone during pregnancy or to breastfeeding women (see Precautions, Nursing Mothers).

A study on rats showed no embryofetotoxicity with atenolol/chlorthalidone doses of 8/2 mg/kg/day, 80/20 mg/kg/day, and 240/60 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, two studies were conducted: the first involved doses of 8/2 mg/kg/day, 80/20 mg/kg/day, and 160/40 mg/kg/day, with no teratogenic effects, though embryonic resorptions were noted at all dose levels (ranging from approximately 5 times to 100 times the maximum recommended human dose).

### Adempas [^1164uxWp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Instruct patients on the risk of fetal harm when Adempas is used during pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Instruct females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception and to contact their healthcare provider immediately if they suspect they may be pregnant. Female patients must enroll in the Adempas REMS Program.

- **Adempas REMS Program**: For female patients, Adempas is available only through a restricted program called the Adempas REMS Program [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Male patients are not enrolled in the Adempas REMS Program. Inform female patients (and their guardians, if applicable) of the following important requirements:
	- All female patients must sign an enrollment form.
	- Advise female patients of reproductive potential that they must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
	- Educate and counsel females of reproductive potential on the use of emergency contraception in the event of unprotected sex or contraceptive failure.
	- Advise pre-pubertal females to report any changes in their reproductive status immediately to their prescriber.
	- Review the Medication Guide and REMS educational materials with female patients.

- **Lactation**: Advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with Adempas [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2)].

- **Other risks associated with Adempas**: Inform patients of the contraindications.

### Safety of antihypertensive medications in pregnancy: Living with uncertainty [^111ynjK2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Hypertension is one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy. Clinical management is challenging; strategies that are standard of care in nonpregnant individuals, such as lowering blood pressure (BP) to 120/80 mm Hg, may be beneficial for maternal health but must be considered carefully in the context of possible teratogenicity of medications if taken in early pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, the impact of drugs on blood flow and placental perfusion must be addressed. Even if medications are not teratogenic, less easily detected effects on placental and fetal growth and metabolism are important.

- **Severe hypertension**: Regardless of etiology, severe hypertension — defined as 160/110 mm Hg — is associated with serious maternal morbidity and mortality, and treatment with antihypertensive drugs is almost always indicated.

- **Mild to moderate hypertension**: What remains unclear, although currently under investigation, is whether the treatment is worse than the disease in pregnancies complicated by "mild to moderate" hypertension (140–159/90–109 mm Hg). Lowering BP in women with less severe, so‐called mild to moderate hypertension is not routine practice in the United States, although it may be appropriate in some women with chronic hypertension, depending on maternal symptoms, acuity of the BP increase, comorbidities, and gestational age. At present, some evidence suggests that antihypertensive treatment in women with mild to moderate chronic or gestational hypertension may prevent the development of severe hypertension, and retrospective data suggest that lower BP is associated with better pregnancy outcomes.

### Levophed [^112GN1Yu]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy risk summary**: Limited published data consisting of a small number of case reports and multiple small trials involving the use of norepinephrine in pregnant women at the time of delivery have not identified an increased risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus from hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which are medical emergencies in pregnancy and can be fatal if left untreated. In animal reproduction studies, using high doses of intravenous norepinephrine resulted in lowered maternal placental blood flow. The clinical relevance to changes in the human fetus is unknown since the average maintenance dose is ten times lower. Increased fetal reabsorptions were observed in pregnant hamsters after receiving daily injections at approximately two times the maximum recommended dose on a mg/m³ basis for four days during organogenesis.

The estimated background risk for major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations - Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk**: Hypotension associated with septic shock, myocardial infarction, and stroke are medical emergencies in pregnancy, which can be fatal if not addressed promptly.

### Safety of medication use during pregnancy in mainland China: Based on a national health insurance database in 2015 [^112xfvXh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

Medication safety during pregnancy has drawn global attention, with little reported about the Chinese population. This study aims to describe patterns and risks of medication use among pregnant women in mainland China with reference to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pregnancy risk category.

- **Methods**: Hospital diagnostic and drug dispensing information from a national representative sample of basic medical insurance (BMI) beneficiaries was obtained from the China Health Insurance Association (CHIRA) database in 2015. The prevalence of use and the number of medicines involved in each risk category were calculated. The most commonly used medicines from each risk category were illustrated. Factors associated with the use of category D/X medicines were evaluated through multiple logistic regression.

- **Results**: Out of 11,373 women who had singleton deliveries in 2015, there were 2,896 women with records covering their entire pregnancies, 5,377 with records through the 2nd trimester, and 7,946 with records through the 3rd trimester. It was found that 11.1% of pregnant women used at least one medication, and a total of 321 medications had been used during pregnancy. Most pregnant women used medicines classified as FDA category C (66.2%), followed by category B (57.8%), category A (16.8%), category X (7.5%), and category D (5.0%). The most commonly used medicines from categories D and X were anxiolytics and hormonal preparations, respectively. Women from the mid-western area (p = 0.045) or those who used four or more medications (p < 0.001) were more likely to use category D/X medications.

### Hypertension Canada's 2020 comprehensive guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment of hypertension in adults and children [^11446Jt6]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the use of metoprolol tartrate PO (also known as Lopressor) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, consider safer alternatives and use only if clearly needed. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals, and it is essential to monitor neonates for hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression. The Hypertension Canada guidelines recommend metoprolol as one of the initial monotherapy choices for nonsevere hypertension during pregnancy. The drug metoprolol tartrate PO (also known as Lopressor) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Antihypertensive drug therapy for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy [^117G1vkA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy is common. Antihypertensive drugs are often used in the belief that lowering blood pressure will prevent progression to more severe disease, thereby improving outcomes.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antihypertensive drug treatments for women with mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2005), LILACS (1984 to November 2005), and EMBASE (1974 to November 2005).

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized trials evaluating any antihypertensive drug treatment for mild to moderate hypertension during pregnancy were included, defined, whenever possible, as systolic blood pressure 140 to 169 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 90 to 109 mmHg. Comparisons were of one or more antihypertensive drugs with placebo, with no antihypertensive drug, or with another antihypertensive drug, where treatment was planned to continue for at least seven days.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently extracted data.

- **Main results**: Forty-six trials (4282 women) were included. Twenty-eight trials compared an antihypertensive drug with placebo/no antihypertensive drug (3200 women). There is a halving in the risk of developing severe hypertension associated with the use of antihypertensive drugs (19 trials, 2409 women; relative risk (RR) 0.50; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.61).
