Cigarettes and clozapine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how cigarette smoking interacts with clozapine pharmacokinetics and what to do about it in practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacokinetic mechanism and the magnitude of effect. Then, I should verify the clinical consequences of smoking cessation or reduction. Next, I will review the time course of CYP1A2 normalization after quitting. After that, I need to check dose-adjustment strategies and monitoring thresholds. I will then consider special populations and modifiers such as sex, ancestry, and genetics. Finally, I should integrate this into a practical, safety-focused algorithm and confirm that my recommendations align with guidelines and labeling before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism and magnitude of effect. Tobacco smoke contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and induce hepatic CYP1A2, the principal enzyme metabolizing clozapine to norclozapine; smokers typically have 30–50% lower clozapine concentrations at a given dose compared with nonsmokers, necessitating higher doses to reach therapeutic levels [^114gi7m4] [^114rd1u1] [^116yK9GL]. Wait, let me verify the directionality so I don't misstate it: induction lowers clozapine exposure, so smokers need more drug to achieve the same trough, which is consistent across multiple cohorts and TDM datasets [^114rd1u1] [^116fNi6s].

> Hold on, I should verify the clinical consequences of changing smoking status. When a smoker on a stable clozapine dose reduces or stops smoking, CYP1A2 activity falls and clozapine levels can rise by roughly 30–40% or more, risking dose-related toxicity such as sedation, hypersalivation, seizures, and cardiovascular adverse effects; case reports and series document toxicity mimicking end-of-life decline or seizures after smoking cessation, underscoring the need for anticipatory dose reduction and monitoring [^116TkgzW] [^116EHKc7]. I need to ensure I'm not overstating the magnitude; the 30–40% estimate is conservative and supported by pharmacokinetic reviews and case-based literature, with some reports showing larger increases depending on baseline induction and dose [^116TkgzW] [^114rd1u1].

> Next, I should review the time course of CYP1A2 recovery after smoking cessation. Let me check the paraxanthine/caffeine phenotyping data: within about 1–2 weeks of quitting, CYP1A2 activity declines with an apparent half-life around 39 hours, approaching a new steady state by days 10–13. Clinically, this argues for preemptive dose reduction rather than waiting for toxicity to emerge [^115jkMQG]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the half-life was closer to 48–72 hours; the fitted estimate is 38.6 hours, so I should correct that and plan dose changes within the first week when feasible, with close monitoring thereafter [^115jkMQG].

> I will now examine practical dose-adjustment strategies. A pragmatic approach is to reduce the total daily clozapine dose by about 30–40% over the first week after smoking cessation, aligning with the expected increase in exposure, and to use therapeutic drug monitoring to titrate to a trough of roughly 350–600 ng/mL while watching for adverse effects. This range balances efficacy and dose-related toxicity, though individual targets may vary with clinical response and tolerability [^116TkgzW] [^111zyuuL]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with authoritative guidance. The VA/DoD guideline explicitly notes that smoking cessation increases clozapine levels and supports using plasma levels to guide dosing, which reinforces the TDM-first strategy here [^115wTcVB].

> Let me consider the reverse scenario, because discharge planning is a common pitfall. If a patient starts or resumes smoking after being dose-adjusted in a smoke-free inpatient setting, clozapine levels can fall below the therapeutic window and precipitate relapse. Care plans should specify smoking status monitoring and dose re-adjustment contingencies, yet audits show this is frequently omitted, placing patients at risk of subtherapeutic exposure after discharge [^114rd1u1] [^113swKzj]. I should double-check that my plan includes explicit documentation of smoking status and a protocol for post-discharge TDM when smoking status changes, which is a recognized quality gap in practice [^114rd1u1] [^113swKzj].

> Next, I should review patient-specific modifiers that shift baseline clearance and thus the magnitude of change with smoking cessation. Female sex and estrogen exposure tend to inhibit CYP1A2, lowering dose requirements, whereas male sex and smoking increase clearance. Asian ancestry generally has lower CYP1A2 activity and thus lower dose needs, while some Black patients may require higher doses. Genetic variants near CYP1A1/CYP1A2 and in NFIB can reduce clozapine exposure substantially, and CYP1A2*1F inducibility further augments smoking-related induction [^1115EhP5] [^111zyuuL] [^113G32uw] [^117Nzsir]. Wait, let me verify the clinical implication: a male smoker with inducible CYP1A2 genotype may have very high dose requirements, and conversely, a female nonsmoker of Asian ancestry may need markedly lower doses. These factors should be integrated with smoking status when anticipating post-cessation dose changes [^1115EhP5] [^113G32uw].

> I need to ensure I account for other CYP1A2 modulators that can confound interpretation. Fluvoxamine is a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor and can raise clozapine levels severalfold, sometimes overriding smoking induction; caffeine also inhibits CYP1A2 at high intake, and acute inflammation or infection can downregulate CYP1A2 and increase clozapine concentrations, so CRP and clinical status should be checked when levels unexpectedly rise [^111LoGd6] [^1169PnSW] [^116mcXpX]. Hold on, I should verify that recent dose changes or intercurrent illness are documented whenever interpreting a new level, because phenoconversion from inflammation or new inhibitors is common and clinically consequential [^116mcXpX] [^1169PnSW].

> Let me synthesize a practical, safety-focused algorithm and double-check it against guidelines. Before any smoking change, obtain a baseline clozapine trough and document smoking status, CYP1A2-interacting co-medications, caffeine intake, and inflammatory symptoms. If the patient will stop smoking, reduce the dose by about 30–40% within the first week and recheck a trough in 3–7 days, titrating to 350–600 ng/mL while monitoring for sedation, hypersalivation, tachycardia, orthostasis, myoclonus, and seizures. If smoking resumes, anticipate a fall in levels and be prepared to increase toward the pre-cessation dose with TDM confirmation. Throughout, coordinate inpatient smoke-free policies with outpatient relapse prevention and document smoking status at every visit [^116TkgzW] [^111zyuuL] [^115wTcVB] [^114rd1u1]. I should confirm that this approach aligns with labeling and expert guidance; the FDA labeling acknowledges tobacco as a CYP1A2 inducer and advises dose reduction when inducers are discontinued, and the VA/DoD guideline supports TDM to navigate these transitions safely [^114gi7m4] [^115wTcVB].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot or will not reduce smoking? I need to ensure we do not inadvertently underdose smokers who continue to smoke. Smokers often require higher maintenance doses to achieve therapeutic troughs, and failure to account for this can lead to apparent treatment resistance; TDM helps distinguish pharmacokinetic underexposure from true nonresponse, and in select cases of ultra-rapid metabolism with smoking, doses above 900 mg/day may be necessary with careful monitoring, though this is uncommon and should be individualized [^114rd1u1] [^117Py8wZ] [^117Ms3ap]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not missing a safer alternative such as adding fluvoxamine to intentionally raise levels when ultra-rapid metabolism is confirmed, but that strategy carries its own risks and requires expert oversight and frequent TDM [^111LoGd6].

> Finally, I should confirm that my recommendations are consistent with broader safety and monitoring principles for clozapine. Beyond smoking-related adjustments, maintain routine hematologic monitoring per REMS, watch for constipation and anticholinergic toxicity, and consider CRP during early titration or when intercurrent illness is suspected, as inflammation can acutely alter clearance and increase toxicity risk. These layers of monitoring complement TDM and smoking-status surveillance to keep patients safe during transitions [^115wTcVB] [^1115a9RY] [^111zyuuL]. I need to ensure the care plan explicitly links smoking status changes to automatic TDM triggers and prescriber notification, closing the loop on this high-risk interaction [^114rd1u1] [^113swKzj].

Cigarette smoking **induces CYP1A2** [^114gi7m4], which increases clozapine metabolism and lowers plasma levels by about 30–50% [^114rd1u1] [^116yK9GL]. Smokers often need **higher clozapine doses** to reach therapeutic levels, but smoking cessation or reduction can cause rapid clozapine accumulation and toxicity [^116TkgzW] [^116EHKc7]. Clinicians should **monitor clozapine levels** [^115wTcVB] and adjust the dose when smoking status changes, and use therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dosing [^114rd1u1] [^111zyuuL].

## Pharmacokinetic interaction between cigarette smoking and clozapine

- **CYP1A2 induction**: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in tobacco smoke induce CYP1A2 [^1169PnSW], the main enzyme metabolizing clozapine, increasing clearance and lowering plasma concentrations [^114rd1u1].

- **Magnitude of effect**: Smokers typically have 30–50% lower clozapine levels than nonsmokers at the same dose [^114rd1u1] [^116yK9GL].

- **Dose requirements**: Smokers often need higher doses to achieve therapeutic levels (e.g. 525 mg/day vs 325 mg/day in males) [^114rd1u1].

---

## Clinical implications of smoking cessation or reduction

When smoking stops or decreases, **CYP1A2 activity declines** [^115jkMQG], reducing clozapine clearance and increasing plasma levels, which can precipitate toxicity [^116TkgzW]. Toxicity may present as sedation, hypersalivation, seizures, and cardiovascular effects [^111zyuuL] [^117ViC4u]. Case reports describe toxicity after smoking reduction or cessation, sometimes mimicking end-of-life decline [^116EHKc7].

---

## Clinical management strategies

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess smoking status and monitor clozapine plasma levels, especially after smoking changes [^115wTcVB] [^114rd1u1].

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce clozapine dose by about 30–40% when smoking stops or decreases to prevent toxicity [^116TkgzW] [^115jkMQG].

- **Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)**: Use TDM to maintain levels within the therapeutic range (350–600 ng/mL) [^111zyuuL] [^1138wDTi].

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about the risks of smoking changes and the need for close monitoring [^115wTcVB].

## Summary of clinical recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|
| Smoking cessation or reduction | - Reduce clozapine dose by 30–40% <br/> - Monitor plasma levels [^116TkgzW] [^115jkMQG] |
| Smoking initiation or increase | - Consider dose increase <br/> - Monitor plasma levels [^114rd1u1] |
| Stable smoking status | - Routine monitoring of plasma levels <br/> - Adjust dose as needed [^111zyuuL] |

Cigarette smoking **significantly reduces clozapine exposure** via CYP1A2 induction [^114gi7m4]; changes in smoking can cause rapid shifts in clozapine levels, so clinicians should monitor levels and adjust dosing to maintain efficacy and safety [^115wTcVB].

### Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by clozapine induces preadipocyte differentiation and contributes to endothelial dysfunction [^115K3fa4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Activation of AhR has been associated with increased incidence of hypertension. For example, coke oven workers are exposed to high concentrations of PAH which leads to hypertension and abnormal electrocardiography. In young cigarette smokers impaired flow-mediated dilation was associated with increased serum PAH levels resulting in increased AhR activity. However, activation of the AhR with subsequent induction of antioxidative defense mechanisms reduced heart failure in hypertensive rats.

In patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, short-term treatment (3 days) with clozapine induced transient hypotension, most likely due to direct α1 adrenergic receptor antagonism. During 8 weeks of clozapine treatment, heart rate increased and blood pressure shifted toward hypertension. Although there is no evidence from clinical studies, one might speculate that hypertension in response to long-term clozapine treatment might be linked to AhR signaling. Here we present evidence that clozapine activates the AhR pathway. Reduced vasodilatation and increased adipogenesis under clozapine point to physiological effects of AhR activation in mice and humans.

Our findings may help to elucidate some of the actions of clozapine that have not been commonly recognized so far. On one side, a possible concern for psychiatrists and their patients is whether AhR activation is involved in the side effects of clozapine treatment like agranulocytosis, hypertension, or weight gain. Since exposure to environmental PAHs can cause insulin resistance, abdominal obesity and leukopenia, too, one might attribute the adverse effects of clozapine — probably in synergy with other AhR ligands — to AhR activation. On the other side, AhR activation is involved in a number of detoxifying and cytoprotective pathways that enhance antioxidative defense mechanisms. Since oxidative stress is higher in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, beneficial effects of clozapine treatment might also result from AhR signaling.

Finally, further studies should investigate clozapine's effects beyond the vasculature and adipogenesis, for example, its effects on the brain via AhR signaling. The AhR is expressed in neuronal progenitor cells in the hippocampus. In AhR -/- mice, brain aging and loss of the white matter integrity was more pronounced than in age-matched wild-type mice, thereby implicating protective effects of AhR signaling in the brain. Likewise, neuroprotective activities of clozapine as shown in the Tg-APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease might also be related to increased AhR signaling.

### Deciphering genetic causes for sex differences in human health through drug metabolism and transporter genes [^114J1xNV]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Lastly, we evaluated sex differences in the expression of DMET genes. We identified 20 DMET genes with significant sex-differentiated expression. We further confirmed the sex differences in the protein abundance of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in HLMs. Because CYP1A2 expression is highly inducible by smoking, we carefully designed our protein quantification experiments to include the same percentage of smokers in each separate male and female donor pool. To further explore the clinical impact of our findings, we extensively examined published literature of sex differences in CYP1A2 metabolized drugs. Of 519 articles, we found 49 drugs with previously reported sex differences in the PK profile, efficacy or toxicity. Among them, clozapine and olanzapine showed a consistent higher rate of adverse events in males. We investigated whether this observation could be due to sex differences in metabolizing clozapine and found that a higher level of the active metabolite, N-desmethylclozapine, was detected in male-pooled HLMs, suggesting that male HLMs have higher CYP1A2 abundance. Both clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine are considered efficacious in treating schizophrenia and inducing side effects. However, N-desmethylclozapine has a longer half-life than clozapine. We proposed that a higher abundance of CYP1A2 in males leads to the accumulation of N-desmethylclozapine, which consequently increases the likelihood of drug side effects. These results suggest that sex differences in DMET gene expression could affect the drug response.

### Effects of clozapine treatment on the improvement of substance use disorders other than nicotine in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117CcCvS]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Risk-of-bias assessment

An assessment of comparative study quality was conducted independently by the two reviewers (RR and MD). We used Downs and Black instrument for RCTs, which contains 27 items for randomized and non-randomized comparative studies, providing a total score of 28 for each study. Quality levels are reported as excellent (26–28); good (20–25); fair (15–19); and poor (≤ 14). For cohort studies, we used the Quality of Cohort Studies (Q-Coh), which is a tool used to assess methodology and identify studies that would be a source of bias in the meta-analysis. It is divided into the following domains — representativeness, comparability of groups, quality of exposure measures, maintenance of comparability, quality of outcome measures, and attrition. For each domain, a positive or a negative inference is made. Three categories — good (none or one domain was assessed negatively), adequate (two domains were judged negatively), or low (more than two domains were judged negatively) — are used to summarize an overall quality assessment. Discussion was used to resolve any disagreements among reviewers until an agreement was reached.

Data analysis

For SUD outcomes with three or more comparative studies with available raw data meta-analysis was performed. Data were analyzed using the Cochrane Review Manager, RevMan 5. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated using a random-effects model for dichotomous data that applied the Mantel–Haenszel method. Heterogeneity in effect sizes between studies was tested using the chi-square statistic (with p < 0.10 indicating significant heterogeneity), and its magnitude was quantified using the I-squared statistic, which is an index that describes the proportion of the total variation in the study effect size estimates that is due to heterogeneity and is independent of the number of studies included in the meta-analysis and the metric of the effect size. SUD outcomes not meeting criteria for meta-analysis were described qualitatively.

### Cytisinicline for smoking cessation: the ORCA phase 3 replication randomized clinical trial [^115HQp3N]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The study ORCA-3 (cytisinicline for 6 weeks) was published by Nancy A Rigotti and colleagues in 2025 in the journal JAMA Intern Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Tobacco use. In the ORCA-3 (cytisinicline for 6 weeks) study, the trial question was: what is the role of cytisinicline in adults who smoked cigarettes daily and wanted to quit? In the ORCA-3 (cytisinicline for 6 weeks) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ORCA-3 (cytisinicline for 6 weeks) study, the population was: 528 patients (288 female, 240 male). The inclusion criteria were adults who smoked ≥ 10 cigarettes daily and wanted to quit. The key exclusion criteria were previous cytisinicline treatment; receipt of bupropion, varenicline, nortriptyline, or any nicotine replacement product in the past 4 weeks or planned to use these medications during the study; history of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, cerebrovascular incident, or hospitalization for congestive HF in the past 3 months; current uncontrolled hypertension; hepatic or kidney impairment; moderate-to-severe depression symptoms; current psychosis, suicidal ideation, or suicide risk; positive urinary screen for illicit drugs. In the ORCA-3 (cytisinicline for 6 weeks) study, the interventions were: n = 263 cytisinicline (3 mg TID for 6 weeks, then placebo TID for 6 weeks plus behavioral support) n = 265 placebo (matching placebo TID for 12 weeks plus behavioral support). In the ORCA-3 (cytisinicline for 6 weeks) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in the rate of biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence during weeks 3 to 6 (14.8% vs. 6%; OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 5.6). In the ORCA-3 (cytisinicline for 6 weeks) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the rate of biochemically verified continuous abstinence rates for weeks 3 to 24 (6.8% vs. 1.1%; OR 6.3, 95% CI 1.9 to 34.6) Significant increase in reduction in mean serum cotinine levels in participants who did not quit at week 6 (150.21 ng/mL vs. 38.26 ng/mL; MD 111.95, 95% CI 45.52 to 178.38). In the ORCA-3 (cytisinicline for 6 weeks) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in treatment-emergent adverse events. In the ORCA-3 (cytisinicline for 6 weeks) study, the conclusion was: in adults who smoked ≥ 10 cigarettes daily and wanted to quit, cytisinicline was superior to placebo with respect to the rate of biochemically verified continuous smoking abstinence during weeks 3 to 6.

### Identification of a novel polymorphism associated with reduced clozapine concentration in schizophrenia patients-a genome-wide association study adjusting for smoking habits [^116sqzFN]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
The impact of NFIB rs28379954 minor C allele carriers on clozapine and N -desmethylclozapine concentration, as well as clozapine-to- N -desmethylclozapine ratio, in relation to smoking habits.

a The figure shows all serum concentration measurements (dots) versus clozapine prescribed daily dose. The regression lines for the various subpopulations are calculated using a linear mixed model analyses without any covariates (blue, nonsmoking rs28379954 TT carriers; golden, smoking TT carriers; green, nonsmoking CT carriers; red, smoking CT carriers). The figures show the impact of rs28379954 minor C allele carriers on dose-adjusted serum concentration of clozapine (C/D ratio; b), N -desmethylclozapine (C/D ratio; c) and clozapine-to- N -desmethylclozapine ratio (d) in relation to smoking habits. The ratios were analyzed by linear mixed model including sex, age, and sampling time (time between last dose and blood sampling) as covariates. The numbers of patients within each subpopulation are shown in the various bars.

### Meta-analyses of clozapine, norclozapine levels and their ratio across three genome wide association studies [^112KhNZk]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) found associations between clozapine serum levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in intragenic region between cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and CYP1A2 and nuclear factor 1B (NFIB). The aim of this study was to perform another GWAS of polymorphisms associated with the serum levels of clozapine and norclozapine, their ratios, and to perform meta-analyses with two previous GWAS. Finnish clozapine patients (n = 170) with known smoking habits were genotyped. GWAS was performed with clozapine concentration/dose ratio (C/D), norclozapine C/D and clozapine/norclozapine-ratio as phenotypes, adjusting for age, sex and first four genetic principal components, and additionally for smoking and valproate use. The two other patient populations were from the British CLOZUK2 study (n = 2989) and Norwegian Diakonhjemmet Hospital study (n = 484). In the three population (n = 3643) meta-analyses the top SNP associated with the clozapine C/D ratio was rs2472297, located between the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes. For the norclozapine C/D ratio, an association signal was found near uridine-5´-diphospho-glucunorosyltransferase (UGT) UGT2B10 gene. Additionally, rs3732218, an intron variant in the UGT1A family gene complex, was associated with norclozapine C/D. Lead SNP associated with the clozapine/norclozapine ratio was rs6827692, an intron variant near UGT2B7 gene. In the two population meta-analyses (n = 654) adjusting for smoking and valproate use, the UGT2B10 intron variant rs835309 was associated with the clozapine/norclozapine ratio. We suggest a UGT2B10 missense SNP rs61750900, in perfect linkage disequilibrium with UGT2B10 rs835309, as the probable causal variant. Our study confirms and extends the number of genetic variants affecting clozapine and norclozapine metabolism.

### Neural inhibition as a mechanism of nicotine dependence… [^117MR51C]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

Study Overview The prevalence of smoking is unusually high among patients with SCZ. In light of the negative health, economic, and social consequences of smoking, treatment efforts in this area are imperative. Such efforts rest, in part, on an improved understanding of the underlying causes of smoking within this unique population. For example, several lines of research have indicated that smoking improves specific SCZ-related symptoms and that patients may smoke to self-medicate with nicotine. These hypotheses are supported by previous experiments that suggest: patients with SCZ have decreased NI; nicotine administration enhances NI in these.
- To acutely administer nicotine versus placebo to smokers with SCZ following transient abstinence from cigarettes, in order to investigate the effect of nicotine on the SCZ symptoms. This objective extends previous research by employing an adequately large sample and simultaneously testing several relevant domains of symptom improvement. Hypothesis: Significantly greater improvements across the domains of negative symptoms, negative affect, and cognitive deficits will be evident among those patients receiving nicotine versus placebo.
- To acutely administer nicotine versus placebo to nonsmokers with SCZ in order to investigate the effects of nicotine on the symptoms of SCZ, independent of withdrawal. This objective allows for the methodological disambiguation of the direct neural effects of nicotine from the effects of termination of withdrawal symptoms.

Additionally, this will provide seminal data regarding the acute treatment benefits of nicotine as a therapeutic agent, delivered without the health risks associated with smoking. Hypothesis: Significantly greater improvements across all symptoms domains will be evident among those patients receiving nicotine versus placebo.
- To investigate whether polymorphisms in CHRNA7 are associated with the magnitude of NI deficits, symptom reductions following acute nicotine administration, rates of smoking among patients with SCZ, and/or quit/reduction or relapse rates following smoking cessation treatment. Hypothesis: Significant genetic association will be demonstrated between CHRNA7 polymorphisms and each of the above-listed clinical variables. Drug: Nicotine patch Other: placebo Behavioral: smoking cessation group therapy
- 63/2005.
- Currently taking clozapine.

### Effects of clozapine treatment on the improvement of substance use disorders other than nicotine in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1166h2e1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Still, the validity of this association needs greater exploration. Given the prescriber bias in observational studies, significant heterogeneity and limitations among included studies, providing recommendations for the utility of clozapine in individuals without treatment-resistant psychosis and comorbid SUDs would be premature. The preliminary findings summarized here do however, further demonstrate the importance of early identification of individuals with treatment-resistant SSD and SUDs for clozapine initiation while maintaining high standards of monitoring to ensure safety.

Study limitations

Certain limitations should be considered when interpreting our findings. First, we applied broad inclusion criteria to our search to capture all studies involving clozapine use in individuals with SSD and SUDs. However, limiting our studies to English language articles may have narrowed the number of eligible trials detected. Heterogeneity in the pool of included studies, both at the methodological level, outcome measured, and antipsychotic comparison, complicated interpretation of results. Furthermore, there was a lack of reporting on differences in antipsychotic discontinuation rates compared with clozapine. Due to major methodological differences between studies, we grouped similar study designs reporting on the same outcome together to weigh the evidence. Other factors that accounted for heterogeneity included duration of follow-up, dosage, and study sample characteristics such as stage of illness and type of SUD. The potential influence of these factors on the generalizability of the results is discussed below.

Antipsychotic comparison heterogeneity

For most observational studies, c lozapine was compared to FGAs with little description of dosing. Given that incidence of EPS is a dose-related phenomenon and might occur with higher frequency in treatment with high potency antipsychotics, analysis of dosing and type of antipsychotics used would be an important consideration to strengthen results. Indeed, in the only registry-based observational study, the odds of decreasing psychiatric and substance use-related hospitalization were similar between clozapine and any long-acting injectable antipsychotics.

### Clozapine: more than 900 mg / day may be needed [^117Py8wZ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2009). Low credibility.

Patients may fail to respond to clozapine treatment despite use of the maximum licensed UK dosage (900 mg/day) because of ultra-rapid metabolism of the drug. We present the findings of a study of a national clozapine/norclozapine assay service for the period 1997–2005 and three individual case studies of patients treated with clozapine in doses greater than 900 mg/day. Clinicians should be alert to the possibility of treatment failure because of rapid clozapine clearance secondary to genetic factors and heavy cigarette consumption. This may necessitate the use of clozapine in doses up to 1400 mg/day, notably in young male smokers. Doses of greater than 900 mg/day are rarely justified in women. Anyone given relatively high-dose clozapine (600 mg/day or more) should be monitored regularly for adverse events and changes in smoking habit.

### Impact of acute inflammation on cytochromes P450 activity assessed by the Geneva cocktail [^116mcXpX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Similarly to our results, many studies found decreased CYP1A2 activity in inflammatory conditions, such as infection or induced‐infection models. 5, 28 Even though tobacco smoking is a known inducer of CYP1A2, we did not find that smokers' status modulated CYP1A2 activity in our study, probably because of the small number of smokers (n = 6) and as smoking is forbidden in the hospital setting. 5 Significant inverse associations have previously been established between IL‐6 levels and CYP1A2 activity (r = −0.5, P = 0.0235) but not with TNF‐α, in 16 patients with congestive heart failure. 29 Several case reports have described increased clozapine toxicity or plasma concentration after infection and/or inflammatory processes. 5 The decrease of CYP1A2 activity described in our study confirms that it could be of clinical relevance as a phenoconversion was seen in 82% of patients. These changes in CYP1A2 activity led to increased risk of ADR and required dose adaptation. 30 Some authors reported an association between circulating concentrations of CRP and clozapine. 30, 31 These published studies are in agreement with our results, because we found an inverse Spearman's correlation with IL‐6 and CRP but not with TNF‐α. However, conflicting results were reported in patients with diabetes. 32, 33 In our study, only surgery was inversely correlated with CYP1A2 activity in the linear mixed model, but not cytokines' levels. This means that surgery triggered changes, other than an increase in cytokines' levels that could be responsible for the downregulation of CYP1A2 activity. It is indeed well‐known that CYP1A2 is easily modulated by endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. BMI was also positively correlated to CYP1A2 activity in our study, but at the limit of significance. This has never been shown before in the literature.

### Serum prolactin and smoking status in chronic antipsychotic-treated male patients with schizophrenia [^113gbSGM]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

We investigated the effects of smoking status on the serum prolactin levels in schizophrenia. The serum prolactin concentration was significantly higher in nonsmokers compared with smokers. Moreover, smoking was an independent predictor of prolactin concentration. These findings suggest that smoking has an impact on prolactin concentration in male schizophrenic patients.

### Clozapine-related obsessive-compulsive symptoms and their impact on wellbeing: a naturalistic longitudinal study [^117GKV8Y]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Linear mixed models, with intercept as a (per-subject) random variable, were used to assess the longitudinal effect of changes in OCI-R and CGI-SCH upon the outcomes of interest. Linear mixed modelling is a robust statistical technique for longitudinal analysis with repeated measures. To test associations of interest, we performed a hierarchical approach to fit the data. Taking the first dependent variable, mental wellbeing, as an example, we first fitted the data using the overall OCI-R score (or subscores) and overall CGI-SCH score (or subscores) as the independent variables (models 1, 2, 4, and 6 in Table 2). Next, we added interaction terms between the overall OCI-R score and CGI-SCH subscores (models 3, 5, and 7 in Table 2). Of note, we only added interaction terms for OCI-R subscores or CGI-SCH subscores when they were associated with statistically significant main effects in the first step. All models controlled for age at baseline, age at FEP, gender, smoking (cigarettes per day), alcohol use (units per week), length of clozapine treatment (in years), and clozapine dose (in mg/day). Confound variables to control for were chosen a priori based on our earlier research (Biria et al; Fernandez-Egea et al.), which identified that clozapine dose and treatment duration were important for OCS, as were variables that influenced the individual's level of clozapine, such as smoking habits, alcohol use, and gender. Age at baseline and age at FEP were included as traditional demographic and psychiatric information as per convention in this field of research. The same approach as described above was used with the other dependent variable, general functioning.

### Impact of tobacco smoking cessation on stable clozapine or olanzapine treatment [^116TkgzW]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the pharmacokinetic implications and potential clinical effects of tobacco smoking cessation in patients on stable clozapine or olanzapine treatment.

Data Sources

A literature search of MEDLINE (1950-November 2009) and EMBASE (1980-November 2009) was conducted using the search terms smoking, tobacco, cigarette, cannabis, smoking cessation, cytochrome P450, antipsychotic, clozapine, and olanzapine. In addition, reference lists from publications identified were searched manually.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language articles and human studies were identified, yielding 111 returns. Articles that reported clinical outcomes following smoking cessation were selected. Pharmacokinetic data for these drugs were reviewed and articles that provided relevant background information were also included.

Data Synthesis

Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated more rapid clearance of olanzapine and lower clozapine and norclozapine (desmethylclozapine) concentrations in smokers compared to nonsmokers. These studies also found that smokers require higher doses of these agents than nonsmokers. There are case reports of adverse clinical outcomes following smoking cessation in patients being treated with olanzapine and clozapine. Reports that included serum concentrations consistently found elevations following smoking cessation, and dosage reductions of 30–40% were required to achieve pre-cessation concentrations. Worsening psychiatric symptoms, somnolence, hypersalivation, extreme fatigue, extrapyramidal effects, and seizures have all been reported following smoking cessation in this patient group.

Conclusions

Pharmacists need to be aware of potential risks associated with smoking cessation in patients stabilized on clozapine or olanzapine. Toxicity as a result of recent smoking reduction or cessation may be a reason for hospital admission. For hospitalized patients, pharmacists should obtain information concerning smoking status, including cessation attempts. Nonspecific signs and symptoms of elevated clozapine or olanzapine concentrations should be considered in relation to clinical status while the patient is hospitalized. Measurement of baseline serum clozapine concentrations and/or empiric dosage adjustment in patients expected to have a prolonged hospital stay with forced smoking cessation may be appropriate.

### A selective literature review exploring the role of the nicotinic system in schizophrenia [^114cn79P]. General Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Pros and cons of nicotine in psychosis

The relationship between smoking and antipsychotic medications is worth examining in detail. Some early reports state that smoking ameliorates previously noted psychomotor slowing seen with first-generation antipsychotics (FGA) such as haloperidol. The basis of this association arises from nicotine's potential to increase dopaminergic activity and to compensate for the preferential D2 blockage caused by FGA. Nicotine use has been associated with lower levels of antipsychotic-induced akathisia. This could explain the increased propensity for smoking in patients exhibiting akathisia, although this is not a universal finding. Clozapine has a higher affinity for D4 than D2 receptors, lowering the baseline risks of extrapyramidal side effects and akathisia. As a result, smoking may confer little symptomatic relief in patients on clozapine, compared with those on FGA. Nicotine induces cytochrome P450, thus increasing the metabolism of some antipsychotic drugs. This lowers their plasma levels and reduces the antipsychotic efficacy. As such, continued nicotine consumption may have adverse effects on the efficacy of antipsychotic regimes. This may increase the risk of psychosis relapse, worsening disease progression and complications from antecedent pathology.

### Prescribing clozapine in the UK: quality improvement issues identified by clinical audit [^114rd1u1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Change in smoking status

The hepatic enzyme CYP1A2 is a major metabolic pathway for clozapine, and this enzyme is induced by the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in tobacco smoke, rather than nicotine. Thus, people who smoke tobacco tend to have lower plasma concentrations of clozapine for any given dose administered than those who do not. For example, the data analysed bysuggest that female non-smokers will have a mean plasma concentration of 350 ng/ml with a daily clozapine dose of 265 mg, whereas female smokers will require 435 mg to achieve the same plasma concentration. Similarly, male non-smokers will have an average plasma clozapine concentration of 350 ng/ml with a daily dose of 325 mg, whereas male smokers will require 525 mg to achieve the same plasma concentration. But the confidence intervals around these mean values are wide, making it impossible to accurately predict for any individual patient the change in plasma clozapine concentration consequent upon an alteration in their smoking habit. A systematic review and meta-analysis byconcluded that plasma clozapine concentration was reduced by around one-third in smokers compared with non-smokers, although heterogeneity across the study outcomes was high. Overall, these findings strongly support the need for monitoring of plasma clozapine concentration and assessment of mental state following a change in smoking status.

Specifically, close monitoring is indicated for any smoker prescribed clozapine who is discharged from a smoke-free ward. If such a patient were to re-start smoking but stay on the same dose of clozapine, it is likely that their plasma clozapine concentration would be significantly lower than the concentration achieved while in the smoke-free environment, and potentially down to a sub-therapeutic concentration. Therefore, the discharge care plan should outline the steps that should be taken to monitor any change in smoking status and the implications this may have for the dose of clozapine that is prescribed. In the baseline audit, such a plan was in place for less than one-third of smokers discharged from a smoke-free ward. At re-audit, the respective proportion was just over half, but that still meant that almost half of such patients might be at an increased risk of relapse should they resume smoking tobacco after leaving hospital. Wherever applicable, participating trusts were asked to review their clinical pathways for patients who are smokers and prescribed clozapine.

### As countries improve their cigarette tax policy, cigarette consumption declines [^113eTrqC]. Tobacco Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Third, cigarette consumption is a stock value of both smoking participation and smoking intensity. Using the aggregate data of overall cigarette tax scores and cigarette consumption at the national level does not allow us to examine differential effects of cigarette tax policies on smoking participation and smoking intensity, nor the effects of those policies on different subpopulations of interest. Thus, future research may benefit from using longitudinal individual-level data to investigate the differential effects of cigarette tax policies on those outcomes and subpopulations.

Fourth, the Tobacconomics overall cigarette tax scores are constructed as the average of the four tax components, implying that each of the four tax component scores has equal weight. It is possible that some tax components are more effective than other measures in reducing smoking and should be assigned greater weight. Future research should further investigate the effects of those tax components with different assigned weights. Despite those limitations, our results are robust to different sensitivity analyses and are consistent with the findings of previous studies.

### Clozapine is strongly associated with the risk of pneumonia and inflammation [^111zyuuL]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Clozapine is prone to cause side effects, called adverse drug reactions (ADRs) by pharmacologists. Some of these clozapine ADRs, such as sedation, hypersalivation, constipation and seizures, are dose-related. It is probably more accurate to describe them as serum concentration-related. An expert guideline recommends for efficacy in schizophrenia trough steady-state clozapine concentrations of 350–600 ng/mL. This indicates a narrow therapeutic index. The serum concentration of norclozapine does not contribute to antipsychotic efficacy since norclozapine has no antipsychotic activity. On the other hand, it is possible that serum norclozapine concentration may contribute to most or all clozapine ADRs.

If clinicians have access to clozapine levels, they should use them to maintain each clozapine patient on the lowest dose possible that provides stable trough steady-state clozapine levels within the therapeutic range. Assuming that the patient practices good medical adherence and is reliable, we recommend establishing a clozapine dose that provides stable serum concentrations between 350 and 400 ng/mL, to allow some room for normal fluctuations in the clinical environment. To increase compliance and reduce daily ADRs, a single administration at night can be used.

Clozapine dosing is not only influenced by geriatric age, smoking, gender and co-medication but ethnicity (Asian vs non-Asian). In 1997, Asian researchers first described Chinese patients as having serum concentrations similar to those of Caucasians with only half the clozapine dose used in the US. A meta-analytic reviewshowed that Chinese and other East Asians have lower clozapine clearance than Caucasians. The lower clozapine clearance, probably explained by lower CYP1A2 activity, appears to be present not only in Chinese patients but is also common to other Asians. The FDA describes Asians as those people whose ancestral origins range geographically from Pakistan to Japan. In Asians, to reach 350 ng/mL, a non-smoking female with average metabolism needs around 150 mg/day and a male smoker 300 mg/day, requiring typical doses in Asians from 150 to 300 mg/day. On the other hand, a non-smoking US Caucasian female with average clozapine metabolism needs around 300 mg/day while a US Caucasian male smoker needs 600 mg/day, requiring typical doses in the US from 300 to 600 mg/day.

### Clozapine is strongly associated with the risk of pneumonia and inflammation [^1169PnSW]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Clozapine metabolism

In 1989 before pharmacokinetic studies were required, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved clozapine with very limited information on clozapine metabolism. In 1994, Bertilsson et al described CYP1A2 as its major metabolic pathway. CYP1A2 pharmacology is highly relevant in clozapine dosing. Norclozapine is the main metabolite of clozapine and appears to be mainly eliminated by the kidney, since its conjugated metabolites are present in the urine and the serum free norclozapine is excreted by an unknown renal transporter that can be inhibited by gemfibrozil. With geriatric age, clozapine clearance from the body decreases; this is probably explained by the decrease in renal function and subsequent decrease in renal clearance of norclozapine and other metabolites eliminated in the urine.

Tobacco smoke has polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and induce CYP1A2 expression, increasing the levels of CYP1A2, which is mainly expressed in the liver. Therefore, smokers tend to have serum concentration values that are approximately 0.80 that of non-smokers when using the same clozapine dose. Conversely, oestrogens have inhibitory effects on CYP1A2 activity. Male patients, then, tend to have serum concentration values that are approximately 0.86 that of females when using the same clozapine dose. Co-medication with inducers such as carbamazepine, phenytoin or rifampicin increase clozapine metabolism and decrease clozapine levels. The most important inhibitors of clozapine metabolism are ciprofloxacin, oral contraceptives, fluvoxamine and caffeine in high doses. Valproic acid can be an inducer and/or an inhibitor of clozapine metabolism; this varies from patient to patient and over time. During clozapine titration, clinicians should be more concerned about the potential of valproic acid to act as an inhibitor.

### Treatment response after 6 and 26 weeks is related to baseline glutamate and GABA levels in antipsychotic-naïve patients with psychosis [^1123KAUw]. Psychological Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Our findings support that abnormal glutamate and GABA levels in initially antipsychotic-naïve patients are associated with non-response after first antipsychotic treatment as also reported in two recent studies, but the direction of abnormalities and regions affected differ (de la Fuente-Sandoval et al; Egerton et al.). Egerton et al. found significantly higher glutamate levels at baseline in ACC, but not in the left thalamus of minimally-treated non-responder patients after 4 weeks treatment with amisulpride (Egerton et al.), and de la Fuente-Sandoval et al. reported higher GABA levels in medial frontal cortex of non-responding antipsychotic-naïve patients after 4 weeks of treatment with risperidone (de la Fuente-Sandoval et al.). These variations may be explained by methodical differences. Most importantly, we used matched HCs as a reference instead of responders. Second, we observed a decrease in thalamic glutamate levels after treatment was initiated and therefore speculate if the prior exposure to antipsychotic treatment had reduced thalamic glutamate levels in the study of minimally-treated patients (Egerton et al.). Third, the voxel placement varied between studies. We placed our voxel in the area corresponding to the dorsal ACC, whereas the two other studies placed it in the pregenual ACC. Previous studies have reported a different distribution of glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors in these two subregions (Palomero-Gallagher et al.), and higher glutamate and GABA levels in the pregenual ACC compared to the dorsal ACC in HCs (Dou et al.). Interestingly, we also observed lower baseline glx in both responders and non-responders after 6 weeks in the larger and more dorsal MEGAPRESS voxel, but not in the PRESS voxel. It therefore seems likely that glutamatergic and GABAergic disturbances in ACC are region-specific in patients. Moreover, differences in factors that influence glutamate and GABA levels, including age (Marsman et al; Rowland et al.), sex (O'Gorman et al.), cigarette smoking (Akkus et al.), and possibly also ethnicity and substance abuse, may contribute to the heterogeneous findings. Last, clozapine treatment in chronic patients might enhance glutamate levels as indicated by preclinical studies (Melone et al; Tanahashi et al.) and by a recent cross-sectional study that found increased glx in dACC of non-responders to clozapine (Iwata et al.).

### Contributions of cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1 and CYP1A2 gene variants on the effects of plasma ratio of clozapine / N-desmethylclozapine on working memory in schizophrenia [^1122EokX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Clozapine has heterogenous efficacy in enhancing working memory in schizophrenia. We have previously hypothesized that this is due to opposing effects of clozapine and its metabolite, N-desmethylclozapine, at the muscarinic M1 receptor and demonstrated that a lower clozapine/ N -desmethylclozapine ratio is associated with better working memory than clozapine or N -desmethylclozapine levels alone.

Aims

In this study, we expanded the above hypothesis to explore whether genetic variation in the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1 gene, encoding the M1 receptor, affects the relationship between clozapine/ N -desmethylclozapine and working memory. Further, we explored whether CYP1A2 gene variants affect the ratio of clozapine/ N -desmethylclozapine and by this, working memory performance.

Methods

We evaluated two functionally significant single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs1942499 and rs2075748, in cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1, with the haplotype T-A associated with lower transcriptional activity than the haplotype C-G. Further, we examined CYP1A2 *1F, with *1F/*1F conferring high inducibility in the presence of smoking.

Results

In a sample of 30 patients with schizophrenia on clozapine monotherapy, clozapine/ N -desmethylclozapine was correlated with working memory only in non-carriers of the haplotype T-A of the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1 gene. Interaction of CYP1A2 genotype and smoking status significantly affected clozapine concentrations, but there were no significant effects of CYP1A2 genotype and smoking status on the relationship between clozapine/ N -desmethylclozapine on working memory.

Conclusions

Our finding that the relationship between clozapine/ N -desmethylclozapine and working memory is specific to patients with potentially higher transcription of M1 receptor (i.e. non-carriers of the haplotype T-A of cholinergic receptor muscarinic 1) supports a cholinergic mechanism underlying this relationship.

### Serum clozapine levels: a review of their clinical utility [^115Mh75E]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is frequently utilized in the treatment of psychiatric conditions, but its clinical application concerning the use of clozapine is unclear. We present three case reports of patients taking clozapine, review the relevant literature, and propose guidelines to aid the clinical use of TDM of clozapine. Due to its complex metabolism, there are significant inter- and intra-individual variations in clozapine serum levels, for a given dose. However, the range of serum levels that corresponds with toxicity remains unclear. Although central nervous system side-effects may correlate with serum level, many adverse effects of clozapine appear to be unrelated, including haematological and cardiac events. There are numerous clinically significant interactions between clozapine and other substances, including prescribed medications, nicotine and caffeine. TDM of clozapine may be of clinical value in certain situations, such as poor clinical response; signs of toxicity; onset of seizures; changes in concurrent medication, caffeine or nicotine; liver disease; and suspected non-compliance. The current literature does not support the routine testing of serum clozapine levels in everyday clinical practice.

### Identification of a novel polymorphism associated with reduced clozapine concentration in schizophrenia patients-a genome-wide association study adjusting for smoking habits [^116fNi6s]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Sample characteristics

The study population comprised 484 CLZ-treated patients with a total of 10,283 CLZ and N -desmethylclozapine serum concentrations measurements (Table 1), with median age of 37 years (IQR: 29–47) and 38.4% females (n = 186). The median prescribed daily dose of CLZ was 400 mg (IQR: 250–500 mg), whereas the median serum concentration of CLZ and N -desmethylclozapine were 1167 and 770 nmol/L, respectively. Among the patients with known smoking habits (n = 422; 9284 serum samples), 258 were confirmed smokers (61.1%) and 164 were confirmed nonsmokers (38.9%). The median dose-adjusted CLZ serum concentrations (C/D ratio) were 2.46 nmol/L/mg (IQR: 1.67–3.64) and 4.63 nmol/L/mg (IQR: 2.91–6.49) in smokers and nonsmokers, respectively, whereas the median CLZ-to- N -desmethylclozapine ratios were 1.43 (IQR: 1.17–1.71) in smokers and 1.69 (IQR: 1.40–2.06) in nonsmokers.

### Identification of a novel polymorphism associated with reduced clozapine concentration in schizophrenia patients-a genome-wide association study adjusting for smoking habits [^116yK9GL]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Previous studies have shown that interindividual variability in CLZ concentration is significantly associated with age, sex, and smoking habits, where the latter is quantitatively most important. However, these factors only explain parts of the variability, which has motivated the search for pharmacogenetic determinants of CLZ pharmacokinetics. Most studies so far have been unsuccessful in identifying genetic polymorphisms associated with individual variability in CLZ pharmacokinetics, but recently a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a British patient population (n = 2989) identified a single locus (15:74817689–75404506) between the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes associated with a reduction in CLZ serum levels. Further, a locus on chromosome 4 (4:69542100–70387482), containing the UGT2B10 gene, was associated with both N -desmethylclozapine serum concentration and the CLZ-to- N- desmethylclozapine metabolic ratio. For the N -desmethylclozapine serum concentration and CLZ-to- N -desmethylclozapine metabolic ratio two additional loci were identified, i.e. at chr2:234611523–234676118 and 10:96098093–96974830, respectively. In contrast to polygenic complex traits, such as schizophrenia, these results support the hypothesis that the genetic architecture of CLZ metabolism is less polygenic and may constitute a smaller number of variants with larger effect sizes. This is typical for the pharmacogenetics of drug-metabolizing enzymes, where a limited number of variant allele diplotypes have large effect sizes and separate the population into distinct metabolizer phenotypes. In addition, CLZ related adverse effects are associated with few genetic variants with large effect sizes.

Tobacco smoke reduces the serum concentration of CLZ by ~30–50% due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons inducing gene transcription of drug-metabolizing enzymes, e.g. CYP1A enzymes –. Thus, information on smoking habits is crucial when studying factors that may influence the CLZ serum concentrations. The previous British GWAS did not account for the individual patient's smoking habits, but used a proxy measure (polygenic risk scores for smoking), which may imply that significant variants were not captured in the analysis. The aim of the present study was to perform a GWAS on serum concentrations of CLZ and its main metabolite N -desmethylclozapine in a Norwegian population of schizophrenia patients with known smoking habits.

### Effects of cigarette smoking on spatial working memory… [^112em8jn]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

In smokers with schizophrenia and control smokers, overnight abstinence led to undetectable plasma nicotine levels and an increase in tobacco craving. While abstinence reduced CPT hit rate in both groups, VSWM was only impaired in smokers with schizophrenia. Smoking reinstatement reversed abstinence-induced cognitive impairment. Enhancement of VSWM and CPT performance by smoking reinstatement in smokers with schizophrenia, but not the subjective effects of smoking, was blocked by mecamylamine treatment. Conclusions Cigarette smoking may selectively enhance VSWM and attentional deficits in smokers with schizophrenia, which may depend on nAChR stimulation. These findings may have implications for understanding the high rates of smoking in schizophrenia and for developing pharmacotherapies for cognitive deficits and nicotine dependence in schizophrenia.

In addition, postmortem studies have demonstrated that tritiated nicotine binding is reduced in schizophrenic compared with healthy control brain regions, including the striatum, thalamus, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex.
25. Post hoc testing revealed that within the 3 test sessions in the placebo condition in smokers with schizophrenia, overnight smoking abstinence produced a nonsignificant decline in performance compared with baseline, while smoking reinstatement reversed abstinence-induced performance deficits. In the placebo condition, smokers with schizophrenia demonstrated a mean ± SD 2. 5% ±
5. 0% enhancement of CPT hit rate, which was dose-dependently reduced by pretreatment with MEC at 5 and 10 mg/d.

Our results suggest that cigarette smoking has selective effects on VSWM 30-second delay performance and sustained attention performance on the CPT in schizophrenia. Calculated effect sizes for overnight smoking abstinence effects ranged from d = 0. 40 for CPT hit rate to d = 
1. 01 for VSWM 30-second delay, suggesting that there are clinically significant effects3 of smoking abstinence on neuropsychological performance.

### Effect of fluvoxamine augmentation and smoking on clozapine serum concentrations [^111LoGd6]. Schizophrenia Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Clozapine (CLZ) is metabolized via cytochrome P450 CYP1A2 to N-desmethylclozapine (NCLZ). Smoking induces CYP1A2 thereby increasing clozapine metabolism whereas fluvoxamine inhibits CYP1A2. Studies suggest that the beneficial effect of fluvoxamine augmentation in raising serum clozapine concentrations also occurs when serum concentrations are low due to smoking. Yet, little is known about the influence of fluvoxamine augmentation on clozapine serum concentrations in smoking versus non-smoking patients.

Methods

A TDM database was analyzed. Serum concentrations of CLZ, NCLZ, dose-adjusted serum concentrations (C/D) and metabolite-to-parent ratios (MPR) were compared using non-parametrical tests in four groups: clozapine-monotherapy in non-smokers (V NS, n = 28) and smokers (V S, n = 43); combined treatment with clozapine and fluvoxamine in non-smokers (V NS+F, n = 11) and smokers (V S+F, n = 43).

Results

The CLZ monotherapy smoking group showed lower values of C/D CLZ of -38.6% (p < 0.001), C/D NCLZ -35.6% (p < 0.001) and a higher MPR (p = 0.021) than in the non-smoking group. The combination of CLZ and fluvoxamine in non-smoking patients led to higher C/D values: C/D CLZ +117.9% (p < 0.001), C/D NCLZ +60.8% (p = 0.029) while the MPR did not differ between groups (p = 0.089). Changes were comparable to fluvoxamine augmentation in the smoking group with increased C/D CLZ of +120.1% (p < 0.001), C/D NCLZ of +85.8% (p < 0.001) and lower MPR (p = 0.006).

Conclusions

Smoking in clozapine monotherapy reduced median dose-adjusted serum concentrations more than a third. Combined treatment with fluvoxamine and clozapine led to higher median C/D values in both, smokers and non-smokers. The opposing effects of CYP1A2 induction by smoking and inhibition by fluvoxamine on clozapine serum concentrations balanced out.

### Effects of clozapine treatment on the improvement of substance use disorders other than nicotine in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113qi9yR]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Clozapine safety in individuals with comorbid SUDs

A descriptive analysis of the European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Database explored cases reported due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to clozapine. There were 326 cases out of 11,847 suspected clozapine-related ADRs reporting on "drug abuser", "drug abuse", "drug diversion", "intentional product misuse", "product use issue", and "substance abuse". Moreover, 258 cases described "withdrawal syndrome" involving possible severe and long-lasting symptoms due to abrupt clozapine discontinuation.

In a phase-1 study of four oral challenges with ascending doses of clozapine (12.5, 25, and 50 mg) and placebo followed 2 h later by a 2 mg/kg dose of intranasal cocaine, one participant out of eight had to be removed from the challenge study due to syncope. Furthermore, clozapine challenge resulted in the elevation of serum cocaine levels.

One published case report described the ineffectiveness of clozapine in improving SUD and resulting in excess sedation and its eventual discontinuation. Another case report described clozapine resistance, lack of improvement in SUD, and the incidence of small bowel obstruction resulting in an eventual switch to aripiprazole with clinically meaningful therapeutic outcomes.

### Mediation and longitudinal analysis to interpret the association between clozapine pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomics, and absolute neutrophil count [^1118KHAV]. Schizophrenia (2023). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

In the context of research on the pharmacogenomics of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, CLOZUK3 is a relatively large sample linked to an extensive longitudinal blood monitoring dataset. It is therefore better powered than most previous studies to assess the relationships between clozapine dose and metabolites on ANC. Data availability also allowed us to merge and analyse FBC and pharmacokinetic assays taken on the same day, providing a precise relationship between neutrophil counts and plasma clozapine and norclozapine levels. Finally, we were also able to incorporate classic pharmacogenomic allele calling to extend previous work and to establish associations between inferred CYP1A2 enzyme activity with neutrophil counts in clozapine users.

A limitation of the present work is that the CLOZUK3 sample was not fully genotyped. Nevertheless, the key pharmacokinetic associations observed in the LMM remain when explored in the subset of the genomically informative sample (Supplementary Note). Furthermore, the participants in the CLOZUK3 dataset were primarily of European ancestry limiting the extent to which the findings can be generalised to other populations. Our findings therefore need to be tested in non-European individuals, as exemplified by the strength of known ancestry-specific genetic effects on ANC.

We were unable to account for the effects of concomitant medication (e.g. oral contraceptives, some antidepressants), physiology (e.g. weight, BMI), or lifestyle factors (e.g. caffeine consumption, cigarette smoking) that can impact drug clearance. For example, while there are currently no guidelines relating to clozapine dose and patient weight in the UK, some have suggested that obesity should be considered during clozapine titrationand that obese individuals might display slower clozapine clearance. There is also some evidence that cigarette and caffeine consumption, habits that both influence and are influenced by CYP1A2 function, can be associated with white blood cell counts. Unfortunately, information about these variables was not available in CLOZUK3. Therefore, our study needs replication in an independent sample where the potential of all these factors to either impact clozapine metabolism via phenoconversion or act as a confounder in our models can be explicitly tested.

### Time response of cytochrome P450 1A2 activity on cessation of heavy smoking [^115jkMQG]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 activity is induced by cigarette smoking. Thus smoking cessation in patients while they are undergoing therapy with a CYP1A2 substrate such as theophylline or clozapine increases its concentrations and may cause adverse effects. Our objective was to determine the time course of CYP1A2 activity changes after smoking cessation in heavy smokers as the basis for dosing adaptation schemes.

Methods

The study was conducted in 8 men and 4 women (all white) who smoked 20 cigarettes or more per day. Sudden smoking cessation was carried out after a 14-day run-in period. Subjects were phenotyped for CYP1A2 activity at 6, 4, and 1 day before smoking cessation and at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 13 days thereafter by use of the paraxanthine-to-caffeine ratio in plasma 6 hours after a 148-mg caffeine test dose. A monoexponential decay of CYP1A2 activity to a residual value was fitted to the data by nonlinear regression analysis.

Results

On cessation of smoking, initial caffeine clearance (estimated geometric means and 95% confidence intervals) decreased significantly (P < .01), by 36.1% (30.9%-42.2%), from 2.47 mL. min(-1). kg(-1) body weight (2.03–3.00 mL. min(-1). kg(-1) body weight) to a new steady state of 1.53 mL. min(-1). kg(-1) body weight (1.24–1.89 mL. min(-1). kg(-1) body weight). The apparent half-life of CYP1A2 activity decrease was 38.6 hours (27.4–54.4 hours).

Conclusion

Doses of CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic range should be decreased immediately on cessation of heavy smoking. As a rule of thumb, a stepwise daily dose reduction of approximately 10% until the fourth day after smoking cessation is proposed, which should be accompanied by therapeutic drug monitoring.

### Improving smoking cessation policy by assessing user demand for an inpatient smoking cessation service in adult psychiatric wards [^115djaYm]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Smoking rates are higher among people with mental health conditions compared to the general population. This contributes to the higher rates of physical co-morbidity and shorter life expectancy in this population. Furthermore, smoking has an associated financial burden, and can interact with the pharmacokinetics of psychotropic drugs such as clozapine, meaning higher doses are required. Smoking cessation has been shown to improve mental health and quality of life in a recent meta-analysis. This is contrary to widely-held views that intervening with smokers might be detrimental to their mental health. In the context of a national push to make many hospital sites smoke-free, an inpatient admission to a psychiatric ward should equally provide an opportunity to engage and support smokers in smoking cessation.

NICE guidelines recognise the importance of documenting the current smoking status of patients, and encouraging and supporting cessation by healthcare professionals. Recent published guidelines within our Trust further reinforce this. The guidelines advise that all smokers be assessed for motivation to stop smoking, and those expressing a desire to stop should be referred to level 2 specialist cessation services.

A recently published quality improvement report has encountered a similar problem in a general medical inpatient setting, but to our knowledge this is the first published smoking cessation audit report on a psychiatric inpatient population.

### An international guideline with six personalised titration schedules for preventing myocarditis and pneumonia associated with clozapine [^1115EhP5]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

International clozapine titration guideline

The international clozapine guidelinewas developed for inpatients since, in many countries, clozapine is started during hospitalisation. Its new recommendations include: (1) personalised titration, (2) CRP measures, and (3) dose predictions based on blood levels.

Personalised titration

Based on a comprehensive review of the clozapine pharmacokinetic literature, the international guidelineproposes that clozapine clearance can be measured by the dose needed to reach the minimum therapeutic range of the plasma concentration of 350 ng/mL. Clozapine clearance is influenced by three levels of complexity: (1) ancestry groups, (2) sex-smoking subgroups, and (3) absence/presence of poor metabolizer (PM) status. These three groups of variables should determine the maintenance dose and speed of clozapine titration (table 1).

Table 1
Summary of international clozapine titration guideline for adult inpatients according to ancestry groups with updates*

It is not known why people of Asian or Native American ancestry have lower CYP1A2 activity than those with European ancestry, leading to lower clozapine doses needed to get a therapeutic response. Olanzapine is also mainly metabolised by CYP1A2. Asians need lower olanzapine doses. On the other hand, people of black ancestry (sub-Saharan Africans) may need higher olanzapineand, possibly, clozapine doses. Moreover, higher clozapine dose requirements in African-American patients in the USA versus those of European ancestry may explain why US experts and the US package insert recommend 300–600 mg/day of clozapine, which is higher than the dosages used in Europe. Extrapolation from US dosages to black patients provides three basic levels of clozapine dose ranges. They are dose ranges because within each ancestry group (Asians/Native Americans, Europeans and blacks), female non-smokers need the lowest doses while male smokers need the highest doses. Oestrogens inhibit CYP1A2, so women need lower clozapine (and olanzapine) doses, while tobacco smoking induces CYP1A2, so smokers need higher clozapine (and olanzapine) doses.

### Antipsychotic medication and smoking prevalence in acutely hospitalized patients with chronic schizophrenia [^111aFPxz]. Schizophrenia Research (2000). Low credibility.

The atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, has been reported to reduce smoking in schizophrenic patients. We sought to determine whether other atypical antipsychotics would also be associated with a decreased prevalence of smoking in this population. Data were obtained from three groups of chronic, hospitalized, schizophrenic patients, receiving either a typical antipsychotic (n = 15), clozapine (n = 6), or another atypical antipsychotic (n = 18). In addition to smoking prevalence, the groups were compared with regard to demographics (age, education), medication (doses, duration of treatment, side-effects), clinical (diagnosis, duration of illness) and behavioral (Wide-Range Achievement Test, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) variables. Smoking prevalence differed significantly among the three groups (P < 0.001). Clozapine was associated with a significantly lower incidence of smoking than either typical drugs (P < 0.003) or other atypical antipsychotics (P = 0. 042). The groups did not differ on demographic or other medication variables or on any of several behavioral measures. However, a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia was also significantly correlated with smoking (P < 0.01), but not with medication class. Although the cause is still unknown, these results are consistent with reports that clozapine reduces smoking and provide new data on smoking prevalence associated with other atypical agents.

### Impact of CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 genotype-and phenoconversion-predicted enzyme activity on clozapine exposure and symptom severity [^112aCh5y]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 enzymes. Among 66 adult schizophrenia patients treated with clozapine-based combination therapies, we explored the impact of genotype-predicted CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 activity on dose-adjusted clozapine concentrations and symptom severity, with and without correction for inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes. Uncorrected activity scores were not associated with dose-adjusted clozapine concentrations or symptom severity. CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 activity scores corrected for known inducers (i.e., smoking) and inhibitors (e.g., concomitant medications) were associated with dose-adjusted clozapine levels and in the case of CYP1A2, symptom severity. However, smoking status and certain inhibitors of clozapine metabolism (i.e., esomeprazole) explained significantly more variance in dose-adjusted clozapine levels relative to corrected activity scores. These findings highlight the clinical importance of nongenetic factors (smoking, concomitant medications) and suggest that the added utility of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 activity scores to guide clozapine dosing is currently limited.

### Clozapine toxicity: a cautionary palliative care tale [^116EHKc7]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2020). High credibility.

Objective

This case report presents an unusual case of clozapine toxicity secondary to reduced smoking habit mimicking a patient approaching end of life.

Methods

It is a cautionary tale for palliative care specialists, perhaps unaware of the effect of cigarette smoke on metabolism of this antipsychotic, to be aware of.

Results

Following specialist advice and change of antipsychotic medication, this patient's condition improved to the point that he was discharged from the hospice.

Conclusion

Palliative care specialists should be aware that reducing cigarette consumption can alter metabolism of clozapine, potentially causing drug accumulation and toxicity with features which mimic deterioration towards end of life. Specialist advice should be sought in such a situation.

### Identification of a novel polymorphism associated with reduced clozapine concentration in schizophrenia patients-a genome-wide association study adjusting for smoking habits [^116XW86G]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clozapine (CLZ) is the most efficient antipsychotic drug in treatment of schizophrenia. However, CLZ is only indicated in treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) due to risk of neutropenia or agranulocytosis, which is reported to occur in about 3% and 0.5–1% of the patients, respectively. Therefore, close monitoring of neutrophil granulocyte counts is mandatory during use of CLZ. The suppression of granulocyte levels, as well as risk of other adverse effects such as seizures, cardiometabolics (weight gain and type 2 diabetes), sedation, and hypersalivation, have been associated with CLZ and/or metabolite levels.

CLZ is subjected to complex metabolism involving biotransformation via multiple pathways. Several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19, are in vitro shown to be involved in the oxidative metabolism of CLZ to the major metabolites N -desmethylclozapine and clozapine- N -oxide. In addition, CLZ undergoes metabolism to reactive nitrenium ion metabolites, which are believed to be important for the toxicity of CLZ treatment. Less is known about the enzyme(s) mediating the formation of nitrenium ion metabolites of CLZ, but the myeloperoxidase system in granulocytes seem to play a role.

### Pairwise genetic meta-analyses between schizophrenia and substance dependence phenotypes reveals novel association signals with pharmacological significance [^112zHpgj]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia is a complex and debilitating psychiatric disorder with a diverse array of symptoms and comorbidities including substance dependence. While the onset generally occurs during early adolescence, schizophrenia is highly heritable, which provides an opportunity to glean molecular insight into the composition of dysfunctional networks underlying its pathophysiology and phenotypic diversity, including associated comorbidities. Substance use disorders (SUDs) are also complex, heritable traits with susceptibility linked to unique polygenic architecture not shared with non-pathological substance use behaviour. Twin studies have provided insights into the magnitude of total SUDs heritability regardless of the substance; alcohol (AD, 0.63), cannabis (CD, 0.78) nicotine (ND, 0.72), cocaine (CoD, 0.61), and opioids (OD, 0.61).

While these SUDs arise independently of psychotic and affective disorders, they are frequently comorbid. A 2018 meta-analysis by Hunt et al. of 123 articles between 1990 and 2017 (n = 165,811) found that the prevalence of any SUD in schizophrenia was 41.7%, with 26.2% for cannabis, 24.3% for alcohol and 7.3% for stimulants. Some population studies have reported even higher use, with 72% of people with schizophrenia being daily cigarette smokers, and nearly half using cannabis regularly. Although data on opioid use in schizophrenia is limited, it was found to be significantly higher than the general population. Substance use and dependence is a significant complication for patients with schizophrenia and often impedes treatment options. For example, cigarette smoking has been shown to have a profound effect on the metabolism of many psychotropic drugs, with plasma concentrations of clozapine shown to be reduced in people who smoke cigarettes. First-generation and short acting oral antipsychotics have also been shown to increase substance use and cravings, with alcohol use in patients worsening over time.

### Plasma clozapine concentration coefficients of variation in a long-term study [^113kbJnT]. Schizophrenia Research (2005). Low credibility.

Kurz et al. conducted the first study of the intra-individual variability of clozapine plasma concentrations but did not take into account the effect of smoking and co-medication. As patients were receiving varying doses, Kurz et al. standardized plasma levels by using a plasma level/dose/kg ratio. In 15 patients, the mean coefficient of variation (CV) was 53% (S.D. = 21). In this new study, plasma clozapine and norclozapine concentrations were measured every 2 weeks in 47 patients randomized to 100, 300, or 600 mg/day for 16-week double-blind clozapine trials under controlled conditions (stable smoking, limited co-medication and absence of caffeinated beverages). For 100, 300 and 600 mg/day, the respective mean CVs for plasma clozapine concentrations were 23% (S.D. = 14), 19% (S.D. = 11) and 18% (S.D. = 8). For the combined concentrations of clozapine and norclozapine, the respective mean CVs were 20% (S.D. = 13), 16% (S.D. = 9) and 15% (S.D. = 7). Under 100 mg/day, the mean CV for clozapine concentrations was significantly higher for heavy smokers than non-heavy smokers (32%, S.D. = 3 vs. 19%, S.D. = 8) (p = 0.03). Studies of CVs in other environments are needed. Clozapine CVs may be important in order to understand the importance of variations around the therapeutic range and to interpret drug interactions above the usual noise of measuring plasma concentrations.

### An international guideline with six personalised titration schedules for preventing myocarditis and pneumonia associated with clozapine [^1115a9RY]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

White blood cell (WBC) monitoring has reduced clozapine-treated patient deaths associated with agranulocytosis to a rarity. However, clozapine protocols and package inserts worldwide provide no instructions for preventing myocarditis or pneumonia during clozapine titrations. Prescribers worldwide are largely unaware of that. Meanwhile, as they worry about agranulocytosis, their clozapine-treated patients are at risk of dying from pneumonia or myocarditis. Consequently, an international guideline with 104 authors from 50 countries/regions was recently published to provide personalised clozapine titration schedules for adult inpatients. This forum article reviews pneumonia and myocarditis occurring during clozapine titration, as well as the three most innovative aspects of this new guideline: (1) personalised titration, (2) C reactive protein (CRP) measures, and (3) dose predictions based on blood levels. Clozapine metabolism is influenced by 3 levels of complexity: (1) ancestry groups, (2) sex-smoking subgroups, and (3) presence/absence of poor metabolizer status. These 3 groups of variables should determine the maintenance dose and speed of clozapine titration; they are summarised in a table in the full-text. The international clozapine titration guideline recommends measuring CRP levels simultaneously with WBC, at baseline and weekly at least for the first 4 weeks of titration, the highest risk period for clozapine-induced myocarditis.

### Meta-analyses of clozapine, norclozapine levels and their ratio across three genome wide association studies [^112pGTGy]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

CYP1A1 / CYP1A2 r s2472297 has been previously linked with caffeine metabolism. Caffeine is an important substrate for CYP1A2. This suggests that the effects of rs2472297 on clozapine metabolism are also mediated through CYP1A2. The variant was missing from the Norwegian sample and therefore this association could not be replicated in previous study by Løvsletten Smith et al. Our two-cohort meta-analysis did not identify any novel SNPs affecting the clozapine C/D ratio.

Norclozapine C/D has previously been linked to UGT2B10 loci by Pardiñas et al. and by Løvsletten Smith et al. Our lead SNP in this locus (rs10000284 in linkage disequilibrium with rs61750900) supports the central role of the UGT2B family in norclozapine metabolism. This missense variant has been linked to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) on clozapine patients in CLOZUK2 population, with long term exposure of high levels of clozapine, but also high clozapine to norclozapine ratio lowering absolute neutrophil count. Also, rs3732218, an intron variant from UGT1A family gene complex reached significance in the three cohort meta-analysis for norclozapine C/D. This SNP was previously reported by Samanaite et al. as one of the SNPs related to biological predictors of clozapine response.

Pardiñas et al. found a SNP affecting clozapine to norclozapine metabolic ratio that was possibly linked to UGT2B7 area. Clozapine to norclozapine metabolic ratio was affected by SNP rs6827692, an UGT2B7 intron area variation in our three cohort meta-analysis but this SNP was not available in CLOZUK2 population. Valproate use, and smoking were not used as covariates in our three cohort meta-analysis due to the lack of this data in the CLOZUK2 dataset. Interestingly, the role of certain UGT2B7 polymorphisms in valproate metabolism has been discussed recently, suggesting this is another shared metabolic route for clozapine metabolites and valproate.

The top SNP in two cohort meta-analysis on clozapine to norclozapine ratio was rs835309, UGT2B10 intron variant, that was previously reported in conjunction with UGT2B genotypes affecting nicotine and nitrosamine glucuronidation in European and African American smokers and in conjunction with SNPs affecting dexmedetodimine spectrometry samples in pediatric patients.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^116nCVKB]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Smoking cessation in schizophrenia — Recommendation 39 states: "We recommend a face-to-face individualized smoking cessation intervention tailored specifically to the patient for individuals with schizophrenia. (Strong for | Reviewed, New-added)". Tobacco use in schizophrenia is "approximately 5.3 times higher than the average population". A systematic review (SR) identified "three RCTs (n = 921)" showing improved tobacco cessation with individualized face-to-face interventions versus TAU. Interventions "should target issues specific to this population" including higher levels of nicotine addiction, SMI symptoms of schizophrenia, side effects of antipsychotic medications, and concerns that quitting tobacco limits coping strategies. The Work Group's confidence in this evidence "was moderate", and studies of machine-based individualized delivery "were insufficiently powered to detect a statistically significant difference… because of the small sample sizes".

### Clozapine [^114gi7m4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers

Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Consider reducing the clozapine dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Anticholinergic Drugs

Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.16)].

Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation

Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of clozapine. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

### Treatment with antipsychotics in pregnancy: changes in drug disposition [^117NSxkk]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

None of the remaining drugs of our study have previously been investigated with respect to changes in serum levels in pregnancy. From a theoretic perspective, the major CYP enzymes involved in the metabolism of perphenazine (CYP2D6), ziprasidone (CYP3A4), and haloperidol and risperidone (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) 13 suggest that their serum levels could decline in pregnancy, as they do for aripiprazole and quetiapine. We did find a trend towards declining perphenazine concentrations in pregnancy. For instance, in Figure S2 almost all serum perphenazine intramuscular concentrations in pregnant women were below the median (gray line) of the nonpregnant population. This is particularly interesting, as nonadherence is not an issue for intramuscular administration. Also for oral perphenazine and haloperidol, a corresponding trend was found. However, it should be emphasized that the number of observations was low, thus being vulnerable to variations caused by confounding factors in single subjects, such as outlier observations due to nonadherence or erroneous dose information. For ziprasidone and risperidone the numbers were even smaller and the trends even less clear.

For olanzapine and clozapine the estimates for alterations in the serum concentrations during pregnancy were closer to zero, indicating no or little change. Although the confidence intervals for these estimates are narrower for olanzapine (with observations from 29 pregnancies) than for clozapine (with observations from four pregnancies only) it is interesting to note that both these drugs have a metabolism largely dependent on CYP1A2, 13 an enzyme that has been shown to have a decreased activity during the second and third trimesters. 6, 18 This could explain why our results for these drugs may differ from the others. Another explanation that cannot be excluded is reduced cigarette smoking during pregnancy, which would also result in decreased CYP1A2 activity. 19 Unfortunately, information on smoking habits was not available in our dataset.

It is also of importance to explore when and how maternal serum concentrations return to normal following delivery. Some researchers have provided evidence of a postpartum drop in metabolic capacity that could result in briefly elevated drug concentrations (i.e. higher than baseline) for some antidepressants during the first 6–8 weeks following delivery. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 Due to few postpartum observations our study can neither confirm nor rule out that such a refractory period occurs for antipsychotic agents. However, our data do indicate that serum concentrations return back to baseline values within the first weeks after delivery (Figure 2 and Figure S1), as also shown previously for aripiprazole. 9

### Unidentifiedgenotype does not affect pharmacological treatment for patients with first episode psychosis [^114sVXws]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although we did not confirm the previous findings regarding CYP2D6 phenotype, our results did partly agree withregarding other factors. Namely, we found that risperidone dose was weakly, but significantly, correlated with all three PANSS scales. These scales were also positively correlated with dosage in the complete sample, as well as the PGx actionable subset, although correlation strength remained weak. These three scales were also most often found to correlate with dosage for other drugs, suggesting that at higher scores of the PANSS, higher chlorpromazine-equivalent dose would be prescribed. These findings may not be unanticipated, considering that higher scores of the PANSS are associated with increased impairment related to psychotic symptoms. Sex has also previously demonstrated to be related to dosage, as women are often prescribed lower doses due to for example, differences in body composition, such as smaller organs and increased fatty tissue, different gastric emptying and intestinal motility, and drug metabolism. Similarly, smoking status has been associated previously with increased dose, which may be due to the effect of smoking on CYP1A2 activity, an enzyme also involved in the metabolism of certain drugs for psychosis, such as olanzapine and clozapine. Thus, our results are in line with existing literature on patient factors affecting dose. Illness duration was also found to be positively, albeit weakly, associated with dose. A possible explanation is that patients may be in need of a progressively higher dose to continue to manage symptoms over time, although previous research suggests that increasing dose for maintenance does not lead to improved outcomes. Rather, this correlation may represent treatment resistant patients, as the PANSS positive scale was also significantly correlated with illness duration and dose. Since acute treatment drug efficacy is greater for positive symptoms, a combination of higher PANSS positive score and longer illness duration may suggest a lack of treatment response and potential treatment resistance.

### The effect of clozapine on premature mortality: an assessment of clinical monitoring and other potential confounders [^112uDF65]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations include the possibility of residual confounding, particularly medication use prior to the observation period. We only examined cases newly prescribed clozapine during the observation period and did not investigate mortality associations beyond 5 years. Despite our strategy of using propensity scores to perform sensitivity analysis and adjustment sensitivity, confounding by indication is an important consideration which cannot be ruled out entirely in any observational study. However, we found no evidence to suggest that clinicians were reserving clozapine for patients who were healthier (apart from being younger). Instead, those individuals who were prescribed clozapine had more severe psychopathology and poorer functional status (consistent with clozapine being a third line treatment). Consequently one would expect that the true association between clozapine and reduced mortality risk would be at least as strong or stronger than that which we observed. In addition we adjusted for indicators of severity of illness including diagnosis, symptoms, physical illness, and functional status; however, a reliable assessment of duration of psychiatric illness was not available. Ultimately, the only means of excluding residual confounding is through randomized controlled trial evidence, which we do not believe is likely to be forthcoming to address this particular question.

Adverse lifestyle choices (other than drinking problems and opiate use), such as smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity which may also contribute to the increased risk of mortality in individuals with SMIwere not controlled for in this analysis, although it is not clear that those prescribed clozapine are likely to differ in these respects compared to people prescribed other antipsychotics. Also general practice data and glucose or cholesterol data were not available for inclusion in this analysis. It is possible that the increased clinical contact received by those prescribed clozapine might provide greater opportunities for clinicians to influence the lifestyle choices of their patients. However, this is unlikely to account for the association between clozapine and reduced risk of mortality, since this association persisted after adjustment for level of clinical contact. Specialist mental healthcare is provided at no cost to consumers as part of the UK National Health Service (NHS), so the only missing mental health service contacts would be from individuals seeking exclusively private healthcare.

The results of this investigation have important implications for clinical practice. Our results suggest that the observed protective effect of clozapine is not due to the extra clinical contact, as previously suggested, nor due to confounding by the broad range of other covariates that we examined. Clozapine appears to reduce the risk of both natural and unnatural mortality in patients with SMI. Current guidelines restricting the use of clozapine to those with treatment resistant SMI may need revising.

### Is clozapine-induced weight gain dose-dependent? Results from a prospective cohort study [^1168Khmo]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Table 1 compares clinical variables between patients whose total average dose during the follow-up was < 200 or ≥ 200 mg/day. Patients receiving high doses were more likely to be smokers (P = .001), diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (P < .001), had higher weight at baseline (P = .02) and were younger (P < .001), most of the adults (64.8%) taking doses ≥ 200 mg/day in contrast with old-age patients mainly taking doses < 200 mg/day (60.7%).

Table 1.
Comparison of Clinical Variables Among Patients Receiving an Average of < 200 or ≥ 200 mg/day

Treatment duration and dose were significantly associated with weight change over 1 year (table 2), with a 0.50% increase in weight for each additional month (P < .001), and a 0.48% increase in weight for each 100 mg dose increase (P = .004). Applying the piecewise function at a dose value of 200 mg/day, the weight increase for each additional 100 mg was +0.59% for doses ≥ 200 mg/day (eg, for dose increases from 300 to 400 mg/day, P = .001), and +1.12% for doses < 200 mg/day (eg, for dose increases from 20 to 120 mg/day, P = .003). Since weight gain can occur rapidly in the first 3 months of treatment, the piecewise function was also applied to the treatment duration covariate at 3 months, and the dose effects were evaluated before and after this cutoff. The estimated weight increase for each additional month was +0.47% for treatment duration values greater than 3 months and +0.84% for treatment duration values up to 3 months (P < .001). The dose was significantly associated with weight change for treatment duration values greater than 3 months, with a +0.54% weight increase estimated for each additional 100 mg increment (P = .004). On the other hand, the dose was not associated with weight change for treatment duration values up to 3 months, although a trend was observed (+0.33%, P = .075). The 3 models revealed no further associations between weight change and another clinical covariate (eg, age, sex, baseline weight, see Supplementary table 2). However, patients taking antihypertensive drugs gained a mean of 2.77% more weight than patients not taking these comedications (P = .03).

### Utilizing plasma drug levels and genetic testing to achieve optimal treatment response in a patient with treatment-resistant schizoaffective disorder [^113Feqa7]. Bipolar Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

We report the case of a Chinese male with schizoaffective disorder, an active smoker and a nonresponder to clozapine (600mg daily). Therapeutic clozapine monitoring was analyzed, revealing a low concentration-dose ratio. A pharmacogenetic test showed that the patient had the CYP1A2*1F/*1F genotype, indicating an ultra-rapid clozapine metabolizer. In combination with fluvoxamine, a CYP1A2 enzyme inhibitor, clozapine plasma concentrations approached the reference range and achieved clinical improvement. This case demonstrates how pharmacogenetics can help understand the value of therapeutic drug monitoring to enhance the treatment of refractory schizoaffective disorder.

### Prescribing clozapine in the UK: quality improvement issues identified by clinical audit [^111G94vC]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Antipsychotic regimen before starting clozapine

In the subsample of patients treated with clozapine for less than 18 weeks (481 patients in the baseline audit and 396 in the re-audit), information was collected on the antipsychotic regimen prescribed immediately before clozapine was started. Regarding the route of administration, the majority (57%) of patients had been prescribed an oral antipsychotic medication only, whereas an LAI antipsychotic medication had been prescribed for 21% of patients, and a combination of oral and LAI antipsychotic medication for 13% of patients. The remaining 9% of patients had not been prescribed any antipsychotic medication. These percentages were the same in the two audits. Almost two-thirds of the patients in this subsample had been prescribed antipsychotic monotherapy within the licensed dosage range, 65% in the baseline audit and 63% at re-audit, whereas more than one antipsychotic medication was prescribed for 21% and 23%, respectively, and a single antipsychotic in high dose for 6% and 5%, respectively.

Change in smoking status

In the subsample of patients treated with clozapine for between 18 weeks and 1 year (599 patients in the baseline audit and 458 at re-audit), 47% and 50% of patients, respectively, were documented as tobacco smokers. In the baseline audit, of the 77 smokers who had been discharged from a smoke-free ward, the implications of a potential change in smoking status on plasma clozapine concentration, and consequent adjustments to clozapine dose, had been considered in the care plans of 25 (32%). At re-audit, 53 smokers had been discharged from a smoke-free ward and the implications of a potential change in smoking status had been considered in 28 (53%). In the baseline audit subsample, clozapine was included in 58% of the SCRs, whereas at re-audit the respective proportion was 72%.

Accuracy of the Summary Care Record

In the subsample of patients treated with clozapine for more than a year who were under the care of a community mental health team (3,902 patients in the baseline audit and 4,738 at re-audit), information was collected about whether their SCRs identified clozapine as a currently prescribed medication.

### Lessons learnt in the end-of-life management of a hospice inpatient with advanced oropharyngeal cancer established on clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia [^1115ghFj]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Clozapine is a tightly controlled medication used effectively as a last-line agent in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, with a relatively narrow therapeutic window and significant interactions. Both underdosing and toxicity can be catastrophic to the patient. Patients with complex mental health illnesses are more at risk of head and neck cancers due to the high prevalence of associated risk factors including smoking, diet and alcohol. These patients also face barriers to accessing and using healthcare and may not tolerate procedures for artificial routes for feeding and medications. As the disease progresses, these patients are vulnerable to clozapine toxicity from factors such as constipation, reduction in cigarette smoking, weight loss and medication interactions. Conversely, they also risk underdosing with a relapse of distressing psychotic symptoms as the swallow deteriorates. This case highlights the need for considerate planning, prescribing, close monitoring and awareness alongside the importance of multidisciplinary working when caring for this patient group.

### Identification of a novel polymorphism associated with reduced clozapine concentration in schizophrenia patients-a genome-wide association study adjusting for smoking habits [^1138wDTi]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics

The study population consisted of patients with TRS as determined by TDM of CLZ per se, since use of this drug is solely indicated for TRS. In Norway, TDM analyses are reimbursed by the governmental health service, and it is used as a tool for clinical follow-up in psychiatry. The analyses are typically requested as a routine control to monitor e.g. adherence and drug–drug interactions, or to assess adverse effects or lack of effect, in relation to a therapeutic concentration reference range. All results from the analyses are interpreted by the TDM laboratory against the therapeutic reference range as basis for the reports sent to the physicians.

The therapeutic reference ranges used in our TDM service are based on international standards as defined by the AGNP working group. However, they are adjusted according to the concentrations measured at our laboratory in a Norwegian patient population during therapeutic dosing. In the case of CLZ, the applied therapeutic reference range at our laboratory is 300–2500 nmol/L, while the AGNP reference range is 1071–1835 nmol/L. The AGNP definition of 1071 nmol/L (= 350 ng/ml) as the lower therapeutic concentration boundary is based on several studies correlating clinical response and serum concentration of CLZ, e.g. the study by Perry et al. showing that only 22% of the patients with concentration < 350 ng/mL were responders (i.e. ≥ 20% reduction in symptom score), while 64% of the patients above the limit were responders. This was supported by a follow-up study where the majority of nonresponders achieved clinical effects when the serum CLZ levels were raised above 350 ng/mL. However, in the present study, we use a more conservative lower serum concentration boundary, i.e. 300 nmol/L, since it is applied in our clinical TDM service based on Norwegian data. Use of 300 nmol/L as the lower boundary also increases the likelihood of poor clinical efficacy of CLZ when serum concentrations are below this threshold. In addition, a CLZ concentration of 300 nmol/L corresponds with a brain dopamine-2 (D2) receptor occupancy of about 20–40%, which is regarded as critical for clinical effect.

The TDM service at the Diakonhjemmet Hospital in Oslo analyses serum samples from psychiatric patients mainly located in the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, and ~25% of the submitted samples are from hospitalized patients.

### Identification of a novel polymorphism associated with reduced clozapine concentration in schizophrenia patients-a genome-wide association study adjusting for smoking habits [^116CJjZJ]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of TDM data for research purposes is associated with some methodological limitations, where potential nonadherence is a relevant issue creating 'nonbiological' variability in the concentration phenotype. Unknown co-medications may also alter CLZ metabolism and concentration, but in the current material, co-prescription of the most relevant interacting drugs was accounted for, i.e. phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and fluvoxamine, which all change the CLZ concentration several-fold. In addition, information on comorbidity, weight, and potential consumption of dietary supplements potentially affecting concentration phenotypes was not available. The amount of cigarette consumption could not be obtained, but the enzyme-inducing effect of smoking is little affected by the degree of cigarette consumption.

In conclusion, the present GWAS on CLZ pharmacokinetics, adjusting for known smoking habits, identified a novel variant in the NFIB gene (rs28379954) associated with a significant reduction in CLZ levels. These results suggest that patients carrying the minor C allele are at risk of subtherapeutic CLZ serum concentrations, particularly in smokers. Thus, genotyping of rs28379954 may potentially aid individualized dosing of CLZ in clinical practice.

### Clozapine safety monitoring and related research in psychiatry and neurology in south America: a scoping review [^117HLxF2]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The quality and quantity of clozapine safety monitoring considerably differs among South American countries and mainly focus on hematological surveillance. Few studies have been conducted on other clozapine-related adverse effects (ADRs) and mainly refer to case reports and literature reviews. We retrieved thirty-nine publications on clozapine related ADRs others than neutropenia. Studies in Brazil and Venezuela accounted for 67% of all the publications, and 8 out of 12 countries published 2 or less manuscripts. Only Chile offers serum clozapine level measurement in public institutions. Given the recently recognized role of ethnicity, gender, smoking, obesity drug interactions in optimal clozapine administration, modernization of clozapine clinical use and research in psychiatry and neurology most be broadcasted and stimulated in South American countries.

### Identification of a novel polymorphism associated with reduced clozapine concentration in schizophrenia patients-a genome-wide association study adjusting for smoking habits [^113SjTW8]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Clozapine (CLZ) is the superior antipsychotic drug for treatment of schizophrenia, but exhibits an extensive interpatient pharmacokinetic variability. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CLZ serum concentration adjusting for known smoking habits, which is a major nongenetic factor reducing CLZ levels. The study included 484 patients with 10,283 steady-state serum concentrations of CLZ and N-desmethylclozapine, prescribed dosing, co-medications and known smoking habits (n = 422; 9284 serum samples) from a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) service. The GWAS analyses were performed with and without smoking habits as covariate, where possible hits were assessed in relation to the target CLZ concentration range applied in the TDM service (300–2500nmol/L). The smoking-independent analysis of N-desmethylclozapine serum concentration and the CLZ-to-N-desmethylclozapine ratio replicated the previously identified locus on chromosome 4. After adjusting for smoking habits in patients confirmed as 'smokers' (61%) or 'nonsmokers' (39%), a novel variant (rs28379954; minor T > C allele frequency 4.1%; 7.6% CT carriers in the population) within the gene encoding the nuclear factor 1 B-type (NFIB) was significantly associated with reduced CLZ serum concentration (p = 1.68×10–8, beta = -0.376; explained variance 7.63%). There was no significant association between rs28379954 and N-desmethylclozapine concentration in the GWAS analysis (p = 5.63×10–5). The fraction of CLZ TDM samples below 300nmol/L was significantly higher in carriers vs. noncarriers of the rs28379954 minor C allele [12.0% (95% CI: 9.4–14.7) vs. 6.2% (95% CI: 5.7–6.8), p < 0.001]. We identified a novel variant in the NFIB gene associated with reduced CLZ levels and increased risk of subtherapeutic serum concentrations. This warrants testing of clinical relevance of screening for this gene variant, and also experimental studies to investigate the biological mechanisms of NFIB involvement in CLZ pharmacokinetics.

### Genome-wide association analyses of symptom severity among clozapine-treated patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [^112pFwsD]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

A promising strategy for the identification of genetic variation associated with symptom severity among clozapine users, is the genome-wide association study (GWAS) that also allows to generate data for polygenic risk scoring (PRS). Several GWASs have identified candidate loci for clozapine blood concentrations and severe adverse drug reactions associated with clozapine, but limited focus has been given to symptomatic outcomes in patients using clozapine. To our knowledge, there has only been one study that used a genome-wide approach to examine clozapine treatment outcome. In that study of 123 clozapine-treated individuals, no statistically significant differences in schizophrenia-PRS between responders and nonresponders were detected (N = 123, p = 0.06). PRS analyses performed to uncover differences between responders and nonresponders of other antipsychotics have yielded inconsistent results.

Another promising approach that complements GWAS and PRS, is the examination of known haplotype variation in genes associated with clozapine metabolism. CYP1A2 is considered the primary metabolism pathway for clozapine with secondary minor contributions from CYP3A4/5, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 that collectively produce two metabolites, norclozapine (active) and clozapine n-oxide (inactive). Although norclozapine possesses the hallmark characteristics of an atypical antipsychotic, it is thought to have little antipsychotic activity and may be responsible for side effects. The role CYP enzymes play in clozapine metabolism can be exemplified by the comparison of clozapine blood concentrations of smokers and nonsmokers. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons produced by smoking are established inducers of CYP1A2 enzymatic activity and smokers have consistently been shown to have lower clozapine and higher norclozapine blood concentrations compared to nonsmokers. Thus, the relationship between CYP enzyme activity and clozapine metabolism is notable, can differ between persons, and as a result, clozapine blood concentrations among individuals prescribed the same dose may vary. Because of this variation, therapeutic drug monitoring of clozapine blood concentrations is routinely applied. Previous studies have suggested that clozapine blood concentrations ≥ 350 ng/mL are associated with superior symptomatic outcome. However, determining the required dose for an individual to achieve this target blood concentration and symptomatic relief can be challenging. As such, several studies have used haplotype variation in CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 as markers of an individual's capacity to metabolize clozapine and their probability of receiving symptomatic relief. Although results of these studies have been inconsistent, recent findings suggest these inconsistencies could be a result of phenoconversion, a phenomenon in which an individual's genotype-predicted drug metabolism does not reflect their observed metabolism, due to the presence of nongenetic factors such as concomitant medications (e.g. (es)citalopram) and smoking behavior. Thus, we hypothesized that genotype-predicted drug metabolism corrected for phenoconversion would be associated with clozapine blood concentrations and symptom severity.

### Is clozapine-induced weight gain dose-dependent? Results from a prospective cohort study [^113iiv84]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analyses

Clinical variables were compared between patients taking a total average dose above or below the median value (ie, ≥ 200 vs < 200 mg/day, which was determined considering every dose observation of each patient), using the χ 2 or Fisher tests for categorical variables as appropriate, and the Wilcoxon test for continuous variables. The dose effect on weight change was evaluated using linear mixed-effects models, adjusted for treatment duration, age, sex, baseline weight, treatment setting (ie, in- vs out-patients), and the intake of medical (ie, lipid-lowering, antidiabetic, and antihypertensive drugs) and psychotropic comedications (ie, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and weight-inducing psychotropic drugs). As the clozapine prescribed dose depends on the diagnoses and serum clozapine levels are affected by smoking status, models were also adjusted for both diagnoses and smoking status. Weight changes were expressed as a percentage of baseline weight. Since greater weight gain can be detected in the first 3 months of treatment, the piecewise function was applied with a knot at 3 months to the treatment duration variable, and the effect of the dose was also analyzed before and after this knot. The piecewise function was also applied to the dose variable to evaluate its effect on weight change for dose increases above (eg, 250–350 or 400–500 mg) and below (20–120 or 50–150 mg) the median dose (ie, 200 mg). Since the majority of included patients had glucose and/or cholesterol and/or blood pressure observations only in the first 4 months of treatment, linear mixed-effects models were performed over this time frame adjusting for treatment duration, age, sex, baseline body mass index, smoking status, and diagnoses. Patients taking medical drugs related to our outcomes were excluded (ie, patients taking antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and lipid-lowering medications were excluded from models evaluating blood pressure, glucose, and lipid values, respectively). Finally, logistic regression was also applied to detect whether the dose was associated with a substantial weight gain (≥ 5% for 1 monthand ≥ 7% during follow-up). Statistical significance was set at a P -value ≤ .05 and the analyses were performed using Stata 16.1 (StataCorp; College Station, Texas) and the statistical software package R-4.0.2.

### Clozapine and anemia: a 2-year follow-up study [^116CBDN8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Clozapine's association with agranulocytosis led to the implementation of stringent and mandatory hematologic monitoring guidelines in most countries. Although other hematologic aberrations such as eosinophilia and neutropenia have been previously described, clozapine's impact on the erythroid lineage has not been studied. There is a suspicion that a higher rate of anemia is observed in patients receiving clozapine; therefore, we hypothesized that there would be a higher rate of anemia in patients receiving clozapine therapy.

Method

All individuals initiated on clozapine at our center from 2009 to 2010 were recruited. Information on age, gender, medical comorbidities, and smoking status was extracted from the medical records. Data from complete blood counts over a 2-year follow-up period were extracted, with anemia defined as a hemoglobin value below 120 g/L for women and 130 g/L for men. Time to anemia event was calculated and Cox regression was employed to identify predictors of anemia.

Results

We found a high incidence of anemia in the first 2 years following clozapine initiation; of the 94 individuals (68 men, 26 women) recruited, 23 (24.5%) developed anemia. Higher baseline hemoglobin level (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, P = .002) and smoking status (HR = 0.21, P = .021) were identified as significant protective factors against anemia in men but not in women (HR = 0.92, P = .184, and HR = 0.52, P = .467 for baseline hemoglobin and smoking, respectively).

Conclusions

Although smoking appears to lower the risk of anemia, we believe this is due to smoking's up-regulation of hemoglobin levels. Further studies are warranted in light of the present findings; for example, we cannot exclude the possibility that anemia was an epiphenomenon, characterizing instead a population with severe mental illness.

### Impact of patient-specific factors on clozapine metabolism in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [^115RcANW]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The direction and magnitude of patient-specific factors' impact on clozapine's rate of metabolism (measured by change in C/D ratios) was evaluated in a cohort of hospitalized patients with treatment-resistant psychotic illnesses. Given the inpatient and specialized setting of the study, there was high accuracy in the timing of clozapine dosing and blood samples for plasma concentration quantification. Furthermore, supervision by trained nurses increased the likelihood of high adherence rates.

Our results demonstrate that fluvoxamine has a strong, positive dose–response relationship with C/D ratios. Fluvoxamine use independently explained the most variance in clozapine C/D ratios and reduced the effect size of other patient-specific factors in the subgroup of participants prescribed fluvoxamine. Unlike previously published literature that suggested a possible balancing out effect between CYP1A2 inducing effects of smoking and CYP1A2 inhibiting effects of fluvoxamine augmentation, our findings suggest that in a dose-related fashion, fluvoxamine will ultimately override the inducing effects of smoking. Consequently, concomitant use of fluvoxamine with clozapine, specifically at higher doses, requires rigorous TDM and should generally be avoided at the time of initiation of clozapine to decrease the risk of rapid dose accumulation and clozapine-associated inflammation.

In the subgroup of patients not on fluvoxamine, CRP elevation was the strongest patient-specific factor in predicting an increase in clozapine levels followed by nonsmoking status, female sex, and obesity. Initiation of clozapine treatment is associated with inflammation, including but not limited to myocarditis, which requires close monitoring. CRP measures have been recommended at baseline prior to initiation of clozapine and weekly throughout the initial few weeks following drug commencement. Notably, compared to the general population, a diagnosis of schizophrenia and common comorbidities like metabolic syndrome are linked to greater levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the bloodstream as well as persistently elevated CRP. Using the cutoff of > 10 mg/L, we were able to include individuals with persistent CRP elevation, and our results confirm its strong association with a decreased rate of clozapine metabolism not just in early treatment, but throughout. Therefore, CRP plasma levels have therapeutic significance when used in conjunction with TDM for dose adjustments and evaluation of dose-related adverse effects. Like fluvoxamine, the dose–response relationship between CRP levels and C/D ratios was strong and positive. This association has the clinical implication that acute infections or inflammations can precipitate clozapine toxicity.

### Is clozapine-induced weight gain dose-dependent? Results from a prospective cohort study [^114GquTQ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

One of the main limitations of the present study was the limited sample size; followed by the lack of information on food, alcohol intake, and/or physical activity; which could have influenced the weight change. History of previous antipsychotic use was also unavailable, and it probably also influenced the weight change, as patients previously taking high-risk drugs for inducing weight gain might have gained weight differently than patients previously taking low-risk drugs or no psychotropic drug (eg, after a wash-out period). However, since clozapine prescription is limited to non-responders to other antipsychotic drugs (ie, except for patients affected by dopaminergic agent-induced psychoses), we are confident that most of the included patients were not antipsychotic naïve, with the exception of elderly patients. Additionally, the homogeneous previous exposure to antipsychotics may explain the discrete, albeit statistically significant, effect size of weight gain per month and/or per clozapine dose unit in this study, since weight gain probably occurred already during the previous treatments, and clozapine was prescribed in a stage where more weight gain is less likely. Therefore, the clinical trend suggesting that clozapine should be used in the early stages of psychosis, may reveal that clozapine as a first-choice treatment can induce greater weight gain per month and/or per 100 mg. Adherence to treatment through clozapine plasma concentrations could also not be ascertained, but the administered doses for inpatients were available. Moreover, it would also have been of interest to analyze weight change and plasma concentration correlation, since there is interindividual variability in the metabolism of clozapine based on environmental (ie, smoking status with PAHs present in tobacco smoke being a strong inducer of the clozapine metabolizer cytochrome P4501A2) and genetic factors (ie, cytochrome P4501A2 and other gene polymorphisms). Finally, concerning glucose, lipid levels, and/or blood pressure, a 12-month analysis could not have been done due to the limited number of observations after the first 4 months of treatment. On the other hand, the present naturalistic study allowed examination of the effect of clozapine dose on metabolic adverse effects in a real-world setting, giving further indications about weight consequences following clozapine dose lowering and/or increasing. Altogether, additional studies need to be performed to better define the dose effect on weight change in larger age- and sex-stratified cohorts, and also on glucose; total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol; triglyceride and blood pressure values, taking into account additional confounders unavailable in the present study (eg, physical activities), and interventional controlled studies randomized for age, diagnosis, and other weight-related clinical variables (eg, physical activity and diet) should be considered to confirm our results.

### Co-medication with disulfiram markedly increased serum clozapine levels: two case reports [^11789je4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1.
Clozapine and norclozapine serum levels of Patient 1 presented in chronological order from left to right with information on the clinical situation, dose of clozapine and whether disulfiram was in use.

Patient 2 is a 26-year-old male of Caucasian origin admitted to our unit in August 2020, who had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia one year prior and clozapine treatment had been initiated in July 2020. He also had a history of multiple substance abuse. He was a heavy smoker (20–40 cigarettes/d). In September, his clozapine dose was 400 mg/d and the corresponding serum level of clozapine was 728 nmol/l (240 ng/ml) and norclozapine 524 nmol/l (162 ng/ml). Disulfiram treatment was commenced 1 week later (in September) with 200 mg/d to discourage his urge to use alcohol and simultaneously his clozapine dose was increased to 650 mg/d. Two weeks after these changes in drug treatment, his clozapine serum level had risen to 2206 nmol/l (728 ng/ml) and norclozapine to 1048 nmol/l (325 ng/ml). Thus, the rise in serum clozapine level was threefold, although the clozapine dose was only increased 1.6-fold. His clozapine dose was decreased slightly to 600 mg/d and this yielded a clozapine serum level of 2133 nmol/l (704 ng/ml) and a norclozapine serum level of 1380 nmol/l (428 ng/ml). At that point, the patient's regular co-medications were olanzapine 10–20 mg/d, chlorprotixen 25mg–100 mg/d, scopolamine 1 mg/72 h transdermal preparation (for excess salivation) and buprenorphine long-acting injectable 16 mg/1 week. His liver enzymes were monitored and were within the normal range. The patient began to experience worsening psychotic symptoms in mid-October; he was more agitated and had to be kept indoors. The staff noted that his coffee intake increased substantially up to several mugs of filtered coffee daily over a few days. Then, in late October, the patient started to vomit, complained of headache and sore throat, and was admitted to the emergency unit. He had received one injection of zuclopenthixol 50 mg intramuscularly one day before his admission to the emergency unit. His body temperature was slightly elevated to 37.3°C (99.1° Fahrenheit). His leukocyte count was 17.0 × 10 9 /l (reference range: 3.4–8.2 × 10 9 /l), C-reactive protein (CRP) was 11 mg/l (reference range: 0–10 mg/l), alanine transaminase was 18 U/l (reference range under 50 U/l) and gamma-glutamyl transferase was 29 U/l (reference range under 60 U/l), but his creatinine kinase level was 1416 U/l (reference range 50–400 U/l). Clozapine levels were checked when the patient was admitted to the emergency unit, but there was a delay of 6 days before these results were available. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) was suspected and all other antipsychotics (except clozapine) were discontinued. Clozapine was continued with a reduced dose of 400 mg. The results of the serum clozapine levels received 6 days later were high; clozapine 5597 nmol/l (1830 ng/ml) and norclozapine 2750 nmol/l (899 ng/ml). Clozapine was discontinued immediately when these toxic levels were ascertained and disulfiram treatment was also discontinued in November. The patient's liver enzymes began to rise after this but were normalized within a month. Clozapine was re-started slowly over several weeks, starting with a smaller dose and gradually increasing to a higher dose, which the patient tolerated without any complications. His caffeine intake, smoking and clozapine serum levels were constantly monitored and his latest dose of clozapine is 500 mg with serum levels of clozapine 1816 nmol/l (598 ng/ml) and norclozapine 797 nmol/l (247 ng/ml). Later, the patient received zuclopenthixol, chlorprotixen and olanzapine on several occasions without developing any signs of toxicity or NMS. Patient 2 was pharmacogenetically tested (GeneAccount, Abomics; Pharmacogenetics Applied into Clinical Practice |.) and he had CYP1A2 genotype *1F/*1F, meaning increased inducibility and normal metabolic findings for CYP3A4, CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. The clozapine and norclozapine serum levels of Patient 2 are reported in Table 2.

### Common practical questions-and answers-at the British Association for Psychopharmacology child and adolescent psychopharmacology course [^111oSuV1]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

How do I treat an adolescent with treatment-resistant schizophrenia?

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is defined by persistence of significant symptoms, despite adequate treatment with at least two different antipsychotics, lasting 6 weeks each, and during which there was no appreciable symptomatic or functional improvement, as measured by validated rating instruments. It can be present from the beginning of therapy or develop over time, often after relapses.

Before considering that a patient has a treatment-resistant schizophrenia, we need to investigate possible causes of lack of effectiveness of prescribed treatments. After reviewing diagnosis, we should document adequate treatment adherence and make sure that optimal medication dosages have been used. In children and adolescents, antipsychotics should not be dosed according to weight, but rather using a 'start slow, go slow' approach, raising the dose until reaching recommended maximum doses or until adverse events appear. If a trial cannot be completed at the adequate dose, then another treatment should be tried until two adequate trials of different antipsychotics are completed. Adequate treatment of medical and psychiatric comorbidities should also be implemented (medication or psychosocial interventions as needed), paying attention to potential drug interactions that may increase adverse effects or diminish efficacy of antipsychotic medication.

According to NICE guidelines, clozapine should be offered to children and young people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. This recommendation is based on evidence of clozapine being significantly more effective than other antipsychotics in children and adolescents. Clozapine monitoring trough plasma levels may help to guide dosing. Greatest efficacy is seen at levels ⩾350 µg/L, although this level is not universal, and factors such as gender, inflammation or tobacco or caffeine consumption may alter clozapine plasma levels.

Initiation of clozapine requires a careful balance of the risk/benefit ratio and commitment to the increased monitoring requirements by patient, family and psychiatrist. Psychiatrists should adopt a proactive approach on assessment, intervention and reassurance for patients and families, as most side effects will appear during the first weeks of treatment and could be managed without discontinuation.

### Impact of patient-specific factors on clozapine metabolism in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [^112s8F1C]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, Asian ancestry trended toward an association with a lower rate of metabolism without meeting statistical significance. A larger cohort free from the dominating effects of potent CYP1A2 inhibitors would likely be necessary to demonstrate statistical significance. This study could not confirm the findings of a prior small study that revealed Indigenous ancestry, similar to Asian ancestry, may be linked with lower rates of clozapine metabolism. The present study is inconclusive given the small number of participants self-identifying as Indigenous Canadians, and the global designation "Indigenous people of Americas" may underestimate the genetic diversity and mixed ancestry in the vast continent and may overstate its impact on variability in plasma concentration of clozapine.

There are several limitations of this study. First, given the retrospective real-world nature of the clinical data, there may be some inaccuracies, such as the time of administration, patient adherence, and dietary habits. In addition, it was not possible to quantify the amount of coffee consumed or number of cigarettes smoked daily. However, these issues were mitigated as much as possible, as all patients were institutionalized and under direct supervision for dosing, blood sample collection, and day-to-day function. Second, in this study, ancestry was determined by self-identification and not by genetic testing. Nonetheless, this study is representative of real-world practice; genetic ancestry testing is not done in clinical settings. Third, we relied on a single measure of the serum clozapine level in patients with only one available clozapine TDM at steady-state conditions (n = 78), which cannot account for any intra-individual variation in clozapine kinetics. Fourth, we were not able to determine whether participants were assessed to be clozapine rapid metabolizers prior to the initiation of fluvoxamine by clinicians. Fifth, we acknowledge that we have combined two distinct diagnoses, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder which may have distinct overall underlying demographic and clinical factors.

### Use of very-high-dose olanzapine in treatment-resistant schizophrenia [^112xwrdD]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is a chronic illness with a progressive course that can be marked by resistance to antipsychotic treatment. This can make therapeutic support challenging for the practitioner, with results that are partial and unsatisfactory. In the literature, treatment with high-dose olanzapine (> 20mg/day) appears to be a good alternative to clozapine, the gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In the present observational prospective study, we studied the clinical and biological profiles of patients treated with olanzapine doses up to 100mg/day. In total, 50 patients were clinically and biologically assessed. We found a linear relationship between oral dose and serum concentration (Pearson's r = 0.83, p < 0.001) with effects of tobacco (p < 0.05) and of coffee and tea consumption (p < 0.01). Tolerance seemed to be good regardless of dose. No link was found between concentration and efficiency. Despite a nonexhaustive assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters, not least pharmacogenetic data (e.g., genotyping of cytochrome P450–1A2 or glycoprotein P Abcb1a), pharmacokinetic aspects alone cannot account for why the disease may sometimes be resistant to 20mg of olanzapine but respond to higher doses. A nuclear imaging study exploring brain occupancy by high-dose olanzapine, coupled with the abovementioned pharmacokinetic assessment, may prove a relevant experimental paradigm for studying the pathophysiological mechanisms of resistant schizophrenia.

### Co-medication with disulfiram markedly increased serum clozapine levels: two case reports [^1175imjU]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We reported two cases where dramatic changes in clozapine serum levels occurred when co-medicating with two widely used, older drugs. As far as we know, no earlier reports of similar cases have been presented.

The Finnish Medicines Agency had no reports of similar incidences. According to the Eudravigilance database, there were no reports of a suspected interaction between clozapine and disulfiram. There were four reports of adverse effects of clozapine treatment in conjunction with altered clozapine serum levels (two elevated and two decreased) and concurrent use of disulfiram, but there was no information as to whether disulfiram had been initiated recently or had been in use for a longer period (.).

Clozapine metabolism is mediated by cytochrome P450 system, mainly by CYP1A2. The role of genetic polymorphisms in CYP1A2 and its effect on clozapine medication in clinical setting is poorly understood. The habitual clinical factors determining clozapine metabolism are age, ethnicity, sex, weight and smoking The first report that disulfiram may affect a metabolic pathway, which later was to be nominated as cytochrome P450 CYP1A2 system, was published in 1986, when it was reported that administering disulfiram to recovering alcoholics delayed their caffeine clearance by up to 30% when compared to healthy test subjects. Caffeine is metabolized by CYP1A2 system and is the only approved test substrate in studies on CYP1A2 metabolism. The effect of chronic disulfiram exposure on different cytochrome P450 systems has been studied later with the finding that disulfiram inhibits CYP2E1 in particular, but also has a wider effect on drug metabolizing enzymes (.;). Interestingly, the potential of disulfiram to inhibit clozapine metabolism was speculated on in a letter to the editor in 1994, but the authors considered it more as a potential factor for increasing efficacy of treatment through increased clozapine serum levels.

### Effects of clozapine treatment on the improvement of substance use disorders other than nicotine in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113V926B]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42022307739) and followed the 2020 PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses) reporting recommendations. Systematic searches of the peer-reviewed literature were conducted following PRESS guidelines in consultation with a medical librarian in four electronic databases (i.e. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and CINAHL) from inception to March 1, 2022. The keywords included two concepts: (1) clozapine and (2) substance use or SUD terms (excluding nicotine). Database searches and an exhaustive list of key terms are provided in the. Two reviewers performed title/abstract screening and full-text article screening (RR and MD) for eligibility for inclusion. Articles for which a consensus between the two reviewers was not obtained were evaluated by a third reviewer (CS). In addition, a web-based citation chaser was used for backward and forward citation chasing for additional references not identified in our primary searches. Literature in human subjects published in English was included according to the following criteria: (1) research including participants treated with clozapine and (2) research providing information on SUD parameters other than nicotine. Prospective clinical trials with or without randomization, prospective and retrospective observational studies, cross-sectional studies, and case reports were included. Abstracts of presentations and conference posters were also considered for inclusion.

Two independent reviewers (RR and MD) used a custom data extraction template to summarize the selected articles. Extraction information included author names, year, study design, sample size, country, medications used, patient characteristics (i.e. age, sex, and ancestry), diagnosis, and funding. When information was missing or incomplete for an eligible study, a request for additional information was made to the corresponding author of the eligible study.

### Genotype-dependent effects of smoking on mirtazapine serum concentrations [^114h17F6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Inducibility of *1F is supported by a study on olanzapine, primarily metabolized by CYP1A2. For olanzapine, a significant association between the CYP1A2 *1F genotype and the serum concentrations was reported, with lower concentrations in CYP1A2 *1F/*1F carriers compared to CYP1A2 *1A carriers (rs762551; C allele). Moreover, including only patients with CYP1A2 inducers (tobacco smoke and carbamazepine), 22% of lower serum concentrations of olanzapine in CYP1A2 *1F/*1F carriers were reported compared to CYP1A2 *1A carriers. Clozapine is another drug primarily metabolized by CYP1A2. Also, for clozapine, lower serum concentrations were reported in smokers who were CYP1A2 *1F/*1F carriers. By contrast, in another study, serum concentrations of clozapine did not differ in patients with different CYP1A2 genotypes; however, the study just distinguished between CYP1A2 *1A/*1A and CYP1A2 *1F carriers (*1A/*1F and *1F/*1F).

Mirtazapine is one of the most prescribed antidepressants in Germany in 2022. Studies investigating CYP1A2 genetics in association with mirtazapine treatment did not report an association between mirtazapine serum concentration and CYP1A2 variants. Nevertheless, no study so far has focused on mirtazapine serum concentration and CYP1A2 gene variants, taking into account CYP1A2 -inducing parameters, such as smoking.

Therefore, the present analysis aimed to investigate the association of CYP1A2 variants and mirtazapine treatment, considering the smoking status of the patient. We hypothesized that in smokers, who are CYP1A2 *F carriers, the dose-corrected serum concentration (CD) of mirtazapine was lower compared to smoking patients, who are carriers of other genotypes. Moreover, we hypothesized that CDs in non-smoking patients were not different across the genotypes.

### CYP2D6 genotypes Do not affect clozapine levels in a large, multicenter cohort: time has come to revise food and drug administration's clozapine packet insert [^114Tj8AU]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Hypothesis

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) package insert for clozapine states that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 is important in clozapine metabolism, implying that CYP2D6 genotypes should be considered in clozapine dosing. We investigated differences for clozapine concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratios, as a pharmacokinetic measure, in relation to CYP2D6 phenotype.

Study Design

Linear mixed-effect regression models were applied to investigate the association between genotype-predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotypes and C/D ratios including the effects of age, sex, smoking, and sampling time in a pooled sample of three cohorts, both without and with adjusting for the interaction between cohort and CYP2D6 phenotype, as well as in separate models stratified by cohort.

Study Results

We included 897 patients from three cohorts with a total of 10428 clozapine and norclozapine measurements. We found no association between CYP2D6 phenotypes and clozapine or norclozapine C/D ratios or clozapine-to-norclozapine ratios in the pooled sample with or without adjustment for the interaction between cohort and CYP2D6 phenotype nor when analyzing three cohorts separately (P > .05 in all cases). Older patients and females had higher C/D ratios of clozapine and norclozapine (P < .001, P < .001, P < .001 and P = .02), whereas smokers had lower C/D ratios of clozapine and norclozapine as well as clozapine-to-norclozapine ratios (P < .001 for all three).

Conclusions

We reported no association between CYP2D6 genotype-predicted phenotypes and clozapine pharmacokinetics. Dose adjustment based on CYP2D6 genotyping is unlikely to be helpful in managing clozapine-treated patients. We propose that the current FDA package insert should be updated to avoid misleading prescribers.

### Effects of clozapine treatment on the improvement of substance use disorders other than nicotine in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Yy4Pn]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our systematic review and meta-analysis builds upon previous reviews, and it suggests the association of clozapine treatment with significantly higher odds of remaining abstinent from substance use and decreased likelihood of psychiatric hospitalization, compared with continuing treatment with other antipsychotic medications. These findings must be interpreted with caution when considering the number of studies and the suboptimal quality of evidence from these studies. It is unclear whether clozapine improves these outcomes by better treating psychosis in a treatment-resistant population or has additional "anti-craving" effects compared with other antipsychotics. There is an urgent need to address the limitations of previous studies in the field with adequately powered, pragmatic randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials with larger samples, followed by open-label follow-up studies. The preliminary findings summarized here do however, further demonstrate the importance of early identification of individuals with treatment-resistant SSD and SUDs for clozapine initiation while maintaining high standards of monitoring to ensure safety.

### Meta-analyses of clozapine, norclozapine levels and their ratio across three genome wide association studies [^111Ugu57]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clozapine is the only approved medication for treatment resistant schizophrenia which affects approximately 30% of patients with schizophrenia. Treatment with clozapine is complicated by many factors, the most important being the risk of developing neutropenia or agranulocytosis. Other adverse effects of clozapine treatment, such as hypersalivation, weight gain, paralytic ileus, seizures and risk of diabetes mellitus type II are connected to the serum levels of clozapine and its metabolites. The efficacy of clozapine treatment is tied to serum levels of clozapine and norclozapine. Clozapine metabolism is mainly influenced by patient's sex, age, ethnicity, weight and smoking status. Main cytochrome P450 enzymes which metabolize clozapine are CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, with the role of CYP1A2 being the most important. In addition, glucuronidation pathways are shown to be of importance for clozapine metabolism and treatment discontinuation, without significantly affecting its serum levels. Interindividual variation in clozapine metabolism has become a point of interest due to the need for safe titration procedures and efficacious but safe management of clozapine serum levels.

Earlier genome-wide association study (GWAS) demonstrated that rs2472299-T between CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 is associated with decreased serum clozapine concentration. Recently, the role of several SNPs in clozapine metabolism in a cross-ancestral patient sample was investigated and the study identified gene loci in uridine-5´-diphospho-glucunorosyltransferase (UGT) UGT1A*, CYP1A1 / CYP1A2 and novel SNP in cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase gene (POR) that were associated with clozapine metabolism. However, in neither of these studies the association analyses were adjusted with the patients' smoking status.

A GWAS study conducted on Norwegian patients demonstrated that rs28379954-C within nuclear factor 1B (NFIB) gene which was associated with 42% reduced dosed adjusted serum concentration of clozapine after accounting for smoking habits. In a subsequent mechanistic study, rs28379954-C accelerated hydroxylation of risperidone in CYP2D6 normal metabolizers up to the level of CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizers. This indicates a wider role of NFIB in regulating cytochrome P450 system, thus revealing a perhaps unknown layer of regulation in genetics of drug metabolism. Carriers of both rs28379954-T and rs2472299-T might need considerably larger doses of clozapine to reach therapeutic serum levels. Furthermore, a recent GWAS of clozapine treated patients found a trend of NFIB rs1923778 being associated with treatment response without major differences in dose-adjusted clozapine serum levels between genotypes.

### Effects of clozapine treatment on the improvement of substance use disorders other than nicotine in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114nFzLQ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and are associated with a reduction in psychiatric hospitalization and overall mortality. Some evidence suggest that antipsychotic medications might have a varying effect on the improvement of comorbid substance use disorders (SUDs), with clozapine showing more favorable outcomes.

Aim:

We systematically reviewed all available evidence on effects of clozapine on the improvement of SUDs other than nicotine.

Methods:

Electronic searches of MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINHAL were conducted up to March 1, 2022. Studies of any methodological design involving two concepts: (1) clozapine and (2) SUD terms (excluding nicotine) were included. For SUD outcomes with three or more comparative studies with available raw data meta-analysis was performed. SUD outcomes not meeting criteria for meta-analysis were described qualitatively. Risk of bias was examined using "Downs and Black", and "Q-Coh" instruments.

Results:

The majority of individuals in the included 31 studies were male and of European ancestry. Abstinence was the most common outcome. Most of the studies were of low-to-moderate quality, and none of the studies met all the quality criteria. Pooled findings from four observational studies in samples of patients with predominantly comorbid alcohol use disorder showed that clozapine treatment is associated with significantly higher odds of remaining abstinent. In addition clozapine was associated with decreased odds of psychiatric hospitalization in all but one observational study.

Conclusions:

Our systematic review and meta-analysis builds upon previous reviews, and it suggests the association of clozapine treatment with significantly higher odds of remaining abstinent from substance use and decreased likelihood of psychiatric hospitalization, compared with continuing treatment with other antipsychotic medications. Still, the validity of this association needs greater exploration and providing recommendations for the utility of clozapine in individuals without treatment-resistant psychosis and comorbid SUDs would be premature.

### Pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia and co-occurring substance use disorders [^1137rgux]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Research on the optimal pharmacotherapy for people with schizophrenia and co-occurring substance use disorders remains in its infancy. This report reviews existing data and provides an update on recent research. The confluence of findings is consistent with a model of a reward dysfunction inherent in the neuropathology of schizophrenia, leading to a heightened vulnerability of people with schizophrenia to substance use disorders. Studies indicate that patients with dual disorders have difficulty tolerating conventional antipsychotics, have higher rates of medication nonadherence, and have greater impulsivity and sensation seeking. Limited evidence suggests that clozapine treatment may be associated with reduced substance abuse, with weaker evidence suggesting that other novel antipsychotics may have similar, but potentially less potent, effects. Controlled trials to test the effects of these medications are underway. A number of recent studies indicate that bupropion can facilitate reduced tobacco smoking among patients with schizophrenia. The preferential use of novel antipsychotics, a lower threshold for prescription of clozapine, the use of bupropion for smoking cessation, careful monitoring of compliance, and possible use of other medications for substance use disorders when indicated are recommended in pharmacologic management for people with co-occurring substance use disorders and schizophrenia.

### Identification of a novel polymorphism associated with reduced clozapine concentration in schizophrenia patients-a genome-wide association study adjusting for smoking habits [^117Nzsir]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Among the patients with smoking habits data (n = 422), 32 patients (7.6%) were in the GWAS identified as rs28379954 minor C allele carriers. In Fig. 2a, the linear regressions of absolute, unadjusted CLZ serum concentration vs. prescribed daily dose are shown according to rs28379954 genotype. As compared with the rs28379954 TT genotype carriers (smoker s: 2.31 (95% CI: 2.19–2.44); nonsmokers: 3.39 (95% CI: 3.15–3.64)), the C allele carriers (smokers: 0.81 (95% CI: 0.56–1.06); nonsmokers: 0.77 (95% CI: 0.37–1.16)) had a significantly lower linear slope (Fig. 2a). This was reflected by a significantly higher proportion of CLZ serum concentrations below the therapeutic range (< 300 nmol/L) in C vs. TT allele-carrying smokers (16.0% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001) and nonsmokers (8.0% vs. 4.9%, p = 0.017), despite similar daily dosing (p > 0.05). Regarding the pharmacokinetic effect of rs28379954, C allele carriers had an ~42% lower CLZ dose-adjusted serum concentration than TT genotype carriers in smokers (p = 0.004), whereas the C allele-carrying nonsmokers had 33% lower CLZ dose-adjusted serum concentration ratio than the TT genotype carrying nonsmokers (p = 0.031; Fig. 2b), after adjusting for age, sex, and sampling time as covariates. The dose-adjusted serum concentration of N -desmethylclozapine and CLZ-to- N -desmethylclozapine ratio were not associated with the rs28379954 C > T polymorphism in the GWAS analyses (Table 2). Due to reduced substrate (CLZ) availability, the rs28379954 C allele carriers still had 30% and 31% lower dose-adjusted serum concentration of N -desmethylclozapine compared with the smoking (p = 0.029) and nonsmoking (p = 0.016) TT genotype carriers, respectively (Fig. 2c). In smoking rs28379954 TT allele carriers, the CLZ-to- N -desmethylclozapine ratio was 19% (p = 0.014) higher than in smoking C allele carriers (Fig. 2d), while no significant change in CLZ-to-desmethylclozapine ratio was observed among C allele-carrying nonsmokers (p = 0.265; Fig. 2d).

### Impact of patient-specific factors on clozapine metabolism in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [^116VP6M4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study setting and population

This was a retrospective study using routine care clinical data from the British Columbia Psychosis Program (BCPP), a 25-bed tertiary inpatient resource for treatment-resistant psychosis in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of British Columbia Clinical Research Ethics Board. The study cohort consisted of inpatients with severe and treatment-resistant psychosis who were admitted to the program between February 21, 2012, and November 7, 2021, after being referred by psychiatrists working at secondary inpatient facilities or within community mental health or assertive community treatment teams. Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder are the most common diagnoses for patients who are admitted to the program. Most patients entering the BCPP have used clozapine in the past or are currently taking clozapine. The majority are admitted as involuntary patients under the provincial Mental Health Act.

For patients with resistant psychotic illnesses, the BCPP employs a thorough treatment strategy. This entails a formal review of the diagnosis by DSM 5 criteria, challenges, and re-challenges of the clozapine medication as necessary, trials of alternative antipsychotics and augmentation drugs, evidence-based nonpharmacological approaches, such as cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis and social skill development, and electroconvulsive treatment trials. Unless severe tolerability or safety issues occur after admission, patients who were receiving clozapine at the time of admission continue to receive this medication.

Clozapine administration at BCPP is supervised by psychiatric nurses and if there are reasons to suspect non-adherence, nurses ask to see the inside of patients' mouths after dose intake. In some cases, clozapine tablets may be crushed in jam or apple sauce to improve adherence. If there are concerns regarding emesis of the ingested dose, patients are observed for 30 min post-medication administration. During this period, access to their room is restricted. Moreover, patients at BCPP have a limited number of independent passes each day for the duration of their stay because it is a secured unit; consequently, the frequency of cigarette smoking in this cohort is likely lower than in studies conducted in outpatient settings. Similarly, caffeine intake is supervised and lower than studies conducted in outpatient settings.

VA/DoD clinical practice guideline — clozapine safety, monitoring, and practical requirements: Safe and effective use of clozapine requires 'laboratory tests to monitor neutrophil levels; training for both pharmacies and prescribers; registration of pharmacies, prescribers, and patients; and reporting of episodes of neutropenia', as well as 'the need for increased clinical contacts… starting at very low doses and increasing gradually'.Access barriers related to benign ethnic neutropenia were addressed through 'modifications in the Clozapine REMS protocols for blood testing in people with BEN'.Both systematic reviews note 'clinically useful associations exist between plasma levels of clozapine and its metabolites and clinical responses', and 'speculations have occurred that titrating doses to adjust plasma levels could enhance therapeutic benefits'.Additional findings 'suggest that smoking increases the rate of clozapine metabolism', with smoking cessation or reduction on a constant dose increasing blood levels and toxicity, while starting or restarting smoking can decrease levels and reduce effectiveness; aging 'decreases the rate of clozapine metabolism' and 'physiological changes related to aging increase the risks of several adverse effects'.Therefore, 'safe, effective use of clozapine might require the availability of laboratory resources to evaluate blood levels and providers who have the training and knowledge required to interpret them'.

### Elevated peripheral expression of neuregulin-1 (NRG1) mRNA isoforms in clozapine-treated schizophrenia patients [^11247s9V]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

In contrast to our mRNA findings, NRG1-β1 protein abundance was lower in clozapine-treated schizophrenia patients relative to controls. This finding did not appear to be related to demographic characteristics, genetic variation, or clozapine dose or clozapine blood levels (confirmed by our in vitro clozapine exposure experiment) but was attenuated after adjustment for smoking status. To our knowledge, previous studies measuring peripheral or central NRG1 protein levels have not accounted for smoking status as a potential confound. Our results suggest smokers, regardless of case status, have lower peripheral NRG1-β1 protein levels than non-smokers. Given that smoking prevalence rates are known to be significantly higher among individuals with schizophrenia compared to the general population, it is possible that previously reported differences in NRG1 protein levels between schizophrenia and control participants may have also been confounded by smoking. We are aware of two previous studies that have examined peripheral NRG1 protein levels in schizophrenia. The first reported lower Ig-NRG1 levels in serumand the second reported lower NRG1-β1 protein in plasma from schizophrenia patients. However, neither study adjusted for smoking status in their analyses. It is not clear if smoking status would have similar effects on brain NRG1 protein levels reported in post-mortem studies, as none of these studies examined this potential effect and it remains uncertain whether NRG1 protein levels in the brain concur with levels in the periphery. Nevertheless, our findings provide reasonable evidence for inclusion of smoking as a potential confound when measuring and interpreting NRG1 protein levels in groups with known differences in smoking prevalence and support future pre-clinical experiments assessing the effect of smoking on NRG1 protein levels in blood and brain.

### Acute and chronic effects of cigarette smoking on sRAGE [^114N9XsS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Cigarette smoke is known to increase the formation of AGEs and the expression of RAGE. However, the effect of cigarette smoking on sRAGE is inconsistent across the literature. Decreased, elevated, and unchanged levels of sRAGE were found in different studies, as reviewed by Prasad and colleagues. However, most of those studies, as I explained previously, were not specifically designed to explore the effect of smoking on sRAGE and thus were confounded by the presence of other diseases or conditions that affect sRAGE levels. Therefore, in our study, we specifically aimed to compare sRAGE levels between cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, controlling for the majority of confounding variables. In that study, we showed for the first time a significant elevation of sRAGE in cigarette smokers, a strong correlation between sRAGE and the number of cigarettes smoked per day, and an independent association of sRAGE with smoking habit. Although the exact mechanism of this apparently surprising finding is not yet known, we proposed a number of scientifically valid explanations. Now, Pouwels and colleagues have identified the acute effect of cigarette smoking on sRAGE, which is the opposite of the chronic effect of smoking previously identified by our group. Therefore, further studies are required to explore the true effect of cigarette smoking on serum sRAGE levels and to explain the discrepancy among these studies. These issues need to be resolved before we can consider sRAGE as a biomarker for inflammatory conditions or as a protective factor against AGEs and other RAGE ligands.

### Is clozapine-induced weight gain dose-dependent? Results from a prospective cohort study [^117S7wLH]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 3.
Linear Mixed-effect Models of Weight Change Over 1 Year According to Age and Sex Categories

Since serum clozapine levels are influenced by smoking with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) present in tobacco smoke being a strong inducer of the clozapine metabolizer cytochrome P4501A, a sensitivity analysis considering smokers (N = 41, median dose 280 mg) and nonsmokers (N = 74, median dose 130 mg) separately was applied, indicating a trend (E = 0.81, P = .090) and a slightly significant (E = 0.94, P = .047) effect of the dose on weight change, respectively, probably due to the low sample size. Moreover, since dose prescription can vary between both ages and diagnoses (as shown in table 1), a sensitivity analysis including only schizophrenic and schizoaffective patients was performed for the models reported in table 3 (see Supplementary table 3), reporting similar results. However, a non-significant effect of the dose was found for adults, probably due to the low sample size.

### Differences in duloxetine dosing strategies in smoking and nonsmoking patients: therapeutic drug monitoring uncovers the impact on drug metabolism [^113RGX1A]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Background

For certain psychotropic drugs, such as clozapine or olanzapine, the influence of smoking on drug metabolism is well studied. Tobacco smoke increases the metabolism of drugs that are substrates for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 due to CYP induction. The antidepressant duloxetine, acting as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is mainly metabolized via CYP1A2. To date, little is known about the influence of smoking on serum duloxetine concentrations.

Methods

A therapeutic drug monitoring database consisting of plasma concentrations of duloxetine collected from January 2013 to June 2017 was analyzed. A group of nonsmoking patients undergoing treatment with duloxetine (n = 89) was compared to a group of active smokers also receiving duloxetine (n = 36). Serum concentrations of duloxetine and dose-adjusted serum concentrations were compared using non-parametric tests.

Results

Groups did not differ concerning sex (P = .063), but the group of active smokers was younger (P < .001) and received higher daily doses of duloxetine (P = .001). Smokers showed significantly lower median serum duloxetine concentrations (38.4% lower, P = .002) and 53.6% lower dose-adjusted serum concentrations (0.325 [ng/mL]/[mg/d] in smokers vs 0.7 [ng/mL]/[mg/d] in nonsmokers, P < .001).

Conclusions

Despite higher daily doses, smokers had considerably lower serum duloxetine concentrations. The induction of CYP1A2 by tobacco smoke is a clinically relevant factor for drugs that are substrates for CYP1A2. Clinicians should actively assess smoking status, inform patients about the effect of smoking on duloxetine metabolism, and anticipate higher serum concentrations in the case of smoking cessation. Therapeutic drug monitoring ensures treatment efficacy by enabling the personalizing of treatment, as smokers need higher duloxetine doses to target serum concentrations within the therapeutic reference range.

### Reducing the risk of withdrawal symptoms and relapse following clozapine discontinuation-is It feasible to develop evidence-based guidelines? [^116hxVM2]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2022). Medium credibility.

When stopping electively, it is recommended clozapine discontinuation takes place over a minimum of 6 months following a hyperbolic discontinuation regime (figure 2). Decisions regarding the planning and implementing of tapering regimes should be made collaboratively with patients. If withdrawal symptoms emerge during the tapering period, or if there is early evidence of relapse, consider returning to the lowest dose that was well-tolerated and reduce the speed of tapering. Strategies to manage specific clozapine discontinuation symptoms are summarized in figure 3.

Fig. 2.
Example hyperbolic discontinuation regime for a patient treated on stable dose of 300mg of clozapine (adapted from Horowitz et al 2021). Hyperbolic discontinuation involves dose reductions in increasingly smaller increments that approximate linear decreases in receptor occupancy. In this example, each step is equivalent to approximating a 2.5 percentage point reduction in D 2 blockade. Following the law of mass effect, a similar relationship can be expected for other receptor types, such as cholinergic and histaminergic. Suggested interval between dose changes are 6−12 weeks, however this can be tailored to the individual. For example, in the case of a patient where withdrawal symptoms are a particular concern, a slower taper can be achieved by increasing the interval between dose reductions and/or by smaller dose reductions. If withdrawal symptoms emerge (which can include psychotic symptoms) consider a longer period on the same dose for stabilisation (which can take weeks or even months), or returning to a higher dose, until symptoms resolve. Thereafter taper more gradually. The emergence of withdrawal symptoms does not necessarily indicate that a patient cannot discontinue clozapine successfully. During discontinuation, it is important to closely monitor other factors that could affect clozapine plasma levels and therefore receptor blockade, such as concomitant medication and smoking status. Hyperbolic discontinuation may lead to the administration of very small doses during the final stages of the taper, which may require splitting tablets or use of liquid formulations.

The line of best fit is shown with the 95% confidence intervals for the regression estimate in translucent bands around the regression lines. The r s indicates Spearman correlation coefficient for which two-tailed tests were used. The asterisks indicate significance and their color correspond to the group they are representing. Acronyms: HV = healthy volunteers, OCD = obsessive compulsive disorder, SCZ-OCS = schizophrenia with OCS, SCZ-only = schizophrenia without OCS, IOU Intolerance Of Uncertainty, STAI-S State Trait Anxiety Inventory-State, YBOCS Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, SWMBE Spatial Working Memory Between Errors (the number of times the subject incorrectly revisits a box in which a token has previously been found). ✱ p ≤ 0.05, ✱✱ p < 0.01.

Relationship between checking under uncertainty and clinical measures

Only in OCD patients, was functional checking under uncertainty (block 1) positively correlated with intolerance of uncertainty scores (r s = 0.40, p = 0.02), but this was not the case in other groups. Clozapine dose was significantly correlated with checking under uncertainty (block 1) only in the SCZ-OCS group (SCZ-OCS: r s = 0.44, p = 0.04; SCZ-only: r s = 0, p = 0.98). When accounting for cigarette use and gender, known modulators of clozapine metabolism and plasma levels (Mayerova et al.), this partial correlation remained very similar (SCZ-OCS: r s = 0.428, p < 0.05; SCZ-only: r s = 0.14, p = 0.31).

### Schizophrenia and smoking [^114nVGHc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Smoking is associated with the induction of the CYP 1A2 enzyme, and hence with diminished levels of drugs metabolized by this enzyme. This article presents a hypothetical patient, diagnosed with schizophrenia, who smokes about 10 cigarettes a day. The progress of the patient is examined across several follow up meetings, each of which presents a fresh clinical problem related to smoking and its interaction with the medication. Clinical guidance for each problem is presented along with a brief discussion on the subject. The article concludes with a discussion of other pharmacokinetic considerations related to smoking and its treatment in patients with schizophrenia.

### Optimizing antidepressant and clozapine co-prescription in clinical practice: a systematic review and expert recommendations [^111X4myo]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To synthesize the information relevant for clinical practice on clozapine-antidepressant co-prescription concerning pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDI), adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with the co-prescription, antidepressant add-on for clozapine-resistant symptoms and antidepressant add-on for clozapine-induced ADRs.

Methods

Articles were identified with MEDLINE, Web of Sciences and PsycINFO search from inception through April 2023. Data were synthesized narratively.

Results

ADRs are most often induced by the co-prescription of antidepressants that inhibit CYP enzymes (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine). Fluvoxamine add-on is hazardous because of its potent inhibition of clozapine metabolism and has few indications (lowering daily number of clozapine tablets, reducing norclozapine-induced metabolic disturbances and other dose-dependent clozapine-induced ADRs). ADR frequency may be reduced by therapeutic drug monitoring and knowledge of other factors impacting clozapine metabolism (pneumonia, inflammation, smoking, etc.). Improvement of negative symptoms is the most documented beneficial effect of antidepressant add-on for clozapine-resistant psychotic symptoms. The add-on antidepressant should be chosen according to its safety profile regarding DDI with clozapine: antidepressants inhibiting clozapine metabolism or increasing the anticholinergic load should be avoided. Other indications of antidepressant add-on (affective or obsessive compulsive symptoms, sialorrhea, and enuresis) are poorly documented.

Conclusion

Antidepressant add-on to clozapine is associated with potential benefits in clozapine users as this strategy may contribute to reduce the burden of clozapine-resistant symptoms or of clozapine-induced ADRs. Further studies are needed to determine whether antidepressant add-on can reduce the risk of clozapine discontinuation.

### Do Indian patients with schizophrenia need half the recommended clozapine dose to achieve therapeutic serum level? An exploratory study [^113H9CAJ]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Inter-racial differences in serum clozapine have received less scientific importance, as there are fewer studies on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) from Asia. We measured the serum clozapine levels in 142 patients with schizophrenia and related disorders at a tertiary care psychiatric institute in India. The clozapine concentration per milligram (mg) of oral clozapine dose (C/D ratio) was calculated, and the C/D ratio was used to estimate oral clozapine dose needed to achieve therapeutic serum clozapine level (350 ng/ml). This study examined Indian patients only and compared the results with weighted mean serum clozapine and its correlates in Caucasian population, based on published scientific literature. The median C/D ratio in our sample was 2.5 (n = 142), and the clozapine dose needed to achieve therapeutic serum clozapine level was 140 mg/d. The median C/D ratio of our subjects was nearly two and a half times higher than the weighted mean C/D ratio of Caucasians (2.5 v/s 1.07) reported elsewhere. After excluding the significant pharmacokinetic interactions and stratifying according to gender and smoking status, the estimated clozapine dose to achieve therapeutic serum level in male smokers (n = 9) and female non-smokers (n = 38) were 238 mg/d (C/D ratio; 1.47) and 120 mg/d (C/D ratio:2.93) respectively. On comparing, male smokers (600 mg/d versus 238 mg/d) and female non-smokers (300 mg/d versus 120 mg/d) in our study needed about 40% of the recommended clozapine dose for Caucasians to achieve therapeutic serum clozapine level. The pharmacogenetic correlates of lesser clozapine dose requirement in the Indian population require further research.

### Elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios correlate with increased clozapine concentration-to-dose ratios during titration [^114WqWnN]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clozapine is a highly effective atypical antipsychotic used for the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia; however, it is underused because of its various side effects. The ability to metabolize clozapine varies significantly among individuals. Factors such as sex, smoking, and ethnicity are known to affect clozapine metabolism, and international guidelines recommend initial titration protocols that consider these factors. Rapid clozapine titration that is not appropriate for an individual's metabolic capacity can lead to early inflammatory side effects such as fever, myocarditis, and pneumonia –. This may progress to a life-threatening condition characterized by organ damage such as myocarditis, pneumonia, nephritis, liver dysfunction, and pancreatitis, which may be accompanied by eosinophilia and rash, and is diagnosed as clozapine-associated drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome –. These conditions are thought to be caused by an immune hypersensitivity reaction to clozapine. The relative mortality rate of myocarditis and pneumonia associated with clozapine is significantly higher than that of clozapine-associated agranulocytosis. Therefore, it is important to estimate the clozapine-metabolizing ability of an individual early in the titration phase and perform individualized titration. Measuring the clozapine concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio helps estimate the individual metabolic capacity. Our previous study analyzing the weekly measurements of clozapine blood concentrations within 6 weeks of starting clozapine revealed that fever increased the clozapine C/D ratio. Inflammation reportedly reduces the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of clozapine. The underlying mechanism is hypothesized to be that inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α suppress the transcription of CYP1A2, thereby reducing its synthesis and activity. The inflammation induced by clozapine itself may impair its metabolism, leading to increased clozapine blood levels and further inflammation, creating a vicious cycle. Therefore, international guidelines recommend measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) weekly for the first 4 weeks after initiating clozapine and avoiding dose increases if CRP levels rise. Our previous study measured CRP levels weekly or daily during clozapine titration and reported that CRP levels were elevated in many patients even in the absence of obvious inflammatory symptoms such as fever. Furthermore, we showed that the C/D ratio may temporarily increase even in patients without fever. Based on these results, we hypothesized that subclinical inflammation during clozapine titration increases the clozapine C/D ratio. Most of the data on the relationship between inflammation and elevated blood clozapine levels is based on case reports, and studies with well-controlled cohorts are lacking. A recent retrospective study by Smith et al. identified 126 patients who had their clozapine blood levels and CRP levels measured simultaneously, demonstrating an association between CRP and clozapine blood levels. However, they were limited as the clinical context of each patient and the timing of the blood measurements (number of days after starting clozapine) were unknown, and the longitudinal change in the C/D ratio within patients was unknown. Therefore, we decided to examine the relationship between inflammation and clozapine blood levels using past datasets. Although CRP was not measured simultaneously with clozapine blood levels, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were routinely measured in clinical practice. We therefore decided to use the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of inflammation.

### Tobacco use, nicotine dependence, and cessation methods in adults with psychosis… [^113nb86B]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Respondents were classified as having lifetime psychosis if they answered yes to having ever had a diagnosis or a past-year diagnosis. Among individuals with past-month tobacco use, the distributions of types of tobacco products used varied by lifetime psychosis status. Adults with lifetime psychosis had a higher prevalence of dual cigarette and e-cigarette use, polycombustible tobacco use, and polycombustible. Although cigarettes remain the most common type of tobacco product used among adults with psychosis, the high prevalence of polytobacco product use in this population indicates the need for clinical efforts to address all types of tobacco use. In the general adult population, polytobacco use has been associated with a greater likelihood of nicotine dependence symptoms than single tobacco product use.

35 We found that, among adults with past-month cigarette use, those with lifetime psychosis had greater polytobacco use and higher adjusted mean nicotine dependence scores than those without psychosis. Results of the present study are consistent with those of a small study that found people with schizophrenia smoked more intensely than their matched nonpsychiatric counterparts36 and findings of a clinical study that reported a high smoking prevalence and nicotine dependence severity from early through late psychosis. 37 In accordance with these findings, a recent study also found overlapping neural mechanisms of nicotine dependence and psychosis.
38. Tobacco consumption has been associated with higher levels of psychosis symptoms and lower cognitive function, 39, 40 and greater smoking severity was a factor in increased premature mortality risk.

41 By contrast, tobacco cessation among people with psychosis has been associated with improved cognitive function and psychosis symptoms42, 43and with reduced morbidity. 35 Yet a systematic literature review has shown that people with schizophrenia and tobacco use are less likely to receive tobacco cessation support from clinicians than their counterparts without schizophrenia.
44. Furthermore, the analyses uncovered a much higher frequency of past-month use of cannabis and other substances among adults with a history of psychosis than in those without psychosis. Even when the analyses adjusted for differences in these measures, other behavioral conditions, and sociodemographic characteristics, tobacco use remained significantly associated with psychosis. Further research is needed to examine the interactions between nicotine and cannabis consumption and to evaluate strategies for smoking cessation in individuals with comorbid use of other substances.

### Clozapine ultrarapid metabolism during weak induction probably exists but requires careful diagnosis. A literature review, five new cases and a proposed definition [^117Ms3ap]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

During weak induction (from smoking and/or valproate co-prescription), clozapine ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) need very high daily doses to reach the minimum therapeutic concentration of 350 ng/ml in plasma; clozapine UMs need clozapine doses higher than: 1) 900 mg/day in patients of European/African ancestry, or 2) 600 mg/day in those of Asian ancestry. Published clozapine UMs include 10 males of European/African ancestry, mainly assessed with single concentrations. Five new clozapine UMs (two of European and three of Asian ancestry) with repeated assessments are described. A US double-blind randomized trial included a 32-year-old male smoking two packages/day with a minimum therapeutic dose of 1,591 mg/day from a single TDM during open treatment of 900 mg/day. In a Turkish inpatient study, a 30-year-old male smoker was a possible clozapine UM needing a minimum therapeutic dose of 1,029 mg/day estimated from two trough steady-state concentrations on 600 mg/day. In a Chinese study, three possible clozapine UMs (all male smokers) were identified. The clozapine minimum therapeutic dose estimated with trough steady-state concentrations > 150 ng/ml was: 1) 625 mg/day, based on a mean of 20 concentrations in Case 3; 2) 673 mg/day, based on a mean of 4 concentrations in Case 4; and 3) 648 mg/day, based on a mean of 11 concentrations in Case 5. Based on these limited studies, clozapine UMs during weak induction may account for 1–2% of clozapine-treated patients of European ancestry and < 1% of those of Asian ancestry. A clozapine-to-norclozapine ratio < 0.5 should not be used to identify clozapine UMs.

### Cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome in people with established psychotic illnesses: baseline data from the IMPaCT randomized controlled trial [^112BKC8T]. Psychological Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Lifestyle choices amplify the potential consequences of abnormal metabolic parameters in this population: 62% were smokers, hugely in excess of the current smoking rates in the general UK population of 20% (Health & Social Care Information Centre). A recent 11-year follow-up of 517 people with schizophrenia showed an overall standardized mortality ratio of 2.80, smoking being a very strong predictor of death (relative risk of 4.66) (Dickerson et al.). Smoking not only increases the risk of early death, but also complicates treatment, in that the hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke accelerate the metabolism of dibenzodiazepines, clozapine and olanzapine (Rostami-Hodjegan et al.). Until recently, clinicians have shown little interest in supporting smoking cessation in psychosis patients. However, findings from a systematic review have demonstrated that people with schizophrenia want to stop smoking and that it is possible to help them to do so (Banham & Gilbody,) and it is logical that this should now be a priority public health measure.

Lack of exercise was common among the study population, with only 12% of individuals participating in high-intensity physical activity, consistent with previous reports (Faulkner et al.), with high-intensity physical activity associated with lower rates of obesity and dyslipidaemia. As exercise is linked to greater longevity in the general population (Paffenbarger et al; Manson et al.), it is likely that greater emphasis on engaging in physical activity among those with severe mental illnesses (SMI) would help reduce mortality risk (Vancampfort et al.). This will require addressing the individual barriers to regular physical activity and promoting it within the structure of community treatment programmes (Vancampfort et al.) but will also entail addressing wider organizational barriers to regular physical activity and other health promotion programmes (O'Brien et al.).

### Clozapine (Versacloz) [^112cgdS3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers

Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of VERSACLOZ. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the VERSACLOZ dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of VERSACLOZ and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)].

Consider reducing the VERSACLOZ dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers, because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)]. Anticholinergic Drugs Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of VERSACLOZ with anticholinergic drugs when possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.15)].

Drugs that Cause QT Interval Prolongation

Use caution when administering concomitant medications that prolong the QT interval or inhibit the metabolism of VERSACLOZ. Drugs that cause QT prolongation include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, mesoridazine, droperidol, and pimozide), specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

### Prescribing clozapine in the UK: quality improvement issues identified by clinical audit [^113swKzj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Prescribing Observatory for Mental Health initiated a quality improvement (QI) programme on clozapine use in UK mental health services.

Methods

Clinical audits conducted in 2019 and 2021.

Results

Sixty-three participating NHS Trusts/healthcare organisations in 2019, and 61 in 2021, submitted treatment data for 6948 and 8155 patients, respectively. In both audits, high-dose and/or combined antipsychotic medications had been prescribed immediately before initiating clozapine in over a quarter of patients recently started on clozapine. In patients who were tobacco smokers and recently discharged from a smoke-free ward, the impact of the potential change in smoking status had been considered in the care plans of just under one-third in 2019 and just over a half in 2021. For community patients, their Summary Care Records (SCRs) included their clozapine prescriptions in 58% of cases in 2019 and 72% in 2021.

Conclusions

Three QI issues were identified. (1) Antipsychotic regimens with limited evidence for efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia were prescribed for over a quarter of cases before starting clozapine. Use of such strategies may delay clozapine treatment, potentially reducing the likelihood of a therapeutic response. (2) While anticipation of the consequences of a change in smoking status on plasma clozapine concentration following discharge from hospital showed improvement over time, even in 2021 it was not evident for nearly a half of relevant cases. (3) While inclusion of clozapine in the SCR also improved over time, even in 2021 it was missing for more than a quarter of community patients.

### Quantifying intraindividual variations in plasma clozapine levels: a population pharmacokinetic approach [^115abxzr]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Clozapine has strong recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring. While factors that influence interindividual variation in plasma clozapine levels have been extensively reported, intraindividual variation remains poorly studied. We employed a population pharmacokinetic approach to assess intraindividual variations in plasma levels of both clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine, as well as the impact of smoking on this variability.

Methods

Patients who were initiated on clozapine from January 2009 to December 2010 and who provided at least 2 plasma samples were included in this study. The observed concentrations of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were applied in a Bayesian pharmacokinetic modeling approach by using a previously published pharmacokinetic model from an independent sample to compute a predicted concentration. The predicted concentrations of clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were then compared with the observed concentrations in the form of a ratio: predicted-to-observed concentration ratio (Cpred/Cobs). The coefficient of variation of the Cpred/Cobs ratios was taken as a measure of intraindividual variation.

Results

A total of 723 plasma levels from 61 patients were included in this analysis. The coefficient of variation of Cpred/Cobs ratios for clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were 29.8% (SD = 17.2%) and 27.4% (SD = 16.4%), respectively. Though values were higher, smoking did not have a significant effect on coefficients of variation of clozapine (33.5% vs 26.3%, P = .184) or N-desmethylclozapine (30.7% vs 24.2%, P = .100).

Conclusions

Clinicians need to be aware of intraindividual variability and not assume that plasma levels are static. If plasma levels are used to guide dosing of clozapine, serial measurements rather than a single level might be necessary to make an informed clinical decision. The clinical implications of intraindividual variability in plasma clozapine levels need further study.

### Identification of a novel polymorphism associated with reduced clozapine concentration in schizophrenia patients-a genome-wide association study adjusting for smoking habits [^116dzoRS]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Study population

Patients with serum concentration measurements of CLZ and the metabolite N -desmethylclozapine, and biobanked blood samples for genotyping, were included from the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) service at the Center for Psychopharmacology, Diakonhjemmet Hospital, Oslo, Norway, from March 2005 to May 2019. Inclusion criteria were: (i) blood sampling for serum concentration analysis of CLZ at steady-state conditions and 10–30 h after the last drug intake, and (ii) prescribed daily dose of CLZ. For the GWAS analysis adjusting for smoking only, a further inclusion criterion was (iii) information about confirmed smoking habits written by the physician on the TDM requisition form (cigarette smoking 'yes' or 'no'). The time intervals between last dose intake and blood sampling for serum concentration analysis, and the psychotropic co-medication profiles, were obtained from the requisition forms. Exclusion criteria were (i) concurrent use of interacting drugs, i.e. the CYP1A2/2C19/3A4 inhibitor fluvoxamine, or the CYP3A4/2C19 inducers phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine, and (ii) concentration of CLZ or N -desmethylclozapine below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ; i.e. 20 nmol/L). All serum concentration measurements from each of the patients fulfilling the criteria were included in the statistical analyses, as described below.

The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics and the Hospital Investigational Review Board. As the study was solely based on historical data, the project did not have the potential to cause any harm or burden, informed patient consent was not required.

### Impact of patient-specific factors on clozapine metabolism in individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder [^117ViC4u]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clozapine has unique superior efficacy in treatment resistance, persistent hostility or violent behavior, and suicidality in individuals with schizophrenia. Moreover, it has been associated with lower all-cause and specific-cause mortality, fewer hospitalizations, and all-cause discontinuation. Yet, these findings have not translated into greater clozapine use, and its initiation is markedly delayed. This is in part due to common and sometimes severe adverse effects, as well as knowledge gaps in preventing and managing these effects.

Clozapine is a strong candidate for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) as it has a suggested plasma concentration–response relationship and carries an increased risk of nonresponse or adverse effects if plasma concentrations occur outside the therapeutic range. Available evidence suggests concentrations above 350 ng/mL (1070 nmol/L) are associated with higher rates of therapeutic response and concentrations above 600 ng/mL (1850 nmol/L) are associated with higher rates of dose-dependent adverse drug effects, such as sedation, seizures, myoclonus, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, tachycardia, and orthostatic hypotension. During the dose-escalation phases of treatment, other clozapine side effects, like inflammation, can become more noticeable and could be connected to the rate of titration and dose accumulation. Therefore, to individualize the titration plan and target dose, it would be imperative to identify patient-specific factors that impact clozapine metabolism.

Clozapine clearance is mediated, in part, by extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism via the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system with a modest excretion of unchanged drug in the urine of less than 3%. CYP1A2 is the principal enzyme that metabolizes clozapine in vivo and results in the formation of N-desmethylclozapine (norclozapine). Although CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 are also involved in the metabolism of clozapine, their contribution is minor based on the current evidence.

To date, the proportion of the variance in clozapine metabolism explained by genetic differences has been modest. By contrast, other patient-specific factors such as smoking, high caffeine intake, inflammation indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and certain concurrent medications have a significant influence because they can either induce or inhibit CYP1A2 activity.

### Cigarette smoking in Chinese male inpatients with schizophrenia: a cross-sectional analysis [^112xie2U]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Given the high rates of cigarette smoking in schizophrenia in many published studies from around the world, we studied the relationship between smoking status and clinical characteristics in male Chinese schizophrenic inpatients. Two hundred seventy-nine schizophrenic inpatients were assessed using clinical data forms to ascertain historical, demographic and treatment variables and collateral information was also collected from case records and interviews with patients and family members. Current smokers (N = 112) were compared with non-smokers (N = 167) on clinical variables by independent sample t-tests and chi(2) tests, with adjustment for confounding variables using ANCOVA and binary logistic regression analysis. Compared to non-smokers, current smokers were significantly more likely to be divorced, have lower educational attainment, a more episodic course, have a greater number of previous psychotic relapses and more likely to be treated with clozapine. There was no correlation, however, between smoking consumption and schizophrenic psychopathology. Accordingly, cigarette smoking may be associated with certain clinical features in schizophrenic patients, and should be carefully screened for when making treatment and rehabilitation plans.

### Pharmacogenomic variants and drug interactions identified through the genetic analysis of clozapine metabolism [^113G32uw]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Clozapine is the only effective medication for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but its worldwide use is still limited because of its complex titration protocols. While the discovery of pharmacogenomic variants of clozapine metabolism may improve clinical management, no robust findings have yet been reported. This study is the first to adopt the framework of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to discover genetic markers of clozapine plasma concentrations in a large sample of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Methods

The authors used mixed-model regression to combine data from multiple assays of clozapine metabolite plasma concentrations from a clozapine monitoring service and carried out a genome-wide analysis of clozapine, norclozapine, and their ratio on 10,353 assays from 2,989 individuals. These analyses were adjusted for demographic factors known to influence clozapine metabolism, although it was not possible to adjust for all potential mediators given the available data. GWAS results were used to pinpoint specific enzymes and metabolic pathways and compounds that might interact with clozapine pharmacokinetics.

Results

The authors identified four distinct genome-wide significant loci that harbor common variants affecting the metabolism of clozapine or its metabolites. Detailed examination pointed to coding and regulatory variants at several CYP* and UGT* genes as well as corroborative evidence for interactions between the metabolism of clozapine, coffee, and tobacco. Individual effects of single single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) fine-mapped from these loci were large, such as the minor allele of rs2472297, which was associated with a reduction in clozapine concentrations roughly equivalent to a decrease of 50 mg/day in clozapine dosage. On their own, these single SNPs explained from 1.15% to 9.48% of the variance in the plasma concentration data.

Conclusions

Common genetic variants with large effects on clozapine metabolism exist and can be found via genome-wide approaches. Their identification opens the way for clinical studies assessing the use of pharmacogenomics in the clinical management of patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

### Genotype-dependent effects of smoking on mirtazapine serum concentrations [^1125Wrj4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

It was reported that not only smoking status but also the number of cigarettes impacts CYP1A2 activity. CYP1A2 activity was found to increase with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, with major differences found between groups smoking 10–19 and 30–39, or 40–70 cigarettes per day. In our sample, 5 patients smoked 1–9 cigarettes per day, 19 patients smoked 10–19, and 18 patients smoked 20 or more cigarettes per day. Corroborating previous results, we found a significantly decreasing CD of mirtazapine in patients smoking ⩾20 cigarettes per day compared to non-smokers. However, in patients smoking 10–19 cigarettes per day, CD was also lower but on trend level (p = 0.07). While this supports previous findings, this may also indicate that the smoking effects on CYP1A2 might not be linear. Therefore, a bigger sample size might be needed to depict those effects in the intermediate group of 10–19 cigarettes per day. In addition, other influencing factors affecting the CD of mirtazapine could partly explain our results, other metabolizing enzymes, for example other metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. Analysis on inducibility of CYP1A2 in association with the number of cigarettes and genotype group was impossible due to small sample sizes.

Purpose

To disentangle an association between tobacco smoking, smoking habits and pharmacokinetic patterns such as plasma concentrations of risperidone (RIS), its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone (9-OH-RIS) and the active moiety, AM, (RIS+9-OH-RIS) in a naturalistic sample.

Methods

Plasma concentrations, dose adjusted plasma concentrations (C/D) of RIS, 9-OH-RIS and AM in patients out of a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) database were compared between smokers (n = 401) and non-smokers (n = 292).

Results

Daily dosage of risperidone differed significantly with smokers receiving higher doses than patients in the control group (p = 0.001). No differences were detected in plasma concentrations of the active moiety, RIS and 9-OH-RIS (p = 0.8 for AM, p = 0.646 for RIS and p = 0.538 for 9-OH-RIS). However, dose corrected concentrations (C/D) of metabolite (C/D 9-OH-RIS) and active moiety (C/D AM) differed between significantly between groups (p = 0.002 and p = 0.007). After stratifying smokers to a group of moderate smokers (< 20cigarettes/day) (RS1, n = 109) and a group of heavy smokers (≥ 20cigarettes/day) (RS2, n = 135), the comparison between non-smokers and both groups only showed lower values of C/D for 9-OH-RIS (p = 0.011) for the group of moderate smokers while other pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ.

Conclusions

Apart from the well-known induction of CYP1A2 activity by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, smoking might exert an effect on other CYP isoenzymes as well. A possible interpretation proposes a slight inducing effect of smoking on risperidone metabolism most likely via CYP3A4.

### Effects of acute abstinence, reinstatement, and mecamylamine on biochemical and behavioral measures of cigarette smoking in schizophrenia [^111yksdF]. Schizophrenia Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Schizophrenics have higher rates of smoking than the general population, and more difficulty with smoking cessation. However, there has been little study of differences between schizophrenics and controls with respect to biochemical and behavioral indices of smoking. We compared smokers with schizophrenia (SS; n = 27) and control smokers (CS; n = 26) on smoking and psychiatric outcomes at baseline, during acute smoking abstinence and reinstatement, and with pre-treatment using the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine (MEC) in a human laboratory setting.

Methods

Biochemical (e.g., plasma nicotine) and behavioral (e.g., craving, withdrawal) outcomes were assessed at baseline, after overnight abstinence, and after smoking reinstatement during three consecutive test weeks. Each week, participants received one of three doses of MEC (0.0, 5.0, or 10.0 mg/dayx3 days) in a randomized, counterbalanced manner.

Results

Compared to CS, SS displayed similar levels of craving and withdrawal, but higher plasma nicotine and cotinine levels, and cotinine/CPD ratio. During reinstatement, SS consumed significantly more cigarettes than CS, but MEC did not significantly alter indices of smoking, psychiatric symptoms, or cigarette consumption during reinstatement.

Conclusions

1) The reinforcing effects of smoking may be increased in SS versus CS after overnight abstinence; 2) the lack of effects of nAChR antagonism may suggest that non-nicotinic components of cigarettes may contribute to the behavioral effects of smoking in both SS and CS; and 3) consistent with previous studies, SS may exhibit higher baseline levels of nicotine and cotinine, and greater extraction of nicotine per cigarette than CS.
