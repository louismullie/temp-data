## Question

Decreased fetal movement, pregnant came to the Ed. What to do

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do when a pregnant patient presents to the emergency department with decreased fetal movement. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and stabilization. Then, I should verify the focused history elements that change pretest probability. Next, I will review the bedside assessment priorities, including fetal heart tones and maternal vitals. After that, I need to check the evidence-based testing sequence: cardiotocography followed by targeted ultrasound. Then, I will consider adjuncts like Doppler and maternal labs selectively. Finally, I should synthesize decision pathways based on test results, address special populations, and close with documentation and follow-up planning, ensuring each step aligns with guidelines and high-quality evidence.

> Let me first confirm the triage priority and immediate actions, because I need to ensure we do not miss imminent fetal compromise. Decreased fetal movement after 28 weeks is a high-acuity obstetric complaint that warrants prompt evaluation; I should assign a high triage category and initiate continuous fetal monitoring if available, while simultaneously checking maternal vitals and placing two large-bore IVs in case urgent delivery or resuscitation is needed, and I should notify obstetrics early for co-management and potential delivery planning [^2055b83a] [^e0e69f1a].

> Wait, let me verify the focused history elements that meaningfully shift risk. I should ask about gestational age, time course and characterization of the movement change, prior episodes, and any associated symptoms such as bleeding, leakage, contractions, or maternal illness. I also need to screen for risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, smoking, obesity, prior stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, and anterior placenta, and I should clarify whether the patient has already tried home strategies like lying on her left side, drinking cold fluids, or eating to stimulate movement, because these details influence both testing and disposition decisions [^d18eb5e1] [^58e8d846].

> I will now examine the bedside assessment, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before confirming viability. I should auscultate fetal heart tones with a Doppler or fetoscope; if I cannot immediately detect them, I should escalate to ultrasound urgently to confirm viability and exclude fetal demise, while also assessing maternal blood pressure, temperature, and abdominal tenderness to identify maternal conditions that could explain decreased movements or require concurrent management [^2055b83a] [^e0e69f1a].

> Next, I should review the first-line test, and I need to ensure I get this right. Cardiotocography is the initial test of choice after 28 weeks to assess fetal status; a reassuring NST typically shows two or more accelerations in 20 minutes with moderate variability, whereas nonreassuring patterns such as minimal variability, late decelerations, or prolonged bradycardia warrant escalation to additional testing or delivery planning depending on gestational age and clinical context [^d18eb5e1] [^88eab874].

> Hold on, I should verify the second-line evaluation. Regardless of NST results, a targeted ultrasound is indicated to assess fetal growth, amniotic fluid volume, placental location and appearance, and to visualize fetal movements; this helps detect growth restriction, oligohydramnios, or placental insufficiency that may not be evident on CTG alone, and it aligns with guidance that ultrasound is a key modality when DFM is reported [^d18eb5e1] [^88eab874].

> Let me consider adjunctive testing, but I should confirm when they add value. Umbilical artery Doppler is reasonable if there is suspected growth restriction, hypertension, or other placental disease, whereas routine Doppler in otherwise low-risk DFM presentations is not supported; maternal labs such as CBC, glucose, and infectious screening can be obtained selectively based on history, and a Kleihauer-Betke test is not routinely indicated unless there is suspected feto-maternal hemorrhage or trauma [^d18eb5e1] [^88eab874].

> I should double-check the decision pathways now. If both NST and ultrasound are reassuring, discharge with return precautions and arranged follow-up within 1 week is appropriate, with counseling that DFM is associated with increased risks such as SGA and may warrant closer surveillance. If either test is nonreassuring, I should involve obstetrics for delivery planning or enhanced surveillance, recognizing that management should be individualized by gestational age and comorbidities, and that a BPP may be used to refine decisions when the NST is equivocal [^d18eb5e1] [^88eab874].

> But wait, what if the patient is preterm or has special circumstances. Before 28 weeks, I should still confirm viability with ultrasound and consider maternal factors and fetal anatomy, and while NST may be less predictive, ultrasound assessment of growth, fluid, and movements remains central. In patients with prior stillbirth, obesity, or hypertension, I should maintain a lower threshold for admission, extended monitoring, and early delivery discussions given elevated baseline risk [^d18eb5e1] [^88eab874].

> I need to ensure my documentation is complete and actionable. I should record the exact history of movement change, risk factors, maternal vitals, fetal heart rate assessment, and all test results with interpretations. I must also document counseling about warning signs, when to return urgently, and the follow-up plan, and I should communicate with the patient's obstetric provider for continuity and coordination of care [^b97a1c05].

> Let me reconsider the evidence base to avoid overpromising. While maternal perception of DFM is associated with adverse outcomes including stillbirth and growth restriction, high-quality evidence does not show that routine kick counting alone reduces stillbirth, and large trials of awareness campaigns have yielded mixed results with increased interventions; therefore, I should emphasize patient-specific pattern recognition, timely reporting, and standardized evaluation rather than rigid counting thresholds [^d18eb5e1] [^f7cc1a3b] [^b08f3366].

> Finally, I should confirm disposition and safety-netting. Most patients with reassuring testing can be discharged with clear return precautions for absent movements, significant decrease, bleeding, leakage, fever, or severe headache, and with arranged follow-up within a week. Patients with nonreassuring findings or high-risk profiles should be admitted for observation, repeat testing, or delivery planning, and I should provide written information about normal fetal activity patterns and when to seek care to reduce prehospital delay in future episodes [^d18eb5e1] [^88eab874].

In the ED, evaluate decreased fetal movement with **immediate fetal heart rate assessment** and **urgent obstetric consultation**. If the fetus is viable (≥ 24 weeks), perform a **nonstress test (NST)** and **ultrasound** to assess fetal well-being, growth, amniotic fluid, and placental function. If the NST is nonreassuring or ultrasound reveals abnormalities, admit for continuous monitoring and consider delivery. If tests are reassuring, discharge with strict return precautions and arrange follow-up within 24–48 hours. Always prioritize maternal-fetal safety and escalate care promptly if concerns persist [^d18eb5e1] [^88eab874].

---

## Initial assessment and triage

- **Immediate assessment**: On arrival, assess maternal vital signs, gestational age, and fetal viability. If gestational age is ≥ 24 weeks, proceed with fetal assessment; if < 24 weeks, prioritize maternal stabilization and urgent obstetric consultation [^notfound].

- **Fetal heart rate assessment**: Auscultate fetal heart tones using a Doppler device. Absence of fetal heart tones necessitates immediate ultrasound confirmation of fetal viability and urgent obstetric involvement [^notfound].

- **Maternal history**: Obtain a detailed history, including the duration and nature of decreased fetal movement, maternal comorbidities (e.g. hypertension, diabetes), previous pregnancy complications, and recent trauma or infection [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Gestational age ≥ 24 weeks

- **Nonstress test (NST)**: Perform an NST to assess fetal well-being. A reassuring NST shows two or more accelerations of ≥ 15 beats per minute lasting ≥ 15 seconds within 20 minutes, indicating adequate fetal oxygenation and neural integrity [^notfound].

- **Ultrasound assessment**: Conduct a targeted ultrasound to evaluate fetal growth, amniotic fluid volume, placental location and function, and fetal anatomy. Ultrasound can identify fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, placental insufficiency, or congenital anomalies that may explain decreased fetal movement [^notfound].

- **Doppler velocimetry**: If fetal growth restriction or placental insufficiency is suspected, perform umbilical artery Doppler studies to assess fetal vascular resistance and guide management decisions [^notfound].

---

### Gestational age < 24 weeks

In gestations under 24 weeks, **ultrasound** is the primary modality to confirm fetal viability, assess growth, and evaluate placental and amniotic fluid status. Immediate **obstetric consultation** is essential for further management and counseling.

---

## Management based on findings

### Reassuring findings (normal NST and ultrasound)

- **Discharge planning**: If NST and ultrasound are reassuring, discharge the patient with strict return precautions, including instructions to return immediately if decreased fetal movement persists, worsens, or if new symptoms develop (e.g. vaginal bleeding, severe abdominal pain, fever) [^notfound].

- **Follow-up**: Arrange follow-up within 24–48 hours for repeat assessment and continued monitoring of fetal well-being [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Provide education on fetal movement patterns, emphasizing the importance of reporting any further decrease or change in movement promptly [^d18eb5e1].

---

### Nonreassuring findings (abnormal NST or ultrasound)

- **Admission and continuous monitoring**: Admit the patient for continuous fetal monitoring, repeat NST, and serial ultrasound assessments. Persistent nonreassuring findings warrant escalation of care [^88eab874].

- **Obstetric consultation**: Involve obstetrics early for consideration of interventions, including corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity if preterm, and delivery planning based on gestational age and fetal condition [^88eab874].

- **Delivery considerations**: If gestational age is ≥ 34 weeks, delivery is often indicated for nonreassuring fetal status. Between 28–34 weeks, individualized decisions balance neonatal risks and benefits, with corticosteroids administered when appropriate [^88eab874].

---

## Special considerations

- **Maternal comorbidities**: Hypertension, diabetes, and other chronic conditions increase the risk of placental insufficiency and fetal compromise, necessitating closer monitoring and lower thresholds for intervention [^notfound].

- **Multiple gestations**: Twin pregnancies require heightened vigilance due to increased risks of fetal growth restriction and placental insufficiency [^notfound].

- **Patient anxiety and communication**: Address maternal anxiety through clear communication, education, and emotional support, reinforcing the importance of timely reporting of decreased fetal movement [^c135957a].

---

## Documentation and communication

Record maternal vital signs, gestational age, fetal heart rate, and a detailed history of decreased fetal movement. Document all diagnostic findings, including NST results, ultrasound findings, and Doppler studies. Communicate clearly with the patient regarding findings, management plan, and return precautions, and coordinate with obstetricians, primary care providers, and nursing staff to ensure continuity of care.

---

## Follow-up care

Arrange **follow-up within 24–48 hours** for repeat assessment of fetal well-being, and provide ongoing patient education on fetal movement monitoring and when to seek immediate medical attention. Maintain coordinated care with obstetricians and primary care providers to monitor maternal and fetal status closely.

---

In the ED, manage decreased fetal movement with **immediate fetal heart rate assessment**, **NST**, and **ultrasound** to guide disposition. Admit for nonreassuring results; discharge with strict return precautions for reassuring results, and ensure close follow-up.

### Management of decreased fetal movements [^121b79ea]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Maternal perception of decreased fetal activity is a common complaint, and one of the most frequent causes of unplanned visits in pregnancy. No proposed definitions of decreased fetal movements have ever been proven to be superior to a subjective maternal perception in terms of identifying a population at risk. Women presenting with decreased fetal movements do have higher risk of stillbirth, fetal growth restriction, fetal distress, preterm birth, and other associated outcomes. Yet, little research has been conducted to identify optimal management, and no randomized controlled trials have been performed. The strong associations with adverse outcome suggest that adequate management should include the exclusion of both acute and chronic conditions associated with decreased fetal movements. We propose guidelines for management of decreased fetal movements that include both a nonstress test and an ultrasound scan and report findings in 3014 cases of decreased fetal movements.

### A randomised controlled trial comparing standard or intensive management of reduced fetal movements after 36 weeks gestation – a feasibility study [^6f9dc8c0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Women attending a single maternity unit (St Mary's Hospital, Manchester, UK) presenting with RFM after 36 weeks gestation between October 2011 and August 2012 were invited to participate. The protocol was given a favourable ethical opinion by the Greater Manchester North Research Ethics Committee (11/NW/0664) and was registered on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register (ISRCTN07944306). Women were excluded if there was a known congenital anomaly, multiple pregnancy, the fetus required immediate delivery for abnormal fetal heart rate trace, maternal age was less than 16 years or they were unable to give informed consent.

Recruitment

Women meeting the inclusion criteria were approached by the research midwife (GB) either during their attendance at the maternity day unit (MDU) if between 9 am–5 pm or on the morning after attending the obstetric triage service outside normal hours (5 pm–9 am). Women approached during attendance at MDU were given information during the initial fetal heart rate assessment which lasted approximately 45 minutes. Women were then randomised to standard or intensive management groups by computer, using individual randomisation in a 1:1 ratio with random variable block size. This was facilitated by the University of Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit. We aimed to randomise 120 patients in total, giving 60 patients in each arm of the study. From our previous studies we anticipated a loss to follow-up of < 5% (3 participants per arm) and estimated that 150 women would need to be approached to recruit 120 participants. In addition, demographic data were collected on non-participants to determine whether there were differences between participants and non-participants.

Conclusions

This study aids understanding about why women present with RFM and how they reach that decision. This should inform professionals' practice, as appreciating and addressing womens' concerns may reduce anxiety and make presentation with further RFM more likely, a desirable outcome as this group is at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome.

Data Collection

Data were generated from face-to-face audio-recorded semi-structured interviews that were transcribed verbatim; these were supplemented by field notes detailing relevant features of the interview. The interview schedules were designed to understand women's and clinicians experiences and how they themselves make sense of RFM. Semi-structured questions included open-ended questions developed from expertise within the research team and published literature, thus gaining content validity. This style of interview allowed the pre-specified topics to be explored in detail, as well as allowing exploration of new ideas mentioned.

The women's interview schedule covered five broad topics; demographic details, general questions relating to the pregnancy, the women's understanding and experience of fetal activity in pregnancy, information and advice provided by clinicians or others about RFM, and specific questions relating to their experience of RFM.

The interview for clinicians addressed four broad topics; demographic details, clinical monitoring of fetal activity, information they provided about RFM, and specific questions relating to the management of RFM.

Analysis

Data were analysed using framework analysis principles - a flexible, rigorous and systematic method of analysis which entails the utilisation of a framework in five logical steps: familiarisation, identifying/developing a theoretical framework, indexing/charting and finally, mapping and interpretation. The data from each group of participants were analysed separately and then merged together to explain the process of managing RFMs from women's and clinicians perspectives. Rigour was maintained throughout the process by the research team conducting regular meetings to discuss the analysis of the data. To ensure anonymity and confidentiality each participant was assigned an individual number and all quotes anonymised. Individual codes denote two factors: interviewee number and length of time experiencing RFM before contacting a healthcare professional.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. Our study is limited by the lack of information regarding the length of time of DFM and the elapsed duration between the start of the DFM episode and presentation, which have been found to be associated with the risk of stillbirth. Furthermore, the relatively small number of stillbirths in our study and a tertiary center focus with a clear policy algorithm for the clinical management of women with DFM may limit the generalizability of our results. Additionally, during the study period, a new clinical protocol was implemented at our center for the treatment of women with DFM. Over the study period, the absolute number of women presenting with DFM increased, but the rate of increase was similar before the introduction of national guidelines compared with after the introduction. The increase in the number of women presenting with DFM is likely associated with increased community awareness, through frequent media campaigns, of the importance of monitoring fetal movements.

### A randomised controlled trial comparing standard or intensive management of reduced fetal movements after 36 weeks gestation – a feasibility study [^ec32ce2e]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reduced fetal movements (RFM) is a frequently seen problem in maternity care with 6–15% of women reporting attending at least one occasion of RFM to health professionals in the third trimester of pregnancy. RFM, defined by maternal perception of significantly reduced or absent fetal activity, is associated with increased risk of stillbirth and fetal growth restriction (FGR) due to placental dysfunction. Despite this association there is a paucity of evidence to direct clinical management of women presenting with RFM. This has been recently highlighted by guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG) and a meta-analysis, where the highest level of evidence identified was level 2 (case-control study). The absence of high-quality evidence has led to wide variation in management strategies for RFM in high-income settings.

Cohort studies carried out on different populations have found that the investigations that best predicted poor perinatal outcome (including stillbirth, FGR and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)) after RFM were electronic fetal monitoring, ultrasound assessment of fetal weight and liquor volume and measurement of human placental lactogen (hPL) in maternal serum. Although there are randomised controlled trials (RCT) of counting fetal movements by a formal structure (e.g. count to ten) there have been no published RCTs of patient management following presentation with RFM. To undertake an RCT of patient management raises important practical concerns including: maternal anxiety for fetal wellbeing, the need to make a decision regarding participation in a short period of time due to the acute nature of RFM and adherence to protocol. Thus, studies have adopted an approach of changing practice at the unit level in quality-improvement projects or stepwise cluster RCT (AFFIRM, NCT01777022).

We performed this study to address whether an RCT of the management of RFM in individual patients was an appropriate trial design, and was feasible with regard to i) maternal recruitment and retention ii) patient acceptability, iii) adherence to protocol. In addition, we wished to confirm the prevalence of poor perinatal outcomes in the study population.

### Evaluation of the quality of guidelines for the management of reduced fetal movements in UK maternity units [^d48b6252]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This evaluation has shown that unit guidelines for the management of a common presentation in maternity care were of variable quality, and were of a significantly lower standard than national guidelines. This may adversely affect care for women presenting with RFM. Unit guidelines need to be improved in specific areas, particularly stakeholder involvement and incorporating the relevant research identified by national guidance and applying those findings to the local situation.

### A randomised controlled trial comparing standard or intensive management of reduced fetal movements after 36 weeks gestation – a feasibility study [^bf352d70]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

To determine sample size of a definitive trial the following assumptions have been made: i) 33% of stillbirths occur after 36 weeks gestation; ii) the risk of stillbirth after RFM is three-times greater than the background risk; iii) 20% of pregnancies with RFM end in poor pregnancy outcome. To detect a 20% reduction in stillbirths after 36 weeks gestation with a power of 80% and α = 0.05 would require 146,945 patients per arm, if this is extended to death before discharge, 128,457 patients per arm are required. To use the approach of randomisation after testing conservatively assumes that women with a positive test are at a four-fold increased risk of poor perinatal outcome. To demonstrate a 20% reduction in perinatal mortality would require 5,568 participants in each arm, as 50% of women test positive, 22,272 women would need to be approached and tested. In comparison, to observe a reduction in composite poor perinatal outcome from 20% of women presenting with RFM after 36 weeks gestation to 16% would require 1,447 participants in each arm. Using the randomisation after testing approach in combination with the measure of poor perinatal outcome would reduce this further to 270 participants per arm, meaning that 1,080 participants would be required. There are approximately 700,000 births in England and Wales per year, and assuming 6% of women are reported to attend on at least one occasion with RFM, there are estimated to be 42,000 women presenting with RFM in the third trimester of pregnancy. If 33% of these are over 36 weeks gestation, this leaves approximately 14,000 women who may be eligible for a multi-centre study. This makes a study with stillbirth as the sole primary outcome unfeasible. However, using a composite primary outcome or randomisation after testing approach appropriate recruitment would be achievable. The feasibility study carried out here suggests that the former would be acceptable to patients and professionals. However, additional measures may be required to reduce maternal anxiety due to abnormal investigations the intensive group; these could include verbal and written information provided by staff.

Introduction

Reducing the tragedy of the estimated 2 million deaths that occur in the antenatal and intrapartum period remains the focus of significant national and internationalefforts. In low-income and middle-income countries, almost 1 in 2 stillbirths occurs during labor. In high-income countries, most stillbirths occur in the antenatal period, thus potentially allowing time to mitigate this risk through lifestyle and behavior change, optimization of management of comorbidities, identification of fetuses who are small for gestational age (SGA), and education regarding the importance of monitoring fetal movements. However, the causative pathways that culminate in fetal death are often poorly understood, making complete prevention of stillbirth problematic. Because of this difficulty, most stillbirth mitigation strategies involve a package of interventions addressing different elements of prenatal care, education, and risk factors.

Movements provide 1 simple measure of fetal well-being. Perception of fetal movements that are normal for that pregnancy generally reflects an appropriately functioning central nervous system and adequate oxygenation. Fetal hypoxia, associated with acute or chronic placental dysfunction, induces activation of the peripheral chemoreflex, centralization of cardiac output to vital organs, and a reduction in fetal movements, thereby limiting energy expenditure and oxygen consumption. Although decreased fetal movements (DFM) are associated with infants being born SGA, stillbirth, higher rates of induction of labor (IOL), emergency cesarean delivery, and adverse neonatal outcomes, the usefulness of DFM in predicting poor obstetric and perinatal outcomes is questionable, with most women who report DFM in the third trimester having outcomes without complications. Furthermore, maternal perception of fetal movements is highly subjective, and there is no universally agreed upon definition.

Currently, many international guidelines emphasize DFM as an important warning sign associated with risk of stillbirth for the fetus, and women are urged to monitor their baby's movements and alert their clinicians if concerned. However, the evidence supporting the incorporation of DFM into national guidelines and as part of a broader stillbirth reduction strategy remains limited. The aim of this study was to review pregnancy outcomes of women with singleton pregnancies presenting with DFM in the third trimester at a large Australian perinatal center.

Results

Quantitative evaluation of guidelines

Of the 235 units contacted, a response was received from 98 (42%). Of those respondents, 12 (12%) did not have a guideline. Seven (8%) of the 86 guidelines received were out of date and 10 (12%) had no review date. No guideline contained all 12 key recommendations from the RCOG Guideline, the median number of recommendations included in unit guidelines was 7 (Range 3–11; Table 1). The only criterion included in all the guidelines was 'after fetal viability has been confirmed and history confirms a decrease in fetal movements, arrangements should be made for the woman to have a cardiotocograph (CTG) to exclude fetal compromise'. Eleven units continue to recommend the use of kick-charts despite national guidance to the contrary. Further detailed investigation of women presenting with RFM was recommended in up to 30% of guidelines, which increased to 53% for women with multiple presentations with RFM. There was no relationship between the strength of evidence for the recommendation and inclusion in unit guidelines.

### Decreased fetal movements: report from the international stillbirth alliance conference workshop [^b3ba7cf2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Maternal reports of decreased fetal movement (DFM) are a common reason to present to maternity care and are associated with stillbirth and other adverse outcomes. Promoting awareness of fetal movements and prompt assessment of DFM has been recommended to reduce stillbirths. However, evidence to guide clinical management of such presentations is limited. Educational approaches to increasing awareness of fetal movements in pregnant women and maternity care providers with the aim of reducing stillbirths have recently been evaluated in a several large clinical trials internationally. The International Stillbirth Alliance Virtual Conference in Sydney 2021 provided an opportunity for international experts in fetal movements to share reports on the findings of fetal movement awareness trials, consider evidence for biological mechanisms linking DFM and fetal death, appraise approaches to clinical assessment of DFM, and highlight research priorities in this area. Following this workshop summaries of the sessions prepared by the authors provide an overview of understandings of fetal movements in maternity care at the current time and highlights future directions in fetal movement research.

### Effect of encouraging awareness of reduced fetal movement and subsequent clinical management on pregnancy outcome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b08f3366]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Reduced fetal movement, defined as a decrease in the frequency or strength of fetal movements as perceived by the mother, is a common reason for presentation to maternity care. Observational studies have demonstrated an association between reduced fetal movement and stillbirth and fetal growth restriction related to placental insufficiency. However, individual intervention studies have described varying results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether interventions aimed at encouraging awareness of reduced fetal movement and/or improving its subsequent clinical management reduce the frequency of stillbirth or other important secondary outcomes.

Data Sources

Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Guidelines, trial registries, and gray literature were also searched. Databases were searched from inception to January 20, 2022.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Randomized controlled trials and controlled nonrandomized studies were eligible if they assessed interventions aimed at encouraging awareness of fetal movement or fetal movement counting and/or improving the subsequent clinical management of reduced fetal movement. Eligible populations were singleton pregnancies after 24 completed weeks of gestation. The primary review outcome was stillbirth; a number of secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes were specified in the review.

Methods

Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies I tools for randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies, respectively. Variation caused by heterogeneity was assessed using I². Data from studies employing similar interventions were combined using random effects meta-analysis.

Results

A total of 1609 citations were identified; 190 full-text articles were evaluated against the inclusion criteria, 18 studies (16 randomized controlled trials and 2 nonrandomized studies) were included. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of encouraging awareness of fetal movement on stillbirth when compared with standard care (2 studies, n = 330,084) with a pooled adjusted odds ratio of 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 0.96–1.47). Interventions for encouraging awareness of fetal movement may be associated with a reduction in neonatal intensive care unit admissions and Apgar scores of < 7 at 5 minutes of age and may not be associated with increases in cesarean deliveries or induction of labor. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of encouraging fetal movement counting on stillbirth when compared with standard care with a pooled odds ratio of 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.18–2.65) based on data from 3 randomized controlled trials (n = 70,584). Counting fetal movements may increase maternal-fetal attachment and decrease anxiety when compared with standard care. When comparing combined interventions of fetal movement awareness and subsequent clinical management with standard care (1 study, n = 393,857), the evidence is uncertain about the effect on stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.05).

Conclusion

The effect of interventions for encouraging awareness of reduced fetal movement alone or in combination with subsequent clinical management on stillbirth is uncertain. Encouraging awareness of fetal movement may be associated with reduced adverse neonatal outcomes without an increase in interventions in labor. The meta-analysis was hampered by variations in interventions, outcome reporting, and definitions. Individual studies are frequently underpowered to detect a reduction in severe, rare outcomes and no studies were included from high-burden settings. Studies from such settings are needed to determine whether interventions can reduce stillbirth.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^205bf2c9]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American College of Emergency Physicians clinical policy — early pregnancy in the emergency department — revises the 2003 policy and frames evidence-based recommendations through three critical questions. It asks whether the emergency physician should obtain a pelvic ultrasound in a clinically stable pregnant patient with abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding and a beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level below a discriminatory threshold; in patients with an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound, what is the diagnostic utility of β-hCG for predicting possible ectopic pregnancy; and, in patients receiving methotrexate for confirmed or suspected ectopic pregnancy, what are the implications for emergency department management. Evidence was graded and recommendations were developed.

Importance

Stillbirth is a devastating pregnancy outcome with far-reaching economic and psychosocial consequences, but despite significant investment, a screening tool for identifying those fetuses at risk for stillbirth remains elusive. Maternal reporting of decreased fetal movements (DFM) has been found to be associated with stillbirth and other adverse perinatal outcomes.

Objective

To examine pregnancy outcomes of women presenting with DFM in the third trimester at a tertiary Australian center with a clear clinical management algorithm.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used data on all births meeting the inclusion criteria from 2009 through 2019 at Mater Mothers' Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. This is a tertiary center and Australia's largest maternity hospital. All singleton births without a known congenital anomaly after 28 weeks' gestation were included. Among 203 071 potential participants identified from the hospital database, 101 597 individuals met the eligibility criteria. Data analysis was performed from May through September 2020.

Exposure

Presentation to hospital with DFM after 28 weeks gestation.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of stillbirth. Multivariate analysis was undertaken to determine the association between DFM and stillbirth, obstetric intervention, and other adverse outcomes, including being born small for gestational age (SGA) and a composite adverse perinatal outcome (at least 1 of the following: neonatal intensive care unit admission, severe acidosis [ie, umbilical artery pH < 7.0 or base excess -12.0 mmol/L or less], 5-minute Apgar score < 4, or stillbirth or neonatal death). The hypothesis being tested was formulated prior to data collection.

Results

Among 101 597 women with pregnancies that met the inclusion criteria, 8821 (8.7%) presented at least once with DFM and 92 776 women (91.3%) did not present with DFM (ie, the control population). Women presenting with DFM, compared with those presenting without DFM, were younger (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [5.4] years vs 31.5 [5.2] years; P < .001), more likely to be nulliparous (4845 women [54.9%] vs 42 210 women [45.5%]; P < .001) and have a previous stillbirth (189 women [2.1%] vs 1156 women [1.2%]; P < .001), and less likely to have a previous cesarean delivery (1199 women [13.6%] vs 17 444 women [18.8%]; P < .001). During the study period, the stillbirth rate was 2.0 per 1000 births after 28 weeks' gestation. Presenting with DFM was not associated with higher odds of stillbirth (9 women [0.1%] vs 185 women [0.2%]; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.23–1.26, P = 0.16). However, presenting with DFM was associated with higher odds of a fetus being born SGA (aOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03–1.27; P = 0.01) and the composite adverse perinatal outcome (aOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.02–1.27; P = 0.02). Presenting with DFM was also associated with higher odds of planned early term birth (aOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.15–1.38; P < .001), induction of labor (aOR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.53–1.74; P < .001), and emergency cesarean delivery (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09–1.28; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

The presence of DFM is a marker associated with increased risk for a fetus. This study's findings of a nonsignificantly lower rate of stillbirth among women with DFM may be reflective of increased community awareness of timely presentation to their obstetric care clinician when concerned about fetal movements and the benefits of tertiary level care guided by a clear clinical management protocol. However, DFM was associated with increased odds of an infant being born SGA, obstetric intervention, early term birth, and a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes.

### Women's and clinicians perspectives of presentation with reduced fetal movements: a qualitative study [^f9bd845f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Irrespective of information and advice given to pregnant women, 6–15% present with concerns about RFM in late pregnancy. Seeking health information or advice in pregnancy often reflects individuals' circumstances in life, work and personal environment but this need may only be triggered if it is preceded by knowledge to seek advice regarding fetal movements i.e. what is 'normal' for her baby. Midwives and obstetricians knowledge and practice regarding fetal movements and RFM is variable and guidance varies between units Both staff and women had concerns about the mixed messages promoted by the internet, family-members and maternity staff. To address this, a consistent evidence-based message, regarding RFM, from maternity care providers must be delivered, which enables the woman to seek help whilst taking care not to needlessly elevate anxiety.

The internet provides an immediate resource for health and pregnancy related concerns and, if used appropriately, has positive value but the information retrieved can be inconsistent and incorrect. Whilst it may prove invaluable to some women, for others it does not play a significant role, preferring to speak to a midwife as their first port of call. Not only is it imperative that maternity care providers discuss current, evidence based information around fetal movements with women but also that they are able to guide women to reliable, high-quality web-based information. Equally, advice from a woman's social network may be inconsistent and inaccurate, which makes decision making a difficult task for the pregnant woman who receives conflicting advice from maternity care providers, internet, friends and family. If consistent advice is shared with pregnant women by maternity care providers, they will be able to recognise when advice from other sources is not valid and have confidence in themselves to seek help when necessary.

This study demonstrates women's and professionals uncertainty about definitions of normal and abnormal fetal movements and its management highlighted by previous questionnaire studies. This may stem in part from the low-level of evidence underpinning the management of RFM. Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the management of RFM concluded that more studies were needed. Systematic reappraisal of existing data has moved the focus from counting specific numbers of movements to maternal awareness of fetal movements. To address problems with information about normal and abnormal fetal movements high-quality information is needed that is accessible to women and their families.

Control Period

Standard care: Standard care across these maternity services usually includes provision of the bi-national brochure to women and management of women according to the recommended guidelines. Key recommendations include that all pregnant women should receive information about what constitutes normal FM and advise that concerns for a decrease in movements should be reported to a health care provider without delay. Upon presentation for care, and exclusion of fetal death, recommended clinical care includes a cardiotocograph (CTG) to exclude imminent fetal demise followed by a thorough examination and testing for maternal fetal haemorrhage. In the presence of risk factors or concerns about fetal growth, an ultrasound scan should be performed. Specific recommendations on timing of birth are not provided.

Intervention Period

MBM: In addition to standard care as provided in the control period, during the intervention period all eligible women will be offered the use of the MBM mobile phone app (or SMS messages for those who do not have a smartphone). All maternity care staff will be encouraged to complete an on-line DFM educational program, which educates and tests staff on the clinical care pathways for women presenting with decreased fetal movements, as outlined in Fig. 3. All sites receive a site visit from the CI team which includes presentation to staff on management of women with DFM.

Eight weeks prior to implementation, a teleconference is held with the MBM site team (usually made up of a midwifery educator, obstetrician and research midwife) and the MBM trial team to plan implementation, taking into consideration local procedures. The site team will be provided with an educational package about MBM and management of women with DFM to use in ongoing in-service education. One week prior to the commencement of the intervention phase, a site visit by the MBM trial team will be undertaken to present the trial and the management of women with DFM to clinical staff.

### Perinatal outcomes of reduced fetal movements: a cohort study [^785bfa5d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Maternal perception of reduced fetal movements (RFM) in pregnancy is a common reason for self-referral for assessment by healthcare providers in pregnancy. RFM has been shown to occur in up to 15% of pregnancies, and comprises of 6.1% of the workload of acute maternity assessment services. It has been found that up to 55% of women who have a stillbirth note a reduction in fetal movement prior to diagnosis. It has also been hypothesized that inadequate clinician response to the complaint of RFM is an important contributory factor to stillbirth. Factors relating to sub-optimal care are implicated in up to 50% of stillbirths, and suboptimal care is continually highlighted in international maternal morbidity and mortality enquiries.

Fetal movement counting is a long-standing method of assessing fetal wellbeing. Froen et al have reported that those presenting with RFM in pregnancy had an increased perinatal mortality, increased need for emergency delivery and low neonatal Apgar scores at delivery. International guidelines also note disparities in the definition and management of RFM. There is no evidence that any formal definition of RFM is of greater value than the subjective maternal perception in the detection of fetal compromise. There are no current randomised trials comparing pregnancy outcomes in those who employed fetal movement counting and those who did not utilise formal fetal movement counting, and therefore there is little consensus to advise clinical practice in the area of RFM. The implementation of formal counting strategies is increasingly a controversial issue, with some studies demonstrating no significant benefit to fetal movement counting. Conversely, some studies have shown that fetal movement counting reduces perinatal mortality, with little economic impact. It has been noted that consensus on the management of RFM is difficult to achieve due to lack of definitive guidance.

Further, more recent studies have recommended protocols to assess and manage RFM, and along with patient education, have decreased their institutional stillbirth rate from 4.2% to 2.4% in women with RFM.

From review of the literature, it is clear that there are a limited number of large scale studies comparing outcomes of pregnancies affected by RFM, particularly in the Irish context. As RFM is a significant precursor to intra-uterine fetal death, attention needs to be focussed on related areas of intervention.

The primary objective of this observational study was to assess the pregnancy characteristics and outcomes of pregnant women presenting to hospital with RFM. We examined the incidence and demographics of these women, and evaluated their investigation and management pathways.

### Evaluation of the quality of guidelines for the management of reduced fetal movements in UK maternity units [^210feff9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines are one means to improve and standardise clinical care; they are defined as "systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances". Their role in maternity care is strongly supported by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) who emphasise that "optimal standards of clinical care will be achieved only by following national guidelines and through the quality of staff training and clinical research". Potential positive impacts of clinical guidelines include: improved quality of clinical decisions, reduced variation in care, support for other quality improvement activities and identification of gaps in research evidence. However, guidelines can potentially lead to harm, research evidence could be lacking or misinterpreted, recommendations can be influenced by the guideline developers and inflexible guidelines can prevent care being tailored to individual patients. The RCOG published guidelines for the management of RFM in 2011, it is hoped that good quality guidance would reduce variation in care, increase access to appropriate investigations and reduce perinatal mortality.

This study aimed to systematically assess the quality of guidelines for the management of RFM in individual maternity units and whether this equates with the standard of national guidelines. To ensure robust and reproducible assessment of guidelines the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool was used to evaluate all guidelines.

### Reduction of late stillbirth with the introduction of fetal movement information and guidelines-a clinical quality improvement [^d8f0ac25]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Improved quality of management of DFM and uniform information to improve the value of the existing "self-screening" of fetal activity was associated with a reduction in stillbirth rates in our population. For further improvements, new and individually adjusted definitions of DFM are needed, as well as randomized controlled trials to determine the optimal management and information to pregnant women with DFM. Further research is required to identify optimal methods for detecting important reductions in FM if DFM is to be an effective screening tool for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

### Maternal perception of decreased fetal movements from maternal and fetal perspectives, a cohort study [^cd21df90]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study shows that 8.1% of healthy normotensive pregnant women who give birth to healthy term newborns report perception of decreased fetal movement when asked to count their fetal movement during the third gestational trimester which is independently associated with maternal employment, supine position when counting fetal movement and not having daily exercise. These factors should be taken into consideration when using this screening tool for assessing fetal well-being and also should be considered for the interpretation and management of patients presenting with concerns related to a decreased perception of fetal movement.

### Evaluation of the quality of guidelines for the management of reduced fetal movements in UK maternity units [^3b4e32cc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The development of evidence-based guidelines is a key step in ensuring that maternity care is of a universally high standard. To influence patient care national and international guidelines need to be interpreted and implemented locally. In 2011, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists published guidelines for the management of reduced fetal movements (RFM), which can be an important symptom of fetal compromise. Following dissemination it was anticipated that this guidance would be implemented in UK maternity units. This study aimed to assess the quality of local guidelines for the management of RFM in comparison to published national standards.

Methods

Cross-sectional survey of maternity unit guidelines for RFM. The guidelines were assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II Tool and scored by two independent investigators. Two national guidelines were used as standards to evaluate unit guidelines.

Results

Responses were received from 98 units (42%); 12 units had no guideline. National guidelines scored highly using the AGREE II tool but there was wide variation in the quality of individual maternity unit guidelines, which were frequently of low quality. No guidelines incorporated all the recommendations from the national guideline. Maternity unit guidelines performed well for clarity and presentation but had low scores for stakeholder involvement, rigour of development and applicability.

Conclusions

In contrast to national evidence based guidance the quality of maternity unit guidelines for RFM is variable and frequently of low quality. To increase quality, guidelines need to include up to date evidence and audit standards which could be taken directly from national evidence-based guidance. Barriers to local implementation and resource implications need to be taken into consideration. Training may also improve the implementation of the guideline. Research is needed to inform strategies to realize the benefits of clinical guidance in practice.

### Management of reported decreased fetal movements for improving pregnancy outcomes [^ed2de190]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical observations indicate that mothers commonly perceive a reduction in, or absence of, the baby's movements for some days preceding a baby's death. For this reason, fetal movement monitoring is advised by caregivers and used spontaneously by mothers to assess the baby's well-being. However, it is possible that the harmful effects of interventions may outweigh the benefits of such testing. Evidence of effectiveness of fetal movement screening to improve outcomes is limited, though indirect evidence suggests a potential benefit. A secondary question is whether any specific management response to perceived decreased fetal movements (DFM) improves clinical outcome.

Objectives

To determine, from the best available evidence, the effectiveness of various management strategies for DFM.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 February 2012) and bibliographies of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing various management strategies for DFM, including delivery, expectant management, cardiotocography (visual and computerised), ultrasound examination including Doppler ultrasound, and fetal arousal tests (cardiotocographic or clinical).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two assessors evaluated potentially eligible trials for inclusion, and extracted data onto a purpose-designed form. Where DFM was one among a number of inclusion criteria for the trial, we contacted trial authors for information on outcomes specific to the DFM subgroups.

Main Results

No randomised trials of management of DFM were found. Of 13 randomised trials of management strategies for pregnancies with risk factors for fetal compromise including DFM, data on the DFM subgroups could only be provided by the authors of one trial. The numbers were too small for meaningful analysis (there were 28 cases of DFM).

Authors' Conclusions

There are insufficient data from randomised trials to guide practice regarding the management of DFM. Based on the results of other systematic reviews of management strategies for women whose babies are thought to be at risk of compromise for various reasons, the following strategies show promise and may be prioritised for further research: Doppler ultrasound studies, computerised cardiotocography, and fetal arousal to facilitate cardiotocography. For settings where electronic fetal assessment methods are not available, clinical fetal arousal tests should be investigated.

Fetal kick counting for women with history of unexplained stillbirth — Women reporting decreased fetal movement are at increased risk for adverse perinatal outcomes, but although fetal kick counting is an inexpensive test of fetal well-being, evidence of its effectiveness in preventing stillbirth remains uncertain. One study combining uniform patient information and standardized provider guidelines for decreased fetal movement was associated with a reduction in stillbirth rates, whereas a large randomized study of fetal movement awareness did not demonstrate a reduction in stillbirth rates and observed more interventions such as inductions and hospital admissions. There are insufficient data to make specific recommendations regarding fetal kick counts; best practices emphasize encouraging awareness of fetal movement patterns, attending to complaints of reduced fetal movements in a systematic way, and using shared decision making to use interventions safely.

5.1 Counting active movements

The meta‐analysis by Hayes et al. showed that neither counting active fetal movements (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.18–2.65) nor encouraging women to perceive fetal movements regularly (OR = 1.19; 95% CI: 0.96–1.47) reduced the fetal death rate. These results were confirmed in the AFFIRM study by Norman et al. Therefore, it is not recommended to ask women to perform active fetal movement counts to reduce the risk of fetal death (strong recommendation; high quality of evidence).

5.2 Management during a consultation for decreased active fetal movement

At the time of consultation for diminished active fetal movement, it is recommended to (expert opinion):
Assess for the presence of fetal heart activity.
Perform an initial assessment: Search for a risk situation, particularly in utero growth retardation and fetal anemia, by clinical examination and analysis of the obstetric record, and Perform a fetal assessment by: ○ Recording the fetal heart rate and perception of fetal movements during the test ○ And/or an ultrasound scan that objectifies fetal movements and assesses the amount of amniotic fluid without the need for a biophysical (i.e. Manning) score.

Assessment method choices depend on GA, context, and local resources. If the initial assessment is normal and no underlying pathology is suspected, the Kleihauer–Betke test should not be performed. Nor should specific monitoring or systematic induction of labor be planned. If the initial assessment is not normal, management should be adjusted on a case‐by‐case basis.

### A randomised controlled trial comparing standard or intensive management of reduced fetal movements after 36 weeks gestation – a feasibility study [^b89d4bcd]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

A recent systematic review and meta-analysis and the RCOG guideline have identified the need for robust evidence to guide the management of RFM. This feasibility study suggests that a randomised controlled trial of the individualised management of RFM would be acceptable to women perceiving RFM after 36 weeks gestation and to professionals, given a participation rate of 87% and a dropout rate of < 2%. A minority of participants were keen to be randomised to the more intensive management, but this did not appear to cause participants to withdraw from the standard arm of the trial. These effects of participant preference are similar to those previously described in other analyses of randomised controlled trials. Importantly, both strategies tested here resulted in a decrease in maternal anxiety after tests were performed, but the reduction in anxiety was greater in women receiving standard management compared to intensive management group. This may reflect concerns of women who had an abnormal investigation leading to IOL which was more frequent in the intensive management group. This feasibility study suggests that a larger trial may increase the rate of IOL for RFM as a primary intervention for abnormal investigation findings, but this should not impact on instrumental or Caesarean delivery. This is in agreement with studies that describe no increased rate of obstetric intervention in RCT of fetal movement counting or in quality improvement studies for women with RFM.

### Evaluation of the quality of guidelines for the management of reduced fetal movements in UK maternity units [^218e5695]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

To address deficiencies in the care of women presenting with RFM identified by CESDI and national surveys of practice regarding RFM, ANZSA and RCOG produced guidelines released in 2010 and 2011 respectively. The failure to translate evidence-based guidance into local maternity unit guidelines represents a missed opportunity to address variation in care and to potentially reduce stillbirths in this high-risk group. Differences between local and national recommendations described here is not an isolated finding in maternity care; Rowe described low-quality of UK guidelines for transfer of women in labour from midwifery-led units and two international studies, a Danish study of methods of anaesthesia for Caesarean section and a review of guidelines developed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) described variation in guideline quality. The WHO study found that newer guidelines were of higher quality than older ones, which may be relevant to the guidelines for the management of RFM reviewed here as 20% were out of date or had no specified review date. In addition, even when the same guideline is used, different units vary in their adherence to it, resulting in failure to deliver effective treatment. Thus, local factors need to be addressed when implementing any clinical guidance.

Introduction

- Item 2a

- **Standard CONSORT item**: scientific background and explanation of rationale

- **Extension for pilot trials**: scientific background and explanation of rationale for future definitive trial, and reasons for randomised pilot trial

- Example

"Reduced fetal movements (RFM) is a frequently seen problem in maternity care with 6–15% of women reporting attending at least one occasion of RFM to health professionals in the third trimester of pregnancy. RFM, defined by maternal perception of significantly reduced or absent fetal activity, is associated with increased risk of stillbirth and fetal growth restriction (FGR) due to placental dysfunction. Despite this association there is a paucity of evidence to direct clinical management of women presenting with RFM. This has been recently highlighted by guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (RCOG) and a meta-analysis. The absence of high-quality evidence has led to wide variation in management strategies for RFM in high-income settings. Although there are randomised controlled trials (RCT) of counting fetal movements by a formal structure (e.g. count to ten) there have been no published RCTs of patient management following presentation with RFM. To undertake an RCT of patient management raises important practical concerns including: maternal anxiety for fetal wellbeing, the need to make a decision regarding participation in a short period of time due to the acute nature of RFM and adherence to protocol. Thus, studies have adopted an approach of changing practice at the unit level in quality-improvement projects or stepwise cluster RCT (AFFIRM, NCT01777022). We performed this study to address whether an RCT of the management of RFM in individual patients was an appropriate trial design, and was feasible with regard to i) maternal recruitment and retention ii) patient acceptability, iii) adherence to protocol. In addition, we wished to confirm the prevalence of poor perinatal outcomes in the study population".

### Maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes associated with delivery versus expectant management following decreased fetal movement at term [^6a3fb94e]. American Journal of Perinatology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study aimed to compare maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes between term patients evaluated for decreased fetal movement (DFM) who were delivered versus expectantly managed. Retrospective cohort study of term patients delivering within a large hospital system from 2015 to 2023 who were evaluated for DFM. Patients were classified into three groups based on the time between evaluation for DFM and delivery admission: (1) < 24hours, (2) 24-48hours, (3) > 48hours. Bivariate comparisons and multinomial logistic regression were performed to evaluate which maternal characteristics were associated with immediate delivery (< 24 and 24-48hours latency) as compared with expectant management (> 48hours latency) as well as to compare delivery and neonatal outcomes. Of 2,015 patients, significant sociodemographic and clinical variations were noted between groups. Following adjustment, noncommercial insurance, hypertension in pregnancy, and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30kg/m² at delivery were associated with reduced odds of admission < 24 and 24-48hours as compared with > 48hours. There were no cases of stillbirth or neonatal demise and there were no differences in delivery or neonatal outcomes. Among patients with DFM at term, there are significant sociodemographic and clinical variations between those admitted for < 24, 24–48, and > 48hours, though delivery and neonatal outcomes were similar. · Having noncommercial insurance, hypertension in pregnancy, and BMI ≥ 30kg/m² at delivery were associated with reduced odds of admission within < 24 and 24-48hours as compared with > 48hours after presenting with DFM at term. · There were no cases of stillbirth or neonatal demise among this cohort of patients presenting with DFM at term. · There were no differences in delivery or neonatal outcomes among this cohort of patients presenting with DFM at term as stratified by timing from presentation to admission for delivery.

### Reduction of late stillbirth with the introduction of fetal movement information and guidelines-a clinical quality improvement [^f865ae17]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Women experiencing decreased fetal movements (DFM) are at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including stillbirth. Fourteen delivery units in Norway registered all cases of DFM in a population-based quality assessment. We found that information to women and management of DFM varied significantly between hospitals. We intended to examine two cohorts of women with DFM before and during two consensus-based interventions aiming to improve care through: 1) written information to women about fetal activity and DFM, including an invitation to monitor fetal movements, 2) guidelines for management of DFM for health-care professionals.

Methods

All singleton third trimester pregnancies presenting with a perception of DFM were registered, and outcomes collected independently at all 14 hospitals. The quality assessment period included April 2005 through October 2005, and the two interventions were implemented from November 2005 through March 2007. The baseline versus intervention cohorts included: 19,407 versus 46,143 births and 1215 versus 3038 women with DFM, respectively.

Results

Reports of DFM did not increase during the intervention. The stillbirth rate among women with DFM fell during the intervention: 4.2% vs. 2.4%, (OR 0.51 95% CI 0.32–0.81), and 3.0/1000 versus 2.0/1000 in the overall study population (OR 0.67 95% CI 0.48–0.93). There was no increase in the rates of preterm births, fetal growth restriction, transfers to neonatal care or severe neonatal depression among women with DFM during the intervention. The use of ultrasound in management increased, while additional follow up visits and admissions for induction were reduced.

Conclusion

Improved management of DFM and uniform information to women is associated with fewer stillbirths.

### Women's and clinicians perspectives of presentation with reduced fetal movements: a qualitative study [^0759ec6a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Worldwide maternal perception of fetal movements has been used for many years to evaluate fetal wellbeing. It is intuitively regarded as an expression of fetal well-being as pregnancies in which women consistently report regular fetal movements have very low morbidity and mortality. Conversely, maternal perception of reduced fetal movements is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We sought to gain insight into pregnant women's and clinicians views and experiences of reduced movements.

Method

We performed qualitative semi-structured interviews with pregnant women who experienced reduced fetal movements in their current pregnancy and health professionals who provide maternity care. Our aim was to develop a better understanding of events, facilitators and barriers to presentation with reduced fetal movements. Data analysis was conducted using framework analysis principles.

Results

Twenty-one women and 10 clinicians were interviewed. The themes that emerged following the final coding were influences of social network, facilitators and barriers to presentation and the desire for normality.

Conclusions

This study aids understanding about why women present with reduced movements and how they reach the decision to attend hospital. This should inform professionals' views and practice, such that appreciating and addressing women's concerns may reduce anxiety and make presentation with further reduced movements more likely, which is desirable as this group is at increased risk of adverse outcome. To address problems with information about normal and abnormal fetal movements, high-quality information is needed that is accessible to women and their families.

### Evaluation of pregnancy outcomes among women with decreased fetal movements [^ffb3a162]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

While there are data showing that many women report a reduction in fetal movements preceding their stillbirth, the usefulness of DFM as a screening test for stillbirth remains unclear. Although an association between DFM and stillbirth has been found previously, along with other adverse perinatal outcomes, the difference between our study and others, is that we excluded pregnancies for which stillbirth was diagnosed at first presentation with DFM. This was done because including such pregnancies would incorrectly influence outcomes, given that DFM is a symptom of fetal death and not a risk factor for subsequent stillbirth in these pregnancies. In our view, failure to exclude these cases from analysis in other studies may raise the potential for interpreting nonsignificant associations between DFM and stillbirth as significant. This may in part explain why stillbirth rates were not significantly different among women with DFM who were treated using strict guidelines incorporating early term birth compared with a control population in a 2018 randomized clinical trial. This trial also found that a package aimed at improving maternal awareness of DFM and expediting delivery even at early term gestation resulted in a significant increase in rates of IOL, emergency cesarean delivery, NICU admission, and early neonatal deaths.

Maternal perception of fetal movements has long been considered a sign associated with fetal well-being. Decreased fetal movements may occur as an adaptive response to fetal hypoxia (acute or chronic) as a consequence of placental dysfunction and may be associated with fetal growth restriction or stillbirth. Consequently, DFM is perceived to be an important risk factor associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. However, maternal perception of DFM is also associated with smoking, nulliparity, fetal anomaly, and anterior placental location, with most women who present with DFM having an uncomplicated live birth.

Our finding of higher odds of planned early term birth among women with DFM is worrying but not surprising. Prevention of stillbirth is clearly achieved with the birth of a live infant, and most caregivers would feel that the trade-off between earlier birth and death is an obvious choice. However, early term birth, compared with birth at later than 39 weeks and 0 days, is associated with an increased risk of neonatal morbidity, including respiratory distress, NICU admission, neonatal hypoglycemia, and intubation. Moreover, early term birth is associated with adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes, including cerebral palsy (aOR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.32–3.31; P < .001) and intellectual impairment.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^7412f560]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Anti-D immunoglobulin prophylaxis — evidence in Rh-negative patients — lacks randomized trials in pregnant women but shows benefits in observational and experimental data. "The straightforward answer is that no randomized clinical trials to answer that question have been done on pregnant Rh-negative women". In volunteers, "Rh-negative male volunteers were injected with Rh-positive blood, which resulted in 50% immunization". In a Canadian study "of 1,216 Rh-negative patients… receiving anti-D immunoglobulin, there were no cases of immunization at 6 months postpartum", compared with "a 7.3% immunization rate in patients refusing treatment". In a combined Liverpool and Baltimore trial, "58% of patients were treated with anti-D immunoglobulin immediately postpartum and 50% were not", and "The treated patients had a 90% decrease in alloimmunization… when tested at 6 months postpartum". Population-level programs show impact: in the United Kingdom, introduction of "a postpartum rhesus prevention program… in 1969 reduced fetal mortality… from 120 per 100,000 live births to 1.5 per 100,000 by 1989", and "Introduction of antenatal prophylaxis at 28 and/or 34 weeks' gestation reduced the immunization rate another 90%".

### Women's and clinicians perspectives of presentation with reduced fetal movements: a qualitative study [^dea729b9]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Mixed messages

There was a large variation and inconsistencies in the definition of 'normal' fetal movements, which was recognised to lead to confusion by both women and clinicians:

"One of the problems I encounter is that there's a wide broad-ranging experience and level of understanding of RFM which means that the information women are given varies greatly… That's why they're confused, not because their family has misinformed them, but because they ask lots of different people and get lots of different answers".(31; midwife)

"You hear different things, because somebody tells you every 12 h, somebody tells you a certain amount of movement doing all day. You question yourself, if gives me two kicks, one after another, do I count as one or two?" (09; 12 h)

Almost all women reported being asked about fetal movements as part of their routine care, most of this advice was centred on the woman's awareness of their baby's pattern of movements: "they've just said what's felt normal for you (10; 2 days) ". Some women wanted advice that was more tangible, wanting to know the time it takes to observe a specified number of movements: "They haven't told me how often or how many times she should move" (06; 2 days). As a consequence some women could not confidently recall at what point they should consider their movements to be suboptimal: "I don't know how bad it would have to be" (20; 2 days) or considered the enquiry by professions as insufficient: "I don't think they've ever said what I should be feeling" (06; 2 days).

### My baby's movements: a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial to raise maternal awareness of fetal movements during pregnancy study protocol [^6047ee07]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

The challenge of stillbirth prevention

With improvements in intrapartum care in HIC settings, the majority of stillbirths now occur in the antepartum period. The on-going risk of stillbirth increases each week towards the end of pregnancy. In addtition, maternal and fetal factors which increase the risk include maternal overweight and obesity, smoking in pregnancy, age 35 years or more, fetal growth restriction, and previous stillbirth. In the absence of a reliable screening test for stillbirth, early identificaiton of risk factors combined with appropriate monitoring and early birth, when indicated, is the mainstay of management to reduce late gestation stillbirth.

DFM is a marker of an at-risk pregnancy. DFM is thought to be an adaptive response to acute or chronic placental dysfunction whereby the fetus reduces gross movement to conserve blood flow for the vital organs. Women who experience DFM have a four-fold increased risk of stillbirth and double the risk of fetal growth restriction. DFM is also associated with other serious adverse outcomes including feto-maternal haemorrhage, low birth weight, neonatal death and neurodevelopmental disability. Clinical audits into substandard care show that around 20–30% of stillbirths may have been avoided through better care, with deficiencies in care around detection and management of women with decreased/reduced fetal movements a common finding.

### Perinatal outcomes of reduced fetal movements: a cohort study [^fee3d810]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The perception of reduced fetal movement (RFM) is an important marker of fetal wellbeing and is associated with poor perinatal outcome (such as intra-uterine death).

Methods

We conducted a prospective study of women presenting with RFM over 28 weeks' gestation to a tertiary-level maternity hospital. We examined pregnancy outcomes and compared them to a retrospectively collected control group delivering contemporaneously.

Results

In total, 275 presentations were analysed in the RFM group, with 264 in the control group. Women with RFM were more likely to be nulliparous (p = 0.002) and have an induction of labour (p = 0.0011). 26.5% (n = 73) of cases were admitted following presentation with RFM, and 79.4% (n = 58) delivered on primary presentation. Overall, 15.2% (n = 42) women were induced for RFM specifically.

Conclusion

This prospective study shows the increased burden of care required by those with RFM, including increased neonatal unit admission rates, increased induction rates and higher surveillance demands, demonstrating the need for increased attention to this area of practice.

### Reduction of late stillbirth with the introduction of fetal movement information and guidelines-a clinical quality improvement [^a9cbfa1c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Among the attempts to define DFM, a variety of methods of FM counting with different alarm limits have been published. Among these, the rule of "ten movements within 2 hours". This is the only definition of DFM based on focused maternal counting which has been both developed and tested as a screening tool in a total population, and currently the definition of DFM recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists if maternal movement counting is performed. Other definitions of DFM have mostly been based on counting through both rest and activity and have little evidence in support of their association with actual fetal activity. The most important clinical understanding of DFM is still the mother's own perception of a decrease.

There are no universally accepted guidelines for the management of DFM. Although several studies have presented guidelines including non-stress test (NST), ultrasound examination and Doppler, most of these recommendations are based on limited evidence, as we have reviewed elsewhere.

We intended to examine two cohorts of women with DFM before and during a quality improvement intervention by implementing guidelines for management of DFM and uniform information on fetal activity to women.

### Awareness of fetal movements and care package to reduce fetal mortality (AFFIRM): a stepped wedge, cluster-randomised trial [^f7cc1a3b]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Interest in RFM as a stillbirth prevention tool has been renewed in recent years. The arbitrary threshold of normal movements (as used by Grant and colleagues) is widely recognised as unhelpful; rather, the woman's perception of RFM is important. Crucially, maternal perception of RFM can only improve outcome if action is taken. In Norway, as part of a seminal quality improvement project, a package of care was introduced to raise awareness of the importance of reporting RFM, combined with action to detect babies that are small for gestational age and expedited delivery of babies at risk. The incidence of stillbirth decreased from 3.0 stillbirths per 1000 pregnancies to 2.0 stillbirths per 1000 pregnancies. Consequently, several groups have prioritised RFM for stillbirth research.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Awareness of reduced fetal movement (RFM) is promoted to reduce stillbirth, but the evidence to support the effect of RFM awareness is uncertain. We searched PubMed in 2013, and updated the search on March 23, 2018, using the terms "reduced fetal movement" AND "randomised trials" OR "systematic review". We found one systematic review evaluating routine fetal movement counting compared with mixed or undefined fetal movement counting, but there were no differences in the incidence of stillbirth or perinatal mortality between the groups. All the data to inform this finding came from a single cluster-randomised trial of 68 654 women, with a standard mean difference in incidence of stillbirth per cluster of 0.23 per 1000 (95% CI −0.61 to 1.07), with a trend to higher risk in the intervention clusters.

### Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children in a pregnant pediatric patient… [^2e54f04c]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

We present a case of MIS-C and associated shock in a pregnant pediatric patient requiring ICU level care. Case Description: A 16-year-old G1P0 female presented to the ED at 25 weeks gestation with complaints of fever, headache, myalgias, cough and congestion. She denied prior COVID-19 exposure and vaccination, and COVID-19 PCR testing returned negative. She was diagnosed with a viral syndrome. She further reported decreased fetal movement. OB performed a biophysical profile that was overall reassuring, and she was discharged. Due to persistent symptoms and new onset chest pain and dyspnea, she returned to the ED six days after her initial presentation. Bedside ultrasound demonstrated fetal tachycardia. Laboratory work up revealed leukocytosis, anemia, hyponatremia and hypokalemia with markedly elevated inflammatory markers concerning for MIS-C. She was treated empirically with ceftriaxone and vancomycin.

She developed fluid refractory shock and ultimately required vasoactive support with norepinephrine necessitating admission to the PICU with OB consultation. Continuous fetal monitors demonstrated normalization of fetal heart rate. She was transferred to the high risk OB floor on hospital day 3. During her stay, she developed a mild transaminitis thought to be associated with MIS-C given her otherwise negative workup. She was discharged home on hospital day 12 on a prednisone taper and oral iron. Discussion: Pregnancy complications associated with COVID-19 are still not well understood, but include preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and premature birth. Although rare, cases of vertical transmission and fetal demise have been reported, as well. Given the profound effects that both pregnancy and MIS-C have on the body, understanding the potential risks of MIS-C in pregnancy is imperative to ensure favorable outcomes.

Our current understanding of the effects of maternal MIS-C on a fetus can only be extrapolated from studies on adult women infected during pregnancy and a single reported case of MIS-A in a pregnant adult. Conclusion: We report a case of a pregnant pediatric patient who presented to the ED with shock secondary to MIS-C and associated fetal tachycardia that was successfully treated with vasopressors, IVIG and steroids to enhance knowledge for this presentation and treatment of this condition in a vulnerable population.

### The association between increased fetal movements in the third trimester and perinatal outcomes; a systematic review and meta-analysis [^85054ab1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Adverse perinatal outcomes are the main causes of neonatal mortality and morbidity. It is estimated that 2.5 million late gestation stillbirths and 3 million neonatal deaths occur globally each year. Moreover, over 40% of all stillbirths that happen during labor and delivery could have been prevented with improved fetal monitoring and access to emergency obstetric care when needed. Various factors may contribute to stillbirth, including maternal health and obstetric condition, sociodemographic and economic status, congenital abnormalities, pregnancy disorder, and placental dysfunction. It seems crucial to determine the modifiable risk factors to develop prevention strategies and reduce the risk of stillbirth.

Fetal well-being can be monitored by the number of fetal movements being perceived by the mother. Reduced fetal movement (RFM) is typically defined as a decrease in the mother's perception of fetal movements or a change in the pattern of normal movement. A great number of studies that evaluated the relationship between maternal understanding of fetal activity and pregnancy outcomes, were focused RFM. There is some evidence to support that RFM is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. It was estimated that more than half of the pregnant women who face stillbirth understood the reduction in fetal movements before the diagnosis. The likely mechanism behind RFM was explained as impaired placental function, which led to increased inflammation and limited blood supply in fetuses experiencing RFM. So, guidelines have been developed based on the best recent findings, to provide recommendations for clinicians to manage women with reduced fetal movement.

### Evaluation of the quality of guidelines for the management of reduced fetal movements in UK maternity units [^ecabaff0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of fetal movements (FM) is a well-recognised sign of fetal viability and vitality. In contrast to the reassurance provided by normal fetal activity, reduced fetal movements (RFM) can be an important symptom preceding fetal death; this was initially recognised in cohorts of women completing fetal movement charts. These findings are confirmed by recent studies, O'Sullivan et al. describe a 2–3 fold increased risk of subsequent stillbirth in women who present with a live baby after RFM and Stacey et al. found a two-fold increase in maternal perception of RFM in the two weeks prior to stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio 2.37; 95% CI: 1.29–4.35). Biomedical studies suggest that maternal perception of RFM is associated with stillbirth by underlying placental dysfunction. Thus, it is hypothesised that maternal awareness of fetal movements and standardised management to detect fetal compromise could reduce the incidence of stillbirth. One quality-improvement study gives preliminary evidence that this may be the case.

The 8 th Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths and Deaths in Infancy (CESDI) reviewed 422 antepartum stillbirths and found suboptimal care in 45% of cases; more than 10% of which related to altered FMs or RFM, including: changes in FMs not voiced by the mother, healthcare professionals not effectively communicating the importance of reporting a change in FMs or inadequate management of RFM. Inadequate management included failure to act in high risk pregnancies and not undertaking appropriate examinations and investigations. Although the 8 th CESDI report dates from 1999, these findings were echoed in a regional Confidential Enquiry of stillbirths in 2010–11.

Two related studies, in the UK and Australia/New Zealand describe a wide variation in obstetric and midwifery practice in the management of RFM. This may result from a paucity of evidence identified by two systematic reviews that conclude that formal FM counting using specified alarm-limits cannot be recommended and no specific management plan can be proposed. Due to the variation in practice and the frequency of suboptimal care in the management of RFM, several studies concluded that a clinical guideline covering the assessment and management of RFM should be developed.

### Reduction of late stillbirth with the introduction of fetal movement information and guidelines-a clinical quality improvement [^92dfb8e1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

Guideline development

Our observations of pregnancies with DFM prior to the intervention identified significant differences in management between hospitals – none had provided the women with written information – and there were indications of co-variation between management and pregnancy outcomes. Almost all hospitals would perform an NST, about half performed an ultrasound scanning, and some carried out an umbilical artery Doppler examinations. The risk of adverse outcomes increased with the severity (perceived absence of DFM) and duration of DFM. Undesirable behavior was frequent, with one-third of the women did not present before an absence of FM was perceived: one-quarter of these women waited for more that 24 hours. An initial survey of all 55 birth clinics in Norway found a wide range of definitions of DFM used to inform women, varying from three kicks per hour to an absence of more than 24 hours. Among the fourteen participating clinics, the women received a wide range of advice in terms of normal frequency of FM: varying from 25 kicks per hour to 3 kicks per 24 hours.

With this in mind, a systematic review of all currently published literature was undertaken to determine the optimal management for women with DFM. A group of experts together with Chairs of midwifery and obstetrics of all participating hospitals developed a best- practice- and consensus-based approach to the best-practice management of DFM and the information provided to pregnant women. In our own quality assessment of care prior to the intervention, NST and ultrasound examination were found to be the most useful tools for fetal surveillance in DFM, while an umbilical artery Doppler examination failed to add significant information among 3014 cases of DFM. Ultrasound scanning was, by comparison, the most important tool, being the source of information in 86.2% of cases where abnormalities were detected. In brief, our implemented guidelines recommended: a standard clinical evaluation for all women reporting DFM, an NST, and an ultrasound scan to quantify FM, amniotic fluid volume, and fetal anatomy and growth. A mother presenting with a concern of DFM was to be examined within two 2 hours if absence of FM was suspected, otherwise within 12 hours (guidelines published in detail).

### My baby's movements: a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial to raise maternal awareness of fetal movements during pregnancy study protocol [^ad8bdd66]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Stillbirth is a devastating pregnancy outcome that has a profound and lasting impact on women and families. Globally, there are over 2.6 million stillbirths annually and progress in reducing these deaths has been slow. Maternal perception of decreased fetal movements (DFM) is strongly associated with stillbirth. However, maternal awareness of DFM and clinical management of women reporting DFM is often suboptimal. The My Baby's Movements trial aims to evaluate an intervention package for maternity services including a mobile phone application for women and clinician education (MBM intervention) in reducing late gestation stillbirth rates.

Methods/Design

This is a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial with sequential introduction of the MBM intervention to 8 groups of 3–5 hospitals at four-monthly intervals over 3years. The target population is women with a singleton pregnancy, without lethal fetal abnormality, attending for antenatal care and clinicians providing maternity care at 26 maternity services in Australia and New Zealand. The primary outcome is stillbirth from 28weeks' gestation. Secondary outcomes address: a) neonatal morbidity and mortality; b) maternal psychosocial outcomes and health-seeking behaviour; c) health services utilisation; d) women's and clinicians' knowledge of fetal movements; and e) cost. 256,700 births (average of 3170 per hospital) will detect a 30% reduction in stillbirth rates from 3/1000 births to 2/1000 births, assuming a significance level of 5%. Analysis will utilise generalised linear mixed models.

Discussion

Maternal perception of DFM is a marker of an at-risk pregnancy and commonly precedes a stillbirth. MBM offers a simple, inexpensive resource to reduce the number of stillborn babies, and families suffering the distressing consequences of such a loss. This large pragmatic trial will provide evidence on benefits and potential harms of raising awareness of DFM using a mobile phone app.

### Emergency management of the nonviable intrauterine pregnancy [^5e28bbc5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Fetal death early in gestation is common. Patients in the first trimester of pregnancy with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding often present to the emergency department for care. Over the past 20 years, the technology available to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of a nonviable pregnancy has improved dramatically. These improvements have altered the diagnostic approach to these patients and have lead to a change in the terminology used to categorize the pregnancy status. In addition, the therapeutic options available to manage patients with a confirmed nonviable pregnancy have expanded greatly. In this article, we re-evaluate the classification scheme used to categorize patients with first trimester pain or bleeding given the improved technology that is available to the emergency physician today. We discuss the role of ultrasound and biochemical markers in confirming or excluding the diagnosis of a nonviable pregnancy. Finally, we review the therapeutic options, including expectant, surgical as well as medical management that are available once the diagnosis of a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy has been confirmed.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^4d47b846]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy of unknown location predictive model — model derivation and prospective validation included stable pregnant patients presenting to an early pregnancy unit with pain with or without bleeding, poor obstetric history, or to establish gestational age, limited to pregnancy of unknown location on initial ultrasound, and aimed to predict outcomes using demographic and hormonal data. Final diagnosis categories were intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), ectopic pregnancy, failing pregnancy of unknown location based on low progesterone or decrease of β-hCG level to < 5 mIU/mL, or persistent pregnancy of unknown location. The derivation phase included 189 patients and the validation phase 199; mean β-hCG levels in the derivation set (mIU/mL) were IUP 781 (SD 1,323), failing IUP 595 (SD 894), and ectopic pregnancy 1,510 (SD 2,374), and in the test set (mIU/mL) were IUP (38%) 640 (SD 643), failing IUP (55%) 287 (SD 457), and ectopic pregnancy (6%) 567 (SD 446). Limitations note this was not an ED population, included both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients referred to an early pregnancy unit, and the model did not incorporate simple initial β-hCG level because of poor predictive performance in the past.

### Evaluation of the quality of guidelines for the management of reduced fetal movements in UK maternity units [^287d078d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Two hundred and thirty five maternity units across the UK were asked by letter for either an electronic or paper copy of their guideline for the management of RFM in May-July 2013. Ethical approval was not required as this work was a service evaluation. In addition, two national evidence-based guidelines were identified by internet searches (Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, UK; Australia and New Zealand Stillbirth Alliance (ANZSA)). Unit guidelines were compared against the national evidence-based guidelines. Basic information regarding the guidelines including the authors, review date, version control was recorded as well as the recommendations of the guideline. The recommendations contained within the unit guidelines were compared against twelve recommendations in the RCOG guideline based upon the strongest grade of evidence.

The individual maternity unit and two national guidelines were reviewed and scored by two independent observers (SJ and AH) using the AGREE II tool which has been used previously in maternity care. The AGREE II tool has 23 items in 6 domains of Scope and Purpose (3 items), Stakeholder involvement (3 items), Rigour of Development (8 items), Clarity of Presentation (3 items), Applicability (4 items) and Editorial Independence (2 items). The scope and purpose domain assesses whether the aims and target audience are explicitly stated. Stakeholder involvement domain evaluates the involvement of professional users and patients in guideline development. The use of systematic literature searches to identify evidence and the link between evidence and guidance is assessed in the "rigour of development" domain. In addition, this domain assesses whether the guideline has been peer-reviewed and whether a strategy is in place for updating the guideline. Clarity of guidance is assessed in the fourth domain, with an ideal standard of easily identifiable, specific and unambiguous recommendations. The applicability domain assesses whether barriers to implementation and resource implications have been identified, and a strategy to implement guidance into practice has been stated. Finally, editorial independence requires a statement regarding potential conflicts of interests of authors or commissioners. Each item is rated on a seven point Likert scale with 1 being the worst quality and 7 being the best. There is also a global rating score from 1–7. Prior to assessing the guidelines both investigators used AGREE II online training tools to familiarise themselves with the instrument.

Data, including overall scores and domain scores for the guidelines were collated and analysed using Microsoft Excel. The agreement between both appraisers' (AH and SJ) assessments was compared on 20% of the samples using Cohen's Kappa coefficient. The relationship between the overall score and the total of the domain scores were calculated by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the domain and overall scores; unit guidelines and national guidelines were compared using Mann–Whitney U-test (two-sided comparison; Graphpad version 5, La Jolla, CA). A p value of < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.

### Reduction of late stillbirth with the introduction of fetal movement information and guidelines-a clinical quality improvement [^d8d6cf43]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2009). Low credibility.

The lowered overall stillbirth rates seen in the observational cohorts and during the cluster-randomized trial might, however, be attributable equally to increased awareness and vigilance, as to the actual FMC methods and alarm limits. Indeed, the cluster-randomized trial used extreme limits (ten movements in 10 hours for two days or no movements for one full day) and based their "count to ten" method on the mother's perception through the day, and not on focused counting while lying down. Thus, the women needed 162 minutes to count ten movements versus the average of 20 minutes reported in focused counting. Despite the extreme nature of such limits, they are still widely used. There is no evidence that formal FMC with their fixed alarm limits are superior to maternal common sense, no evidence to support the introduction of such counting in any total population, and no rationale to perform trials using the existing alarm limits of FMC. Better tools to identify the pregnancy at risk by assessing FM patterns are needed, and they will have to be individually adjusted to identify change, not fixed levels, to reflect what pregnant women are actually reporting. However, the routine of daily FMC in the third trimester could provide additional vigilance in the individual pregnancy, and help the expectant mother to identify significant changes. Our information highlighted the importance of the woman's subjective perception of a significant and sustained reduction in FM as the primary indicator of DFM, and a cause to seek professional help. We suggested daily FMC only as a tool to aid monitor FM, and guided the woman with "ten FM within 2 hours" as a secondary rule of thumb in situations where she felt in doubt.

Table 3
Scores generated using the AGREE II Tool for unit guidelines for the management of reduced fetal movements

The range of scores is shown in parentheses. Maximum score for each domain is shown in square brackets.

When assessing individual units scores differed greatly, but some patterns were apparent. In the first domain, 'scope and purpose', the majority of scores were above average quality (≥ 4). Unit guidelines usually specifically stated the objective of the guideline, but lost points due to a lack of description of to whom the guideline is meant to apply. Guidelines that scored poorly in this domain had either omitted the section or there was insufficient detail. Overall, the 'stakeholder involvement' domain was of average quality, but there was a wide range of scores (Table 3). High scoring units named at least one obstetrician and one midwife involved in guideline development. However, the majority of guidelines (57%) did not seek the views of service-users.

The 'rigour of development' of unit guidelines was poor, with most units having a low score. None of the unit guidelines explicitly stated a strategy to obtain evidence and few referenced relevant research. Critically, 41% of guideline did not reference national evidence-based guidelines in lieu of a novel literature search. Although a review date was usually included, points were frequently lost because there was rarely a procedure for updating the guideline. In contrast, national guidelines stated an explicit strategy for generating evidence and had a comprehensive reference list.

'Clarity of Presentation' was the highest scoring domain and was the biggest collective strength of all the guidelines with no difference between national and unit guidelines; almost all units highlighted the key recommendations for practitioners. In contrast, 'applicability' was one of the lowest scoring domains, with both national and unit guidelines neither identifying barriers or facilitators to their implementation nor resource implications. Nevertheless, some high-scoring guidelines provided supporting materials to aid dissemination such as patient information leaflets. All unit guidelines scoring the lowest possible score of 2 for 'editorial independence', most likely because in the UK healthcare is publicly funded implying that there are no directly competing interests.

### My baby's movements: a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial to raise maternal awareness of fetal movements during pregnancy study protocol [^8bff607b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

DFM and the evidence for raising awareness

No universally agreed definition of DFM currently exists and none are sufficiently robust as a screening tool for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Maternal perception of DFM is more effective in detecting at-risk pregnancies than any threshold based on maternal count of fetal movements. Many stillbirths are preceded by perceived DFM for a number of days and mothers who delay reporting DFM increases the risk of stillbirth.

A systematic revew of interventions to raise awareness and improve outcomes for women with DFM showed no clear beneift. Fetal movement counting (where women record the number of movements using a kick chart) has been proposed as an intervention to reduce stillbirth rates through increasing maternal awareness of DFM. However, the Cochrane systematic review on fetal movement (FM) counting showed no reduction in stillbirths. In the largest trial of kick counting, while no reduction was shown in stillbirth rates, the overall late gestation stillbirth rate fell during the study period from 4 per 1000 to 2.8 per 1000 births. It was postulated that this reduction was due to an increased awareness and vigilance of DFM. In a non-randomised quality improvement study across 14 hospitals in Norway a similar reduction was shown for a package of care to raise awareness of DFM (with optional kick counting) and a standardised protocol for clinical management. Importantly, in the Norwegian study women with DFM presented for care earlier during the intervention period. A more recent indiviual participant randomised controlled trial showed that kick counting increased antenatal detection of FGR. While the trial was not designed to detect a difference in stillbirth rates, no difference was shown in the proportion of women presenting with DFM, induction rates, maternal concern about the baby or maternal fetal attachment. Recruitment into this trial was low (< 20% of all eligible women), suggesting that kick counting may not be widely acceptable to women. The recent AFFIRM trial in the UK showed that a package of care to improve awareness and management of women with DFM resulted in an increase in induction of labour, caesarean section and neonatal admission to special care nursery. A non-statistically significant reduction in stillbirth rates of 10% was shown. The trial investigators concluded that changes in practice around DFM should await the results of ongoing trials.

### Fetal movement assessment [^20a073d2]. Seminars in Perinatology (2008). Low credibility.

Maternal perception of fetal movements is the oldest and most commonly used method to assess fetal well-being. While almost all pregnant women adhere to it, organized screening by fetal movements has seen variable popularity among health professionals. Early results of screening were promising and fetal movement counting is the only antepartum testing method that has shown effect in reducing mortality in a randomized controlled trial comparing testing versus no testing. Although awareness of fetal movements is associated with improved perinatal outcomes, the quest to define a quantitative "alarm limit" to define decreased fetal movements has so far been unsuccessful, and the use of most such limits developed for fetal movement counting should be discouraged.

Additional data items are as follows:

a) Audit of presentations for DFM: will be undertaken for two four-week periods prior to the commencement of the control period and at 6 months after the start of the intervention period using a purpose-built data collection form. Data collected will include the duration of maternal concern of DFM at the time of presentation, investigations undertaken and outcome of clinical assessment.

b) Surveys of women: will be undertaken over a four-week period immediately before commencement of the site education and again at 6 months after the start of the intervention period. Women will be asked during a routine antenatal visit at 35 weeks' or more gestation or up to one-week post-partum to complete a survey to elicit psychosocial outcomes, knowledge and acceptability of the DFM information. A follow-up survey will be undertaken at 6 months postpartum by mail-out or by email (depending on the woman's preference), to determine psychosocial outcomes, quality of life, and health services utilisation since discharge.

c) Acceptability of the MBM Tool: and factors that might inhibit utilisation will be assessed using qualitative methods. Four focus groups of 6–10 women, homogeneous for characteristics potentially associated with poorer uptake (young age; low socioeconomic status; Indigenous background) will be conducted towards the end of the intervention period. In addition, two focus groups of midwives and doctors will be undertaken towards the end of the intervention period. An experienced facilitator will use a semi-structured guide to elicit views and fresh insights into the intervention. Focus groups will be recorded and transcribed. Due to the impracticability of focus groups with multiple ethnic minority and other special needs groups, consultation and key informant interviews (e.g. with those who provide services for these specific population groups) will be conducted at participating hospital sites to gain insights into unique needs of specific populations served.

d) Economic evaluation: In addition to the routinely collected perinatal data and the health service use questionnaire to be completed at the 6 months follow-up time point, all Australian women completing the surveys as well as all women experiencing a stillbirth will be asked for consent to obtain their Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) claims data from the federal government via the Department of Human Services.

8.1 Monitoring

The primary goal of fetal monitoring is prevention of stillbirth by detection of fetal deterioration that precedes irreversible compromise. To achieve this goal, monitoring tests need to be accurate in identifying fetal risks that favor delivery and, for pregnancies where delivery thresholds are not met, follow‐up monitoring needs to be frequent enough to provide a safety net against unanticipated deterioration or stillbirth. Fetal surveillance tests include maternal monitoring of fetal movements, cardiotocography, ultrasound evaluation of amniotic fluid volume and fetal activity, and Doppler ultrasound of the fetal arterial and venous circulations. With progressive compromise, abnormal fetal activity and fetal heart rate patterns are observed, independent of gestational age at diagnosis of FGR. 288, 292, 302, 303, 304 In contrast, cardiovascular manifestations of fetal compromise are driven by placental blood flow resistance in the umbilical artery, and therefore differ significantly between early‐ and late‐onset FGR. 286, 289, 290, 291, 298, 299 The surveillance tests that have been evaluated in the management of FGR pregnancies are described below.

8.1.1 Fetal movement counting

Fetal activity is established from the first trimester onward and as gestational age advances becomes organized into coordinated behavioral states. Progressive fetal hypoxemia is accompanied by a reduction of fetal activity that can be perceived most accurately by the mother when she is lying down and paying focused attention to fetal movements. 305 Decreased fetal movement is often defined as less than 10 movements in 2 hours during focused maternal counting. 306 Although reports on whether quality improvement tools to promote awareness and management of reduced fetal movements can effectively decrease the risk of stillbirth have been conflicting, most of these interventions were focused on unselected populations rather than in pregnancies with suspected FGR. 307, 308, 309 Given that fetal movement counting is a simple and inexpensive tool that may provide a safety net between scheduled outpatient monitoring visits, it seems reasonable to use movement counting as an adjunct to monitoring in FGR. The mother should be provided with clear behavioral instructions and confirmatory monitoring should be performed for patients presenting with decreased fetal movements. 305, 308

Ectopic pregnancy ultrasound in early ED evaluation — Counselman et al. multicenter retrospective chart review included patients with a final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy who had an ultrasound and β-hCG testing at initial ED presentation and did not exclude unstable patients if stable enough for ultrasound, and assessed whether patients with an initial β-hCG level < 1,000 mIU/mL had evidence of ectopic pregnancy on comprehensive ultrasound during their initial visit; ultrasound was considered diagnostic if an extrauterine fetal pole with cardiac activity was identified and suggestive if there was an empty uterus plus a complex adnexal mass and/or a moderate to large amount of pelvic fluid. Results reported that 64 patients with ectopic pregnancy were included, of whom 18 had a β-hCG level < 1,000 mIU/mL; of these 18 patients, 16 had findings suggestive of ectopic pregnancy, including 4 with vital sign abnormalities, and 12 of 14 stable patients with β-hCG level < 1,000 mIU/mL had evidence of ectopic pregnancy on ultrasound. Limitations noted were that presenting symptoms were not abstracted and there was likely selection bias for higher-risk patients because there was no protocol to guide who was getting ultrasound on the initial visit.

Emergency department early pregnancy — Dart et al. conducted a prospective, observational study including pregnant patients with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding who presented to an ED and had an indeterminate ultrasound result, aiming to determine whether indeterminate comprehensive ultrasound results could be subclassified to risk‑stratify patients and to examine the predictive value of β-hCG level for ectopic pregnancy; ultrasound was diagnostic of IUP if a gestational sac with yolk sac or fetal pole was seen, considered diagnostic or suggestive of ectopic pregnancy if an extrauterine sac, a complex mass discrete from the ovary, or a large amount of fluid in the cul-de-sac was present, and all other results were indeterminate with subclassifications; 780 were identified but 145 were lost to follow-up, with 635 patients included, and the overall incidence of ectopic pregnancy was 7% (46 of 635), with ectopic pregnancy rate 15% (95% CI 11% to 20%) when β-hCG level < 1,000 mIU/mL and 2% (95% CI 1% to 4%) when β-hCG level > 1,000 mIU/mL; limitation: Large number lost to follow-up.

Subsequent prenatal visits — actions at every visit: Obstetric visit frequency should be individualized, with an uncomplicated first pregnancy typically examined every 4 weeks until 28 weeks' gestation, every 2 weeks from 28–36 weeks' gestation, and then every week until delivery. People with medical or obstetric complications might require closer surveillance, and parous people without medical or obstetric complications who have had prior normal pregnancy outcomes may be seen less frequently as long as additional appointments are available as needed. During each regularly scheduled visit, the obstetric provider should evaluate blood pressure, patient weight, uterine size for progressive growth and consistency with gestational age, and presence of fetal heart activity at appropriate gestational ages, and after quickening should ask about fetal movement at each prenatal visit thereafter.

Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare syndrome characterized by sudden cardiorespiratory collapse during labor or soon after delivery. Because of its rarity, many obstetrical providers have no experience in managing amniotic fluid embolism and may therefore benefit from a cognitive aid such as a checklist. We present a sample checklist for the initial management of amniotic fluid embolism based on standard management guidelines. We also suggest steps that each facility can take to implement the checklist effectively.

Figure 2
Instructions to women on how to record fetal movement counts in the charts. This figure is included as part of the fetal movement chart.

DFM-related examinations included cardiotocography and biophysical profiling in the majority of cases and Doppler ultrasound when indicated. Clinical management followed the hospital's routine clinical care protocol. Maternal and fetal complications were classified according to Norwegian guidelines for antenatal care, which are largely consistent with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) Green Top Guidelines.

Our main outcome measures were (i) the identification of fetal complications at DFM-related consultations (yes/no) and (ii) the presence of fetal compromise at the time of DFM-related consultation (yes/no). The former measure reflected only the outcome of the examination, whereas the latter included information from medical files, birth outcome data, and placental pathology findings. Whether adverse birth outcome or placental pathology in retrospect was assumed relevant to the DFM consultation was based on the underlying pathology and the time between the DFM consultation and delivery, and was assessed independent of the FM information. It was, however, restricted to DFM consultations occurring within 21 days before birth.

Small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as birth weight < 10 percentile and FGR as birth weight < 2.5 percentile, adjusted for gestational age and sex. Fetal complications identified at the DFM consultation included fetal death, fetal distress (non-reassuring cardiotocographic finding or pathological blood flow in umbilical artery), poly- or oligohydramnios (as reported in clinical files), fetal weight estimate < −10% by ultrasound measurement or fetal malformations. The composite outcome measure of fetal compromise at time of DFM consultation included: (i) fetal complications as listed above, (ii) intrapartum interventions due to non-reassuring fetal state (asphyxia or protracted delivery with pathological cardiotocographic finding) or emergency cesarean section, (iii) neonatal complications including death, SGA, FGR, Apgar < 7 5min, or other relevant complications, or (iv) placental pathology.

### Temporal patterns in count-to-ten fetal movement charts and their associations with pregnancy characteristics: a prospective cohort study [^a9a8b708]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

There seemed to be reporting fatigue in the FM charts, with compliance rates falling towards term. Previous FM counting studies have consistently reported that continued encouragement from health care providers yields the most complete findings. Before we can expect higher acceptance rates, FM counting must prove useful to both women and care providers. Hence, better information about normal FM and how to interpret FM counting patterns is needed. Although not applicable on an individual level, we have with this comprehensive statistical approach taken an important first step in identifying temporal patterns in FM charts.

Our results carry important clinical messages. A perceived change in FM should not be attributed to a woman's maternal characteristics or placental location, but rather be interpreted as a true change in FM, potentially indicating fetal compromise. This should be clarified in published guidelines. Further, maternal characteristics or anterior placental site do not seem to be incompatible with FM counting. Finally, the wide-spread notion that fetal activity decreases in late pregnancy is refuted. With this counting method, a decrease in FM in late pregnancy is not normal. This is a core component of information that should be provided to pregnant women.

Gallbladder disease

Biliary tract disease is the second most common non-obstetric surgical problem. Weight gain and hormonal changes predispose pregnant women to biliary sludge and gallstone formation. Weakened contractions and decreased emptying lead to increased gallbladder volume during fasting and postprandially. Biliary stasis contributes to cholesterol crystal sequestration, theoretically leading to formation of sludge and stones. Estrogen increases bile lithogenicity, whereas progesterone impairs gallbladder emptying. Lower gallbladder ejection fractions and increasing parity appear to increase the risk of sludge formation. The reported incidence of biliary sludge formation is as high as 31%, while gallstone formation ranges from 3% to 12%. A total of 1 in 1000 pregnancies will develop symptoms related to biliary colic. About one-third of patients with biliary colic will experience no additional bouts during the following 2 years. Unfortunately, approximately 80% of pregnant women presenting with symptoms will have recurrence of symptoms with 20%–40% recurring prior to delivery. This recurrence is often more severe than the initial presentation. Surgical intervention is indicated for obstructive jaundice, acute cholecystitis and gallstone pancreatitis. Where once the non-operative management with delayed cholecystectomy of symptomatic cholelithiasis was encouraged, there are data now suggesting that pregnant patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis should undergo cholecystectomy early due to the increase in the rate of recurrent hospitalizations, preterm deliveries, spontaneous abortions and fetal morbidity associated with non-operative management. In addition, non-operative management of symptomatic cholelithiasis increases the risk of gallstone pancreatitis up to 15%. Whereas once it was thought that the second trimester was the optimal time for cholecystectomy due to decreased spontaneous abortions and preterm labor, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests laparoscopy can be performed in all trimesters with equal safety.

### Obstetric triage improvement process using the donabedian model of quality care: a quality improvement initiative [^b97a1c05]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

PDSA cycle 6

After five PDSA cycles, a new triage flow process was developed with defined timelines. The process steps were planned in the following sequence. On arrival, the patient reporting at triage, will be greeted by the nurse. The assessment of patients in the triage will take place in two stages. Within 5 min of arrival, assigned nurse will approach the patient in the L&D triage area for initial brief assessment. The area nurse will inquire for a brief history, infectious screening, fetal movements, and uterine contractions. The initial evaluation will include vital signs and fetal heart sounds assessment. The case will be prioritised in accordance with the acuity tool. These findings will be documented on the triage assessment form. This form shall be a comprehensive document consisting of obstetric acuity and infectious screening tool and hands off component. Triage area assigned nurse will hand over the patient to the assigned nurse of triage assessment room and the patient will be shifted there for further nursing and obstetric assessment by physicians. Triage room nurse will check the order set for completion of care process.

For unwell women fulfilling level 1 criteria of the obstetric acuity tool, labour room consultant will be immediately involved. After quick assessment in the triage area, patient will be directly transferred to labour room or operation theatre for further management including delivery. Pregnant patients presenting with other acuity categories will be managed according to the defined care process. To improve turnover, reassessment and disposition process will be performed according to the defined flow process in the new triage guideline.

L&D team leader will be contacted for help in case of unavailability of bed and for the women waiting longer than 15 min in triage. It will be the responsibility of the unit receptionist to keep a record of arrival and triage times for each woman, and in case of target time breach, he/she will activate the escalation by paging team leader. Nursing lead will also have the responsibility to investigate and respond to any patient feedback regarding triage flow and care process. They will be supported by the on-floor labour room consultant and physicians in the smooth triage process.

### My baby's movements: a stepped wedge cluster randomised controlled trial to raise maternal awareness of fetal movements during pregnancy study protocol [^e9c45603]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Stillbirth has profound and long-lasting adverse psychosocial and economic impacts on women and families, and also on health systems and society. In 2015, an estimated 2.6 million stillbirths occurred globally with rates showing little or no decline. While the majority of stillbirths occur in low and middle income countries, high-income countries (HIC) still have substantial numbers of preventable stillbirths, particularly beyond 28 weeks' gestation, where survival for those born alive approaches 100%.

In HIC settings, stillbirth is now over twenty times more common than Sudden Unexpected Deaths in Infancy where focussed prevention strategies, including awareness campaigns, have reduced these deaths by over 80%. The scale of the hidden tragedy of stillbirth was the impetus for The Lancet to publish the 2011 and 2016 stillbirths series with a global call to action to reduce preventable stillbirths focussing on births of 28 weeks' or more gestation (late gestation). The Lancet's 2016 series showed wide variation in late gestation stillbirth rates across 49 HIC ranging from 1.7/1000 to 8.8/1000 births, highlighting the potential to further reduce stillbirth rates in such settings. In this series, New Zealand and Australia ranked 10th and 15th with rates of 2.3 and 2.7/1000 births respectively, indicating the potential for focussed attention to reduce preventable stillbirth.

In Australia and New Zealand, using the standard definition of stillbirth of 20 weeks or 400 g birthweight, the most recent annual data shows 2107 (6.7/1000) in Australia, and 457 (7.5/1000) in New Zealand; equating to seven deaths every day. Women who are socially disdavantaged have around twice the risk of stillbirth. Ethnicity is also associated with stillbirth; Indigenous Australian women, Pacific Islanders in New Zealand and South Asian born women have around twice the risk.

### Antepartum fetal surveillance: ACOG practice bulletin, number 229 [^88eab874]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Abnormal antepartum fetal test management — An abnormal antepartum fetal test result should always be considered in the context of the overall clinical picture, and maternal reports of decreased fetal movement should be evaluated by an NST, CST, BPP, or modified BPP; abnormal results from an NST or from a modified BPP generally should be followed by additional testing with either a CST or a BPP, and in the absence of obstetric contraindications, delivery of the fetus with an abnormal test result often may be attempted by induction of labor, with continuous intrapartum monitoring of the FHR and uterine contractions. A BPP score of 6 out of 10 is considered equivocal and should prompt further evaluation or delivery based on gestational age; in a fetus at or beyond 37 0/7 weeks of gestation this score generally should prompt further evaluation and consideration of delivery, whereas in the fetus at less than 37 0/7 weeks of gestation it should result in a repeat BPP in 24 hours; a BPP score of 4 usually indicates that delivery is warranted although in pregnancies at less than 32 0/7 weeks of gestation management should be individualized, and in most circumstances a BPP score of 2 or less should result in delivery; if delivery is not planned, then antenatal surveillance should not be performed because the results will not inform management.

### Strip of the month: decreased fetal movement… [^3c36d045]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Electronic fetal monitoring is a popular technology used to establish fetal well-being. Despite its widespread use, the terminology used to describe patterns seen on the monitor has not been consistent until recently. In 1997, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Research Planning Workshop published guidelines for interpretation of fetal tracings. This publication was the culmination of 2 years of work by a panel of experts in the field of fetal monitoring and was endorsed in 2005 by both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses. In 2008, ACOG, NICHD, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine reviewed and updated the definitions for fetal heart rate patterns, interpretation, and research recommendations. Following is a summary of the terminology definitions and assumptions found in the 2008 NICHD workshop report.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^9ffa45f8]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Emergency department (ED) early pregnancy — deferred outpatient ultrasound in clinically stable ectopic pregnancy was evaluated in a retrospective review to determine whether stable patients with final diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy experienced an adverse event between presentation to the ED and outpatient ultrasound at 12 to 24 h. The review included patients with surgically diagnosed ectopic pregnancy who had presented to the ED in stable condition with complaint of abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding in the first trimester, and excluded unstable patients defined as having major risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, vital sign abnormalities, peritoneal signs, or adnexal mass on examination. An adverse event was defined as death or hemodynamic instability requiring a fluid bolus. Of 117 total patients with ectopic pregnancy, 37 were stable and had deferred ultrasound; the median delay from presentation to ultrasound was 14 h, and the range was 0 to 126 h; 62% waited 12 h or longer, but only 2 waited longer than 24 h; no adverse events were identified in the clinically stable group during the interval between presentation and ultrasound (95% CI 0% to 14%). Limitations noted included a small number of stable patients that makes safety difficult to establish, assumed complete follow-up based on absence of other hospitals within a 100-km radius, and retrospective chart review.

### Fetal movement in late pregnancy-a content analysis of women's experiences of how their unborn baby moved less or differently [^cb1d1b08]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Women in this study had a normal CTG before they completed the questionnaire. However, aside from no stillbirths among the participating women, we have no data regarding the health status of the baby after birth. This is a major limitation of the study. There is also only sparse information about the women's' sociodemographic background.

One strength of the study is the large number of participants. Another strength is that all delivery wards in Stockholm participated in the study. However, all women came from the capital city in Sweden where women in generally are older and well educated compared with women outside the capital. Further, the number of those who declined to participate and their reasons for doing so are not known.

The wording of the request, "Try to describe how your baby has moved less or had changes in movement" might have influenced the responders to use the words "decreased" and "differently" in their descriptions of their experiences. The results may have yielded even more if the initial request had been broader or more open, for example, "Try to describe how your baby has moved". However, the context in which the women completed the questionnaire was one of already perceived decreased fetal movements.

Clinical implications

Increased knowledge about the normal changes in the fetal movement patterns in late pregnancy can be one way to lessen the number of visits to obstetric clinics from women over concerns that turn out to be unnecessary from a medical perspective. The challenge from a clinical perspective is to inform and advise pregnant women about fetal movements with the goal of diminishing the length of pre-hospital delay if the fetus is at risk and at the same time reduce worry leading to unnecessary consultation. Reducing the pre-hospital delay when the intrauterine environment is a threat to the unborn baby's life will provide a window of opportunity to save a greater number of children from death or compromised health. Further, fewer visits to obstetric clinics, over concern that turns out to be unnecessary from a medical perspective, will have health economic benefits. Before giving definitive advice that can reduce unnecessary controls at the end of the pregnancy, distinct differences must be identified regarding how women who lost their child intrauterine or have given birth to a hypoxic or anaemic child, report the changes in character of movements as only symptoms when they seek care for decreased fetal movements. Future studies are needed.

### Committee opinion no. 667: hospital-based triage of obstetric patients [^2055b83a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-based triage of obstetric patients — Typical triage involves an initial assessment and decision about the priority level for evaluation that may be conducted by a registered nurse, certified nurse–midwife or certified midwife, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or physician as designated by hospital policy. The health care provider performing triage should assign the patient's acuity during the first encounter, and triage is followed by the complete evaluation of the woman and the fetus by a health care provider with skills and training appropriate to evaluate the issues identified during triage. Having an available health care provider appears to best optimize patient flow and reduce length of stay, and the use of certified nurse–midwives or certified midwives who provide obstetric emergency care services may improve efficiency, reduce length of stay, and improve screening and evaluation. For a given center, the obstetrics department should establish written guidelines defining the appropriate unit to evaluate obstetric patients and coordination and communication between obstetric and emergency departments, as well as hospital ancillary services, is critical. Emergency departments should consider early consultation with obstetric care providers when triaging and managing pregnant patients, especially for patients beyond the first and early second trimesters. To be considered an appropriate location to evaluate and care for pregnant patients, a unit should have the ability to perform basic ultrasonography and fetal monitoring, and it may be necessary to bring these resources from the obstetric unit to the location of the patient. Triage algorithms for obstetric acuity to assess and assign priority to obstetric patients may be useful.

Semi-qualitative assessment using the AGREE II tool

Scores obtained by the two independent investigators using the AGREE II tool showed good agreement for the overall score (Κ = 0.7) but more variable results for the individual domains ranging from fair (K = 0.25) to very good (K = 1.00). For both investigators, the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the total domain scores and overall score was 0.94 indicating a very strong relationship between the overall assessment and the sum of the individual components.

Both the RCOG and ANZSA guidelines received the maximum overall score of 7 and the majority of individual components scored > 5 (Table 2). The ANZSA guideline had a low score for editorial independence as it had no statement regarding the provenance of the guideline or competing interests of the authors. The distribution of overall scores of unit guidelines is shown in Figure 1 A; scores were not normally distributed, scores of 2 and 5 were most common. The range of individual domain scores for unit guidelines is shown in Table 3. Eight guidelines (9%) with a score of 1 would not be recommended for practice; in these guidelines all domain scores were consistently rated ≤ 3. In contrast, the 7 guidelines which received the maximum overall score had above average in all of the domains. High scoring guidelines had their highest scores in the 'scope and purpose' and 'rigour of development' domains. Overall, unit guidelines scored significantly lower in all domains and total score compared to national guidelines (Table 3 and Figure 1 B). The least difference was seen in the 'clarity of presentation' domain and the greatest difference in the 'editorial independence' domain.

### Evaluation of pregnancy outcomes among women with decreased fetal movements… [^431ff09b]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Although DFM, as managed by a clinical algorithm, was not associated with an increased risk of stillbirth, it was associated with identification of a fetus at risk of a number of adverse outcomes, including being small for gestational age and iatrogenic early term birth. Importance Stillbirth is a devastating pregnancy outcome with far-reaching economic and psychosocial consequences, but despite significant investment, a screening tool for identifying those fetuses at risk for stillbirth remains elusive. Maternal reporting of decreased fetal movements has been found to be associated with stillbirth and other adverse perinatal outcomes. During the study period, the stillbirth rate was 2. 0 per 1000 births after 28 weeks' gestation. Presenting with DFM was not associated with higher odds of stillbirth.

Conclusions and Relevance The presence of DFM is a marker associated with increased risk for a fetus. This study's findings of a nonsignificantly lower rate of stillbirth among women with DFM may be reflective of increased community awareness of timely presentation to their obstetric care clinician when concerned about fetal movements and the benefits of tertiary level care guided by a clear clinical management protocol. However, DFM was associated with increased odds of an infant being born SGA, obstetric intervention, early term birth, and a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes. It was associated with lower odds of spontaneous vaginal birth and higher odds of planned early term birth.

Therapeutics and Principles of Management

When a pregnant or postpartum woman presents in acute HF, initial goals should be to stabilize the patient, confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of HF, assess fetal status and viability, and contact members of an interdisciplinary cardio‐obstetrics care team. Any reversible factors that may have contributed to the patient's presentation, such as anemia, thyroid dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, preeclampsia/eclampsia, or infection, should be addressed. The last initial step is to assess fetal viability as well as stability. Steroids can be considered if there is concern for poor fetal lung maturity.

Treatment will vary depending on whether a woman is pregnant or postpartum, as once mothers have delivered there is no longer a concern about fetal stability/maturity or teratogenicity of medications and more standard HF therapies can be initiated (Figure 6). An extensive review of the medication use in pregnancy is beyond the scope of this article but has been reviewed recently. In patients with stable HF, medical treatment approach parallels that of nonpregnant patients; however, there is a need to avoid teratogenic drugs (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, atenolol, direct factor Xa inhibitors). Mainstays of treatment include hydralazine, nitrates, and β‐blockers. Diuretics should be used in those patients with signs or symptoms of pulmonary edema; however, caution must be exercised as they have the potential to reduce placental perfusion. In patients who have already delivered, treatment with standard HF therapy should be the highest priority, focusing on angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors, β‐blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, as they are known to provide a mortality and treatment benefit to HF patients. For patients with cardiogenic shock or severe HF, transfer to a tertiary center where mechanical support can be provided should be pursued immediately. Treatment in these patients must aim to optimize preload (consider diuretics) and oxygenation, use inotropes/vasopressors, consider adding PPCM‐specific therapies, and if the patient is pregnant plan for urgent cesarean section.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the initial evaluation and management of patients presenting to the emergency department in early pregnancy [^6e28114c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Early pregnancy with indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound — β-hCG-level measurements for ectopic pregnancy risk stratification: In a prospective observational cohort of stable, consecutive pregnant patients with suspected ectopic pregnancy, the objective was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of initial and repeat β-hCG-level measurements in patients with an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound. Transvaginal ultrasound was considered diagnostic of IUP when an "intrauterine gestational sac" was seen; ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed only in the presence of an extrauterine gestational sac with yolk sac or fetal pole; otherwise, the transvaginal ultrasound was considered indeterminate. Results included 354 patients with an indeterminate transvaginal ultrasound; 58 had an adnexal mass, 14 had free fluid, and 20 had both findings but were included as indeterminate; LR for ectopic pregnancy in patients without adnexal mass or free fluid, stratified by β-hCG level (mIU/mL), was: < 1,000 (n = 36): 0.62 (95% CI 0.5 to 0.8), 1,000–1,499 (n = 2): 0.31 (95% CI 0.1 to 1.3), 1,500–1,999 (n = 1): 0.63 (95% CI 0.1 to 5), and ≥ 2,000 (n = 24): 19 (95% CI 6.8 to 52).

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 59: the use of analgesia and anesthesia for maternal-fetal procedures [^f9c65721]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Consult Series #59 — recommendations for analgesia and anesthesia in maternal-fetal procedures are as follows: We suggest that fetal paralytic agents be considered in the setting of intrauterine transfusion, if needed, for the purpose of decreasing fetal movement (2C; Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Although the fetus is unable to experience pain at the gestational age when procedures are typically performed, we suggest that opioid analgesia should be administered to the fetus during invasive fetal surgical procedures to attenuate acute autonomic responses that may be deleterious, avoid long-term consequences of nociception and physiological stress on the fetus, and decrease fetal movement to enable the safe execution of procedures (2C; Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Due to maternal risk and lack of evidence supporting benefit to the fetus, we recommend against the administration of fetal analgesia at the time of pregnancy termination (1C; Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Maternal perception of decreased fetal movements from maternal and fetal perspectives, a cohort study [^51785dbf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study showed that 8.1% of healthy normotensive singleton pregnant women with desirable pregnancy outcomes reported perception of decreased fetal movements. Almost the same rates have been reported in other studies; in an American study of 38,728 pregnancies, 6.6% were examined in the hospitals for concerns of DFM, In Norway maternal concern for DFM is a frequent cause for unscheduled antenatal consultations, occurring in approximately 10% of third-trimester pregnancies. The overall rate of perception of DFM is reported at the range of 4% - 15% in most studies. In our study, some maternal and fetal factors were associated with this perception of DFM, but the three factors that remained independently associated with a perception DFM were maternal employment, the state of not having daily exercise and maternal supine position when counting the fetal movements.

### Fetal movement in late pregnancy-a content analysis of women's experiences of how their unborn baby moved less or differently [^5be153c3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pregnant women sometimes worry about their unborn baby's health, often due to decreased fetal movements. The aim of this study was to examine how women, who consulted health care due to decreased fetal movements, describe how the baby had moved less or differently.

Methods

Women were recruited from all seven delivery wards in Stockholm, Sweden, during 1/1–31/12 2014. The women completed a questionnaire after it was verified that the pregnancy was viable. A modified content analysis was used to analyse 876 questionnaires with the women's responses to, "Try to describe how your baby has moved less or had changes in movement".

Results

Four categories and six subcategories were identified: "Frequency" (decreased frequency, absence of kicks and movement), "Intensity" (weaker fetal movements, indistinct fetal movements), "Character" (changed pattern of movements, slower movements) and "Duration". In addition to the responses categorised in accordance with the question, the women also mentioned how they had tried to stimulate the fetus to move and that they had difficulty in distinguishing fetal movements from contractions. Further, they described worry due to incidents related to changed pattern of fetal movements.

Conclusion

Women reported changes in fetal movement concerning frequency, intensity, character and duration. The challenge from a clinical perspective is to inform pregnant women about fetal movements with the goal of minimizing unnecessary consultations whilst at the same time diminishing the length of pre-hospital delay if the fetus is at risk of fetal compromise.

### Dilemmas in managing pregnant women with Ebola: 2 case reports [^ffa7be0d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Case 2 Description

On 7 March 2015, a 22-year-old G3P0 woman approximately 5 months pregnant was admitted from a quarantine home to an MSF-managed ETC in Kissi, Freetown, Sierra Leone. Per Sierra Leone national Ebola response policy, the patient's household had been placed under quarantine for 21 days due to an in-house confirmed Ebola death. Her obstetric history consisted of 2 first trimester miscarriages.

On admission, the patient complained of anorexia, muscle pain, and joint pain. The patient tested negative on malaria RDT. She denied vaginal bleeding, uterine contractions, or loss of fluid and reported good fetal movement. The patient was initially afebrile but later had a temperature of 38.3°C during the first 24 hours of her hospital stay. Blood samples were taken on 8 March and 9 March, and RT–PCR for EBOV RNA (L gene, Realstar filovirus screen, RT–PCR kit 1.0) was positive (see). She had an uncomplicated recovery during her hospital stay and reported frequent fetal movements. Fetal heart rate was auscultated by Doppler and found to be within normal range.

Following a negative RT–PCR test on 14 March, the patient and her family were counseled extensively on the risk of a stillbirth and that her fetus, placenta, and amniotic fluid may remain positive for the EBOV. The patient opted for expectant management with routine care and initially agreed to remain in the ETC for surveillance. On 21 March 2015 the patient requested to leave the ETC and was discharged against medical advice to her home, which was still under quarantine.

Upon discharge, the woman and her family were advised to self-isolate and to call in the event of any abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, discharge, or leaking of amniotic fluid while at home. The patient was called twice daily by a trained healthcare worker and was asked to present weekly to the ETC for an examination by the clinical staff.

### Indications for outpatient antenatal fetal surveillance: ACOG committee opinion, number 828 [^226abaab]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Antenatal fetal surveillance — fetal risk factors and suggested outpatient timing/frequency — lists conditions increasing stillbirth risk with suggested start age and frequency, and the guidance should be construed only as suggestions, not mandates with individualization advised. For fetal growth restriction with UAD normal or with elevated impedance and normal AFI, begin At diagnosis with testing Once or twice weekly; with UAD: AEDV or concurrent conditions start At diagnosis with Twice weekly or consider inpatient management; with UAD: REDV start At diagnosis with Inpatient management. For multiple gestations, twins uncomplicated dichorionic start at 36 0/7 weeks with Weekly testing; twins uncomplicated monochorionic‑diamniotic at 32 0/7 weeks with Weekly; complicated monochorionic‑diamniotic, monoamniotic, and triplets/higher order multiples are Individualized for both timing and frequency. Decreased fetal movement testing is At diagnosis and Once, and fetal anomalies and aneuploidy are Individualized for initiation and frequency.
