## Question

Vaccinations for 18 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about vaccinations for an 18-year-old, including which vaccines are recommended, how to catch up if behind, and what special considerations apply at this age. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the authoritative source and scope, namely the ACIP child and adolescent schedule for ages 18 years and younger. Then, I should verify routine vaccines that are due or overdue at age 18. Next, I will examine catch-up immunizations for those with incomplete histories. After that, I need to check special situations like immunocompromise, pregnancy, and travel. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized plan and note any recent changes that could alter recommendations, making sure I cross-check with the most current ACIP materials and CDC notes.

> Let me first confirm the framework. At age 18, the individual is still covered by the ACIP child and adolescent immunization schedule for persons aged 18 years or younger, and I should use the 2025 schedule alongside its notes and addendum to anchor recommendations, while remembering that harmonized language exists with the adult schedule for vaccines that span ages, which helps with dosing and intervals [^3b2390cd] [^fa22c056] [^eecbae02].

> I will now examine routine vaccines that should be up to date by age 18. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for everyone aged 6 months and older, so an 18-year-old should receive the current season's influenza vaccine, ideally by the end of October, with vaccination continuing as long as influenza viruses circulate and unexpired vaccine is available; I should double-check that the 2024–2025 season shifted to trivalent formulations, which it did, and that adults generally receive one dose unless they are in the 6 months–8 years group getting vaccinated for the first time, which does not apply here [^d9bf172d] [^b3f80e08] [^a7de5e59].

> Next, I should review tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis. If the adolescent has not received a Tdap booster at age 11–12, it should be given now; if the primary series is incomplete, I need to ensure a 3-dose catch-up that includes at least one Tdap, with Td or Tdap for subsequent doses, and I must not restart the series regardless of elapsed time; wait, let me verify the preferred interval sequence, which is Tdap, then Td or Tdap after 4 weeks, then Td or Tdap after 6–12 months, and that remains correct in the updated ACIP pertussis guidance [^3e6971a2] [^815a2e79].

> Hold on, I should verify meningococcal conjugate status. Routine MenACWY is recommended at 11–12 years with a booster at 16 years; if either dose is missing, it should be given now, and if the first dose was given at age 13–15, a booster is still indicated at 16–18 years with at least 8 weeks between doses; I need to ensure I note that persons who receive their first MenACWY dose at age 16 years or older do not need a booster unless they become high risk, which is an important nuance for 18-year-olds catching up [^08d4fa99].

> Let me consider HPV next. Routine HPV vaccination is recommended at 11–12 years, but catch-up is advised through age 26; if the series was not completed, it should be finished now, and I should confirm dosing: if the first dose is at age 15 or older, a 3-dose schedule at 0, 1–2, and 6 months is indicated, whereas those who started before age 15 and had appropriate spacing may be adequately vaccinated with 2 doses; I should also counsel that effectiveness wanes with age and sexual exposure, reinforcing the value of completing the series now [^f330936d] [^b3a076c1].

> I need to check measles, mumps, and rubella. Two doses of MMR are recommended in childhood; if the 18-year-old lacks documentation of two doses or lacks serologic evidence of immunity, they should receive catch-up MMR, with dose 2 given at least 4 weeks after dose 1; I should confirm that this applies to those born in 1957 or later, which it does, and that college entrants without immunity are a priority group for 2 doses [^8dc403d0].

> For varicella, I should confirm that two doses are recommended if there is no reliable history of disease; if only one dose was given or there is no documented immunity, a second dose should be administered, again with a 4-week minimum interval if giving a second dose [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine poliovirus. Most U.S.-born 18-year-olds are presumed to have received a complete IPV series in childhood; however, if there is no documentation of a complete primary series, catch-up IPV should be given, and I should remember that the 2025 schedule highlights catch-up at age 18 with a green box, signaling that this is an appropriate window to complete missing doses before transitioning to adult care [^b3f80e08] [^263e43f4].

> Next, I should review hepatitis B. Universal infant vaccination has been standard for decades; if the 18-year-old lacks documentation of a complete 3-dose series, catch-up HepB is indicated, and I need to ensure I note that adults aged 19–59 are now universally recommended to receive HepB if not previously vaccinated, which reinforces completing the series now when feasible [^41bea29a].

> Let me think about COVID-19. I initially thought a single updated 2024–2025 dose is recommended for everyone 6 months and older, but wait, I should verify the current policy; the 2024–2025 ACIP guidance supports a single dose for most, with a second dose 6 months later for those 65 years or older or immunocompromised, so for a typical healthy 18-year-old, one updated dose is sufficient if not recently vaccinated, and I should also note that AAP policy for 2025–2026 is evolving toward a single-dose approach for children and adolescents in defined risk groups, with shared decision-making outside those groups, so I should align with the most current CDC/ACIP guidance at the time of the visit [^674addf6] [^07376c16].

> I should confirm pneumococcal vaccine indications at 18. Routine pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is not recommended for immunocompetent 18-year-olds without specific risk factors; however, those with certain chronic conditions, asplenia, HIV, or other high-risk states should receive PCV15 or PCV20 according to adult risk-based recommendations, so I need to screen for medical indications before recommending pneumococcal vaccines [^76979f1c].

> But wait, what about meningococcal serogroup B. For healthy adolescents and young adults aged 16–23, MenB vaccination is based on shared clinical decision-making, typically as a 2-dose series 6 months apart; I should discuss this with the patient, especially if they are living in congregate settings, attending college, or have other risk factors, and I need to ensure I reference the updated Bexsero schedule reflected in the 2025 materials [^7318e879] [^91abd310].

> Next, I should review special situations. If the patient is immunocompromised, I need to check for additional COVID-19 doses, consider high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines, and ensure MenACWY boosters and MenB are prioritized; if pregnant, I should confirm Tdap is given between 27–36 weeks to protect the infant, and defer live vaccines; if traveling internationally, I should evaluate accelerated or additional vaccines such as hepatitis A, typhoid, yellow fever, or Japanese encephalitis based on destination and risk, using CDC travel guidance; if entering college, I should verify that MMR, varicella, meningococcal ACWY, and sometimes hepatitis B requirements are met and provide documentation [^22435dcc] [^41d789b6] [^ca6760c5] [^654a2842] [^8dc403d0].

> I will now synthesize a practical, prioritized plan. First, administer the current season's influenza vaccine if not already given. Second, give Tdap if the adolescent dose was never received or if the last tetanus-containing vaccine was more than 10 years ago, and complete any missing tetanus/diphtheria catch-up. Third, ensure MenACWY is up to date with a booster if the first dose was before age 16. Fourth, complete the HPV series if not done. Fifth, give MMR and varicella catch-up if immunity is not documented. Sixth, complete IPV if the primary series is incomplete. Seventh, complete hepatitis B if not previously vaccinated. Eighth, give one updated COVID-19 dose if not current. Ninth, discuss MenB and offer it based on shared decision-making. Throughout, I should screen for chronic conditions, pregnancy, immunocompromise, and travel to tailor additional vaccines and timing [^3b2390cd] [^d9bf172d] [^3e6971a2] [^08d4fa99] [^f330936d] [^8dc403d0] [^b3f80e08] [^674addf6] [^7318e879].

> Finally, I should double-check recent changes that could alter counseling. The 2025 child and adolescent schedule includes updates to COVID-19, Hib, influenza, and MenB, and it explicitly shows catch-up IPV at age 18, which supports completing polio now if behind; I also need to ensure I am using the addendum for any interim updates that occur between annual publications, and I should document all vaccines given and provide a record for school, college, or occupational needs [^c50acb87] [^b3f80e08] [^3b2390cd].

---

For an 18-year-old, the key vaccines are **annual influenza** [^d9bf172d], **Tdap if not given at 11–12 years** [^3e6971a2], **HPV catch-up through age 26** [^b3a076c1], **meningococcal ACWY booster at 16 years** [^08d4fa99] or catch-up if missed, and **meningococcal B** based on shared clinical decision-making [^91abd310]. Also give **COVID-19 updated dose** [^674addf6] and **MMR/varicella** if not previously vaccinated or immune [^8dc403d0]. Use the CDC catch-up schedule for any missing childhood vaccines [^b3f80e08], and tailor to medical conditions, occupation, or travel [^654a2842].

---

## Routine vaccinations

### Influenza vaccine

- **Recommendation**: Annual influenza vaccination for all individuals aged ≥ 6 months [^d9bf172d] [^ac6210b8].
- **Rationale**: Reduces influenza-related morbidity and mortality; cost-effective in adults [^2c6b9279].

---

### Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap)

- **Recommendation**: Single Tdap dose if not previously administered at 11–12 years [^3e6971a2]; then Td or Tdap every 10 years.
- **Rationale**: Maintains protection against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis; pertussis immunity wanes, necessitating boosters [^58b3611d].

---

### Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine

- **Recommendation**: Catch-up vaccination through age 26 years if not previously vaccinated [^b3a076c1]; 2-dose series if initiated before age 15, 3-dose series if initiated at age 15 or older [^f330936d].
- **Rationale**: Prevents HPV-related cancers; early vaccination is more effective [^028b9cff].

---

### Meningococcal vaccines

- **MenACWY**: Routine dose at 11–12 years with a booster at 16 years [^08d4fa99]; catch-up if missed.
- **MenB**: Recommended for ages 16–23 years based on shared clinical decision-making [^91abd310] [^7318e879].
- **Rationale**: Protects against invasive meningococcal disease, which peaks in adolescence and early adulthood.

---

### COVID-19 vaccine

- **Recommendation**: Updated 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine dose for all individuals aged ≥ 6 months [^674addf6] [^7f3209f4].
- **Rationale**: Reduces severe disease, hospitalization, and death; updated vaccines address circulating variants [^e7168f10].

---

## Catch-up vaccinations

If childhood immunizations are incomplete, follow the **CDC catch-up schedule** [^b3f80e08]:

| **Vaccine** | **Catch-up recommendations** |
|-|-|
| MMR | 2 doses if not previously vaccinated or immune [^8dc403d0] |
| Varicella | 2 doses if no documented immunity or disease history [^notfound] |
| Hepatitis B | 3-dose series if not previously vaccinated [^notfound] |
| Polio (IPV) | Complete primary series if not previously vaccinated [^b3f80e08] |
| Hepatitis A | 2 doses if not previously vaccinated [^notfound] |

---

## Special considerations

### Medical conditions

Certain chronic conditions (e.g. asplenia, HIV, complement deficiencies) warrant **additional vaccinations** or modified schedules [^ca6760c5]. Immunocompromised individuals may require **specialized vaccination strategies** and additional COVID-19 doses [^22435dcc].

---

### Occupational and travel-related vaccinations

Healthcare workers, military personnel, or those with occupational exposures may need **additional vaccines** (e.g. hepatitis B, smallpox) [^notfound]. Travel to endemic regions may require **travel-specific vaccines** (e.g. yellow fever, typhoid, Japanese encephalitis) [^654a2842].

---

## Documentation and record-keeping

Maintain **accurate vaccination records** to guide future care and avoid unnecessary revaccination [^43cc5741]. Immunization information systems (IIS) help track vaccinations across providers and states [^5351393c].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Annual influenza vaccine**: Yes [^d9bf172d]
- **Tdap**: Once if not previously given; then Td/Tdap every 10 years [^3e6971a2]
- **HPV vaccine**: Catch-up through age 26 if not previously vaccinated [^b3a076c1]
- **Meningococcal ACWY**: Booster at 16 years if not given; catch-up if missed [^08d4fa99]
- **Meningococcal B**: Ages 16–23 years based on shared clinical decision-making [^91abd310]
- **COVID-19 vaccine**: Updated 2024–2025 dose [^674addf6]
- **MMR and varicella**: Catch-up if not previously vaccinated or immune [^8dc403d0]

---

Vaccination at age 18 focuses on **catch-up**, boosters, and vaccines for older adolescents and young adults. Follow the CDC schedule, consider individual risk factors, and keep accurate records to ensure optimal protection.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2014 [^43cc5741]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Vaccines are recommended for adults on the basis of their age, prior vaccinations, health conditions, lifestyle, occupation, and travel. Reasons for current low levels of vaccination coverage for adult vaccines are multifactorial and include limited awareness among the public about vaccines for adults and gaps in incorporation of regular assessments of vaccine needs and vaccination into routine medical care. Updated standards for immunization of adults were approved by the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) in September 2013. These standards acknowledge the current low levels of vaccination coverage among adults and the role that all health-care providers, including those who do not offer all recommended adult vaccines in their practices, have in ensuring that their patients are up-to-date on recommended vaccines. NVAC recommends that providers assess vaccination needs for their patients at each visit, recommend needed vaccines, and then, ideally, offer the vaccine or, if the provider does not stock the needed vaccines, refer the patient to a provider who does vaccinate. Vaccinating providers should also ensure that patients and their referring health-care providers have documentation of the vaccination.

### Birth through age 18 immunization schedule-AAFP (...) [^263e43f4]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

5-dose series at age 12–23 months Minimum age: birth Revaccination is not generally recommended for persons with a normal immune status who were vaccinated as infants, children, adolescents, or adults. HPV vaccination routinely recommended at age 11–12 years and catch-up HPV vaccination recommended for all persons through age 18 years if not adequately vaccinated Close contacts of severely immunosuppressed persons who require a protected environment: should not receive LAIV3.

If LAIV3 is given, they should avoid contact with or caring for such immunosuppressed persons for 7 days after vaccination. Minimum Age: 6 weeks In the first 6 months of life, use minimum ages and intervals only for travel to a polio-endemic region or during an outbreak. Adolescents age 18 years known or suspected to be unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated: administer remaining doses to complete a 3-dose primary series. Unless there are specific reasons to believe they were not vaccinated, most persons aged 18 years or older born and raised in the United States can assume they were vaccinated against polio as children. Minimum age: 6 weeks Routine Vaccination Note: Tdap may be administered regardless of the interval since the last tetanus- and diphtheria-toxoid-containing vaccine. Catch-up vaccination.

Fully vaccinated = 5 valid doses of DTaP OR 4 valid doses of DTaP if dose 4 was administered at age 4 years or older Minimum Age: 12 months Note: For dose 1 in children age 12-47 months, it is recommended to administer MMR and varicella vaccines separately. MMRV may be used if parents or caregivers express a preference.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedules for persons aged 0 through 18 years – United States, 2015 [^57dbb33f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Each year, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviews the recommended immunization schedules for persons aged 0 through 18 years to ensure that the schedules reflect current recommendations for Food and Drug Administration–licensed vaccines. In October 2014, ACIP approved the recommended immunization schedules for persons aged 0 through 18 years for 2015, which include several changes from the 2014 immunization schedules. For 2015, the figures, footnotes, and tables are being published on the CDC immunization schedule website. This provides readers electronic access to the most current version of the schedules and footnotes on the CDC website. Health care providers are advised to use figures, tables, and the combined footnotes together. Printable versions of the 2015 immunization schedules for persons aged 0 through 18 years also are available at the website in several formats, including portrait, landscape, and pocket-sized versions. Ordering instructions for laminated versions and “parent-friendly” schedules also are available at the immunization schedule website.

For further guidance on use of each vaccine included in the schedules, including contraindications and precautions when using a vaccine, health care providers are referred to the respective ACIP vaccine recommendations at. In addition, changes in recommendations for specific vaccines can occur between annual updates to the childhood/adolescent immunization schedules.

Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, adolescents, and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children and adolescents are harmonized to the greatest extent possible with recommendations made by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG). Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP, ACOG, the American College of Physicians (ACP), and the American College of Nurse Midwives (ACNM). ACIP recommendations adopted by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the date published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Additional information regarding ACIP is available at.

### Update on vaccination guidelines for older adults [^5460cc9e]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

Vaccination is a vital component of routine preventative health. Older adults can potentially benefit most from vaccines because they have greater susceptibility to disease and associated complications. The number of infections covered and the types of vaccines available has grown significantly in recent years. Although this represents tremendous progress, it can also result in confusion and missed opportunities to provided recommended vaccinations. This review summarizes the current guidelines for vaccination of older adults and highlights the latest innovations.

Achieving and maintaining high vaccination coverage levels for adolescents will ensure they have protection from serious and sometimes life-threatening vaccine-preventable diseases. To help adolescents catch up on missed vaccinations, health care providers can identify those who have fallen behind on receiving recommended vaccinations and remind families to schedule an appointment. In addition, during every clinical encounter, including those for COVID-19 vaccination, providers can review patients’ vaccination histories and recommend vaccination if needed. Resources to help promote and discuss vaccination with parents and patients can be found at.

Authorship of papers with age recommendations for HPV vaccinations based on efficacy

In analysing the 18 papers on the efficacy of HPV vaccines as well as the literature on HPV infection, we noted that most are written by investigators in high-resource countries, where governments can afford to implement vaccination programmes and private individuals may wish to pay for vaccination even if the benefit is minimal. Some were funded by vaccine manufacturers or co-authored by company employees (Table 2). Of the 18 papers, 5 had such potential conflicts of interest, and 3 of these recommended vaccinating unlimited ages. All except 1 of the 18 articles were authored by investigators in high-income countries.

Recommendations based on interpretation of cost-effectiveness

Cost-effectiveness studies use mathematical models that combine disease and natural history parameters, vaccine-efficacy findings, and estimated vaccine and health system delivery costs to compute the extra quantity and quality of life provided by an intervention. The intervention is usually considered cost-effective if the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) is less than or equal to the gross domestic product per capita of a given country.

Many cost-effectiveness analyses have modelled HPV vaccination for young adolescent girls, usually 12 years of age, and have found that vaccination at this age is cost-effective in high-income countries, and a 2008 study on cost-effectiveness of vaccinating girls before the age of 12 years in 72 developing countries concluded that vaccination could be cost-effective if the price of vaccine per dose was US$2. Our search identified 13 papers that evaluated vaccinating beyond age 12 years, all modelling cost-effectiveness in high- or middle-income countries (see Table 3). Six of these found vaccination cost-effective up to ages 24–26 years, the maximum ages studied, and one that modelled to age 50 years found that vaccinating to age 25 years, but not beyond, was cost-effective. Three found that vaccinating up to ages 15, 18, or 21 could be cost-effective. Another paper, which considered women up to 35 years of age in several countries, found vaccination most cost-effective up to 15–19 years, depending on the age for the peak of HPV infection in the region under question. Two papers reported that only vaccinating girls ⩽12 years old was cost-effective. Thus, in the few studies that have modelled beyond age 26, none has found including older ages to be cost-effective.

Regarding preventative measures for diphtheria, more specifically with respect to vaccination (children, 7-18 years), CDC 2018 guidelines recommend to administer five doses of diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis, administered at ages 2, 4, 6, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years for routine pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria vaccination for children aged 2 months to 6 years:

- three primary doses at ages 2, 4, and 6 months

- the first booster dose at 15-18 months to maintain adequate immunity during preschool years

- the second booster dose at 4-6 years to confer continued protection against disease during the early years of schooling.

Adults born in 1957 or later should have had either 1 or 2 doses of the MMR vaccine unless they have other acceptable evidence to immunity to these three diseases, while adults born before 1957 can be considered to have immunity to measles, rubella, and mumps. Adults who received either the inactivated measles vaccine or an unknown vaccine type from 1963 to 1967 during childhood should receive 1 or 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, and adults who might be at increased risk for exposure or transmission of measles, rubella, or mumps and who do not have evidence of immunity should receive special consideration for vaccination; students attending colleges or other post-high school educational institutions, healthcare personnel, and international travelers without evidence of immunity or prior vaccination should receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. For catch-up, unvaccinated children and adolescents should receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccine at least 4 weeks apart.

COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) risk and vaccine impact are described as follows: older adults, immunocompromised individuals, and those with certain comorbidities are at risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and from October 2023 to May 2024, rates of hospitalization due to COVID-19 were greatest in adults 75 years of age or older. COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death, with the 2023 to 2024 COVID-19 vaccines decreasing the risk of emergency department and urgent care visits by 50% in the first 2 months after vaccination; however, protection decreased over time, with little effect remaining 4 to 6 months after vaccination, and COVID-19 vaccines have been updated annually to address the currently circulating strains and waning immunity from prior vaccination and infection. For RSV, infants, young children, older adults, and people with immunocompromise are at risk for severe infection and hospitalization; approximately 100,000 to 150,000 adults 60 years of age or older are hospitalized for RSV annually in the United States; RSV is also the most common cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis among children younger than 1 year of age; and other risk factors for severe RSV disease include medical comorbidities such as chronic cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, or hematologic disease.

Figure 3. A new figure, “Figure 3. Vaccines that might be indicated for children and adolescents aged 18 years or younger based on medical indications,” has been added. The purpose of this figure is to do the following:

Demonstrate most children with medical conditions can (and should) be vaccinated according to the routine child/adolescent immunization schedule.
Indicate when a medical condition is a precaution or contraindication to vaccination.
Indicate when additional doses of vaccines may be necessary because of a child’s or adolescent’s medical condition. Providers should consult the relevant footnotes for additional information.

Footnotes. Changes to the footnotes for the figures are as follows:

The Hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) footnote was revised to reflect that the birth dose of HepB should be administered within 24 hours of birth.
The diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) footnote was revised to more clearly present recommendations following an inadvertently early administered fourth dose of DTaP.
Within the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib) footnote, Comvax was removed from the routine vaccination portion of footnote. This vaccine has been removed from the market, and all available doses have expired. Additionally, Hiberix has been added to the list of vaccines that may be used for the primary vaccination series.
Within the pneumococcal vaccine footnote, references to 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) have been removed. All healthy children who might have received PCV7 as part of a primary series have now aged out of the recommendation for pneumococcal vaccine.
The influenza vaccine footnote has been updated to indicate that LAIV should not be used during the 2016–2017 influenza season.
The meningococcal vaccines footnote has been updated to include recommendations for meningococcal vaccination of children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and to reflect recommendations for the use of a 2-dose Trumenba (meningococcal B vaccine) schedule.
The tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) footnote for vaccination of pregnant adolescents between gestational weeks 27–36 has been updated to reflect a preference for vaccination earlier during this period. Currently available data suggest that vaccinating earlier in the 27 through 36–week period will maximize passive antibody transfer to the infant.
The footnote for HPV vaccine has been updated to include the new 2-dose schedule for persons initiating the HPV vaccination series before age 15 years. In addition, bivalent HPV vaccine has been removed from the schedule. This vaccine has been removed from the U.S. market, and all available vaccine doses have expired.

### A review of the cost-effectiveness of adult influenza vaccination and other preventive services [^2c6b9279]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend annual influenza vaccination of persons ≥6 months old. However, in 2016-17, only 43.3% of U.S. adults reported receiving an influenza vaccination. Limited awareness about the cost-effectiveness (CE) or the economic value of influenza vaccination may contribute to low vaccination coverage. In 2017, we conducted a literature review to survey estimates of the CE of influenza vaccination of adults compared to no vaccination. We also summarized CE estimates of other common preventive interventions that are recommended for adults by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Results are presented as costs in US$2015 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. Among adults aged 18-64, the CE of influenza vaccination ranged from $8000 to $39,000 per QALY. Assessments for adults aged ≥65 yielded lower CE ratios, ranging from being cost-saving to $15,300 per QALY. Influenza vaccination was cost-saving to $85,000 per QALY for pregnant women in moderate or severe influenza seasons and $260,000 per QALY in low-incidence seasons. For other preventive interventions, CE estimates ranged from cost-saving to $170,000 per QALY saved for breast cancer screening among women aged 50-74, from cost-saving to $16,000 per QALY for colorectal cancer screening, and from $27,000 to $600,000 per QALY for hypertension screening and treatment. Influenza vaccination in adults appears to have a similar CE profile as other commonly utilized preventive services for adults. Efforts to improve adult vaccination should be considered by adult-patient providers, healthcare systems and payers given the health and economic benefits of influenza vaccination.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2025-2026: technical report [^76f7e79d]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Timing of influenza vaccination and duration of protection—American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance and durability data: The AAP and CDC recommend children, especially those who need 2 doses, be immunized as soon as vaccine becomes available and complete vaccination by the end of October, and vaccination should continue as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available, noting that no influenza vaccines in the US are labeled with an expiration date past June 30 of the prior influenza season. Studies in adults suggest very early vaccination (July or August) might be associated with suboptimal immunity and the CDC now discourages influenza vaccination in the summer months for most adults. Regarding waning, in a cohort of individuals ≥6 months vaccinated during the 2011–2012 to the 2018–2019 seasons, the odds of laboratory-confirmed influenza increased 1.09 times every 28 days since vaccination, but unlike older persons, individuals <18 years had lower odds of influenza at subsequent intervals and waning protection was not observed. In children, a systematic review found antibody levels waned but remained comparable with prevaccination levels for 6 months after vaccination, and among influenza vaccine-naive patients 6 to <24 months of age who received a single dose, vaccine effectiveness declined 9% per month in the first 4 months following immunization and then plateaued. Waning of immunity after 2 doses of vaccine, as is recommended in the US, was not studied.

### Expanding the recommendations for annual influenza vaccination to school-age children in the United States [^925a065c]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Despite long-standing recommendations to vaccinate children who have underlying chronic medical conditions or who are contacts of high-risk persons, vaccination coverage among school-age children remains low. Community studies have indicated that school-age children have the highest incidence of influenza and are an important source of amplifying and sustaining community transmission that affects all age groups.

Methods

A consultation to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of a universal recommendation for annual influenza vaccination of all children age ≥6 months was held in Atlanta, Georgia, in September 2007. Consultants provided summaries of current data on vaccine effectiveness, safety, supply, successful program implementation, and economics studies and discussed challenges associated with continuing a risk- and contact-based vaccination strategy compared with a universal vaccination recommendation.

Results

Consultants noted that school-age children had a substantial illness burden caused by influenza, that vaccine was safe and effective for children aged 6 months through 18 years, and that evidence suggested that vaccinating school-age children would provide benefits to both the vaccinated children and their unvaccinated household and community contacts. However, implementation of an annual recommendation for all school-age children would pose major challenges to parents, medical providers and health care systems. Alternative vaccination venues were needed, and of these school-located vaccination programs might offer the most promise as an alternative vaccination site for school-age children.

Conclusions

Expansion of recommendations to include all school-age children will require additional development of an infrastructure to support implementation and methods to adequately evaluate impact.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^2fceb789]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination—early initiation between ages 9 and 12 years: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended starting the series between ages 9 and 12 years. Evidence is emerging that series completion and acceptance may be higher when vaccination is initiated at age 9 or 10 years compared with age 11 or 12 years; in a primary care network, initiation by age 11 years increased from 4.6% to 60.8% within 18 months. In a large population-based cohort, 97.5% of children who initiated HPV vaccination at age 9 or 10 years completed the series by age 13.5 years compared with 78.0% when initiated at age 11 or 12 years. The American Cancer Society (ACS) adapted ACIP guidance and states that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, and that health care providers are encouraged to start offering the series at age 9 or 10 years.

Vaccination Age

Our analysis assumes that vaccination would focus on children 12 years of age. We considered alternative vaccination strategies that would focus on either infants or persons 18 years of age. Because most women are not sexually active until after age 12, focusing on infants or 12-year-old children leads to approximately the same decrease in lifetime cases of cervical cancer. However, delaying initial vaccination until age 18 leads to only a 54.7% decrease in the number of cancer cases in this cohort. If focusing on the older age group also leads to a decrease in vaccine penetration (60%), then program effectiveness drops further to a 50.9% decrease in lifetime cervical cancer cases in this cohort.

We also considered how the optimal vaccination age was affected if the efficacy of the vaccine waned. If the vaccine efficacy waned over 10 years and no booster was provided, a vaccination program that targeted 18-year-old women would dominate one which targeted 12-year-old girls. In this scenario the cost-effectiveness of also vaccinating 18-year-old men would be economically favorable, with a cost-effectiveness of $57,795/QALY compared to the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating women only. If, however, two booster shots were given at 5-year intervals to maintain the vaccine's efficacy, 12-year-old girls would return to being the optimal vaccination group, but the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating boys would increase to $388,368/QALY.

Changes Affecting Multiple Portions of the Schedule

The overall appearance of the 2019 child and adolescent schedule has been updated because of recommendations resulting from a recent evaluation of the child and adolescent immunization schedule. An internet survey of 249 pediatricians and family medicine physicians was conducted to assess their familiarity with the schedule, the environment in which the schedule is used, the frequency and circumstances of use, and their impressions and preferences on redesigned drafts of the child and adolescent immunization schedule. These changes have been applied to all portions of the immunization schedule, including the cover page, routine immunization schedule (Table 1), catch-up schedule (Table 2), medical indications for each vaccine (Table 3), and notes with details for each vaccine.

Cover Page. Changes to the cover page are as follows:

Guidance on how to use the schedule was added to the top of the document.
Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was added to the vaccine table.
A Helpful Information section, which includes links to the ACIP recommendations, the General Best Practice Guidelines for Immunization, and the Manual for the Surveillance of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, has been added.

Table 1. Changes to Table 1 (previously known as Figure 1) are as follows:

A separate row has been added for LAIV.
A purple bar has been added to the Hepatitis A (HepA) row at age 6–11 months to represent use in infant travelers.
Within the Tetanus, diphtheria, & acellular pertussis (Tdap: ≥7 yrs) row, the bar for persons aged 13–18 years has been split into a half green and half purple bar to represent catch-up vaccination and use in pregnant adolescents, respectively.

Table 2. Changes to Table 2 (previously known as Figure 2) are as follows:

Minor changes to the order in which guidance is presented in the Haemophilius influenzae type b and Pneumococcal conjugate rows were made. The criteria under which no further doses are needed are now presented first, followed by recommendation for those for whom additional doses are indicated.

Table 1 (Routine Immunization Schedule)

• The color of the columns for children aged 4–6 years, children aged 11–12 years, and adolescents aged 16 years has been changed from gray to black to align with the color of the other age range columns. The sentence in the table header stating “School entry and adolescent vaccine age groups are shaded in gray” has been deleted.

• Tdap row: The overlying text in the column for children aged 11–12 years has been changed from “Tdap” to “1 dose” to be consistent with the format used for other vaccines in the table.

• HPV row: The asterisk that was previously present for children aged 9–10 years and its associated descriptive text in the table legend (i.e. “ * can be used in this age group”) have been deleted. Instead, the color for children aged 9–10 years has been changed from blue to checked yellow, which is a new color in Table 1. Within the table’s legend, a new checked yellow box has been added, which now indicates that “Recommended vaccination can begin in this age group.”

• Dengue row: A new row has been added with the boxes for children and adolescents aged 9–16 years highlighted in yellow to indicate the recommended age for routine dengue vaccination. The overlying text “Seropositive in endemic areas only (see notes)” has been added to the yellow boxes.

Table 2 (Catch-Up Immunization Schedule)

• Hib row: The text for the 4-week minimum interval between doses 2 and 3 has been revised to include recommendations for DTaP-IPV-Hib-HepB (Vaxelis). The text now reads, “if current age is younger than 12 months and first dose was administered at younger than age 7 months and at least 1 previous dose was PRP-T (ActHib, Pentacel, Hiberix), Vaxelis, or unknown.” In addition, Hib-HepB (Comvax) was deleted from the text for the 8-week minimum interval between doses 2 and 3 because this vaccine product is no longer available.

• Dengue row: A new row has been added for the dengue vaccine outlining the minimum age and minimum interval between doses.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedules for persons aged 0 through 18 years – United States, 2015 [^df2d4489]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Changes to the previous schedules † include the following:

Figure 1, “Recommended Immunization Schedule for Persons Aged 0 through 18 Years” was modified to highlight the recommendations for influenza vaccination for children 1) for live attenuated influenza vaccine, which may only be administered beginning at age 2 years, and 2) for children aged 6 months through 8 years, who need 2 doses of influenza vaccine in the first year vaccinated, and in subsequent years only require 1 dose of vaccine. Therefore, the gold bar for live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) 1 or 2 doses extends from 2 through 8 years (midpoint of column for 7–10 years) and a new gold bar (1 dose) extends from 9 to 18 years to reflect these changes.
A purple bar was added for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine for children aged 6–11 months, denoting the recommendation to vaccinate such children if they will travel or live abroad.
Pages 4 through 6 contain combined footnotes for each vaccine related to routine vaccination, catch-up vaccination, § and vaccination of persons with high-risk medical conditions or special circumstances.
Standardized formatting is used for footnotes for each vaccine to reflect the number of vaccine doses in a particular series.
The diphtheria/tetanus/acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine footnote has language added stating if the fourth dose DTaP vaccine was administered 4 months or more after the third dose, at an appropriate age, it can be counted as a valid dose, and need not be repeated after the recommended 6-month interval between doses 3 and 4.
The meningococcal conjugate vaccine footnote was revised to more clearly present recommendations for use of MenACWY-CRM, MenACWY-D, and Hib-MenCY-TT in children aged 2 months and older with anatomic or functional asplenia, or with persistent complement deficiencies.
The influenza vaccine footnote was updated to reflect revised contraindications for LAIV: LAIV should not be administered to some persons, including 1) persons who have experienced severe allergic reactions to LAIV, any of its components, or to a previous dose of any other influenza vaccine; 2) children aged 2 through 17 years receiving aspirin or aspirin-containing products; 3) persons who are allergic to eggs; 4) pregnant women; 5) immunosuppressed persons; 6) children aged 2 through 4 years with asthma or who had wheezing in the past 12 months; and 7) persons who have taken influenza antiviral medications in the previous 48 hours. All other contraindications and precautions to use of LAIV are available at.
The pneumococcal vaccine footnote was updated to provide clearer guidance for vaccination of persons with high-risk conditions: – Administer 1 dose of PCV13 if any incomplete schedule of 3 doses of PCV (PCV7 and/or PCV13) was received previously. – Administer 2 doses of PCV13 at least 8 weeks apart if unvaccinated or any incomplete schedule of fewer than 3 doses of PCV (PCV7 and/or PCV13) was received previously.
Figure 2, Catch-Up Immunization Schedule: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap), and varicella vaccine catch-up schedules were updated to provide more clarity. Minimum ages were noted as “not-applicable” for children aged 7 years and older for hepatitis A and B, polio, meningococcal, MMR, and varicella vaccines.

### Update on routine childhood and adolescent immunizations [^25af4fe4]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Recommendations for routine vaccinations in children and adolescents have changed multiple times in recent years, based on findings in clinical trials, licensure of new vaccines, and evidence of waning immunity. Despite the overwhelming success of vaccinations, vaccine delay and refusal are leading to pockets of vaccine-preventable diseases. Schedules for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and acellular pertussis (DTaP); hepatitis A and B; Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib); inactivated poliovirus; varicella; and measles, mumps, and rubella are unchanged. However, since 2008, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has replaced the 7-valent vaccine; a new two-dose oral rotavirus vaccine has been approved; use of the tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine has been expanded to children seven to 10 years of age who received fewer than five doses of DTaP, as well as during each pregnancy; a booster dose of meningococcal vaccine is recommended in adolescents 16 to 18 years of age (unless the first dose was given after 16 years of age); new meningococcal vaccines have been approved for use in infants at high risk of meningococcal disease; influenza vaccine has been expanded to routine use in all children six months and older; and the human papillomavirus vaccine has been approved for routine immunization of adolescent boys and girls. For the 2015-2016 influenza season, either live attenuated or inactivated vaccine can be administered to healthy children two to eight years of age.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^b3a076c1]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations—The ACS recommends routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates. Health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine series at age 9 or 10 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated, and providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for adults aged older than 26 years. The ACS does not endorse the 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for shared clinical decision making for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on the selection of individuals who might benefit.

### The impact of influenza on US working-age adults: exploring the benefits of the recombinant influenza vaccine [^624b58f5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite universal influenza vaccine recommendation in the US, vaccination coverage rates (VCR) in working-age adults (18-64 years) remain suboptimal. Studies have suggested that recombinant influenza vaccines (RIV) offer better protection than standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (SD-IIV) in those ages. We explored the potential added benefit of recommending RIV for the US working-age population.

Methods

We gathered data on influenza burden, vaccine effectiveness, and VCR from the US-CDC (2012-2023, excluding 2020-2021). We conducted a retrospective analysis of the past 10 years to illustrate the influenza burden among adults 18-64 years. We performed an age-stratified analysis using prevalence of chronic conditions to assess their impact on influenza hospitalizations and deaths, and estimated reductions in hospitalizations if RIV had been used instead of SD-IIV during the study period, using an age and risk-group decision-tree model.

Results

Over the last decade, influenza caused a median of 151,021 hospitalizations (95% CI 139,750-164,130) per season among US working-age adults. Adults aged 50-64 years had 3- to 5-fold higher rates of hospitalization and death than those aged 18-49 years. The 14% of 18-49-year-olds with chronic conditions accounted for more than 28% of hospitalizations and deaths in this group. If RIV had been used instead of SD-IIV, an additional 10,000 hospitalizations could have been prevented each season in these populations.

Conclusions

Influenza significantly impacts US working-age adults, particularly 50-64-year-olds. Increases in longevity and chronic conditions prevalence are expected, making tailored public health vaccine recommendations important to support healthy aging.

### Influenza vaccination coverage among children aged 6 months – 18 years-eight immunization information system sentinel sites, United States, 2008-09 influenza season [^d9a4ed34]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2009). Low credibility.

Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Annual influenza vaccination was first recommended for children aged 6-23 months in 2004 and for children aged 24-59 months in 2006. In August 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) expanded its recommendations to include all children aged 5-18 years, beginning with the 2008-09 influenza season. Among children aged 6 months--8 years, previously unvaccinated children and children who received only 1 vaccine dose for the first time in the preceding influenza season are recommended to receive 2 influenza vaccine doses. Children aged 9-18 years are recommended to receive 1 vaccine dose. To update previous estimates by assessing influenza vaccination coverage among children aged 6 months--18 years during the 2008-09 season, CDC averaged data from the eight immunization information system (IIS) sentinel sites. The results indicated that average (unweighted) vaccination coverage with >or=1 influenza vaccine doses decreased with increasing age from 47.8% for children aged 6-23 months to 9.1% for those aged 13-18 years. Among sites, average coverage with >or=1 doses among children aged 6--23 months increased from 40.8% during the 2007-08 influenza season to 47.8% during the 2008-09 season; however, coverage levels remained suboptimal. Vaccination against both seasonal influenza and 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) are recommended for children in 2009; these findings highlight the need to identify opportunities for and barriers to influenza vaccination of children.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years – United States, 2013 [^0fbd238a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

What is already known on this topic?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that adolescents receive 1 dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, 2 doses of meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine, and 3 doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. ACIP also recommends administration of these and all age-appropriate vaccines during a single visit. During 2006–2012, national vaccination coverage for ≥1 Tdap and ≥1 MenACWY increased steadily, with Tdap coverage in 2011 reaching national target levels for adolescents. During 2007–2011, coverage for ≥1 HPV vaccine dose among females increased steadily, but from 2011 to 2012, there were no changes in coverage. Coverage for ≥1 HPV vaccine dose among males increased from 2011–2012.

What is added by this report?

From 2012 to 2013, vaccination coverage among U.S. adolescents increased to 86.0% for ≥1 dose of Tdap vaccine, 77.8% for ≥1 dose of MenACWY vaccine, 57.3% for ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine among females, and 34.6% for ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine among males. Vaccination coverage levels continued to vary widely among states. Although HPV vaccination coverage increased among both females and males, levels are still low and reflect many missed opportunities. Five states had substantial increases in HPV coverage from 2012 to 2013, suggesting greater progress is feasible.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Lower vaccination coverage for HPV compared with Tdap and MenACWY vaccines indicates clinicians, parents, and adolescents are missing opportunities for infection and cancer prevention. Clinician recommendations strongly influence the decisions of parents to vaccinate their children; to maximize coverage, clinicians should clearly and consistently recommend all ACIP-recommended vaccines, including HPV. Health care systems interventions, including use of client reminder and recall systems, immunization information systems, clinician reminders, and standing orders, should be employed to improve protection of adolescents from vaccine-preventable infections and future cancers.

### Prevention and control of seasonal influenza with vaccines: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2009 [^97f7aa37]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Low credibility.

This report updates the 2008 recommendations by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the use of influenza vaccine for the prevention and control of seasonal influenza (CDC. Prevention and control of influenza: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2008;57[No. RR-7]). Information on vaccination issues related to the recently identified novel influenza A H1N1 virus will be published later in 2009. The 2009 seasonal influenza recommendations include new and updated information. Highlights of the 2009 recommendations include 1) a recommendation that annual vaccination be administered to all children aged 6 months-18 years for the 2009-10 influenza season; 2) a recommendation that vaccines containing the 2009-10 trivalent vaccine virus strains A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like, A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like antigens be used; and 3) a notice that recommendations for influenza diagnosis and antiviral use will be published before the start of the 2009-10 influenza season. Vaccination efforts should begin as soon as vaccine is available and continue through the influenza season. Approximately 83% of the United States population is specifically recommended for annual vaccination against seasonal influenza; however, <40% of the U.S. population received the 2008-09 influenza vaccine.

### Recommended schedules for routine immunization of children and adults [^81aaae4a]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Vaccine recommendations continue to evolve as a result of new vaccines, safety considerations, changing disease incidence (e.g., polio), and public health priorities. The pace of discovery is accelerating and advisory committees will need to respond accordingly. Each vaccine, new or old, will be required to earn its place in the routine immunization schedule on the basis of public health benefit or cost-benefit studies.

### Cost-effectiveness of 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination in US adults [^e7168f10]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite prevention and control efforts, COVID-19 still causes substantial morbidity and mortality in adults.During 2020 to 2021, 2 mRNA vaccine products were authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use to prevent severe COVID-19 illness.Updated monovalent 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccines were approved by the FDA in September 2023.In September 2023 and February 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) considered recommendations for the use of 2023 to 2024 COVID-19 vaccines.

The objectives of this study were to help inform ACIP recommendations on seasonal COVID-19 vaccination by (1) estimating annual disease burden and health care utilization associated with COVID-19 illness and 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination and (2) projecting the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with a 2023-2024 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine in adults aged 18 years or older compared with no updated vaccination (with 2023-2024 vaccine). A second phase of the study was conducted in February 2024 to inform ACIP recommendations for an additional midyear dose by evaluating the incremental health benefits and cost-effectiveness of a second dose of a 2023-2024 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine for US adults.

Vaccine-preventable diseases were a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States in the 20th century. With the advent of immunizations, there have been dramatic rates of decline in these diseases. Clinical studies have shown vaccines to be efficacious and cost effective. Despite the simplification of the immunization schedule, vaccination rates are still suboptimal because of missed opportunities. Although several controversies have arisen about the safety of childhood immunizations, they are yet to be validated. There have been recent concerns about the stability of the infrastructure that supports the U.S. immunization program. Research has established strong evidence that certain interventions can increase vaccination coverage rates. The American College of Preventive Medicine outlines recommendations for childhood immunizations.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^35a4ea33]. CA (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) presents an adaptation of the current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The ACS recommends routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, which will lead to increased numbers of cancers prevented. Health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine series at age 9 or 10 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. Providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for adults aged older than 26 years. The ACS does not endorse the 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for shared clinical decision making for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on the selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine update [^fa4baf06]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Rates of cancers attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) are rising. A safe and extremely effective vaccine is available to prevent many of these cancers. Studies have shown that health care providers' recommendation to immunize is the most important factor in parents' decision. Parents of all adolescent boys and girls should receive a strong and unequivocal recommendation to vaccinate their child against HPV at the 11- or 12-year-old well child visit. Ideally, adolescents complete their HPV vaccine series by their 13th birthday, leading to greater immune response and protection before most adolescents are exposed to sexually transmitted HPV.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years-United States, 2016 [^24e13d2b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

At the end of 2016, the recommended HPV vaccination schedule was changed from a 3-dose to a 2-dose series for immunocompetent adolescents initiating the series before their 15th birthday. Three doses are recommended for persons initiating the series at ages 15 through 26 years and for immunocompromised persons. The recommendation allows for 1 fewer dose and one fewer visit to a health care provider, which might encourage providers to promote, and parents to accept, vaccination at the recommended age of 11–12 years. Although it is too early to assess the direct impact of the revised recommendation on vaccination practices, when applied retrospectively, the HPV up-to-date coverage was 6.3 percentage points higher than the ≥3-dose HPV coverage.

Each year in the United States, an estimated 31,500 newly diagnosed cancers in men and women are attributable to HPV; approximately 90% of these could be prevented by receipt of the nine-valent HPV vaccine. Although it is too early to observe the impact of HPV vaccination on HPV-associated cancers, impact on infection with HPV types targeted by the vaccine and other endpoints have been reported (–). Data from the 2007–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys indicate that, compared with 2003–2006 (before HPV vaccine introduction), prevalence of HPV types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine ††† in cervicovaginal specimens had decreased 56% (from 11.5% to 5.0%) among females aged 14–19 years. By 2011–2014, prevalence had declined 71% (from 11.5% to 3.3%) among females aged 14–19 years and 61% (from 18.5% to 7.2%) among females aged 20–24 years. Evidence of vaccine impact among males also exists.

§ Minimum authorized age group; see Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendations for groups recommended to receive a booster dose.

After the EUA amendments, ACIP and CDC issued interim recommendations for vaccine use *, †, § (2). Moderately to severely immunocompromised persons aged ≥12 years (Pfizer-BioNTech recipients) or ≥18 years (Moderna recipients) should receive an additional homologous dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (i.e. the same vaccine product that was administered for the primary series) ≥28 days after receipt of the second dose. Regarding booster dose recommendations, recipients of a primary mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series who are 1) aged ≥65 years, 2) aged ≥18 years and reside in long-term care settings, or 3) aged 50–64 years with certain underlying medical conditions ¶ should receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose ≥6 months after completion of the primary vaccination series. In addition, persons aged 18–49 years with certain underlying medical conditions and those aged 18–64 years who are at increased risk for occupational or institutional exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may receive a booster dose based on their individual benefits and risks. Recipients of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine aged ≥18 years should receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose ≥2 months after primary vaccination. Any approved or authorized COVID-19 vaccine may be used for the booster dose, regardless of vaccine received for primary vaccination (Box 2). For Pfizer-BioNTech and Janssen, the dose and volume are the same for primary and booster vaccination; for Moderna, the dose and volume of the booster dose (50 μ g; 0.25 ml) are one half that used for the primary series (100 μ g; 0.5 ml) (Table). As of October 28, 2021, more than 191 million persons in the United States have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and more than 15 million have received an additional or booster dose. **

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2017 [^f330936d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination. Healthy adolescents who start their human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series before age 15 years are recommended to receive 2 doses of HPV vaccine. Adults and adolescents who did not start their HPV vaccination series before age 15 years should receive 3 doses of HPV vaccine. Changes in recommendations in the adult immunization schedule include updates regarding HPV vaccination for adults who did not complete the HPV vaccination series as adolescents. These changes are described in the 2017 adult immunization schedule as follows:

Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years who have not received any HPV vaccine should receive a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine at 0, 1–2, and 6 months. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated with a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine at 0, 1–2, and 6 months.
Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years (and males aged 22 through 26 years who may receive HPV vaccine) who initiated the HPV vaccination series before age 15 years and received 2 doses at least 5 months apart are considered adequately vaccinated and do not need an additional dose of HPV vaccine.
Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years (and males aged 22 through 26 years who may receive HPV vaccine) who initiated the HPV vaccination series before age 15 years and received only 1 dose, or 2 doses less than 5 months apart, are not considered adequately vaccinated and should receive 1 additional dose of HPV vaccine.

Catch-Up Immunization Recommendations

Persons aged 7–18 years. If persons aged 7–18 years have never been vaccinated against pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria, these persons should receive a series of three tetanus and diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccines, which includes at least 1 Tdap dose. The preferred schedule is 1 dose of Tdap, followed by 1 dose of either Td or Tdap ≥4 weeks afterward, and 1 dose of either Td or Tdap 6–12 months later. Persons aged 7–18 years who are not fully immunized against tetanus and diphtheria should receive 1 dose of Tdap, preferably as the first dose in the catch-up series; if additional tetanus toxoid–containing doses are required, either Td or Tdap may be used. The vaccination series does not need to be restarted for those with incomplete DTaP history, regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses. The catch-up schedule and minimum intervals between doses are available at.

Persons aged ≥19 years. If persons aged ≥19 years have never been vaccinated against pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria, these persons should receive a series of three tetanus and diphtheria toxoid–containing vaccines, which includes at least 1 Tdap dose. The preferred schedule is 1 dose of Tdap, followed by 1 dose of either Td or Tdap at least 4 weeks afterward, and 1 dose of either Td or Tdap 6–12 months later. Persons aged ≥19 years who are not fully immunized against tetanus and diphtheria should receive 1 dose of Tdap, preferably as the first dose in the catch-up series; if additional tetanus toxoid–containing doses are required, either Td or Tdap may be used.

### Improving vaccination uptake among adolescents [^2ca2fc89]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Adolescent vaccination has received increased attention since the Global Vaccine Action Plan's call to extend the benefits of immunisation more equitably beyond childhood. In recent years, many programmes have been launched to increase the uptake of different vaccines in adolescent populations; however, vaccination coverage among adolescents remains suboptimal. Therefore, understanding and evaluating the various interventions that can be used to improve adolescent vaccination is crucial.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of interventions to improve vaccine uptake among adolescents.

Search Methods

In October 2018, we searched the following databases: CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, and eight other databases. In addition, we searched two clinical trials platforms, electronic databases of grey literature, and reference lists of relevant articles. For related systematic reviews, we searched four databases. Furthermore, in May 2019, we performed a citation search of five other websites.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series studies of adolescents (girls or boys aged 10 to 19 years) eligible for World Health Organization-recommended vaccines and their parents or healthcare providers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened records, reviewed full-text articles to identify potentially eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, resolving discrepancies by consensus. For each included study, we calculated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) where appropriate. We pooled study results using random-effects meta-analyses and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 16 studies (eight individually randomised trials, four cluster randomised trials, three non-randomised trials, and one controlled before-after study). Twelve studies were conducted in the USA, while there was one study each from: Australia, Sweden, Tanzania, and the UK. Ten studies had unclear or high risk of bias. We categorised interventions as recipient-oriented, provider-oriented, or health systems-oriented. The interventions targeted adolescent boys or girls or both (seven studies), parents (four studies), and providers (two studies). Five studies had mixed participants that included adolescents and parents, adolescents and healthcare providers, and parents and healthcare providers. The outcomes included uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) (11 studies); hepatitis B (three studies); and tetanus-diphtheria-acellular-pertussis (Tdap), meningococcal, HPV, and influenza (three studies) vaccines among adolescents. Health education improves HPV vaccine uptake compared to usual practice (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.76; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 1054 participants; high-certainty evidence). In addition, one large study provided evidence that a complex multi-component health education intervention probably results in little to no difference in hepatitis B vaccine uptake compared to simplified information leaflets on the vaccine (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97 to 0.99; 17,411 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Financial incentives may improve HPV vaccine uptake compared to usual practice (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.99; 1 study, 500 participants; low-certainty evidence). However, we are uncertain whether combining health education and financial incentives has an effect on hepatitis B vaccine uptake, compared to usual practice (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.00; 1 study, 104 participants; very low certainty evidence). Mandatory vaccination probably leads to a large increase in hepatitis B vaccine uptake compared to usual practice (RR 3.92, 95% CI 3.65 to 4.20; 1 study, 6462 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Provider prompts probably make little or no difference compared to usual practice, on completion of Tdap (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.80; 2 studies, 3296 participants), meningococcal (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.79; 2 studies, 3219 participants), HPV (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.81; 2 studies, 859 participants), and influenza (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.34; 2 studies, 1439 participants) vaccination schedules (moderate-certainty evidence). Provider education with performance feedback may increase the proportion of adolescents who are offered and accept HPV vaccination by clinicians, compared to usual practice. Compared to adolescents visiting non-participating clinicians (in the usual practice group), the adolescents visiting clinicians in the intervention group were more likely to receive the first dose of HPV during preventive visits (5.7 percentage points increase) and during acute visits (0.7 percentage points for the first and 5.6 percentage points for the second doses of HPV) (227 clinicians and more than 200,000 children; low-certainty evidence). A class-based school vaccination strategy probably leads to slightly higher HPV vaccine uptake than an age-based school vaccination strategy (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.13; 1 study, 5537 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A multi-component provider intervention (including an education session, repeated contacts, individualised feedback, and incentives) probably improves uptake of HPV vaccine compared to usual practice (moderate-certainty evidence). A multi-component intervention targeting providers and parents involving social marketing and health education may improve HPV vaccine uptake compared to usual practice (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.59; 1 study, 25,869 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Various strategies have been evaluated to improve adolescent vaccination including health education, financial incentives, mandatory vaccination, and class-based school vaccine delivery. However, most of the evidence is of low to moderate certainty. This implies that while this research provides some indication of the likely effect of these interventions, the likelihood that the effects will be substantially different is high. Therefore, additional research is needed to further enhance adolescent immunisation strategies, especially in low- and middle-income countries where there are limited adolescent vaccination programmes. In addition, it is critical to understand the factors that influence hesitancy, acceptance, and demand for adolescent vaccination in different settings. This is the topic of an ongoing Cochrane qualitative evidence synthesis, which may help to explain why and how some interventions were more effective than others in increasing adolescent HPV vaccination coverage.

### Updated recommendations for use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (tdap) vaccine in adults aged 65 years and older-advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP), 2012 [^ea4c26e8]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Since 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended a tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine booster dose for all adolescents aged 11 through 18 years (preferred at 11 through 12 years) and for those adults aged 19 through 64 years who have not yet received a dose. In October 2010, despite the lack of an approved Tdap vaccine for adults aged 65 years and older, ACIP recommended that unvaccinated adults aged 65 years and older be vaccinated with Tdap if in close contact with an infant, and that other adults aged 65 years and older may receive Tdap. In July 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved expanding the age indication for Boostrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) to aged 65 years and older. In February 2012, ACIP recommended Tdap for all adults aged 65 years and older. This recommendation supersedes previous Tdap recommendations regarding adults aged 65 years and older.

ACIP routine HPV vaccination ages and ACS qualifying statement with rationale indicate that ACIP recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years and that vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years, and ACS states that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates and encourages providers to start the series at age 9 or 10 years. The ACIP basis included that the vaccine can be administered as young as age 9 years, high antibody titers after vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and the established young adolescent visit at age 11 or 12 years. Evidence summarized notes that HPV vaccination has been shown to be more effective at younger ages, that vaccinating at age 12 or 13 years is significantly more effective than vaccinating at age 14 or 15 years, that vaccinating at ages 9 to 11 years will be at least as effective and will likely result in a stronger immune response, and that vaccination has shown no sign of protection waning over time.

### Prevention of pertussis, tetanus, and diphtheria with vaccines in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^806bd4f8]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Persons with Incomplete or Unknown Vaccine History

Persons Aged 2 Months–6 Years

For persons aged <7 years not fully immunized with DTaP vaccine, the catch-up schedule and minimum intervals between doses are available at. The vaccine series does not need to be restarted regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses for those with incomplete DTaP vaccine history.

Because of concern about adverse reactions, the total number of doses of vaccines containing diphtheria and tetanus toxoids (e.g. DTaP, DT, and DTP) received should not exceed 6 doses before the seventh birthday. Only documented doses count toward the maximum of 6 doses.

Persons Aged 7–18 Years

Persons aged 7–18 years not fully immunized with DTaP vaccine should receive a single dose of Tdap as one (preferably the first) dose of the catch-up series; if additional doses are needed, use Td vaccine. The vaccine series does not need to be restarted, regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses for those with incomplete DTaP vaccine history. The catch-up schedule and minimum intervals between doses are available at.

For persons aged 7–10 years who receive a dose of Tdap as part of the catch-up series, an adolescent Tdap vaccine dose should be administered at age 11–12 years.

Persons Aged >18 Years

Persons aged >18 years who have never been vaccinated against pertussis, tetanus, or diphtheria should receive a series of three vaccinations containing tetanus and diphtheria toxoids, which includes 1 dose of Tdap. The preferred schedule is a single dose of Tdap, followed by a dose of Td at least 4 weeks after Tdap and another dose of Td 6 to 12 months later. However, the single dose of Tdap can substitute for any of the Td doses in the 3-dose primary series.

Persons aged >18 years who are not fully immunized against tetanus and diphtheria should receive 1 dose of Tdap (preferably the first) in the catch-up series; if additional tetanus toxoid–containing doses are needed, use Td vaccine. Alternatively, in situations in which a person aged >18 years probably received vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria but cannot produce documentation, vaccine providers may consider serologic testing for antibodies to tetanus and diphtheria toxin to avoid unnecessary vaccination. If tetanus and diphtheria antitoxin levels are each >0.01 IU/mL, previous vaccination with tetanus and diphtheria toxoid vaccine is presumed, and a single dose of Tdap is indicated.

### Annual universal influenza vaccination: ready or not? [^e99e8b3c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Influenza causes annual worldwide epidemics of respiratory disease. Currently, the United States and many other countries recommend influenza vaccination for persons who are at high risk for influenza-related complications. This commentary explores the potential benefits of a policy advocating universal annual influenza vaccination and outlines obstacles that need to be overcome to make such a recommendation feasible. The 5-year experience of a free influenza vaccination program for everyone > or =6 months of age in the Canadian province of Ontario is reviewed.

### Influenza vaccination coverage among children and adults-United States, 2008-09 influenza season [^6aa4a810]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2009). Low credibility.

Before 2008, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) had recommended annual vaccination for influenza for persons aged >or=50 years, 18-49 years at higher risk for influenza complications, and 6 months--4 years. In 2008, ACIP expanded the recommendations to include all children aged 5--18 years, beginning with the 2008--09 season, if feasible, but no later than the 2009--10 season. This expansion added 26 million children and adolescents to groups recommended for routine influenza vaccination. To assess vaccination uptake among children and adults during the 2008-09 influenza season, CDC analyzed data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in 19 states, which represent 43% of the U.S. population. This report summarizes the results of the analysis, which indicated that reported influenza vaccination coverage of >or=1 doses was 40.9% for ages 6-23 months, 32.0% for 2-4 years, and 20.8% for 5-17 years. Among adults, reported coverage was 32.1% for persons aged 18--49 years with high-risk conditions, 42.3% for persons 50--64 years, and 67.2% for persons >or=65 years. These results are consistent with previous studies that have found no significant increases in vaccination coverage for any of these age groups over previous seasons. These 2008--09 season estimates provide a baseline for assessing implementation of the 2008 recommendation for school-aged children. Attaining higher coverage rates likely will require additional vaccination programs in schools and expanded vaccination services in provider offices.

### Use of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccines: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices-United States, 2019 [^815a2e79]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for diphtheria, more specifically with respect to vaccination (children, up to 6 years), CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to administer a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis, preferably as the first dose in the catch-up series, in children aged 7-18 years who are not fully immunized against tetanus and diphtheria. Administer either Td or tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis if additional tetanus toxoid-containing doses are required. Do not restart the vaccination series in children with incomplete diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, and acellular pertussis history, regardless of the time that has elapsed between doses.

### Pertussis infection in the United States: role for vaccination of adolescents and adults [^58b3611d]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Pertussis is the only vaccine-preventable disease on the rise in the United States, with increasing incidence in adolescents and adults related to waning immunity. Although often considered a relatively mild infection in these populations, pertussis can be a serious, potentially deadly illness, particularly in children <12 months old. Infected adolescents and adults serve as a reservoir for disease transmission to young children and infants, who are most vulnerable to severe pertussis and its life-threatening complications. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration licensed two vaccines that contain tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and reduced acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), one for use in adolescents and the other for use in adolescents and adults. In light of these licensures, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) revised its recommendations for pertussis vaccination to include a Tdap booster dose for all adolescents aged 11 to 12 years as well as catch-up vaccination of those aged 13 to 18 years who did not receive the Td booster. The Committee also recommended a Tdap booster dose for all adults aged 19 to 64 years to replace the next Td booster dose, particularly for those who have close contact with infants <12 months old. In February 2006, the ACIP recommended a Tdap booster dose for health care personnel as soon as feasible. If widely administered, Tdap vaccination should have a substantial impact on pertussis.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years – United States, 2013 [^5351393c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that adolescents routinely receive 1 dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, 2 doses of meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine, and 3 doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. * ACIP also recommends administration of “catch-up” † vaccinations, such as measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), hepatitis B, and varicella, and, for all persons aged ≥6 months, an annual influenza vaccination. ACIP recommends administration of all age-appropriate vaccines during a single visit. To assess vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years, CDC analyzed data from the 2013 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen). § This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which show that from 2012 to 2013, coverage increased for each of the vaccines routinely recommended for adolescents: from 84.6% to 86.0% for ≥1 Tdap dose; from 74.0% to 77.8% for ≥1 MenACWY dose; from 53.8% to 57.3% for ≥1 HPV dose among females, and from 20.8% to 34.6% for ≥1 HPV dose among males. Coverage varied by state and local jurisdictions and by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) region. Healthy People 2020 vaccination targets for adolescents aged 13–15 years were reached in 42 states for ≥1 Tdap dose, 18 for ≥1 MenACWY dose, and 11 for ≥2 varicella doses. No state met the target for ≥3 HPV doses. ¶ Use of patient reminder and recall systems, immunization information systems, coverage assessment and feedback to clinicians, clinician reminders, standing orders, and other interventions can help make use of every health care visit to ensure that adolescents are fully protected from vaccine-preventable infections and cancers, especially when such interventions are coupled with clinicians’ vaccination recommendations.

### Meningococcal vaccination: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices, United States, 2020 [^08d4fa99]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

MenACWY Vaccines

ACIP recommends a single dose of MenACWY at age 11 or 12 years followed by a booster dose administered at age 16 years (Table 2). Children who received MenACWY at age 10 years do not need an additional dose at age 11–12 years but should receive the booster dose at age 16 years. Children who received MenACWY before age 10 years and with no ongoing risk for meningococcal disease for which boosters are recommended should still receive MenACWY according to the recommended adolescent schedule, with the first dose at age 11–12 years and a booster dose at age 16 years. For example, a healthy child who received MenACWY at age 9 years because of short-term travel to a country where meningococcal disease is hyperendemic or epidemic and who is not otherwise at increased risk should receive the MenACWY at age 11–12 years according to the recommended ACIP adolescent vaccination schedule. Children who received MenACWY before age 10 years and for whom boosters are recommended because of an ongoing increased risk for meningococcal disease (e.g. those with complement deficiency, HIV infection, or asplenia) should follow the booster schedule for persons at increased risk.

Adolescents who receive their first dose at age 13–15 years should receive a booster dose at age 16–18 years; the booster dose can be administered at any time, as long as a minimum interval of 8 weeks between doses is maintained. Adolescents who receive a first dose after their 16th birthday do not need a booster dose unless they become at increased risk for meningococcal disease. Persons aged 19–21 years who have not received a dose after their 16th birthday can receive a single MenACWY dose as part of catch-up vaccination. MenACWY vaccines are interchangeable; the same vaccine product is recommended, but not required, for all doses. MenACWY vaccines can be administered simultaneously with other vaccines indicated for this age group, but at a different anatomic site, if feasible. MenACWY-TT, which is conjugated to tetanus toxoid, is only licensed for the prevention of meningococcal disease; use of this vaccine does not replace doses or affect the dosing intervals of routinely recommended tetanus toxoid–containing vaccines in any age group.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^eb9c2ccd]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) adapted human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations—age indications and adult decision-making—state that HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, with an ACS qualifying statement that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9–12 y is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, resulting in increased numbers of cancers prevented, and health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine at age 9 or 10 y. Vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and the ACS qualifying statement specifies that providers should inform individuals aged 22–26 y who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. For adults, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all aged >26 y and instead shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated; however, the ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27–45 y because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Update: influenza activity-United States and worldwide, may 21-September 23, 2017 [^a7de5e59]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Annual influenza vaccination is the best method for preventing influenza and its potentially severe complications. In the United States, annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged ≥6 months who do not have contraindications. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended regardless of whether the vaccine composition has changed because immunity from vaccination wanes over time and might decline below protective levels after one season. Optimally, vaccination should occur before the onset of influenza activity in the community. If possible, vaccination should be offered by the end of October and should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses should receive their first dose as soon as possible after vaccine becomes available, and the second dose ≥4 weeks later. For 2017-18 season, manufacturers have projected they will supply the United States with as many as 151 to 166 million doses of injectable influenza vaccine; approximately 119 million of this will be quadrivalent vaccine. As of September 15, 2017, approximately 73 million doses had already been distributed.
