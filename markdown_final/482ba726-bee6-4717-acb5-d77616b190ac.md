## Question

Volume overload

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing volume overload in heart failure, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining volume overload and distinguishing it from congestion. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology, including neurohormonal drivers and the two-circulation model. Next, I will review clinical assessment and objective monitoring, including natriuretic peptides and urine sodium. After that, I need to outline first-line therapy with loop diuretics and dosing strategies. Then, I will address diuretic resistance and sequential nephron blockade, including acetazolamide and thiazides. I will also consider adjuncts like SGLT2 inhibitors and MRAs, and when to use ultrafiltration. Finally, I should integrate phenotype-specific considerations, cardiorenal syndrome, and a practical algorithm, and close with a concise synthesis and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Volume overload refers to excess total body sodium and water with expansion of extracellular fluid volume, whereas congestion reflects elevated filling pressures and clinical signs; importantly, congestion can occur without frank hypervolemia due to redistribution, so I need to ensure I'm not equating edema with increased intravascular volume by default [^1157qeeV] [^112qJMAh].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to anchor management. Neurohormonal activation of RAAS, SNS, and vasopressin drives sodium and water retention, while structural remodeling alters vascular compliance and capillary dynamics; the "two-circulations" model reminds me that interstitial-lymphatic and intravascular compartments interact variably, so decongestion may not mirror changes in plasma volume, which has implications for monitoring and targets [^1176qVkc] [^114zQo8B] [^114MQqog].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about bedside signs alone. I should confirm congestion with a composite of symptoms and signs (orthopnea, JVP, edema, rales) and objective measures, recognizing that weight change is insensitive early and that natriuretic peptides reflect hemodynamic stress rather than pure volume; urine sodium after diuretic dosing can help gauge natriuretic response and guide escalation, though I need to interpret creatinine changes cautiously in the dynamic phase of decongestion [^112qJMAh] [^1178PUbM] [^115c8MSP] [^112z6NhT].

> Next, I should review first-line therapy and dosing. For acute decompensated HF with fluid overload, prompt intravenous loop diuretics are recommended; if already on oral loop diuretics, an IV dose 1–2.5 times the total daily oral dose is reasonable, with either scheduled boluses every 8–12 hours or continuous infusion, and I should reassess response frequently to titrate toward symptom relief and euvolemia rather than a fixed weight target [^11712kA5] [^113SBt7a] [^114DeRrU].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence on infusion versus bolus. The DOSE trial did not show clear superiority of continuous infusion over bolus for hard outcomes, and a recent Cochrane review suggests only modest, low-certainty differences in weight loss without clear advantages in mortality or AKI; therefore, I should individualize the route based on logistics, response, and tolerability rather than assume infusion is inherently better [^112z6NhT] [^115MJc1J].

> I need to ensure I recognize and manage diuretic resistance early. Diuretic resistance is multifactorial, including impaired delivery to the nephron, post-diuretic sodium retention, and neurohormonal activation; strategies include sodium restriction, optimizing renal perfusion, and sequential nephron blockade, with the strongest new evidence supporting acetazolamide added to loop diuretics to improve decongestion without excess AKI or electrolyte harm in ADVOR [^116BRcXA] [^112RACoH].

> Let me consider adjunctive diuretics carefully. Adding a thiazide-type agent such as metolazone or chlorthalidone to a loop diuretic can overcome distal nephron compensation, but I should monitor closely for hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypotension; MRAs can assist with refractory edema and provide disease-modifying benefit in appropriate phenotypes, though I must balance hyperkalemia risk and renal function [^115vRMwt] [^112hA3jW] [^112iW3Qo].

> But wait, what if natriuresis remains inadequate despite escalation. In truly diuretic-refractory cases, guideline-supported options include ultrafiltration, ideally in patients with persistent congestion and careful attention to hemodynamics and renal function; early fixed-rate UF strategies have shown mixed results, whereas adjustable UF tailored to vitals and renal status may be safer, and I should avoid UF purely for rising creatinine without addressing congestion [^115wpsJi] [^111cVgAY] [^112UEdtg].

> I should double-check phenotype-specific nuances. In HFpEF, loop diuretics remain foundational for congestion, and MRAs have a modest role in selected patients; in HFrEF, red cell mass expansion may contribute to total blood volume, so "optimal" intravascular volume may differ from population norms, arguing for individualized targets rather than rigid normalization of plasma volume [^1172ywQ5] [^112hA3jW] [^1164zRfS].

> Hold on, I should verify how to navigate cardiorenal syndrome during decongestion. Mild, hemodynamic creatinine rises during effective decongestion are often acceptable if congestion improves, whereas persistent congestion at discharge is a stronger predictor of adverse outcomes than transient renal function changes; I need to ensure a discharge plan that maintains decongestion and includes diuretic titration guidance to mitigate early readmissions [^116BxYP3] [^112z6NhT].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Confirm HF diagnosis and congestion before giving diuretics; start IV loop diuretics at 1–2.5 times the oral dose; reassess at 24–48 hours using symptoms, JVP, edema, lung exam, and urine sodium to judge natriuretic response; if inadequate, add acetazolamide or a thiazide; if still refractory, consider UF; throughout, monitor electrolytes, renal function, and blood pressure, and transition to an oral regimen anchored to a "dry weight" with patient education on daily weights and symptom triggers [^1178gcpR] [^114DeRrU] [^115c8MSP] [^114poBeZ].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure my approach treats the patient, not just the edema. Volume overload in HF is a dynamic interplay of intravascular and interstitial compartments driven by neurohormonal activation; effective care couples prompt loop diuretic therapy with objective response monitoring, proactive management of diuretic resistance, judicious use of UF, and phenotype-aware, guideline-concordant decongestion targets to relieve symptoms and reduce recurrent events [^11712kA5] [^1129dhbW] [^112RACoH].

Volume overload is best defined as **excess extracellular fluid** — especially plasma and interstitial compartments — leading to congestion and edema [^114zQo8B]. It is driven by **neurohormonal activation** (RAAS, SNS, AVP) [^1176qVkc] and impaired renal handling, with redistribution from splanchnic to pulmonary circulation worsening symptoms [^1127sRdH]. Clinically, it presents with dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, and elevated JVP; assessment relies on history, exam, and biomarkers (BNP/NT-proBNP), with imaging (CXR, echo) and hemodynamics when needed [^1136cDWr] [^112nhdJJ]. Management centers on **loop diuretics** [^11712kA5], with escalation to thiazides, MRAs, or ultrafiltration for resistance [^115wpsJi]; SGLT2 inhibitors and acetazolamide are emerging adjuncts [^112iW3Qo] [^112RACoH]. Persistent congestion increases readmissions and mortality, so careful monitoring and individualized targets are essential [^116BxYP3] [^112z6NhT].

---

## Pathophysiology

Volume overload arises from **complex interactions** among neurohormonal activation, renal sodium and water retention, and fluid redistribution [^notfound].

- **Neurohormonal activation**: RAAS, SNS, and AVP drive sodium/water retention and vasoconstriction, increasing preload and afterload [^112w61Hg].

- **Renal mechanisms**: Reduced GFR and tubular sodium reabsorption promote fluid retention [^notfound].

- **Fluid redistribution**: Splanchnic venous pooling shifts blood centrally, increasing pulmonary congestion [^1127sRdH].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Volume overload presents with **congestive symptoms and signs**:

| **System** | **Clinical manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Respiratory | Dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, rales, pleural effusions |
| Cardiovascular | Elevated JVP, S3 gallop, cardiomegaly, peripheral edema |
| Gastrointestinal | Hepatomegaly, ascites, gastrointestinal congestion |
| Renal | Worsening renal function, oliguria |
| General | Fatigue, weight gain, exercise intolerance |

---

## Assessment and diagnosis

Accurate assessment requires a **multimodal approach**:

- **Clinical assessment**: History and exam (JVP, edema, rales) [^1136cDWr].

- **Biomarkers**: BNP/NT-proBNP for congestion and HF severity [^111sdVqN].

- **Imaging**: CXR for pulmonary edema, echo for cardiac function/volume [^111sdVqN].

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: PAC or TPT for filling pressures and cardiac output when needed [^112kTRXc].

---

## Management strategies

Management aims to **restore euvolemia**, relieve symptoms, and improve outcomes:

- **Diuretics**: Loop diuretics are first-line; thiazides, MRAs, or acetazolamide may be added for resistance [^11712kA5] [^112RACoH].

- **Ultrafiltration**: For refractory congestion or diuretic resistance [^115wpsJi].

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Emerging adjuncts with natriuretic effects [^112iW3Qo].

- **Monitoring**: Track weight, urine output, electrolytes, and renal function; adjust therapy to avoid over-diuresis [^111MGtVU].

---

## Prognostic implications

Persistent congestion is linked to **higher readmissions and mortality**; early, effective decongestion improves outcomes [^116BxYP3] [^112z6NhT].

---

Volume overload reflects **excess extracellular fluid** from neurohormonal and renal mechanisms, with redistribution worsening congestion. Management centers on diuretics with escalation as needed, and persistent congestion worsens prognosis, so individualized, closely monitored decongestion is critical.

### Fluid volume overload and congestion in heart failure: time to reconsider pathophysiology and how volume is assessed [^1127sRdH]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Volume regulation, assessment, and management remain basic issues in patients with heart failure. The discussion presented here is directed at opening a reassessment of the pathophysiology of congestion in congestive heart failure and the methods by which we determine volume overload status. Peer-reviewed historical and contemporary literatures are reviewed. Volume overload and fluid congestion remain primary issues for patients with chronic heart failure. The pathophysiology is complex, and the simple concept of intravascular fluid accumulation is not adequate. The dynamics of interstitial and intravascular fluid compartment interactions and fluid redistribution from venous splanchnic beds to central pulmonary circulation need to be taken into account in strategies of volume management. Clinical bedside evaluations and right heart hemodynamic assessments can alert clinicians of changes in volume status, but only the quantitative measurement of total blood volume can help identify the heterogeneity in plasma volume and red blood cell mass that are features of volume overload in patients with chronic heart failure and help guide individualized, appropriate therapy-not all volume overload is the same.

### Inpatient management of patients with volume overload and high filling pressures [^111uvW97]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with acute decompensated heart failure are admitted with symptoms of congestion. The classic symptoms of "congestive" heart failure reflect fluid overload, that is, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral edema; these symptoms can be so dramatic that it is not surprising that patients seek hospitalization. Activation of the renin angiotensin system coupled with sympathetic hyperactivity results in marked sodium retention and high filling pressures that ultimately bring about these congestive symptoms. The treatment goal of patients hospitalized with volume overload and high filling pressures is to improve symptoms by normalizing the filling pressure and volume status without worsening renal function. The current use of diuretics, vasodilators, and ultrafiltration, as well as potential future use of investigational agents such as oral vasopressin antagonists and adenosine A1-receptor antagonists, is surrounded by the important issues of when to stop intravenous therapy in hospitalized patients and the exact mechanism by which the filling pressures are normalized. New data from evidence-based clinical trials and optimal strategies for monitoring fluid overload will help define this issue and ultimately reduce mortality in these patients.

### Beyond diuretics: management of volume overload in acute heart failure syndromes [^111r2iY7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Diuretics are an established foundation of therapy for patients with chronic heart failure (HF) as well as for those hospitalized for treatment of acute HF syndromes. Despite the accepted use of diuretics in acute HF syndromes, treatment patterns with diuretics vary widely, and there are no data from randomized studies on the benefit of diuretics on morbidity or mortality in patients hospitalized with acute HF syndromes. Additional pharmacologic therapies that complement or replace diuretics in this setting, especially in patients with diuretic resistance, include positive inotropes, nitrovasodilators, and natriuretic peptides, but data are likewise lacking on important clinical outcomes. Ultrafiltration has also been used as a nonpharmacologic strategy to treat patients with acute HF syndromes who exhibit resistance to diuretics. Effective monitoring of volume status with newer modalities may allow more selective use of diuretics and diuretic-like modalities, but additional randomized trial data are clearly needed to establish ideal strategies to promote volume removal in acute HF syndromes.

### Fluid volume homeostasis in heart failure: a tale of 2 circulations [^114zQo8B]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Fluid volume homeostasis in health and heart failure (HF) requires a complex interaction of 2 systems, the intravascular and interstitial-lymphatic circulations. With the development of HF both the intravascular and interstitial compartments undergo variable degrees of volume remodeling which can include significant expansion. This reflects the impact of multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms on both fluid compartments which initially play a compensatory role to stabilize intravascular circulatory integrity but with progression in HF can evolve to produce the various manifestations of volume overload and clinical HF congestion. The intent of this review is to help enhance recognition of the pathophysiologic and clinical importance of the interlinked roles of these 2 circulatory systems in volume regulation and chronic HF. It would also be hoped that a better understanding of the interacting functions of the intravascular and interstitial-lymphatic fluid compartments can potentially aid development of novel management strategies particularly addressing the generally undertargeted interstitial-lymphatic system and help bring such approaches forward through a more integrated view of these 2 circulatory systems.

Abstract

Fluid volume homeostasis in health and heart failure (HF) requires a complex interaction of 2 systems, the intravascular and interstitial‐lymphatic circulations. With the development of HF both the intravascular and interstitial compartments undergo variable degrees of volume remodeling which can include significant expansion. This reflects the impact of multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms on both fluid compartments which initially play a compensatory role to stabilize intravascular circulatory integrity but with progression in HF can evolve to produce the various manifestations of volume overload and clinical HF congestion. The intent of this review is to help enhance recognition of the pathophysiologic and clinical importance of the interlinked roles of these 2 circulatory systems in volume regulation and chronic HF. It would also be hoped that a better understanding of the interacting functions of the intravascular and interstitial‐lymphatic fluid compartments can potentially aid development of novel management strategies particularly addressing the generally undertargeted interstitial‐lymphatic system and help bring such approaches forward through a more integrated view of these 2 circulatory systems.

### Pathophysiology of volume overload in acute heart failure syndromes [^1176qVkc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The inability to effectively regulate volume status is a major consequence of acute heart failure syndromes (AHFS). A variety of pathophysiologic processes contribute to this impairment, most notably neurohormonal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, arginine vasopressin, and the sympathetic nervous system. As a result, addressing volume overload is one of the most challenging aspects of AHFS management. Neurohormonal activation leads to substantial changes in hemodynamics and myocardial remodeling, which further contribute to the severity of heart failure (HF) disease and thereby cyclically increase the risk of further neurohormonal activation. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is a dependable reflection of volume status and has been used as a surrogate marker in recent studies to assess disease progression in response to innovative HF treatment strategies. Future approaches to HF treatment should focus on the more accurate assessment and management of volume status in an effort to improve patient care.

### The use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion-a position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology [^115RN2Sg]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

The vast majority of acute heart failure episodes are characterized by increasing symptoms and signs of congestion with volume overload. The goal of therapy in those patients is the relief of congestion through achieving a state of euvolaemia, mainly through the use of diuretic therapy. The appropriate use of diuretics however remains challenging, especially when worsening renal function, diuretic resistance and electrolyte disturbances occur. This position paper focuses on the use of diuretics in heart failure with congestion. The manuscript addresses frequently encountered challenges, such as (i) evaluation of congestion and clinical euvolaemia, (ii) assessment of diuretic response/resistance in the treatment of acute heart failure, (iii) an approach towards stepped pharmacologic diuretic strategies, based upon diuretic response, and (iv) management of common electrolyte disturbances. Recommendations are made in line with available guidelines, evidence and expert opinion.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to diuretics, ACEP 2022 guidelines recommend to verify the diagnosis of acute HF syndrome with volume overload before administering diuretics to avoid causing harm in patients with an alternative diagnosis.

In Heart Failure: Congestion Does Not Equal Volume Overload

Most of the current heart failure (HF) prevention or management programs assume that cardiovascular decompensations are primarily driven by volume overload that result in cardiopulmonary congestion. Subsequently, a centerpiece of HF therapies is decongestion of the cardiovascular system. Diuretic drug therapies are known to improve HF symptoms, but more aggressive volume removal strategies such as ultrafiltration have not been proven effective in HF. 1, 2 Current strategies for longitudinal HF management often focus on some form of postdischarge surveillance that targets outpatient weight and volume status trends.

Home or remote monitoring efforts commonly rely on daily weight measurements where an acute change in weight would result in a change in medical therapy. The sensitivity of such weight changes prior to hospitalizations were found to be very low (9%), whereas the specificity of such changes is high (97%). 3 Notably, many patients do not experience a change in weight before a hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). In fact, ≈50% of patients gain an insignificant amount of weight (< 2 pounds or < 2 kg based on the study) in the days preceding a hospitalization. 3, 4 Similarly, in the post‐hoc analysis of the ADHF patients in the ASCEND‐HF trial (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure), 26% of patients showed no weight loss (−1 kg ≤ change < 1 kg) and 8% actually experienced weight gain (≥ 1 kg) during the hospitalization. 5 Importantly, in the evaluation of intracardiac filling pressures in an ambulatory setting, recent studies found that in ADHF, right‐ and left‐sided pressures generally start to increase before any notable weight changes take place preceding an admission (Figure 1). 6, 7 Thus, an increase in right and left heart filling pressures occurs in many cases in the absence of weight gain or total body volume increase. 8, 9 Supportive evidence is provided by body volume analysis using the iodohippurate sodium I 131‐labeled human serum albumin indicator–dilution technique. Using this technology, studies found that patients admitted for HF in many cases (34%) were either normovolemic or hypovolemic 10 with often normal plasma volume. 11 The heterogeneity of clinical presentation suggests the presence of a complementary mechanism to explain increased filling pressures and subsequent ADHF despite a lack of fluid retention. A potential contributing mechanism could be blood volume redistribution between different vascular compartments in the human body. We explore the physiology and rationale for this concept below.

### Combination of loop diuretics with thiazide-type diuretics in heart failure [^115vRMwt]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Volume overload is an important clinical target in heart failure management, typically addressed using loop diuretics. An important and challenging subset of heart failure patients exhibit fluid overload despite significant doses of loop diuretics. One approach to overcome loop diuretic resistance is the addition of a thiazide-type diuretic to produce diuretic synergy via "sequential nephron blockade", first described more than 40 years ago. Although potentially able to induce diuresis in patients otherwise resistant to high doses of loop diuretics, this strategy has not been subjected to large-scale clinical trials to establish safety and clinical efficacy. We summarize the existing literature evaluating the combination of loop and thiazide diuretics in patients with heart failure in order to describe the possible benefits and hazards associated with this therapy. Combination diuretic therapy using any of several thiazide-type diuretics can more than double daily urine sodium excretion to induce weight loss and edema resolution, at the risk of inducing severe hypokalemia in addition to hyponatremia, hypotension, and worsening renal function. We provide considerations about prudent use of this therapy and review potential misconceptions about this long-used diuretic approach. Finally, we seek to highlight the need for pragmatic clinical trials for this commonly used therapy.

Fluid overload management

Diuretic therapy

Diuretics, especially loop diuretics, remain a valid therapeutic alternative for relieving symptoms and improving pathophysiological states of fluid overload such as congestive heart failure and in patients with AKI. At this time, there is no evidence that favors ultrafiltration over diuretic use in volume overload patients with or without AKI in terms of less progression of AKI, improved clinical outcomes or reduce incidence of AKI. Despite that more patients developed AKI during diuretic treatment, numerous studies have demonstrated that more aggressive use of loop diuretics to achieve greater volume removal is associated with improved outcomes (Table 2).

What should be the goal of urine output when using diuretics to manage fluid overload? Some empirical observations have shown that a urine output of 3–4 ml/kg/h rarely causes intravascular volume depletion as capillary refill can meet such rates in almost all patients. Diuretics could be either administered by bolus or using a continuous infusion. There has been controversy about which of these strategies is better; some authors advocate that diuretic infusion is superior to boluses since urinary output could be maintain easily. In one study diuretic infusion was associated with greater diuresis and this was achieved with a lesser dose; infusion was also associated with fewer adverse events such as worsening AKI, hypokalemia, and ototoxicity. However, in the DOSE-AHF(Diuretic Optimization Strategy Evaluation in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) study, authors found that patients with acute heart failure may benefit from an initial bolus strategy.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) — volume overload and diuretic management — states that approximately 70% of patients with ADHF have signs and symptoms of elevated ventricular filling pressures, and that loop diuretics such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide are the mainstay of treatment for volume overload; HF specialists should select the most appropriate agent, dose, and route, recognize the deleterious effects of excessive diuretic use and select the lowest effective dose, and when resistance occurs must reassess the plan, adjust dose, use synergistic diuretics, and initiate therapies that augment cardiac output and renal blood flow, while balancing chronic neurohumoral blockade against hemodynamic derangements during ADHF.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Practical use of beta-blockers — risks of treatment: fluid retention and worsening HF indicates initiation of treatment has produced 4 types of adverse reactions, and initiation of therapy with a beta-blocker can cause fluid retention that is usually asymptomatic and is detected primarily by an increase in body weight but may become sufficiently marked to cause worsening symptoms of HF; physicians should ensure that patients are not volume overloaded before a beta-blocker is initiated, should monitor patients closely for increases in weight and for worsening signs and symptoms of HF, and should augment the dose of diuretic if weight increases whether or not other signs or symptoms of worsening HF are present; the occurrence of fluid retention or worsening HF is not generally a reason for the permanent withdrawal of treatment, as such patients generally respond favorably to intensification of conventional therapy and once treated remain excellent candidates for long-term treatment with a beta-blocker.

Advanced heart failure (HF) — management of fluid status includes that control of fluid retention may require progressive increments in the loop diuretic dose and frequently the addition of a second diuretic that has a complementary mode of action (e.g., metolazone). If volume overload persists despite these measures, hospitalization is generally required for further adjustment of therapy, possibly including intravenous dopamine or dobutamine, and ultrafiltration or hemodialysis may be needed to achieve adequate control of fluid retention; the use of such mechanical methods of fluid removal can produce meaningful clinical benefits and may restore responsiveness to conventional doses of loop diuretics. In general, patients should not be discharged from the hospital until a stable and effective diuretic regimen is established, and ideally, not until euvolemia is achieved, after which the patient's dry weight can guide dose adjustments; many patients are able to modify their own diuretic regimen in response to changes in weight that exceed a predefined range. The restriction of dietary sodium (to 2 g a day or less) can greatly assist in the maintenance of volume balance, and patients with persistent or recurrent fluid retention despite sodium restriction and high-dose diuretic use may benefit from review of fluid intake and restriction to 2 liters daily; the ongoing control of fluid retention may be enhanced by enrollment in an HF program.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^112pE19F]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Several complications like congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, delayed wound healing, tissue breakdown, and impaired bowel function are associated with fluid overload. Fluid overload has also been related to increased mortality. The optimal assessment of volume status in critically ill patients is of vital importance particularly during the early management of these patients. One key aspect of fluid overload management is to maintain hemodynamic stability and optimize organ function. Loop diuretics are frequently used as the initial therapy to treat critically ill patients with fluid overload; nevertheless, diuretics have limited effectiveness due to several factors such as underlying acute kidney injury that contribute to diuretic resistance. Renal replacement therapies are often required for optimal volume management in critically ill patients with fluid overload. In this setting, successful volume management depends on an accurate estimation of patients' fluid status, an adequate understanding of the principles of fluid overload treatment with ultrafiltration, and clear treatment goals.

### Clinical and research considerations for patients with hypertensive acute heart failure: a consensus statement from the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine and the Heart Failure Society of America acute heart failure working group [^116CSkhf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Management approaches for patients in the emergency department (ED) who present with acute heart failure (AHF) have largely focused on intravenous diuretics. Yet, the primary pathophysiologic derangement underlying AHF in many patients is not solely volume overload. Patients with hypertensive AHF (H-AHF) represent a clinical phenotype with distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms that result in elevated ventricular filling pressures. To optimize treatment response and minimize adverse events in this subgroup, we propose that clinical management be tailored to a conceptual model of disease that is based on these mechanisms. This consensus statement reviews the relevant pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, approach to therapy, and considerations for clinical trials in ED patients with H-AHF.

Diuretics in hospitalized patients: decongestion strategy (COR/LOE). COR 1, LOE B-NR states that patients with heart failure (HF) admitted with evidence of significant fluid overload should be promptly treated with intravenous loop diuretics to improve symptoms and reduce morbidity. COR 1, LOE B-NR states that for patients hospitalized with HF, therapy with diuretics and other guideline-directed medications should be titrated with a goal to resolve clinical evidence of congestion to reduce symptoms and rehospitalizations. COR 1, LOE B-NR states that for patients requiring diuretic treatment during hospitalization for HF, the discharge regimen should include a plan for adjustment of diuretics to decrease rehospitalizations. COR 2a, LOE B-NR states that in patients hospitalized with HF when diuresis is inadequate to relieve symptoms and signs of congestion, it is reasonable to intensify the diuretic regimen using either a higher doses of intravenous loop diuretics or b. addition of a second diuretic.

### Diuretics and ultrafiltration in acute decompensated heart failure [^116bdNgE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Congestion and volume overload are the hallmarks of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), and loop diuretics have historically been the cornerstone of treatment. The demonstrated efficacy of loop diuretics in managing congestion is balanced by the recognized limitations of diuretic resistance, neurohormonal activation, and worsening renal function. However, the recently published DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial suggests that previous concerns about the safety of high-dose diuretics may not be valid. There has been a growing interest in alternative strategies to manage volume retention in ADHF with improved efficacy and safety profiles. Peripheral venovenous ultrafiltration (UF) represents a potentially promising approach to volume management in ADHF. Small studies suggest that UF may allow for more effective fluid removal compared with diuretics, with improved quality of life and reduced rehospitalization rates. However, further investigation is needed to completely define the role of UF in patients with ADHF. This review summarizes available data on the use of both diuretics and UF in ADHF patients and identifies challenges and unresolved questions for each approach.

### Prevention and management of chronic heart failure in management of asymptomatic patients [^111sdVqN]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Symptomatic heart failure is preceded by a somewhat prolonged asymptomatic stage in many patients. The number of patients with asymptomatic heart dysfunction is about 4-fold greater than the number of patients with clinically overt heart failure. Pharmacologic treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers (in particular carvedilol) of asymptomatic patients with systolic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction can prevent or delay the occurrence of symptoms and reduce mortality in the long term. Thus, it would be of utmost importance to recognize and appropriately treat these patients before they develop heart failure symptoms. The cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic heart dysfunction in the general population and in cohorts at risk has not been extensively evaluated. A normal electrocardiogram has a high negative predictive value in patients at risk. Echocardiography is the best tool for diagnosis and characterization of heart dysfunction, but extensive use is limited by availability and cost. Natriuretic peptides (brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) are very sensitive markers of heart dysfunction and volume overload, and their measurement has been proposed as a first-line test to select patients who need echocardiography. The definition of the etiology of LV dysfunction — in particular, of the ischemic etiology — has prognostic and therapeutic implications. In addition to revascularization, pharmacologic treatment with antiplatelets and statins is helpful in preventing new ischemic events and the development of heart failure. The prevention, or at least the delay, of clinical manifestations of heart failure is strongly related to an effective approach to the asymptomatic stage. Therefore, it is important to educate the entire medical community, particularly physicians in the primary care setting, about recognition and treatment of these patients.

UNRESPONSIVENESS TO DIURETIC AGENTS IN HEART FAILURE

Diuretic agents remain the cornerstone of therapy for fluid overload. Although effective early in heart failure, diuretic agents become increasingly ineffective with disease progression due to the development of unresponsiveness in a significant subset of patients. Excellent reviews describe the mechanisms leading to decreased diuretic agent responsiveness. In patients with heart failure, impaired absorption, decreased renal blood flow, azotemia, and proteinuria all result in reduced levels of active diuretic agents in the tubular lumen. Recently proposed definitions of diuretic resistance include persistent congestion, despite adequate and escalating doses of diuretic agents equivalent to ≥ 80 mg/day furosemide; the amount of sodium excretion as a percentage of filtered load below 0.2%; and failure to excrete at least 90 mmol of sodium within 72 h of a 160-mg twice-daily dose of furosemide. Metrics for diuretic agent response have also been proposed, including weight loss per 40 mg of furosemide or equivalent; net fluid loss per milligram of loop diuretic agent; and natriuretic response to furosemide as urinary sodium-to-urinary furosemide ratio.

The clinical hallmarks of diuretic agent resistance are insufficient symptom relief, higher risk of in-hospital worsening of heart failure, increased mortality after discharge, and a 3-fold increase in rehospitalization rates. Among more than 50,000 patients enrolled in the ADHERE (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry) study, only 33% lost ≥ 2.27 kg (5 lbs), and 16% gained weight during hospitalization. Nearly one-half of hospitalized patients with heart failure are discharged with residual fluid excess after receiving conventional diuretic therapies. Regardless of diuretic strategy, 42% of acutely decompensated heart failure subjects in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial reached the composite endpoint of death, rehospitalization, or emergency department visit at 60 days. Vasopressin and adenosine-A1 receptor antagonists, exogenous natriuretic peptides, and low-dose dopamine, studied as either a complement or a replacement for conventional diuretic therapies, can decrease fluid overload in the short term but have failed to improve long-term outcomes.

### Fluid overload contributing to heart failure [^112w61Hg]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Background

In advanced heart failure, the compensatory responses to reduced cardiac output, in spite of fluid retention, lead to maladaptive consequences.

Methods

We performed a Medline survey for fluid overload and heart failure as well as reviewing textbook chapters.

Results

The increased sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and antidiuretic hormone stimulation and release lead to a vicious cycle — augmenting pre-load, contractility and after-load, as well as increased fluid overload. The elevated work load on an already failed cardio-circulatory system results in further deterioration. Plasma volume is usually increased in untreated patients with increased extracellular fluid. However, it may range from reduced to increased in treated patients. Currently, diuretics remain the initial first line of therapy. In refractory cases, restoring plasma volume and osmolality, by adding albumin or hypertonic saline solutions, neurohormonal antagonists such as vasopressin receptors antagonists, aldosterone antagonists, or administration of nesiritide, may help in overcoming fluid overload.

Conclusion

Exact measurement of plasma volume in various forms of heart failure and adjusting the treatment accordingly, establishing favourable and detrimental effects of various therapies, and introducing additional and new therapeutic options require further investigation.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^112iW3Qo]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Volume overload represents a hallmark clinical feature linked to the development and progression of heart failure (HF). Alleviating signs and symptoms of volume overload represents a foundational HF treatment target that is achieved using loop diuretics in the acute and chronic setting. Recent work has provided evidence to support guideline-directed medical therapies, such as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists, as important adjunct diuretics that may act synergistically when used with background loop diuretics in people with chronic HF. Furthermore, there is growing interest in understanding the role of SGLT2 inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and MR antagonists in treating volume overload in patients hospitalized for acute HF, particularly in the setting of loop diuretic resistance. Thus, the current review demonstrates that: (i) SGLT2 inhibitors and MR antagonists confer long-term cardioprotection in chronic HF patients but it is unclear whether natriuresis or diuresis represents the primary mechanisms for this benefit, (ii) SGLT2 inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and thiazide diuretics increase natriuresis in the acute HF setting, but implications on long-term outcomes remain unclear and warrants further investigation, and (iii) a multi-nephron segment approach, using agents that act on distinct segments of the nephron, potentiate diuresis to alleviate signs and symptoms of volume overload in acute HF.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — diuretic therapy management and risks: Electrolyte imbalances should be treated aggressively and the diuresis continued, and if hypotension or azotemia occurs the physician may elect to slow the rapidity of diuresis, but diuresis should nevertheless be maintained until fluid retention is eliminated, even if this strategy results in mild or moderate decreases in blood pressure or renal function, as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Once fluid retention has resolved, treatment with the diuretic should be maintained to prevent the recurrence of volume overload, with dose adjustment often accomplished by having patients record their weight each day and make changes in their diuretic dosage if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range. Patients may become unresponsive to high doses if they consume large amounts of dietary sodium, are taking agents that can block the effects of diuretics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including cyclo- oxygenase-2 inhibitors), or have a significant impairment of renal function or perfusion, but diuretic resistance can generally be overcome by the intravenous administration of diuretics (including the use of continuous infusions), the use of 2 or more diuretics in combination (e.g., furosemide and metolazone), or the use of diuretics together with drugs that increase renal blood flow (e.g., positive inotropic agents). Diuretics can cause the depletion of potassium and magnesium and can predispose patients to serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of digitalis therapy, and the risk of electrolyte depletion is markedly enhanced when 2 diuretics are used in combination; concomitant administration of ACEIs alone or in combination with potassium-retaining agents (such as spironolactone) can prevent electrolyte depletion in most patients with HF who are taking a loop diuretic, and when these drugs are prescribed, long-term oral potassium supplementation is generally not needed and may be deleterious. Excessive use of diuretics can decrease blood pressure and impair renal function and exercise tolerance; if there are no signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia are likely to be related to volume depletion and may resolve after a reduction in diuretic dose, whereas the signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia, are likely to reflect worsening HF and a decline in effective peripheral perfusion, which is an ominous clinical scenario and necessitates considering the measures discussed under Stage D HF.

### Extracorporeal ultrafiltration for fluid Overload in heart failure: current status and prospects for further research [^116bUPnG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Fluid excess drives most heart failure hospitalizations. Recurrent hospitalizations are common and predict unfavorable outcomes. As heart failure progresses, a significant proportion of patients develop an inadequate response to diuretic agent therapy. Additional approaches, such as sequential nephronal blockade with thiazide diuretic agents or high-dose aldosterone antagonists, have not been appropriately validated. Other pharmacological therapies have not improved the outcomes of patients with heart failure who have fluid overload. Ultrafiltration is an attractive alternative therapy because it predictably removes total body sodium. In future studies, UF should be adjusted according to the patient's hemodynamic and renal profiles; and patient selection, fluid removal amount, duration, and rate should be guided by objective, complementary, and informative measurements of fluid overload and kidney function (Central Illustration). The urgency of these investigations is underscored by the alarming prognostic and economic implications of recurrent heart failure hospitalizations, which remain unacceptably high with conventional pharmacological therapies.

INTERMACS profiles — advanced heart failure severity classification (Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support) defines seven clinical profiles with characteristic features: Critical cardiogenic shock is characterized by life-threatening hypotension with rapidly escalating inotropic/pressor support and critical organ hypoperfusion often confirmed by worsening acidosis and lactate; progressive decline describes patients "dependent" on inotropes with continuing deterioration or refractory volume overload when inotropes cannot be maintained because of tachyarrhythmias, clinical ischemia, or other intolerance; stable but inotrope dependent indicates clinical stability on mild–moderate intravenous inotropes or temporary circulatory support with repeated failure to wean; resting symptoms on oral therapy at home includes frequent congestion at rest or with activities of daily living with possible orthopnea, gastrointestinal symptoms, disabling ascites, or severe lower extremity edema; exertion intolerant patients are comfortable at rest but unable to engage in any activity and are housebound; exertion limited patients are comfortable at rest without fluid overload and can perform minor activities outside the home but develop fatigue within a few minutes or with any meaningful physical exertion; advanced NYHA class III patients are clinically stable with a reasonable level of comfortable activity, usually able to walk more than a block, but any decompensation requiring intravenous diuretics or hospitalization within the previous month should be classified lower. Modifier options include recurrent decompensations for Profiles 3 to 6 defined by frequent emergency department visits or hospitalizations (generally at least 2 in past 3 mo or 3 in past 6 mo) for intravenous diuresis, ultrafiltration, or brief inotropic therapy; if a Profile 7 patient meets these criteria, the patient should be moved to Profile 6 or worse; additional modifiers include recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias (eg, frequent ICD shocks or external defibrillation, usually more than twice weekly) or temporary circulatory support for hospitalized patients Profiles 1 to 3.

### Intravenous diuretic therapy for the management of heart failure and volume overload in a multidisciplinary outpatient unit [^111CpfZX]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous (IV) diuretic treatment for volume management in heart failure (HF).

Background

Limited data exist regarding IV diuretics for the outpatient treatment of volume overload in HF patients.

Methods

We analyzed 60 consecutive patients with chronic HF and clinical evidence of worsening congestion who received a bolus and 3-h IV infusion of furosemide at an outpatient HF clinic. Diuretic dosing was derived from the maintenance oral loop diuretic dose with a standardized conversion algorithm. Outcomes included urine output during the visit, weight loss at 24 h, and hospitalization and mortality at 30 days. Safety outcomes included hypokalemia and worsening of renal function. Outcomes were analyzed across subgroups defined by maintenance diuretic dose and ejection fraction (EF).

Results

The median age of the cohort was 70 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 58 to 80 years), and the median daily loop diuretic dose was 240 mg (IQR: 80 to 800 mg) oral furosemide or equivalent. Twenty-six patients (43.3%) were women, and 36 (60%) had an EF ≤ 45%. For the entire cohort, the median urine output and 24-h weight loss were 1.1 l (IQR: 0.6 to 1.4 l) and 1.1 kg (IQR: 0.2 to 1.9 kg), respectively. Outcomes were similar across patients with varying maintenance diuretic doses (< 40 mg, 40 to 160 mg, 160 to 300 mg, or > 300 mg of furosemide or equivalent) and in patients with reduced or preserved EF. Transient worsening of renal function and hypokalemia occurred in 10 patients (8.9%) and 4 patients (3.5%). Although hospitalization was reported as imminent for 28 patients (52.8%), the observed rate of all-cause hospitalization was 31.7% at 30 days with no deaths.

Conclusions

Short courses of IV diuretics for volume management in patients with HF were safe and associated with significant urine output and weight loss across a wide range of maintenance diuretic doses and EF. This strategy may provide an alternative to hospitalization for the management of selected HF patients.

### Hyponatremia in heart failure: revisiting pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies [^112UGAbo]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently encountered in patients with heart failure (HF), and its association with adverse outcomes is well-established in this population. While hyponatremia is an independent marker for severity of HF, it is not certain whether it has a causal impact on the progression of the disease. There are no universally accepted consensus guidelines regarding therapeutic strategies for HF-associated hyponatremia and volume overload; current societal guidelines do not address management of this complication. Whereas thiazide diuretics are known to induce or worsen hyponatremia in this setting through a number of mechanisms, loop diuretics can be considered a readily available first-line pharmacologic therapy. Consistent with pathophysiology of the disease and mechanisms of action of loop diuretics, available clinical evidence supports such an approach provided that patients can be closely monitored. Use of vasopressin receptor antagonists is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this setting, and the efficacy of these agents has so far been shown in a number of clinical studies. These agents can be reserved for patients with HF in whom initial appropriate loop diuretic therapy fails to improve serum sodium levels.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116BxYP3]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Hospitalization for heart failure (HF) — hospitalization is a sentinel event that signals worse prognosis and the need to restore hemodynamic compensation but also provides key opportunities to redirect the disease trajectory. During the HF hospitalization, the approach to management should include and address precipitating factors, comorbidities, and previous limitations to ongoing disease management related to social determinants of health, and patients require assessment and management of ischemia, arrhythmia, and other precipitating factors and comorbidities. The presenting profile, reversible factors, appropriate work-up for cause of HF including ischemic and nonischemic causes, comorbidities, disease trajectory, and goals of care should be addressed. Establishment of optimal volume status is a major goal, and patients with residual congestion merit careful consideration for further intervention before and after discharge, because they face higher risk for rehospitalization and death. The disease trajectory for patients hospitalized with reduced EF is markedly improved by optimization of recommended medical therapies, which should be initiated or increased toward target doses once the efficacy of diuresis has been shown.

### Fluid volume homeostasis in heart failure: a tale of 2 circulations [^1163Gsqt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCEPT OF OPTIMAL VOLUME IN HEART FAILURE

This leads to the fundamental question of what is the "optimal" volume state in HF, and what constitutes the most favorable intravascular volume and interstitial volume profiles in the context of chronic HF and do these profiles impact clinical outcomes? We know that a "normal" BV in healthy state is going to differ from individual to individual by age, sex, body size, and body composition, and then also potentially by disease state. Basically, however, an optimal volume should refer to an effective circulating BV that supports appropriate oxygen carrying capacity and provides adequate tissue perfusion pressure to supply nutrients and remove metabolic waste and carbon dioxide and the most favorable clinical state possible. An effective circulation, therefore, requires the best fit of BV to the capacity of the vasculature where cardiac preload and cardiac output are appropriate to the hemodynamic and metabolic demands of the individual. Too little BV and pump function fails (mismatch of volume and capacity) too much and the heart fails from acute volume overload and congestion. So, what the intravascular circulatory system needs is the best ratio of BV to vascular capacity under the circumstances it is dealing with, such as the limits of cardiac output and arterial underfilling of HF. The relationship of BV to vascular capacity (arterial and venous) therefore establishes the hemodynamics (perfusion pressures) in relation to myocardial pump function to maintain integrity of the circulatory system and in turn help maintain survival. This also requires concert with an optimal interstitial volume to support the intravascular space. Recently reported quantitative volume data indicated that a persistent expansion in BV (> +25% of normal volume) in a cohort of patients with compensated chronic HF was independently associated with better survival and fewer HF rehospitalizations relative to patients who maintained a normal (nonexpanded) intravascular volume. These findings, while still formative, suggest that the concept of managing intravascular volume to a conventionally considered "normal BV" state in patients with chronic HF may have different and detrimental clinical ramifications pathophysiologically than permitting optimal BV expansion.

Patients with acute decompensated heart failure are usually critically ill and require immediate treatment. However, most are not volume overloaded. Emergency department (ED) management is based on rapid initiation of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation and aggressive titration of nitrates. Afterload reduction with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor can be considered. A diuretic should not be administered before optimal preload and afterload reduction has been achieved. Short-term inotropic therapy can be considered in select patients with cardiogenic shock and acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) who fail to respond to standard therapy.

### Diuretics in States of volume overload: core curriculum 2022 [^1157qeeV]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Volume overload, defined as excess total body sodium and water with expansion of extracellular fluid volume, characterizes common disorders such as congestive heart failure, end-stage liver disease, chronic kidney disease, and nephrotic syndrome. Diuretics are the cornerstone of therapy for volume overload and comprise several classes whose mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, indications, and adverse effects are essential principles of nephrology. Loop diuretics are typically the first-line treatment in the management of hypervolemia, with additional drug classes indicated in cases of diuretic resistance and electrolyte or acid-base disorders. Separately, clinical trials highlight improved outcomes in some states of volume overload, such as loop diuretics and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure. Resistance to diuretics is a frequent, multifactorial clinical challenge that requires creative and physiology-based solutions. In this installment of AJKD's Core Curriculum in Nephrology, we discuss the pharmacology and therapeutic use of diuretics in states of volume overload and strategies to overcome diuretic resistance.

### Myocellular and interstitial edema and circulating volume expansion as a cause of morbidity and mortality in heart failure [^111Ue6ff]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Total body sodium and volume overload are the hallmarks of the congested state in the heart failure patient and result in a variety of deleterious pathophysiologic outcomes including ventricular chamber dilation, passive congestion of both encapsulated and nonencapsulated vital organs and myocardial edema and ischemia.

Methods and Results

We propose that congestion is itself a disease state irrespective of the underlying cardiac or renal dysfunction and that sodium and volume overload are directly related to poor clinical outcomes in such patients. In this model, the target of decongestion therapy should be normalization of total body sodium and volume in an expeditious manner and with a durable result.

Conclusions

Additionally, novel tools to continuously measure the effectiveness and adequacy of decongestion therapy in all compartments are required if improved clinical outcomes are to be attained.

Figure 11 — Management of acute right-sided heart failure (RHF) emphasizes hemodynamic assessment and sets specific targets and actions: Preload Optimization (RAP/CVP ≤ 12 mmHg) and Maintenance of perfusion (MAP ≥ 65). In volume depletion, careful fluid resuscitation is advised with NS 500–1000 mL IV bolus, and if volume overload persists with diuretic resistance, CVVH or UF for removing volume overload with diuretic resistance can be used. All management must be undertaken with an awareness of the patient's hemodynamic status, and if this status is not clear clinically, then invasive assessment/monitoring should be undertaken, with hemodynamic targets providing rough guidelines for tailored therapy.

### Fluid volume homeostasis in heart failure: a tale of 2 circulations [^1164zRfS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

While needing further study, the concept that a persistence in BV expansion may serve a compensatory role in maintaining circulatory integrity in chronic HF has physiologic merit. This, however, does contrast with the current generally followed clinical paradigm of maintaining or treating to what would be considered a "normal" intravascular volume in all patients with HF. An excess in RBC mass in addition to PV expansion appears to be a significant contributor to BV expansion and the development of RBC polycythemia would not be an unexpected physiologic compensatory response to maintain adequate oxygen carrying capacity to tissues in patients with HF. The concept of intravascular volume expansion as an element of compensation HF and a basis for better clinical outcomes has physiologic merit warranting further study to put understanding of volume homeostasis in HF in a necessary clinical context. Further, recognizing that biologic variability also exists in many systems, the physiologic variability in intravascular volume responses to HF should not be unexpected. Whether the identification of different volume phenotypes in HF can help guide more targeted and individualized patient management strategies is a next step for investigation. The methodology now clinically available to measure intravascular volume in the different stages of HF can help address this issue.

Additionally, and importantly, a better functional understanding of the contribution and limitations of the interstitial‐lymphatic circulation and how this system relates to the maintenance of intravascular volume in HF is needed. Clinically feasible methods of intervening on the interstitial compartment and lymphatic system as adjunct approaches to optimize the management of clinical congestion are needed. Preclinical and clinical studies in the 1960s investigated thoracic duct cannulation and the construction of lymphovenous shunts to reduce venous pressure and improve volume overload congestion; however, while such studies provided valuable information these interventions have not advanced to the clinical arena. At this point there is not a clinically feasible technique to directly measure interstitial volume, but such methodology is evolving and will likely become a clinical tool allowing more complete evaluation of volume status in patients with HF. Current methodology, however, does permit direct quantitative measurement of intravascular volume by a clinically useful and time‐efficient technique. More expansive clinical implementation of such methods will help identify distinct volume phenotypes and potentially guide more effective and individualized fluid volume management strategies.

### Hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure: recognition, risk stratification, and treatment review [^112nhdJJ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) has emerged as a major healthcare problem. It causes approximately 3% of all hospitalizations in the United States, with the direct medical cost of these hospitalizations estimated at $18.8 billion per year. Early recognition, risk stratification, and evidence-based treatment are crucial in reducing the morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with this disorder. Classic signs and symptoms of ADHF, such as rales, dyspnea, and peripheral edema, may be absent at hospital presentation and, even when present, are not specific to this disorder. As a result, serum B-type natriuretic peptide level is now used to rapidly and accurately detect ADHF. Multivariate analyses have identified renal dysfunction, hypotension, advanced age, hyponatremia, and comorbidities as significant and independent mortality risk factors. Based on these factors, mortality risk can be stratified from very low to very high using published algorithms that have been validated in independent populations. Evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of ADHF are available from both the European Society of Cardiology and the Heart Failure Society of America. In general, an intravenous loop diuretic, either alone or in combination with a vasodilator, is recommended as initial therapy in patients with volume overload, depending on the patient's clinical status. Use of inotropic agents should be limited to the small subset of patients with low-output syndrome and significant hypotension. In any event, frequent monitoring of clinical response is essential, with subsequent therapy determined by this response. Finally, focused patient education during hospitalization may help reduce readmissions for ADHF.

Clinical practice and patients' perspectives

Reactions to symptoms need to be adapted to the individual patient. Due to changes in the patients' condition (either HF related to other reasons) the medication regimen might need to be changed (see part on side effects and medication), physical activity level and exercise training decreased, or a (temporary) change in their sodium or fluid intake needed.

Furthermore, diuretic therapy is used to treat signs and/or symptoms of congestion.

The goal of diuretic therapy is to achieve and maintain euvolaemia with the lowest achievable dose. However, clinical assessment of euvolaemia may be difficult and many patients remain congested despite increase in HF therapy. 119 The dose of the diuretic must be adjusted according to individual needs over time. A patient‐directed flexible diuretic dosing schedule based on personalized variation in fluid‐related signs and symptoms is safe in patients with chronic HF. Some patients and families might not feel comfortable making decisions to change medications or lifestyle and need support from the health care providers.

Professional attitudes and behaviour
Provide individualized information to support self‐care management to patients and caregivers. Patients may adjust diuretic therapy and/or alert their health care team in case of increasing signs and symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, oedema, hypotension), or a sudden unexpected weight gain of > 2 kg in 3 days as a rule of thumb; however, this may need to be tailored to the individual patient.
In selected euvolaemic/hypovolaemic patients, the use of a diuretic drug might be (temporarily) discontinued.
In patients with severe generalized congestion, especially in those with gut oedema, the effect of oral furosemide may be altered due to inadequate gastro‐intestinal absorption. A change in diuretics or a switch to intravenous furosemide is recommended in order to increase diuresis, reduce generalized congestion and gut oedema and re‐establish gastro‐intestinal absorption for oral diuretics.
Renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors and diuretic therapy continued during acute hypovolaemic illness significantly increase the risk of acute kidney injury and/or hyperkalaemia. One or more of these agents may need to be temporarily stopped or its dose reduced during illness. Particularly the diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists migth need to be reduced/temporarily stopped (early).

### Fluid volume homeostasis in heart failure: a tale of 2 circulations [^114MQqog]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of treatment of congestion is commonly based on improvement in symptoms and objective clinical assessment. Change in body weight is a common metric used to assess adequacy of decongestive diuretic therapy. However, while weight loss can reflect clinical decongestion and symptomatic improvement, this metric is not consistently associated with improved survival or fewer hospitalizations. The findings of clinical studies linking diuresis‐related weight loss to decongestion and outcomes such as HF‐related mortality or re‐hospitalizations are mixed. As observed clinically large volume diuresis (multiple liters) can occur promptly (within the first 24 hours) with intravenous diuretic therapy in volume overload patients with decompensated HF which helps recover clinical compensation and symptom improvement, but not necessarily prevent recurrence in follow‐up evaluations. This may in part reflect the observation that fluid loss associated with diuresis‐related weight decrease does not have a substantial net impact on intravascular volume, but rather is primarily a reflection of the transvascular transport pathways that function primarily to reduce interstitial compartment fluid excess. The decongestion of the interstitial compartment thus likely has a lesser impact on determining outcomes relative to the impact of intravascular volume status. Somewhat contrary to clinical expectations, this suggests that there is an importance in distinguishing fluid overload congestion of the interstitial compartment and the contribution of the lymphatic system from that of the intravascular space where volume expansion of the latter may have a separate compensatory role in chronic HF. Thus, discordance between weight loss associated with clinical decongestion and actual intravascular volume status may in part explain outcome disparities observed in clinical studies. Data supporting a greater degree of weight loss as a common metric of clinical decongestion do not necessarily translate into better HF‐related outcomes. Such discordance, however, is not a consistently reported finding with some studies supporting while others failing to demonstrate an association among surrogate markers such as composite scores, signs and symptoms, hemodynamics, or biomarkers of decongestion with clinical outcomes. Further, observational data demonstrate that changes in diuresis‐related weight loss do not bear a significant relationship to changes in intravascular volume. A basis for this observation is that the decrease in weight reflects the predominant draining of fluid from the interstitial compartment while the intravascular PV state is maintained with minimal change in volume. Also, patient‐to‐patient variability in intravascular volume profiles (greater or lesser expansion) appears to have a limited association to the extent of interstitial volume reduction in response to diuretic therapy. Therefore, diuresis‐related changes in body weight reflect significant decreases in interstitial volume which are often observed clinically to be associated with rapid decongestion and symptom relief but not with significant admission to discharge changes in PV even if large PV expansion is present at hospital admission (Figure 3). A plausible hypothesis would be that the volume status of the intravascular compartment, particularly the integrity of the arterial circulation, is more a driver of clinical outcomes than even large changes in interstitial compartment volume.

### We should avoid the term "fluid overload" [^112rwhUW]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Even when the capillaries are intact, an abrupt increase in hydrostatic pressures, related, for example, to acute heart failure or an acute adrenergic discharge, can result in edema formation stemming from fluid extravasation from the intravascular compartment into the interstitium. More than 40 years ago, Da Luz and co-workers measured plasma volume under these conditions and showed that it is typically reduced. Since then, a prudent fluid challenge has become part of the standard management of cardiogenic shock, because although hypervolemia is always associated with edema, edema can be associated with an increased, a normal, or a decreased blood volume and administering fluid can be harmful or beneficial depending on the underlying cause.

Based on this construction, it should be clear that fluid overload is a poorly-defined term, often confused with hypervolemia, but not synonymous. If, as is often the case, the term is used based solely on the presence of edema, errors in management may occur, with fluids being withheld or diuretics administered just because the edema is assumed to indicate the presence of excess fluid. It is important to remember that once patients become stable following initial management for acute circulatory insufficiency, diuretics should be administered to aid in fluid removal, but only when there is actual hypervolemia. For those who have needed resuscitation, this should be limited to the stabilization or the de-escalation phase.

In summary, the terms hypervolemia and fluid overload are often used interchangeably, yet they do not have the same meaning. "Fluid overload" may vaguely refer to excess total body water content associated with edema, but within medical circles it would be better if the term were avoided completely. The word "hypervolemia" is sufficient to indicate an excess in circulating blood volume and, if present, needs to be properly documented before a strategy of fluid restriction and/or diuretics is applied.

### Exploring safety of down-titrating diuretics in heart failure management [^112ZFHAM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical assessment of fluid status is challenging, and signs and symptoms often occur late. Thus, haemodynamic assessment may identify the need of patients for safe and effective changes in diuretic therapy, although this was not the specific aim of these trials. Also, various biomarkers have been proposed to assess congestion, as well as imaging toolsand the use of artificial intelligence. However, there is not sufficient evidence currently that diuretic therapy guidance using these tools may improve outcomes. Our data highlight the need for such specific trials and suggest significant room for improvement in the management of HF patients regarding diuretic therapy.

This study has several limitations that need to be mentioned. Firstly and most importantly, this was a post‐hoc analysis and patients were not randomized to down‐titration versus stable diuretic therapy. Therefore, our results are hypothesis‐generating only. Secondly, a major limitation of our work is the lack of other HF medication usage and dosage of patients during the trial. These can strongly affect the stability of HF patients and influence the decision‐making of clinicians with regard to diuretics. Thirdly, the exact volume status was not known at the time of dose change if done outside of study visits, nor is the application of fluid or salt restriction known for patients. This is of particular importance in the case of renal dysfunction, which may be related to different reasons including both dehydration and volume overload. Also, hypotension may be caused by dehydration or worsening of HF. Thus, it cannot be excluded that down‐titration was done despite volume overload in some cases. Nevertheless, the availability of information on why diuretic doses were changed is a major strength of our study.

### Protocolized natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy in acute heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115c8MSP]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart failure (AHF) is one of the leading causes of hospitalization worldwide. Volume overload plays an important role in these admissions, being the primary cause of a patients signs and symptoms. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines classify the use of loop diuretics in the acute and chronic management of congestion as class 1 A of recommendation. However, the optimal dose and monitoring strategy of loop diuretics to maximize diuresis in AHF remain controversial.

Traditional but imprecise methods of monitoring diuresis, such as weight changes, may overestimate fluid loss, leading to residual volume overload. This has been associated with increased rehospitalization and mortality rates among heart failure (HF) patients. A recent ESC consensus statement highlights that the primary goal of therapy in AHF is to achieve complete decongestion and restore euvolemic state. In this context, urinary sodium measurement has emerged as a potential tool to optimize diuretic therapy, especially within the first 24 h. ESC proposed measurement of urinary sodium two hours after the initial diuretic dose, with a result > 50 mmol indicating an effective dose of loop diuretics.

Most evidence supporting the use of urinary sodium to guide diuresis comes from non-randomized studies or small randomized controlled trials (RCTs), lacking sufficient power to establish definitive clinical benefits. Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of natriuresis-guided diuretic therapy compared to standard management in patients with AHF.

### Proximal versus distal diuretics in congestive heart failure [^112LrgsS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The retention of sodium and water and consequential fluid accumulation in the extracellular compartment is a cardinal feature of heart failure (HF), irrespective of the left ventricular ejection fraction. The expansion of the extracellular volume, manifesting as volume overload, represents a leading cause for HF hospitalization, with severity of volume overload associated with adverse HF outcomes. Alleviating volume expansion through the use of loop diuretics is a cornerstone of HF treatment. However, achieving decongestion represents a longstanding challenge due to multiple physiological adaptations that favour the retention of sodium, with persistent fluid overload despite increasing diuretic dosing (i.e. diuretic resistance) representing a cardinal sign of worsening HF. Indeed, low urine output in response to loop diuretics or the need for repeated short-term intravenous administration of loop diuretics, are both associated with mortality in the acute HF setting. Furthermore, high diuretic dose requirements or dose escalation in the chronic HF setting are associated with hospitalization.

Accordingly, there is growing interest in understanding the diuretic and natriuretic properties of contemporary medical therapies such as sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists, and their roles in managing volume overload in HF, especially as adjuncts to loop diuretic therapy. The current review aims to summarize existing physiological and clinical evidence on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, CA inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and MR antagonists in managing HF and their role as adjunctive diuretic agents in the acute and chronic setting.

Proximal tubular diuretics

Under normal physiological conditions, the proximal tubule is responsible for two-thirds of sodium reabsorption, principally mediated through the sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform-3 (NHE3) and the sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) (Fig. 1). Neurohormonal activation, including increased plasma levels of norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and vasopressin, characterizes an early physiological manifestation contributing to sodium and bicarbonate (HCO 3) retention in HF by upregulating SGLT2, Na-HCO 3, and NHE3 activity in the proximal tubule. Importantly, increased proximal tubular reabsorption leads to decreased downstream sodium delivery thereby influencing the effectiveness of loop diuretics.

### Extracorporeal ultrafiltration for fluid Overload in heart failure: current status and prospects for further research [^112UEdtg]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

More than 1 million heart failure hospitalizations occur annually, and congestion is the predominant cause. Rehospitalizations for recurrent congestion portend poor outcomes independently of age and renal function. Persistent congestion trumps serum creatinine increases in predicting adverse heart failure outcomes. No decongestive pharmacological therapy has reduced these harmful consequences. Simplified ultrafiltration devices permit fluid removal in lower-acuity hospital settings, but with conflicting results regarding safety and efficacy. Ultrafiltration performed at fixed rates after onset of therapy-induced increased serum creatinine was not superior to standard care and resulted in more complications. In contrast, compared with diuretic agents, some data suggest that adjustment of ultrafiltration rates to patients' vital signs and renal function may be associated with more effective decongestion and fewer heart failure events. Essential aspects of ultrafiltration remain poorly defined. Further research is urgently needed, given the burden of congestion and data suggesting sustained benefits of early and adjustable ultrafiltration.

### American college of cardiology / American Heart Association chronic heart failure evaluation and management guidelines: relevance to the geriatric practice [^115yovp1]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with increasing incidence and prevalence. Most HF patients are older adults. With the aging of the population and effective treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease, the two major underlying causes of HF, the number of older Americans with HF is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades. HF is the number one hospital discharge diagnosis for older adults. It is one of the causes of frequent hospital readmissions, reflecting acute decompensation and compromised quality of life for patients and increased cost and resource use for the healthcare system. It is also associated with approximately 300,000 deaths annually, most in older adults. Advances in the management of HF in the past several decades have significantly decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with this condition. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and spironolactone on survival and quality of life of HF patients, but there is evidence of underuse of evidence-based care for HF. Several national guidelines have been published since 1994 that recommended evidence-based evaluation and management of HF. In 1995, the American College of Cardiologists (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) published their first HF guidelines that recommended left ventricular (LV) function evaluation for all patients presenting with HF and use of ACE inhibitors for all patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) unless contraindicated. The guidelines recommended the use of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate in patients who could not use ACE inhibitors. In addition, digoxin was recommended in patients with HF due to LVSD but not adequately responsive to ACE inhibitors and diuretics and in those with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular rates. Diuretic use was recommended for symptomatic patients with evidence of fluid overload. Use of anticoagulation was restricted to patients with atrial fibrillation or to those with a history of systemic or pulmonary embolism. Beta-blockers were reserved for HF patients after acute myocardial infarctions. Recent advances in the management of HF called for a revision of the guidelines.

Purpose

The purpose of revising the 1995 ACC/AHA guidelines was to incorporate recent advances in pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches to HF treatment and to assist physicians in clinical decision-making in the management of HF.

Methods

The ACC/AHA invited representatives from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Heart Failure Society of America, the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine to participate in the preparation of the guidelines. The writing committee searched pertinent medical literature in English using computerized databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and manually searching the bibliographies of the selected articles. The writing committee classified HF into four stages, including patients who are at high risk for developing HF. According to this new classification, Stage A and B represent asymptomatic patients, the former at high risk for developing HF but no structural disorder, the latter with structural disorders of the heart. Stage C encompasses patients with underlying structural heart disorders who are symptomatic, either currently or in the past. Stage D includes end-stage HF patients. This new classification is intended to complement the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of HF into Class I (asymptomatic), Class II (symptomatic on less than ordinary exertion), Class III (symptomatic on ordinary exertion), and Class IV (symptomatic at rest).

Results

The recommendations are categorized into those for evaluation and management.

### Decongestive treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: cardiorenal implications of ultrafiltration and diuretics [^116CqBdi]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), treatment aimed at adequate decongestion of the volume overloaded state is essential. Despite diuretic therapy, many patients remain volume overloaded and symptomatic. In addition, adverse effects related to diuretic treatment are common, including worsening kidney function and electrolyte disturbances. The development of decreased kidney function during treatment affects the response to diuretic therapy and is associated with important clinical outcomes, including mortality. The occurrence of diuretic resistance and the morbidity and mortality associated with diuretic therapy has stimulated interest to develop effective and safe treatment strategies that maximize decongestion and minimize decreased kidney function. During the last few decades, extracorporeal ultrafiltration has been used to remove fluid from diuretic-refractory hypervolemic patients. Recent clinical studies using user-friendly machines have suggested that ultrafiltration may be highly effective for decongesting patients with ADHF. Many questions remain regarding the comparative impact of diuretics and ultrafiltration on important clinical outcomes and adverse effects, including decreased kidney function. This article serves as a summary of key clinical studies addressing these points. The overall goal is to assist practicing clinicians who are contemplating the use of ultrafiltration for a patient with ADHF.

### Rationale and design of the DECONGEST (diuretic treatment in acute heart failure with volume overload guided by serial spot urine sodium assessment) study [^114wKwxZ]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate whether early-combination diuretic therapy guided by serial post-diuretic urine sodium concentration (UNa +) assessments in acute heart failure (AHF) facilitates safe and effective decongestion.

Methods

The Diuretic Treatment in Acute Heart Failure with Volume Overload Guided by Serial Spot Urine Sodium Assessment (DECONGEST) study is a pragmatic, 2-center, randomized, parallel-arm, open-label study aiming to enroll 104 patients with AHF and clinically evident fluid overload requiring treatment with intravenous loop diuretics. Patients are randomized to receive standard of care or a bundled approach comprising: (1) systematic post-diuretic UNa + assessments until successful decongestion, defined as no remaining clinical signs of fluid overload with a post-diuretic UNa + ≤ 80 mmol/L; (2) thrice-daily intravenous loop diuretic bolus therapy, with dosing according to estimated glomerular filtration rate; (3) upfront use of intravenous acetazolamide (500 mg once daily [OD]); and (4) full nephron blockade with high-dose oral chlorthalidone (100 mg OD) and intravenous canreonate (200 mg OD) for diuretic resistance, defined as persisting signs of fluid overload with a post-diuretic UNa + ≤ 80 mmol/L. The primary endpoint of the DECONGEST study is a hierarchical composite of (1) survival at 30 days; (2) days alive and out of hospital or care facility up to 30 days; and (3) greater relative decrease in natriuretic peptide levels from baseline to day 30.

Conclusion

The DECONGEST study aims to determine whether an intensive diuretic regimen focused on early combination therapy, guided by serial post-diuretic UNa+ assessments, safely enhances decongestion, warranting further evaluation in a larger trial powered for clinical events.

### Diuretic use in heart failure and outcomes [^114bCPiq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Diuretics are frequently administered to relieve congestive symptoms in patients with heart failure (HF). Despite their widespread use, prospective data on the potential of diuretics to modulate HF-related morbidity and mortality are scarce. Diuretic efficacy may be limited by adverse neurohormonal activation and by "congestion-like" symptoms that may occur in the absence of fluid overload. Herein, we review the current knowledge on diuretic use and outcomes in HF.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^111Xaw8j]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The ultimate goal is to preserve tissue perfusion, optimizing fluid balance by effectively removing fluid without compromising the effective circulating fluid volume; therefore, meticulous monitoring of fluid balance is critical for all patients.

Another option for treating patients with fluid overload are the new smaller and more portable devices like the Aquadex FlexFlow System (Baxter Healthcare). In patients with heart failure, Costanzo et al. compare adjustable ultrafiltration using a small ultrafiltration device to the use of intravenous loop diuretics. The authors found a trend to longer time to recurrence of heart failure within 90 days event after hospital discharge in patients treated with the ultrafiltration device, and fewer heart failure and cardiovascular events. Changes in renal function and the 90-day mortality were similar in both groups. However, more patients who were randomized to adjustable ultrafiltration experienced an adverse effect of special interest (p = 0.018) and a serious study product-related adverse events (p = 0.026).

### Volume overload profiles in patients with preserved and reduced ejection fraction chronic heart failure: are there differences? A pilot study [^111Hv6ow]. JACC: Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to characterize volume profiles and their differences in heart failure (HF) patients with preserved (HFpEF) and reduced (HFrEF) ventricular systolic function.

Background

The extent and distribution of volume overload and the associated implications for volume management have not been studied in decompensated HFpEF compared with HFrEF.

Methods

Total blood volume (TBV) was quantitated using a standardized computer-based radiolabeled albumin dilution technique.

Results

Twenty HFpEF and 35 HFrEF patients were evaluated at hospital admission. TBV was expanded by 27 ± 21% (range -5.2% to 77%; p = 0.002) and 37 ± 25% (0% to 107%; p < 0.001), respectively, above normal volumes. Red cell mass (RBCM) was expanded in HFrEF (24 ± 31%; p = 0.004) but within normal limits in HFpEF (8 ± 34%; p = 0.660) with, however, large variability in both groups. RBCM excess was more prominent in HFrEF (63% vs. 45%) than the RBCM deficit in HFpEF (35% vs.14%). With diuresis, TBV decreased to 25 ± 20% (p = 0.029) in HFrEF but was not changed in HFpEF (18 ± 20% [p = 0.173]). Body weight declined 6.6 ± 4.4 kg in HFrEF and 10.5 ± 8.3 kg (p = 0.026) in HFpEF. Interstitial fluid losses accounted for 85 ± 13% (HFrEF) and 93 ± 6% (HFpEF) (p = 0.012) of total volume removed.

Conclusions

TBV profiles differ between HFpEF and HFrEF patients with DCHF. Quantitated volume analysis revealed both significant RBCM (polycythemia) and plasma volume excess in HFrEF, whereas a higher RBCM deficit (true anemia) was demonstrated in HFpEF. Diuresis produced only a modest reduction in intravascular volumes with persistent hypervolemia in both groups at discharge, but overall more total body fluid was lost in HFpEF. These profile differences have implications for individualizing volume management.

### Curriculum in cardiology: integrated diagnosis and management of diastolic heart failure [^113MdfAg]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Among the general heart failure (HF) population, over half have diastolic HF (DHF). The proportion of DHF increases with age, from 46% in patients younger than 45 years to 59% in patients older than 85 years. The diagnosis of DHF is made by the combination of signs and symptoms of HF with preserved systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction > 50%), and evidence of diastolic dysfunction obtained by echocardiographic Doppler examination, invasive hemodynamic evaluation, or an elevation of serum B-type natriuretic peptide. The most common risk factors for the development of diastolic dysfunction and DHF include long-standing hypertension, older age, female sex, obesity, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and coronary artery disease. Acute decompensation occurs in the setting of pressure overload, volume overload, or superimposed cardiac ischemia. The cornerstones of in-hospital management include blood pressure and volume control, heart rate control, and correction of precipitating factors. Priorities in the outpatient clinic include optimal blood pressure control, maintenance of euvolemia with minimal or no diuretics, and, potentially, use of disease-modifying drugs including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and digoxin. Long-term regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, improvement in diastolic filling parameters, and sustained reductions in B-type natriuretic peptide may be future treatment targets for this condition.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Serum albumin and congestion assessment in HF — serum albumin levels should be checked routinely at HF admission, and peripheral edema should be interpreted with caution in the presence of hypoalbuminemia, which has been associated with up to 6-fold higher in-hospital mortality; reduced plasma oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia enhances extravascular fluid accumulation, for which overzealous diuresis may deplete intravascular volume and decrease renal function and blood pressure, particularly with nephrotic syndrome or chronic malnutrition.

### Early postoperative volume overload is a predictor of 1-year post-transplant mortality in pediatric heart transplant recipients [^112hdubK]. Pediatric Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fluid therapy is widely recognized as essential practice for the acute resuscitation of critically ill children. However, aggressive fluid resuscitation beyond the acute resuscitation period may lead to early fluid overload and worse clinical outcomes. Early fluid overload has been further investigated both as an early prognostic marker of poor clinical outcomes and an important potential modifiable risk factor in pediatric critical illness, shaping current clinical standards of fluid-goal directed therapy.

Post-cardiac surgery patients are considered particularly vulnerable to both postoperative volume overload and its secondary complications that result in severe morbidity and mortality. The risk of volume overload is multifactorial and often compounded by the effect of preoperative heart failure, the physiological changes following cardiopulmonary bypass that include capillary leak and low cardiac output syndrome, and renal dysfunction. Further, early fluid overload following postoperative low cardiac output syndrome reduces end-organ perfusion pressure and propagates a cycle of dysregulated pathophysiological mechanisms that exacerbate systemic organ failure, tissue edema, and volume overload. Fluid restriction and aggressive diuretic support have been the mainstay of post-operative management of cardiac surgical patients, among adult and pediatric patients.

### Diuretic therapy for patients With Heart Failure: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111UtGb3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Expansion of extracellular fluid volume is central to the pathophysiology of heart failure. Increased extracellular fluid leads to elevated intracardiac filling pressures, resulting in a constellation of signs and symptoms of heart failure referred to as congestion. Loop diuretics are one of the cornerstones of treatments for heart failure, but in contrast to other therapies, robust clinical trial evidence to guide the use of diuretics is sparse. A nuanced understanding of renal physiology and diuretic pharmacokinetics is essential for skillful use of diuretics in the management of heart failure in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. Diuretic resistance, defined as an inadequate quantity of natriuresis despite an adequate diuretic regimen, is a major clinical challenge that generally portends a poor prognosis. In this review, the authors discuss the fundamental mechanisms and physiological principles that underlie the use of diuretic therapy and the available data on the optimal use of diuretics.

### Extracorporeal ultrafiltration for fluid Overload in heart failure: current status and prospects for further research [^113prxoJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

The UNLOAD trial lacked treatment targets, blood volume assessments, cost analysis, and adjudication of events by an independent CEC. Nevertheless, compared with standard care, UF initiated before the administration of high-dose intravenous diuretic agents led to greater fluid loss at 48 h and reduced 90-day heart failure events. In the ULTRADISCO (Effects of ULTRAfiltration vs. DIureticS on clinical, biohumoral and hemodynamic variables in patients with deCOmpensated heart failure) study, at 36 h, compared with the diuretic agent group, the UF patients had greater reduction in body weight, signs and symptoms of heart failure, aldosterone and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels, and systemic vascular resistance, as well as greater improvements in objective measures of cardiac performance. Albeit very small, this study suggests that effective fluid removal may be associated with improved cardiac function (,–).

The CARRESS-HF (Cardiorenal Rescue Study in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial compared the effects of UF delivered at a fixed rate of 200 ml/h with those of stepped pharmacological therapy inclusive of adjustable doses of intravenous loop diuretic agents, thiazide diuretic agents, vasodilators, and inotropes in acutely decompensated patients with heart failure who had experienced a prerandomization increase in serum creatinine. The primary endpoint of CARRESS-HF was the bivariate change in serum creatinine and body weight from baseline to 96 h after randomization. According to the CARRESS-HF design, this primary endpoint assumes that weight loss is a measurement of effective fluid removal and that an increase in serum creatinine represents acute tubular injury. In CARRESS-HF, both groups lost an equivalent amount of weight, but greater increases in serum creatinine occurred with UF. In addition, a higher percentage of patients in the UF group experienced serious adverse events (Table 2). However, the fact that 37 patients (39%) in the UF group received only diuretic agents or were given these drugs before the assessment of the primary endpoint at 96 h impairs adjudication of adverse events to one or the other therapy.

### Continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for acute heart failure [^115MJc1J]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute heart failure (AHF) is new onset of, or a sudden worsening of, chronic heart failure characterised by congestion in about 95% of cases or end-organ hypoperfusion in 5% of cases. Treatment often requires urgent escalation of diuretic therapy, mainly through hospitalisation. This Cochrane review evaluated the efficacy of intravenous loop diuretics strategies in treating AHF in individuals with New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification III or IV and fluid overload.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intravenous continuous infusion versus bolus injection of loop diuretics for the initial treatment of acute heart failure in adults.

Search Methods

We identified trials through systematic searches of bibliographic databases and in clinical trials registers including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CPCI-S on the Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry platform (ICTRP), and the European Union Trials register. We conducted reference checking and citation searching, and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. The latest search was performed on 29 February 2024.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults with AHF, NYHA classification III or IV, regardless of aetiology or ejection fraction, where trials compared intravenous continuous infusion of loop diuretics with intermittent bolus injection in AHF. We excluded trials with chronic stable heart failure, cardiogenic shock, renal artery stenosis, or end-stage renal disease. Additionally, we excluded studies combining loop diuretics with hypertonic saline, inotropes, vasoactive medications, or renal replacement therapy and trials where diuretic dosing was protocol-driven to achieve a target urine output, due to confounding factors.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened papers for inclusion and reviewed full-texts. Outcomes included weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission following discharge, and occurrence of acute kidney injury. We performed risk of bias assessment and meta-analysis where data permitted and assessed certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

The review included seven RCTs, spanning 32 hospitals in seven countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. Data collection ranged from eight months to six years. Following exclusion of participants in subgroups with confounding treatments and different clinical settings, 681 participants were eligible for review. These additional study characteristics, coupled with our strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, improve the applicability of the body of the evidence as they reflect real-world clinical practice. Meta-analysis was feasible for net weight loss, all-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, readmission, and acute kidney injury. Literature review and narrative analysis explored daily fluid balance; cardiovascular mortality; B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) change; N-terminal-proBNP change; and adverse incidents such as ototoxicity, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances. Risk of bias assessment revealed two studies with low overall risk, four with some concerns, and one with high risk. All sensitivity analyses excluded trials at high risk of bias. Only narrative analysis was conducted for 'daily fluid balance' due to diverse data presentation methods across two studies (169 participants, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect). Results of narrative analysis varied. For instance, one study reported higher daily fluid balance within the first 24 hours in the continuous infusion group compared to the bolus injection group, whereas there was no difference in fluid balance beyond this time point. Continuous intravenous infusion of loop diuretics may result in mean net weight loss of 0.86 kg more than bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (mean difference (MD) 0.86 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.28; 5 trials, 497 participants; P < 0.001, I² = 21%; very low-certainty evidence). Importantly, sensitivity analysis excluding trials with high risk of bias showed there was insufficient evidence for a difference in bodyweight loss between groups (MD 0.70 kg, 95% CI -0.06 to 1.46; 3 trials, 378 participants; P = 0.07, I² = 0%). There may be little to no difference in all-cause mortality between continuous infusion and bolus injection (risk ratio (RR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.90; 5 trials, 530 participants; P = 0.19, I² = 4%; low-certainty evidence). Despite sensitivity analysis, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. No trials measured cardiovascular mortality. There may be little to no difference in the length of hospital stay between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -1.10 days, 95% CI -4.84 to 2.64; 4 trials, 211 participants; P = 0.57, I² = 88%; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis improved heterogeneity; however, the direction of the evidence remained unchanged. There may be little to no difference in the readmission to hospital between continuous infusion and bolus injection of loop diuretics (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.16; 3 trials, 400 participants; P = 0.31, I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show insufficient evidence for a difference in the readmission to hospital between groups. There may be little to no difference in the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse event between continuous infusion and bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.49; 3 trials, 491 participants; P = 0.92, I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis continued to show that continuous infusion may make little to no difference on the occurrence of acute kidney injury as an adverse events compared to the bolus injection of intravenous loop diuretics.

Authors' Conclusions

Analysis of available data comparing two delivery methods of diuretics in acute heart failure found that the current data are insufficient to show superiority of one strategy intervention over the other. Our findings were based on trials meeting stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure validity. Despite previous reviews suggesting advantages of continuous infusion over bolus injections, our review found insufficient evidence to support or refute this. However, our review, which excluded trials with clinical confounders and RCTs with high risk of bias, offers the most robust conclusion to date.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112hA3jW]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Diuretics and decongestion strategies in patients with HF — In patients with HF who have fluid retention, diuretics are recommended to relieve congestion, improve symptoms, and prevent worsening HF. For patients with HF and congestive symptoms, addition of a thiazide (eg, metolazone) to treatment with a loop diuretic should be reserved for patients who do not respond to moderate- or high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electrolyte abnormalities. Loop diuretics are the preferred diuretic agents for use in most patients with HF, while thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide may be considered in patients with hypertension and HF and mild fluid retention. Metolazone or chlorothiazide may be added to loop diuretics in patients with refractory edema unresponsive to loop diuretics alone. Diuretics should be prescribed to patients who have evidence of congestion or fluid retention, and in any patient with a history of congestion, maintenance diuretics should be considered to avoid recurrent symptoms. The treatment goal of diuretic use is to eliminate clinical evidence of fluid retention, using the lowest dose possible to maintain euvolemia. With the exception of MRAs, the effects of diuretics on morbidity and mortality are uncertain, and diuretics should not be used in isolation but always combined with other GDMT for HF that reduces hospitalizations and prolongs survival. Hyponatremia complicates HF management.

Decongestion with diuretic and adjunctive therapy — initial inpatient dosing and continuation: Establishing an effective diuretic regimen is crucial for achieving decongestion, and first doses, often given in the emergency department (ED), are generally based on previous home loop diuretic doses, as in the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial. For patients already on outpatient loop diuretics, the total daily dose should be changed to an oral furosemide equivalent and administered intravenously (IV) at 1 to 2.5 times the total daily dose. For patients not previously on outpatient diuretics, the initial furosemide dose usually is around 40 to 80 mg IV daily. In the DOSE trial, initiation of the 2.5 times higher dose led to 37% more fluid loss, 43% more weight loss, and greater dyspnea relief by 72 hours. Diuretic agents are usually continued throughout the early hospital stay, either by IV bolus every 8 to 12 hours or by continuous IV infusion.

### Noninvasive risk score to screen for pulmonary hypertension with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance in diseases of chronic volume overload [^113X9jx9]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Volume overload promotes pulmonary hypertension (PH) through pulmonary venous hypertension. However, PH with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (hereafter PH-PVR) may develop in patients with diseases of volume overload, such as heart failure or chronic kidney disease (CKD). In such cases, volume management alone may be insufficient to slow PH progression. An accurate, noninvasive method to screen for PH-PVR in these diseases would facilitate early targeted therapy. We integrated invasive hemodynamic and echocardiography data collected from a single-center clinical cohort and identified patients with CKD or heart failure at the time of assessment. We applied penalized regression to derive a risk score of clinical parameters and echocardiography data associated with PH-PVR and categorized patients into low- (≤ 5 points), intermediate- (6–10 points), or high-risk (> 10 points) groups. Using an internal validation strategy, we evaluated the ability of this risk score to predict PH-PVR and determined the association of this risk classification with 3-year all-cause mortality. Of 2422 patients, 42.4% had PH-PVR. In adjusted analyses, tricuspid regurgitant velocity, right ventricular function, BMI, heart rate, and hemoglobin most strongly associated with PH-PVR. The risk score significantly associated with PH-PVR (age-adjusted odds ratio 11.69 for the highest-risk group, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.54–20.92). The high-risk group also associated with a significantly higher risk of 3-year all-cause mortality in adjusted analyses (hazard ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.50–2.27). In conclusion, a noninvasive risk score derived from echocardiography and clinical parameters significantly associated with PH-PVR and all-cause mortality in a cohort of patients with CKD and heart failure.

### Diuretics: still the mainstay of treatment [^117WKERh]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The mainstay of treatment of acute decompensated heart failure is diuretic therapy. While there are no data showing a morbidity or mortality benefit from the use of chronic diuretic therapy, diuretics rapidly improve symptoms associated with volume overload. Thus, despite concerns that some diuretics may cause harm by neurohormonal activation, these agents continue to be the first-line treatment for patients with heart failure. There is no conclusive evidence that one means of diuresis is better than another. When administration of moderate doses of loop diuretics is not sufficient, patients can be treated with higher doses, continuous infusions, or the addition of a thiazide diuretic or aldosterone antagonist. Diuretics improve symptoms but should be used in addition to other agents that improve the long-term outcome of patients with heart failure.

RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS

The randomized controlled trials of UF are summarized in Table 2 and Online Table 4. The RAPID-CHF (Relief of Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients with Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure) trial was the first randomized study of UF to use the Aquadex System 100 device (Sunshine Heart, Minneapolis, Minnesota). Although this small study did not evaluate patients' outcomes beyond 48 h, it confirmed that effective fluid removal and clinical improvement may occur with UF.

The physiological fact that refill of the intravascular space from the edematous interstitium decreases as fluid is removed led to the hypothesis that initiation of UF before the plasma refilling rate is decreased by previous diuretic agent-based therapies might produce greater benefit than intravenous loop diuretic agents in unequivocally congested patients with heart failure. Hence, in the UNLOAD (Ultrafiltration Versus Intravenous Diuretics Decompensated Heart Failure) trial, randomization had to occur within 24 h of hospitalization, and a maximum of 2 intravenous loop diuretic agent doses were permitted before enrollment. Compared with standard care results, the UF group had greater weight loss and similar improvement in dyspnea score (the coprimary endpoints) at 48 h. The percentage of patients with increases in serum creatinine levels ≥ 0.3 mg/dl was slightly but insignificantly higher in the UF group than in the control group at 24 and 48 h. Among UNLOAD patients from a single center, use of iothalamate and para -aminohippurate to measure glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow showed that UF and furosemide produce similar changes in these variables. There were no between-group differences in duration of the index hospitalization, a variable that can be influenced by adjustment of oral heart failure therapy before discharge, performance of additional diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, treatment of comorbidities, issues of patients' placement, and lack of defined discharge criteria. In UNLOAD, the 90-day heart failure events were a pre-specified secondary endpoint, and the investigators determined whether these were related to worsening heart failure or not. It cannot be said with certainty whether the fewer heart failure events in 90 days in the UF group compared with the standard care group were due to differences in fluid loss, the nature of the fluid removed, or other factors. Because UNLOAD did not have an independent clinical events committee (CEC) to adjudicate whether an event was heart failure-related or not, the possibility of patient or investigator bias cannot be excluded. A post hoc analysis of UNLOAD compared the 100 UF patients with 100 usual-care patients subdivided according to intravenous diuretic agent strategy (continuous [n = 32] or bolus [n = 68] administration). Despite removal of the same amount of fluid by UF and diuretic agent infusion, 90-day heart failure events were fewer in the UF group (p = 0.016). The simultaneous reduction of total body sodium and excess fluid by UF may be more effective than removal of hypotonic fluid by diuretic agents or free water by arginine vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists. It is also possible that pre-hospitalization diuretic agent use itself impairs the natriuretic response to subsequent intravenous administration of these drugs. In UNLOAD, complications related to UF included clotting of 5 filters, 1 catheter infection, and the requirement for hemodialysis in 1 patient deemed unresponsive to UF (Table 2).

### Management of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction [^1172ywQ5]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Therapy for HFpEF

The goals of therapy for patients with HFpEF are to reduce symptoms, improve functional status and lower the risk of hospital admission.

Diuretics: the cornerstone of therapy

Patients with HFpEF and documented volume overload should be offered diuretic therapy. Therapy is initiated with loop diuretics, type and dose depending on the severity of volume overload. For those patients with diuretic resistance, sequential nephron blockade can be achieved using thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), the latter of these has been included in the 2022 AHA HF guidelines with class 2b level of recommendation for treatment of HFpEF.

Treating underlying comorbidities

Up until 2022, the core of therapeutic recommendations in HFpEF was a focus on delivering therapy for underlying comorbidity and treating modifiable HF risk factors. Hypertension, AF, CAD, hyperlipidaemia, obesity, anaemia, DM, CKD and sleep apnoea are conditions that are frequently associated with HFpEF. There is no evidence for HFpEF-specific management of these conditions.

Even though multiple randomised controlled trials (RCTs) using ACE inhibitors (ACEis), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), MRAs, beta blockers and angiotensin–neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) in patients with HFpEF did not show mortality benefit or reduction in hospitalisation, their effects on the course of HFpEF were shown in subgroup analyses. Therefore, in selected patients with HFpEF, MRAs, ARBs and ARNIs may be considered to decrease hospitalisations, particularly among patients with LVEF on the lower end of this spectrum, and their use is given a class 2b recommendation in 2022 HF guidelines from AHA/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure Society of America(HFSA).

### Exploring safety of down-titrating diuretics in heart failure management [^114V7v6y]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our findings show that approximately one‐third of patients require swift reinitiation or an increase of the dose after down‐titration and both hospitalization and mortality were increased. Thus, caution is advisable if down‐titration is intended. Current recommendations by guidelines are mostly based on expert opinion with little scientific evidence. Our data emphasize the need to further investigate this practice and prospectively investigate the true risks and benefits of reducing loop diuretic therapy in HF patients who seem to be clinically stable based on signs and symptoms only.

A recent article by Felker et al.acknowledges the lack of evidence regarding the correct use of diuretic therapy, despite being an important cornerstone of treatment in HF, irrespective of LVEF. Regardless of the lack of robust evidence, the consensus remains that lower dosages or discontinuation of diuretic therapy should be pursued as stated by Magdy et al.for example. This might be supported by a small randomized controlled trial by Rohde et al. They included 188 stable outpatients with little or no symptoms and a maximum stable furosemide dose of 80 mg. Loop diuretic therapy was withdrawn in 95 of them without occurrence of any safety issues and little need for restarting diuretic therapy. However, the patients in our study were more symptomatic and had more severe HF. This may explain the different outcomes of the study by Rohde et al.and our study. Moreover, some of the patients had clinical signs of volume overload, at least during the first months, but the increased risk was independent of clinical assessment.

### Hyponatraemia in heart failure: time for new solutions? [^1167vCqU]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyponatraemia is very common in heart failure (HF), especially in decompensated patients. It is associated with increased mortality and morbidity and considered a marker of advanced disease. Recognition of hyponatraemia and its causes may help guide treatment strategy. Historically, therapy has primarily focused on water restriction, decongestion with loop diuretics in case of volume overload (dilutional hyponatraemia) and sodium repletion in case of depletion. In this review, we summarise the potential benefits of established and emerging HF therapies on sodium homeostasis, with a focus on dual vasopressin antagonists, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and hypertonic saline, and propose a potential therapeutic approach for hyponatraemia in HF.

Constrictive pericarditis — medical and surgical management approach emphasizes that for patients with underlying pericardial inflammation as in transient constriction, anti-inflammatory therapy should be initiated before considering pericardiectomy; this approach may resolve the constrictive pathophysiology, or if pericardiectomy remains indicated, facilitates a more successful surgery on a less-inflamed pericardium. In tuberculous constrictive pericarditis, antitubercular therapy may resolve constrictive pathophysiology, and corticosteroids may enhance clinical improvement. In patients with chronic constrictive pericarditis and heart failure, diuretic therapy can treat volume overload but does not alter the natural history, and goal-directed heart failure therapy may be implemented, although evidence is limited. Surgical radical pericardiectomy is preferred, with resection of the entire pericardium — including anterior, diaphragmatic and posterior segments — on cardiopulmonary bypass, and should be performed at experienced tertiary surgical centers for optimal clinical outcomes.

### Extracorporeal ultrafiltration for fluid Overload in heart failure: current status and prospects for further research [^116BQyyQ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Data from 15 patients with acutely decompensated heart failure show that urinary sodium concentration in response to intravenous loop diuretic agents is highly variable and lower than that in the ultrafiltrate. The difficulty in predicting the natriuretic response of individual patients to a given dose of intravenous diuretic agent is underscored by the absence of a correlation between baseline renal function and urinary sodium concentration after furosemide administration. The hypothesis that UF may be especially effective in patients with urinary sodium concentrations of < 100 mEq after a specified dose of intravenous diuretic agents should be tested in randomized trials. A single non-randomized prospective cohort study showed similar effects of UF in heart failure with reduced versus preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. However, because the 2 types of heart failure possess distinct pathophysiological and clinical characteristics, response to UF should be assessed in controlled trials.

Thirteen patients died of cardiovascular causes (11 in the volume-overload group [6.3%] and 2 in the euvolemia group [1.2%]). The rate of first hospitalization for congestive heart failure was significantly higher in the volume-overload group (24 patients [13.7%] compared with 2 in the euvolemia group [1.2%]).

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112z6NhT]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure hospitalization — diuretic management and ultrafiltration are summarized as follows: Evidence of persistent congestion at discharge has been reported in 25% to 50% of patients, and diuresis should not be discontinued prematurely because elevations in the range of 0.3 mg/dL do not predict worse outcomes except when patients are discharged with persistent congestion. In the DOSE (Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation) trial, there were no significant differences in patients' global assessment of symptoms or in the change in renal function when diuretic therapy was administered by bolus versus continuous infusion or at a high dose versus a low dose; however, patients in the low-dose group were more likely to require a 50% increase in the dose at 48 hours. Addition of low-dose dopamine to diuretic therapy in the setting of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) did not improve outcomes overall, although a subset analysis showed increased urine output and weight loss in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40% with significant interaction of effect with LVEF. Bedside ultrafiltration initiated early after admission increased fluid loss, with decreased rehospitalizations in some studies when compared with use of diuretics without systematic escalation, but was also associated with adverse events related to intravenous catheters.

### Diuretic response in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: characteristics and clinical outcome – an analysis from RELAX-AHF [^112GYrUj]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2014). Low credibility.

This is of importance for two reasons. First, we are better able to predict those patients at higher risk for rehospitalization, which is a major problem in patients who are admitted for AHF. Secondly, and more importantly, strategies that improve diuretic response might lead to improved clinical outcome and fewer rehospitalizations in patients with AHF. However, potential strategies to improve diuretic response remain to be established. First, addition of thiazides/chlorothalidon and/or azetazolamide might improve diuretic response, although this should be proven by prospective randomized controlled trials. Ultrafiltration might be another option to improve diuretic response in diuretic-resistant patients. In UNLOAD, in AHF patients with signs of volume overload, ultrafiltration resulted in greater weight and fluid loss than i.v. diuretics, but had no effect on mortality. These beneficial effects could not be confirmed in a recent randomized trial, where loop diuretics were superior to ultrafiltration for the preservation of renal function, with a similar amount of weight loss. However, a good diuresis was observed in both arms, indicating that these patients were not diuretic resistant, although the results might be different in a population of patients selected based on a poor diuretic response.

### Targeting the lymphatic system for interstitial decongestion [^114W45Xw]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2021). Medium credibility.

Congestion is the prevailing symptom in the majority of patients with acute heart failure (AHF). Additionally, most patients with congestion are also volume overloaded, indicating excessive sodium and fluid retention. Most of the sodium and fluid retention in heart failure occurs in the extracellular compartment, yet only 25% is retained in the intravascular space, while 75% is retained in the extravascular space (interstitium and third space). As a result, the ideal decongestive therapy in AHF patients with volume overload would need to be aimed at both removing excess water and sodium from the interstitial space and targeting the excessive plasma volume. Diuretic drugs stimulate renal natriuresis and diuresis, resulting in a reduction in plasma volume. If this is sustained, hemoconcentration of the intravascular space and a reduction in central filling pressures will result in a change of Starling forces in the microcirculation (where the intravascular space and the interstitium intersect with one another), leading to a process called plasma refill, which favors net reabsorption from the interstitium into the intravascular space. Then, once in the intravascular space, this fluid and sodium can be removed by the kidneys. Such a sequential decongestion approach (first targeting intravascular fluid, with subsequent interstitial decongestion) in clinical practice is often hampered because plasma refill rate kinetics drop during decongestion. This is related to a decrease in vasodilatory peptides, leading to a reduction in the capillary surface area (a component of the filtration coefficient K f in the Starling equation). Additionally, heart failure itself has been shown to be associated with a lower K f, therefore hampering plasma refill before decongestive therapies are even begun. When the rate of diuresis outweighs refill rate kinetics, the ultimate result is intravascular contraction, hypotension, and worsening renal function, while the interstitium can remain volume overloaded. Therefore, having therapeutic interventions that can directly target interstitial volume overload would be valuable.

Diuretic therapy (Figure 6) — in hospitalized heart failure, initiate IV loop diuretics early (ED or immediately after admission) with an initial dose usually 1–2.5 times total daily oral loop diuretic agent in furosemide equivalents, and prescribe IV diuretics every 8–12 hrs or continuous while measuring daily weights and urine output and monitoring vital signs and congestion; consider addition of SGLT inhibitors for chronic therapy and consider adjunct diuretic agent such as acetazolamide. For Adequate diuresis, continue diuretics with target relief of congestion and plan for transition to oral therapy. For Inadequate diuresis, usually increase loop diuretic agent dose by 50%-100% and consider other thiazides or additional diuretic agents. For Refractory to diuretics, change course by escalating diuretics, considering additional diuretic agents or other decongestion strategies, and consider hemodynamic monitoring to guide therapy.

BIOMARKERS

The use of natriuretic peptides to assess volume status and guide decongestive therapies cannot be recommended because fluid overload is not the sole cause of increases in the levels of these biomarkers. The removal of fluid to achieve pre-specified natriuretic peptide levels is untested in acute heart failure. Serum creatinine is the sole biomarker used to guide fluid removal because of the belief that its level reflects both renal filtration function and tubular status. However, serum creatinine was established and validated as a measurement of renal function only at the point of steady-state (constant production from the metabolism of muscle creatine phosphate and unchanging glomerular filtration and urinary flow to excrete creatinine at a constant rate). Therefore, it is unfortunate that serum creatinine is the only widely available measurement of renal function in patients with acute illnesses, such as acutely decompensated heart failure, where the rates of creatinine production and excretion may be altered. Gene expression analysis has shown differences in the genes expressed in acute kidney injury due to different processes, even if the magnitude of rise in creatinine is the same. Conversely, serum creatinine concentration can be normal with documented tubular injury due to the delayed achievement of detectable changes of this analyte. Generally, hemodynamically driven increases in serum creatinine resolve with treatment in 24 to 72 h, whereas the cellular derangements due to acute tubular damage, or even necrosis, may last for weeks. Therefore, the duration of the elevation in serum creatinine has a greater predictive effect on morbidity and mortality than the extent of this biomarker's elevation. Indeed, the use of increases in serum creatinine as an endpoint for acutely decompensated heart failure trials has been challenged. Evaluation of the relationship between changes in serum creatinine and 60-day outcomes in DOSE subjects revealed that increases in serum creatinine from baseline to 72 h (DOSE's coprimary endpoint) was associated with lower risk for the composite outcome of death or heart failure events. Conversely, there was a strong relationship between improved renal function and unfavorable 60-day outcomes. Thus, serum creatinine changes are an unreliable surrogate endpoint in trials of fluid removal therapies. After the discovery by Mishra et al. of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), which is secreted in the urine and the plasma by a damaged kidney, it was shown that the expression/secretion of urine NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) occurred within 3 h of the event (sepsis, nephrotoxins, obstruction, ischemia); and that the amount of secreted protein (from 20 ng/ml to 5 mg/ml) was proportional to the severity and time of resolution of the stimulus. A growing body of evidence suggests NGAL is not expressed when serum creatinine increases due to volume stressors. A systematic study of thousands of genes encoding for several biomarkers including NGAL, kidney injury molecule-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and clusterin, found that these molecules were detectable after a brief dose of ischemia, yet none of these genes were expressed after near-fatal volume depletion, despite the rise in serum creatinine in both models. Although this method is not yet widely available, in the setting of any method of fluid removal, the levels of urine NGAL and other biomarkers of tubular injury could potentially help distinguish a rise in serum creatinine due to a hemodynamically mediated decrease in glomerular filtration rate or actual tubular injury. Numerous genes are differentially expressed depending upon the presence and type of acute kidney injury. The levels of NGAL rise faster than those of other indicators of renal injury, making this biomarker better suited to distinguish between hemodynamically, versus tubular injury-driven increases in serum creatinine that may occur during fluid removal therapies.

### Pathophysiology of diuretic resistance and its implications for the management of chronic heart failure [^116BRcXA]. Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Diuretic resistance implies a failure to increase fluid and sodium (Na +) output sufficiently to relieve volume overload, edema, or congestion, despite escalating doses of a loop diuretic to a ceiling level (80 mg of furosemide once or twice daily or greater in those with reduced glomerular filtration rate or heart failure). It is a major cause of recurrent hospitalizations in patients with chronic heart failure and predicts death but is difficult to diagnose unequivocally. Pharmacokinetic mechanisms include the low and variable bioavailability of furosemide and the short duration of all loop diuretics that provides time for the kidneys to restore diuretic-induced Na + losses between doses. Pathophysiological mechanisms of diuretic resistance include an inappropriately high daily salt intake that exceeds the acute diuretic-induced salt loss, hyponatremia or hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, and reflex activation of the renal nerves. Nephron mechanisms include tubular tolerance that can develop even during the time that the renal tubules are exposed to a single dose of diuretic, or enhanced reabsorption in the proximal tubule that limits delivery to the loop, or an adaptive increase in reabsorption in the downstream distal tubule and collecting ducts that offsets ongoing blockade of Na + reabsorption in the loop of Henle. These provide rationales for novel strategies including the concurrent use of diuretics that block these nephron segments and even sequential nephron blockade with multiple diuretics and aquaretics combined in severely diuretic-resistant patients with heart failure.

### Rationale and design of the aquapheresis versus intravenous diuretics and hospitalization for heart failure (AVOID-HF) trial [^114Msvma]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In patients hospitalized with acutely decompensated heart failure, unresolved signs and symptoms of fluid overload have been consistently associated with poor outcomes. Regardless of dosing and type of administration, intravenous loop diuretics have not reduced heart failure events or mortality in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. The results of trials comparing intravenous loop diuretics to mechanical fluid removal by isolated venovenous ultrafiltration have yielded conflicting results. Studies evaluating early decongestive strategies have shown that ultrafiltration removed more fluid and was associated with fewer heart failure-related rehospitalization than intravenous loop diuretics. In contrast, when used in the setting of worsening renal function, ultrafiltration was associated with poorer renal outcomes and no reduction in heart failure events.

Methods

The AVOID-HF trial seeks to determine if an early strategy of ultrafiltration in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure is associated with fewer heart failure events at 90 days compared with a strategy based on intravenous loop diuretics. Study subjects from 40 highly experienced institutions are randomized to either early ultrafiltration or intravenous loop diuretics. In both treatment arms, fluid removal therapies are adjusted according to the patients' hemodynamic condition and renal function. The study was unilaterally terminated by the sponsor in the absence of futility and safety concerns after the enrollment of 221 subjects, or 27% of the originally planned sample size of 810 patients.

Conclusions

The AVOID-HF trial's principal aim is to compare the safety and efficacy of ultrafiltration vs that of intravenous loop diuretics in patients hospitalized with acutely decompensated heart failure. Because stepped treatment approaches are applied in both ultrafiltration and intravenous loop diuretics groups and the primary end point is time to first heart failure event within 90 days, it is hoped that the AVOID-HF trial, despite its untimely termination by the sponsor, will provide further insight on how to optimally decongest patients with fluid-overloaded heart failure.

### Loop diuretic resistance in heart failure: resistance etiology-based strategies to restoring diuretic efficacy [^114hxaG5]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2014). Low credibility.

Loop diuretics are a cornerstone of symptom management for nearly all patients with heart failure. Diuretic resistance is a clinical problem with similar presentation despite diverse and multiple etiologies. Although the exact incidence is not known, diuretic resistance occurs frequently and can increase the length of hospitalization. Despite the prevalence of loop diuretic prescription in heart failure and frequency of diuretic resistance, current heart failure guidelines provide nonspecific guidance on strategies to restore diuretic efficacy. Providers are left with many questions regarding the optimum diuretic titration strategy in the setting of diuretic resistance. In light of these highly prevalent uncertainties, we present a case vignette-structured literature review of the mechanisms of diuretic resistance and recommend therapeutic strategies based on the resistance etiology to improve diuretic response in acute decompensated heart failure.

### Acetazolamide in acute decompensated heart failure with volume overload [^112RACoH]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Background

Whether acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, can improve the efficiency of loop diuretics, potentially leading to more and faster decongestion in patients with acute decompensated heart failure with volume overload, is unclear.

Methods

In this multicenter, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned patients with acute decompensated heart failure, clinical signs of volume overload (i.e., edema, pleural effusion, or ascites), and an N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level of more than 1000 pg per milliliter or a B-type natriuretic peptide level of more than 250 pg per milliliter to receive either intravenous acetazolamide (500 mg once daily) or placebo added to standardized intravenous loop diuretics (at a dose equivalent to twice the oral maintenance dose). Randomization was stratified according to the left ventricular ejection fraction (≤ 40% or > 40%). The primary end point was successful decongestion, defined as the absence of signs of volume overload, within 3 days after randomization and without an indication for escalation of decongestive therapy. Secondary end points included a composite of death from any cause or rehospitalization for heart failure during 3 months of follow-up. Safety was also assessed.

Results

A total of 519 patients underwent randomization. Successful decongestion occurred in 108 of 256 patients (42.2%) in the acetazolamide group and in 79 of 259 (30.5%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.17 to 1.82; P < 0.001). Death from any cause or rehospitalization for heart failure occurred in 76 of 256 patients (29.7%) in the acetazolamide group and in 72 of 259 patients (27.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.48). Acetazolamide treatment was associated with higher cumulative urine output and natriuresis, findings consistent with better diuretic efficiency. The incidence of worsening kidney function, hypokalemia, hypotension, and adverse events was similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

The addition of acetazolamide to loop diuretic therapy in patients with acute decompensated heart failure resulted in a greater incidence of successful decongestion. (Funded by the Belgian Health Care Knowledge Center; ADVOR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03505788.).

### Rationale and design of the ADVOR (acetazolamide in decompensated heart failure with volume overload) trial [^113ZXreH]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Decisive evidence on the optimal diuretic agent, dosing schedule, and administration route is lacking in acute heart failure (AHF) with congestion. The Acetazolamide in Decompensated heart failure with Volume OveRload (ADVOR) trial is designed to test the hypothesis that the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide, a potent inhibitor of proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, improves decongestion when combined with loop diuretic therapy in AHF, potentially leading to better clinical outcomes.

Methods

The ADVOR trial is set up as a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, aiming to recruit 519 patients with AHF and clinically evident volume overload. All study participants receive high-dose intravenous loop diuretics as background therapy and are randomized towards intravenous acetazolamide at a dose of 500mg once daily vs. placebo, stratified according to including study centre and ejection fraction (< 40% vs. ≥ 40%). The primary endpoint is successful decongestion with no more than trace oedema assessed on the third morning after hospital admission, with good diuretic efficacy defined as a urine output > 3.5L during the first 30–48h of decongestive treatment. Secondary endpoints include all-cause mortality or heart failure readmission after 3months, length of hospital stay for the index admission, and longitudinal changes in the EuroQol-5 dimensions questionnaire.

Conclusion

ADVOR will investigate if acetazolamide combined with loop diuretic therapy improves decongestion in AHF with volume overload.

### Evaluation and management of right-sided heart failure: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115JnrPX]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Right-sided heart failure (RHF) decompensation and chronic remodeling — Declining pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in the setting of high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is an ominous clinical finding; with an intact pericardium, right ventricular (RV) dilation compresses the left ventricular (LV) cavity, impeding LV filling and equalizing biventricular diastolic pressures, and although patients with chronic right heart failure (CRHF) may require higher RV end-diastolic pressure, reduced LV filling is more likely caused by RV dilation and ventricular interdependence than reduced RV forward output; increased transmural pressure from RV dilation with pericardial constraint impairs LV filling, and the combination of RV systolic and biventricular diastolic dysfunction reduces cardiac output, impairs coronary blood flow, and exacerbates peripheral and abdominal congestion; venous congestion also negatively affects hepatic and renal function; CRHF most commonly results from gradual increases in RV afterload caused by pulmonary hypertension (PH) most frequently from left HF, although chronic volume overload from right-sided lesions such as tricuspid regurgitation can also lead to its development; if the load persists, the RV transitions to a decompensated phenotype characterized by myocyte loss and replacement/fibrosis.

### Great debate: in patients with decompensated heart failure, acetazolamide in addition to loop diuretics is the first choice [^113jBoBr]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Pro

Objectives of diuretic therapy

Loop diuretics have a Class I recommendation in all ejection fraction classes to treat signs and symptoms of congestion, but in contrast to other medical therapies, robust clinical trial evidence to guide the use of loop diuretics is sparse, which is reflected in a Class C recommendation. Moreover, the appropriate use of diuretics remains challenging, especially in the setting of worsening renal function (WRF), diuretic resistance, and electrolyte disturbances. Thorough knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of diuretics is therefore mandatory to use them effectively (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Side and mode of action of different diuretics (adapted from Mullens et al.).

Despite routine use of high-dose loop diuretics, many patients are discharged with residual clinical signs of volume overload, which is a strong predictor of poor outcomes. Although the ESC HF guidelines have a Class I recommendation (level of evidence C), only 15% of patients were free from clinical congestion after 72 h of treatment in the DOSE study. Sequential diuretic therapy has been suggested as a way to achieve better decongestion, but reliable evidence on the optimal diuretic agents, dosing schedule, and route of administration has been lacking. Importantly, the ESC HF guidelines have a Class I recommendation (level of evidence C) that patients hospitalized for HF should not be discharged with persistent signs of congestion.

Why should acetazolamide be used as a first-line agent in addition to loop diuretics in acute heart failure with volume overload?

### Improved decongestion with the addition of… [^11443RAh]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Bottom Line For patients with chronic heart failure who are hospitalized with acute volume overload, the addition of acetazolamide to intravenous loop diuretics leads to faster decongestion. Nine patients would need to be treated with acetazolamide to have one patient achieve this outcome. The trial was initiated before the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors for the treatment of heart failure and had a predominantly White population. The results may not be generalizable to all populations. Synopsis The investigators randomized hospitalized adults with acute decompensated heart failure to receive intravenous acetazolamide, 500 mg daily, or matching placebo for three days.

All patients received standardized intravenous loop diuretic therapy at double the dose of their oral maintenance therapy. Those taking maintenance acetazolamide or SGLT-2 inhibitors were excluded. Trial participants had a mean age of 78 years, two-thirds were men, and 99% were White. Additionally, 87% were classified as New York Heart Association class III or IV. The primary outcome was successful decongestion, defined as the absence of signs of volume overload within three days of randomization without a need for escalation of decongestive therapy. More patients in the acetazolamide group than in the placebo group achieved the primary outcome.

### NCT05171686 | Diuretics and volume overload in early CKD… [^1176oaWs]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Diuretics and Volume Overload in Early CKD ClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview. The investigators previously showed that brain natriuretic peptide and N-terminal-pro-BNP, measures of ventricular stretch, are associated with death and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease stages 1–3, and the investigators' preliminary pilot results suggest that these natriuretic peptides may correlate with objective measures of excess extracellular volume and with symptoms common in CKD. The investigators will compare the changes in natriuretic peptides, symptoms, and CV parameters with the change in ECV after diuretic initiation or dose increase. The primary aim is to determine if initiation of diuretic treatment or increase in diuretic dose is associated with changes in natriuretic peptides. Secondary aims are to determine the effect of diuretic change on patient-reported symptom burden, and CV physiology.

This clinical trial will include 46 outpatients with CKD stages 1–3 and blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg. At the first visit, the investigators will initiate or increase the dose of a thiazide or loop diuretic. Study measures other than echocardiogram will be repeated 4 weeks after the intervention to determine changes in these parameters. Variables will be compared within participants between baseline and Visit 2 using paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests or paired Student's t tests, depending on variable distributions. Correlations between change in ECV/total body weight and all continuous outcome measures will be analyzed using Spearman or Pearson correlations, applying appropriate transformations. Linear regression analysis will control for clinically relevant variables. The relationship between ECV/total body weight and natriuretic peptides from both visits will be evaluated using a mixed effects model to account for the change in these measures between baseline and Visit 2.

6. Predicted Median Ventilator and Intensive Care Unit Free Days Among the Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy Initiation and Volume Overload Phenotypes. Objective To determine whether timing of CRRT initiation, with and without consideration of volume overload, is associated with major adverse kidney events at 90 days. Design, Setting, and Participants. Acute kidney injury and volume overload are common in children who are critically ill and at risk for increased morbidity and mortality. 1–8 Continuous renal replacement therapy is used when medical therapy cannot maintain fluid balance, or complications of AKI develop. 9–15 In children.

We hypothesized that longer time to CRRT initiation and greater VO at CRRT initiation would be associated with worse outcomes. The independent association of VO at CRRT initiation with adverse outcomes in children treated with CRRT was recognized more than 20 years ago. 39 Since then, multiple studies have reported that higher VO at CRRT initiation is associated with adverse outcomes.
