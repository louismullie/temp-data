## Question

How would these results influence your decision to use dexmedetomidine around delivery for a patient with prenatal depression, and what trade-offs should you discuss?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the randomized trial results would influence the decision to use dexmedetomidine around delivery for a patient with prenatal depression, and what trade-offs should be discussed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and baseline risk of postpartum depression. Then, I should verify the trial design, population, intervention, and outcomes. Next, I will appraise the magnitude and certainty of benefit, followed by a careful safety analysis including maternal hemodynamics, neonatal exposure, and breastfeeding. After that, I need to check external validity and guideline alignment. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline the shared decision-making conversation with explicit trade-offs and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and baseline risk. Women with prenatal depression have a substantially elevated risk of postpartum depression, and effective prevention strategies are limited, so any intervention that meaningfully reduces PPD incidence would be clinically important in this population [^notfound].

> I will now examine the trial design and population. The study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 338 women with prenatal depression, defined by EPDS greater than 9, undergoing elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia, which strengthens internal validity and reduces confounding, though I should confirm generalizability to vaginal deliveries and different anesthesia contexts [^1872d03c] [^8d1a2dc1].

> Next, I should review the intervention details. The dexmedetomidine group received a 0.5 mcg/kg IV bolus over 10 minutes immediately after delivery, followed by dexmedetomidine 2.0 mcg/kg plus sufentanil 2.2 mcg/kg in 100 mL for 48 hours of patient-controlled intravenous analgesia, while the control group received saline bolus and sufentanil-only PCIA; this combined regimen complicates attribution, so I need to keep in mind that some benefits may reflect improved analgesia rather than a direct antidepressant effect of dexmedetomidine alone [^51773b24] [^1872d03c].

> Let me verify the primary outcomes and magnitude of benefit. Positive PPD screening at 7 days dropped from 32.1% to 12.6% and at 42 days from 30.3% to 11.4%, yielding a relative risk around 0.39 with narrow confidence intervals, which is a large, clinically meaningful absolute risk reduction of about 19–20% and a number needed to treat near 5; I should double-check that these are intention-to-treat analyses, which they are [^5a1c8246] [^1872d03c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism. The authors propose BDNF upregulation and pro-BDNF downregulation as plausible mechanisms, but only a subset had BDNF measured and the biomarker results are hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, so I should frame this as a potential mechanism rather than proven causality [^ac29619b] [^4d6d664c].

> Now, I need to assess safety carefully. Overall adverse events were similar, but hypotension occurred more frequently with dexmedetomidine, 18.3% versus 9.5%, with a risk ratio around 2.15; most events were mild to moderate, but this mandates vigilant hemodynamic monitoring and cautious use in patients with baseline hypotension or hemodynamic instability [^90b6ec55] [^1872d03c].

> I should confirm neonatal exposure and breastfeeding considerations. Dexmedetomidine crosses the placenta, and published lactation data suggest low relative infant dose with short detectability in milk, generally supporting compatibility with breastfeeding when clinically indicated, though I need to counsel on infant monitoring for irritability and align with FDA lactation guidance to individualize decisions [^fd23da40] [^241aefbf] [^2fdf6fa8].

> Next, I should review external validity and guideline context. The trial enrolled only women with prenatal depression undergoing elective cesarean delivery, so evidence is indirect for vaginal births or those without prenatal depression; current peripartum depression guidelines emphasize screening and treatment rather than pharmacologic prevention, and there is no guideline endorsement of dexmedetomidine for PPD prevention yet, which tempers routine adoption pending replication and broader populations [^8dd44f8f] [^3f178c2d].

> Let me consider practical implementation and monitoring. If used, I would ensure continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitoring for at least the first 24 hours, avoid coadministration with other sedatives that compound hypotension, and coordinate with obstetrics and pediatrics for maternal-infant observation; I should also confirm institutional protocols for post-cesarean analgesia and whether dexmedetomidine PCIA is feasible and acceptable locally [^notfound].

> I should double-check the balance of benefits and harms. The large absolute reduction in PPD screening positivity is compelling, but the increased hypotension risk and the need for monitoring are nontrivial; additionally, the intervention bundles dexmedetomidine with sufentanil, so disentangling analgesic from antidepressant effects remains a limitation, and replication in other settings and with dexmedetomidine monotherapy is needed before routine use [^1872d03c] [^ac29619b].

> For shared decision-making, I would explain that in women with prenatal depression having cesarean delivery, a short peri-delivery course of dexmedetomidine reduced positive PPD screens by about 20% at 6 weeks, with mostly mild hypotension as the main trade-off and low expected infant exposure via breast milk, while acknowledging that this is the first high-quality trial and that standard PPD screening and treatment remain essential regardless of whether dexmedetomidine is used [^5a1c8246] [^fd23da40] [^8dd44f8f].

> Putting this together, my conditional recommendation is that for patients with prenatal depression undergoing elective cesarean delivery, it is reasonable to consider peri-delivery dexmedetomidine as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen when institutional resources and monitoring are available, provided we counsel on hypotension risk and the need for observation, and we continue routine PPD screening and treatment pathways; I would not generalize this to vaginal deliveries or to patients without prenatal depression outside a trial setting until more data emerge [^1872d03c] [^8dd44f8f] [^3f178c2d].

Dexmedetomidine **reduces postpartum depression risk** by about 60% in women with prenatal depression undergoing cesarean delivery, with benefits evident at 7 and 42 days postpartum [^5a1c8246] [^1872d03c]. It also improves sleep and reduces postoperative pain without increasing overall adverse events, though **hypotension is more common** and requires monitoring [^90b6ec55] [^1872d03c]. Given FDA labeling that dexmedetomidine crosses the placenta and lacks robust first-trimester data, use should be individualized and coordinated with obstetrics and pediatrics, especially if breastfeeding [^46c32e11] [^fd23da40]. I would discuss these benefits and risks, consider dexmedetomidine for high-risk patients with close monitoring, and continue standard PPD screening and care [^8dd44f8f].

## Clinical evidence summary

### Primary outcomes

Incidence of PPD: At 7 days, positive PPD screening fell from 32.1% to 12.6% (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25–0.62; P < .001); at 42 days, from 30.3% to 11.4% (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23–0.61; P < .001) [^5a1c8246] [^1872d03c]. Suicidal ideation: At 7 days, suicidal ideation was lower (1.2% vs 5.5%; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05–1.00), but not at 42 days (2.4% vs 4.2%; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17–1.89) [^a53e132f].

---

### Secondary outcomes

Sleep quality: Significantly improved in the dexmedetomidine group [^db531b70] [^1872d03c]. Postoperative pain: Reduced in the dexmedetomidine group [^db531b70] [^1872d03c].

---

### Safety outcomes

Overall adverse events: Similar between groups (27.2% vs 19.5%; P = 0.10) [^90b6ec55] [^1872d03c]. Hypotension: More frequent with dexmedetomidine (18.3% vs 9.5%; RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.13–4.10; P = 0.02) [^90b6ec55] [^1872d03c]. Sedation: Ramsay scores remained ~2 (awake, cooperative), indicating minimal excess sedation [^90b6ec55] [^1872d03c].

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to PPD

Dexmedetomidine's antidepressant effects may reflect **BDNF upregulation** and pro-BDNF downregulation, supporting synaptic plasticity and mood regulation [^4d6d664c] [^51620377]. Alpha-2 adrenergic modulation reduces sympathetic tone and anxiety, which may further contribute to mood benefits [^4d6d664c].

---

## Safety considerations in pregnancy and lactation

- **Placental transfer**: Dexmedetomidine crosses the placenta; human data after the first trimester are limited, and animal data show fetal toxicity at high doses [^46c32e11] [^80f28a8c].

- **Breastfeeding**: Low relative infant dose (0.02–0.098%) and short detectability in milk (≤ 24 h) suggest minimal risk, but infants should be monitored for irritability [^fd23da40] [^241aefbf].

- **Regulatory status**: FDA labeling advises use in pregnancy only if benefits outweigh risks; no established safety in labor and delivery [^a5f7f198].

---

## Comparison with standard PPD prevention strategies

| **Intervention** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Dexmedetomidine | RR 0.39 for PPD at 7–42 days | Hypotension; low RID in milk | Single RCT; peri-delivery use |
| SSRIs | Moderate reduction in PPD | Fetal/neonatal risks; compatible with breastfeeding | Established option; prenatal use |
| Psychotherapy | Moderate reduction in PPD | No pharmacologic risks | First-line for mild-moderate PPD |
| Brexanolone | Rapid, robust PPD reduction | Requires inpatient infusion; limited lactation data | Postpartum use; high cost |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines do not address dexmedetomidine for PPD prevention; ACOG and SOGC emphasize **established screening and treatment** (SSRIs, psychotherapy, brexanolone) and shared decision-making for pharmacotherapy in pregnancy and postpartum [^8dd44f8f] [^3f178c2d].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Patient selection**: Consider dexmedetomidine for women with prenatal depression undergoing cesarean delivery, especially with high PPD risk or prior episodes.

- **Monitoring**: Use continuous blood pressure monitoring during infusion; treat hypotension promptly.

- **Coordination**: Engage obstetrics, anesthesia, and pediatrics; discuss breastfeeding plans and infant monitoring.

- **Documentation**: Record informed consent, rationale, and monitoring plan.

---

## Discussion with the patient

I would explain that dexmedetomidine **reduces PPD risk by about 60%** and improves sleep and pain, but may cause low blood pressure and requires monitoring; infant exposure via breast milk appears low, though we will watch for irritability [^5a1c8246] [^fd23da40]. I would also review standard options (SSRIs, psychotherapy) and tailor the plan to her preferences and risk profile [^8dd44f8f].

---

## Conclusion and clinical decision

Dexmedetomidine **significantly reduces PPD risk** in women with prenatal depression undergoing cesarean delivery, with favorable effects on sleep and pain and manageable hypotension risk. Given limited pregnancy data, I would individualize use, prioritize close monitoring, and integrate with standard PPD care and breastfeeding support [^1872d03c] [^8dd44f8f].

Importance

Postpartum depression (PPD) is emerging as a major public health problem worldwide. Although the particular period and context in which PPD occurs provides an opportunity for preventive interventions, there is still a lack of pharmacologic prevention strategies for PPD.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine for prevention of PPD among women with prenatal depression undergoing cesarean delivery.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This randomized clinical trial enrolled 338 women who screened positive for prenatal depression at 2 hospitals in Hunan, China from March 28, 2022, to April 16, 2023. Women with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of more than 9 who were 18 years of age or older and were scheduled for elective cesarean delivery were eligible.

Interventions

Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the dexmedetomidine group or the control group via centrally computer-generated group randomization. Dexmedetomidine, 0.5 μg/kg and 0.9% saline were intravenously infused for 10 minutes after delivery in the dexmedetomidine and control groups, respectively. After infusion, sufentanil or dexmedetomidine plus sufentanil was administered via patient-controlled intravenous analgesia for 48 hours in the control group and dexmedetomidine group, respectively.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was positive PPD screening results at 7 and 42 days post partum, defined as a postpartum Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score of more than 9. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis.

Results

All 338 participants were female, with a mean (SD) age of 31.5 (4.1) years. Positive PPD screening incidence at 7 and 42 days post partum in the dexmedetomidine group vs the control group was significantly decreased (day 7, 21 of 167 [12.6%] vs 53 of 165 [32.1%]; risk ratio, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.25–0.62]; P < .001; day 42, 19 of 167 [11.4%] vs 50 of 165 [30.3%]; risk ratio, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.23–0.61]; P < .001). The dexmedetomidine group showed no significant difference in adverse events vs the control group (46 of 169 [27.2%] vs 33 of 169 [19.5%]; P = 0.10), but the incidence of hypotension increased (31 of 169 [18.3%] vs 16 of 169 [9.5%]; risk ratio, 2.15 [95% CI, 1.13–4.10]; P = 0.02).

Conclusions and Relevance

Dexmedetomidine administration in the early postpartum period significantly reduced the incidence of a positive PPD screening and maintained a favorable safety profile.

Methods

Design and Participants

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at The Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (approximately 2000 cesarean deliveries per year) and Hunan Maternal and Child Health Hospital (approximately 9000 cesarean deliveries per year) from March 28, 2022, to April 16, 2023. The protocol (Supplement 1) was approved by the ethics committees of the 2 study centers. All patients provided written informed consent before participation. We followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline for the designing and reporting of this trial.

The participants were parturients who underwent elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia and required postoperative patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA). Inclusion criteria were as follows: 18 years of age or older, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade II, prenatal depression (defined as a prenatal Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS] score > 9,), and the ability to reliably communicate with the investigators and follow study instructions. Exclusion criteria included allergy to dexmedetomidine, heart rate of less than 50 beats per minute or presence of cardiac conduction or rhythm abnormalities such as sick sinus syndrome, preoperative hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), unstable mental illness, and a history of psychotropic substance abuse.

Randomization and Blinding

Eligible parturients were randomized to receive dexmedetomidine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio by an online central randomization system. Sixty participants in each group were randomly selected for venous blood sampling. Data were collected and managed by independent staff using an electronic data capture system.

Participants in the dexmedetomidine and control groups were kept blinded to their group assignment. This study involved researchers who conducted the evaluation (blinded) and researchers who administered the treatment (unblinded). The unblinded researchers who administered the interventions were not involved in the evaluation of the postoperative outcomes.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, we randomly selected only a small number of patients to monitor BDNF levels, and the results from 7 days and 42 days post partum were not available. Further studies are needed to verify the role of BDNF in the antidepressant effect of dexmedetomidine. Second, the dose of dexmedetomidine was determined based on previous single-dose studies. The optimal effective dose of dexmedetomidine needs further research. Third, the EPDS score cannot diagnose PPD; it can only be used as a positive screening tool for PPD.

The study Dexmedetomidine in PPD was published by Yingyong Zhou and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Netw Open. This study is related to the following diseases: Peripartum depression. In the Dexmedetomidine in PPD study, the trial question was: what is the effect of dexmedetomidine on postpartum depression in women with prenatal depression? In the Dexmedetomidine in PPD study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Dexmedetomidine in PPD study, the population was: 338 female patients. The inclusion criteria were adult women with prenatal depression undergoing Cesarean delivery. In the Dexmedetomidine in PPD study, the interventions were: n = 169 dexmedetomidine (loading dose of intravenous infusion of 0.5 mcg/kg for 10 minutes after delivery, followed by dexmedetomidine plus sufentanil via patient-controlled intravenous analgesia for 48 hours) n = 169 normal saline (loading dose of intravenous infusion of 0.9% saline for 10 minutes after delivery, followed by sufentanil via patient-controlled intravenous analgesia for 48 hours). In the Dexmedetomidine in PPD study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in positive postpartum depression screening incidence at 7 days postpartum (12.6% vs. 32.1%; RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.62). In the Dexmedetomidine in PPD study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in positive postpartum depression screening incidence at 42 days post partum (11.4% vs. 30.3%; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.61) Significant decrease in the rate of suicidal ideation postpartum day 7 (1.2% vs. 5.5%; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 1) No significant difference in the rate of suicidal ideation postpartum day 42 (2.4% vs. 4.2%; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.89). In the Dexmedetomidine in PPD study, the safety outcomes were: significant difference in hypotension (18.3% vs. 9.5%). In the Dexmedetomidine in PPD study, the conclusion was: in adult women with prenatal depression undergoing Cesarean delivery, dexmedetomidine was superior to normal saline with respect to positive postpartum depression screening incidence at 7 days postpartum.

Safety Assessments

There was no significant difference in AEs between the dexmedetomidine and the control groups (46 of 169 [27.2%] vs 33 of 169 [19.5%]; P = 0.10), but the incidence of hypotension increased (31 of 169 [18.3%] vs 16 of 169 [9.5%]; risk ratio, 2.15 [95% CI, 1.13–4.10]; P = 0.02) (Table 3). There was no significant difference in common adverse reactions such as dizziness, bradycardia, nausea, and vomiting. The severity of AEs was 1 to 2 in both groups, except for 1 patient (0.6%) in the dexmedetomidine group, who had a grade 3 AE (classified as a serious AE due to headache from postoperative cerebrospinal fluid loss and prolonged hospital stay). The Ramsay Sedation Scale scores of the 2 groups were close to 2 points (awake, no restlessness) at 6, 24, and 48 hours post partum.

Further analysis showed that in the control group, the change value of pro-BDNF was significantly higher among patients with a positive PPD screening vs those with a nonpositive PPD screening at 7 and 42 days post partum, with BDNF showing a decreasing trend. However, no significant correlation was evident between positive PPD screening occurrence and BDNF or pro-BDNF levels in the dexmedetomidine group. This finding may be related to the insufficient sample size due to the lower number of positive PPD screenings in the dexmedetomidine group. Although a complexity of processes may be linked to the alterations in BDNF and pro-BDNF in this study, the changes in plasma BDNF and especially pro-BDNF may serve as a readily accessible, sensitive predictor of PPD.

Suicide is the leading cause of perinatal death, highlighting the importance of suicidal ideation screening of mothers at high risk to initiate clinical intervention. Our study showed that dexmedetomidine significantly reduced suicidal ideation at 7 days post partum but not 42 days post partum, unlike in the previous exploratory study in which suicide ideation was decreased by dexmedetomidine at both time points. This discrepancy could be attributed to a lower incidence of suicidal ideation post partum in the study sample or an insufficient sample size. The emphasis of the present study on women at high risk of PPD may also have influenced these results due to the 2-day postoperative drug treatment being insufficient at the later time point for more severe PPD presentations. Further studies will be required to clarify.

Procedures

A comprehensive preoperative assessment and baseline data collection were conducted. Vital signs were monitored after entering the operating room. After delivery of the infant, participants in the dexmedetomidine group were administered 0.5 μg/kg of dexmedetomidine in 20 mL of 0.9% saline for 10 minutes. The placebo group received 20 mL of 0.9% saline for the same duration. All participants received PCIA immediately after completion of the 10-minute infusion (dexmedetomidine group, dexmedetomidine, 2.0 μg/kg, plus sufentanil, 2.2 μg/kg, diluted in 100 mL; control group, sufentanil, 2.2 μg/kg, diluted in 100 mL). The PCIA was set for continuous infusion at a rate of 2 mL/h for 48 hours. Vital signs, adverse events (AEs), Ramsay Sedation Scale score, and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain score were recorded during the treatment period. Participants' EPDS scores were followed up by telephone at 7 and 42 days after delivery. If a participant could not be contacted at 7 and/or 42 days after the procedure, the investigator made telephone contact again within 2 days. Failure to make contact was considered a loss to follow-up.

Peripheral venous blood (3 mL) was drawn from participants included in the BDNF analysis before the administration of anesthesia and at the cessation of PCIA. These samples were placed in EDTA-containing anticoagulant tubes and processed within 1 hour by centrifugation (2000 g, 4 °C, 15 minutes) to separate the plasma. The separated plasma was stored in a freezer at −80 °C for later use. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and pro-BDNF levels in the plasma were measured by another researcher who was blinded to the group. Measurement of BDNF and pro-BDNF levels in plasma was performed using the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method according to the instructions of the DuoSet ELISA Development Kit (R&D Systems Inc). All samples were analyzed in duplicate. The assay ranges of BDNF and pro-BDNF were 62.5 to 4000 pg/mL and 78.1 to 5000 pg/mL, respectively. The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were less than 10%.

### Caring for two: management of the critically ill cardiac patient during pregnancy [^d9bac692]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacotherapy in the critically ill cardiac patient

Pharmacokinetics is fundamentally altered by pregnancy. Fetal effects of medication administration to the pregnant patient must also be given careful consideration, especially given varying hormonal levels during the trimesters. In general, resuscitative efforts in the critically ill patient should prioritize health of the pregnant individual and this is similarly true for drug therapies. Clinically indicated drugs should not be withheld out of concern for fetal well-being if no therapeutic alternatives exist. In cases of clinical equipoise, the possible benefits and risks to both mother and fetus must be weighed thoughtfully, considering patient values in consultation with a multidisciplinary team.

Decreased gastric motility and increased gastric pH reduce enteral absorption is and bioavailability of oral medications delaying time to peak effect. Increased intravascular volume and volume of distribution for hydrophilic drugs results in decreased serum concentrations. Pregnant individuals may require higher than typical doses to reach therapeutic targets. Conversely, decreased plasma protein concentrations subsequently increase the unbound drug fraction and may increase tissue distribution. Hepatic drug metabolism is variably affected during pregnancy, and discussion of these specific changes is beyond the scope of this review, it should be noted when prescribing medications with significant phase I/II metabolism. Finally, substantial increases in glomerular filtration rate throughout pregnancy results in increased renal excretion of drugs.

Drug safety profiles remain challenging to classify in pregnancy. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration instituted the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule, replacing the former letter classification system (A-D or X). The primary goals were to increase the availability of evidence to health care providers and clarify what was felt to be an overly reductionist categorical classification system. The Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule focuses on summarizing the available data, which is often limited to preclinical and registry studies.

Sedative and analgesic medications considered low risk in pregnant patients include opioids, propofol, and dexmedetomidine. These are preferred over benzodiazepines and ketamine which have a less favorable safety profile. Caution should be taken with any sedative or analgesia use near delivery due to increased risk of neonatal respiratory and neurologic depression. Despite limited retrospective data, vasopressors and inotropes are generally considered compatible in pregnancy for hemodynamic support of shock states, despite limited retrospective data. Sympathomimetics are known to cause constriction of uterine vessels and reduction in placental blood flow; however, untreated hypotension also contributes to fetal hypoperfusion. Providers should target a mean arterial pressure > 65 mm Hg. Appropriate fetal monitoring can help detect associated obstetrical complications.

### Effect of dexmedetomidine on postpartum depression in women with prenatal depression: a randomized clinical trial [^4d6d664c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This randomized clinical trial demonstrates the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine for women with prenatal depression. Preventive administration of dexmedetomidine in the early postpartum period can reduce positive PPD screening incidence, reduce postoperative pain, and improve sleep quality, with a favorable safety profile. The dexmedetomidine antidepressant effect seems to involve BDNF upregulation.

Dexmedetomidine has central antisympathetic, antianxiety, and sedative effects similar to natural sleep and has certain analgesic effects. This study indicated that preventive dexmedetomidine administration may decrease positive PPD screening incidence and reduce the postpartum EPDS score among women at high risk for PPD. A study by Metz et alshowed increased α 2 2-AR density in platelets among patients with PPD, which was reversed after successful mood improvement after antidepressant treatment. The involvement of the α 2 -AR in mood dysregulation is also indicated by its upregulation in several brain areas in patients with depression, as well as by preclinical data showing α 2 -AR gene knockout mice to show depression-like behavior that is not sensitive to tricyclic antidepressants. This finding is further supported by the data in the present study showing that α 2 -AR activation by dexmedetomidine in the early postpartum period decreased the presence of functional and mood deficits among patients with prenatal depression who were susceptible to PPD. The results of the present study are therefore consistent with those of a previous exploratory study in postpartum women.

The present results indicate that early postpartum dexmedetomidine administration reduces positive PPD screening incidence and significantly increases plasma BDNF levels, while downregulating plasma pro-BDNF levels. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor plays a crucial role in neuronal growth, development, and synaptic plasticity and acts as a neuromodulator. Pro-BDNF, a precursor of BDNF, has the opposite function and promotes depression and anxiety. Brain BDNF can cross the blood-brain barrier into the circulation, with brain BDNF level positively correlating with blood BDNF level. Therefore, the level of BDNF in peripheral blood roughly mirrors its level in the central nervous system. Both clinical and preclinical investigations have shown dexmedetomidine to upregulate BDNF expression while downregulating pro-BDNF. A clinical study by Lee et alshowed that the plasma BDNF level of women with postpartum depression decreased significantly, which was reversed on mood recovery. A study by Gao et alof 340 Chinese women also indicated that the decrease in prenatal serum BDNF level was closely related to PPD occurrence within 3 months and could be used as a biomarker to predict PPD. Other studies of patients with depression show similar results to those in the present study. All of these results are consistent with our study.

Neuraxial adjuvants and monitoring — postcesarean analgesia in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD): The use of adjuvants, especially those with sedative properties, warrants appropriate respiratory monitoring in an appropriate care unit, particularly if neuraxial or systemic opioids are coadministered. There is limited evidence to support or refute routinely using nonopioid neuraxial adjuvants including clonidine, dexmedetomidine, epinephrine, or neostigmine, for postcesarean delivery analgesia in patients with OUD (Level C-LD); if used, side effects including respiratory depression, sedation, and nausea must be monitored (Class I, Level C-EO). Intrathecal epinephrine is reasonable to increase the duration of sensory block during cesarean delivery (Class IIa, Level B-NR). The benefits of neuraxial neostigmine for postcesarean analgesia remain unclear and side effects (severe nausea, vomiting) may limit its use in pregnant people with and without OUD (Class III, Level C-LD).

### Dexmedetomidine for chronic pain patients with anxiety and depression: a propensity score matching cohort study [^4ff2c659]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first cohort study to investigate the potential application of DEX in managing chronic pain in patients with comorbid anxiety and depression disorders. The results suggest that intraoperative DEX administration is associated with greater improvements in anxiety and depression, as measured by GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores through PSM. Additionally, the intraoperative DEX application correlated with a significant reduction in pain, with a mean difference of 0.59 (95% CI [0.15, 1.03], P = 0.010), although this difference is minimal and does not reach a clinically meaningful threshold.

Patients who received dexmedetomidine infusions during their interventional pain management procedures reported higher levels of satisfaction compared to those who received only local analgesia (8.6 Vs. 5.7). The mean satisfaction score for the dexmedetomidine group was notably higher, suggesting that the combination of improved anxiety management, pain relief, and overall procedural experience contributed to a more positive overall experience for these patients.

Consistent with our findings, previous trials have explored the efficacy of short-term DEX infusion in reducing depression. Zhou et al. reported that DEX effectively reduced postpartum depression symptoms, similar to our findings in chronic pain patients. A meta-analysis focusing on the use of perioperative intravenous DEX for postpartum depression demonstrated improvements in both analgesia and sleep quality. Additionally, a study comparing melatonin, DEX, and gabapentin for postoperative pain and anxiety following laminectomy found that DEX alleviated both pain and anxiety.

Chronic pain is a complex condition often accompanied by significant psychological distress, with anxiety and depression being common comorbidities. The bidirectional relationship between pain and psychological disorders creates a vicious cycle where each condition exacerbates the other, complicating treatment. In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated DEX as an adjunct in managing chronic pain patients with anxiety and depression. Our findings suggest that DEX may serve as a dual-purpose therapy, addressing both the physical and emotional aspects of chronic pain.

8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

Available data from published randomized controlled trials and case reports over several decades of use with intravenously administered dexmedetomidine during pregnancy have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage; however, the reported exposures occurred after the first trimester. Most of the available data are based on studies with exposures that occurred at the time of caesarean section delivery, and these studies have not identified an adverse effect on maternal outcomes or infant Apgar scores. Available data indicate that dexmedetomidine crosses the placenta.

In animal reproduction studies, fetal toxicity that lower fetal viability and reduced live fetuses occurred with subcutaneous administration of dexmedetomidine to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses 1.8 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 17.8 mcg/kg/day.

Developmental toxicity (low pup weights and adult offspring weights, decreased F1 grip strength, increased early implantation loss and decreased viability of second-generation offspring) occurred when pregnant rats were subcutaneously administered dexmedetomidine at doses less than the clinical dose from late pregnancy through lactation and weaning (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.

Nonopioid neuraxial adjuncts for labor analgesia in OUD — Alternative nonopioid adjuncts may be considered, which can help minimize the local concentration requirements to reduce motor block, hypotension, and risk of assisted vaginal delivery while minimizing exposure to neuraxial opioids. Neuraxial clonidine or dexmedetomidine provide similar analgesia compared to neuraxial fentanyl for labor analgesia infusions and may be an alternative to neuraxial opioids for pregnant people with OUD or patients who wish to avoid all opioids. An observational study of epidural clonidine in 7 patients receiving buprenorphine MOUD reported effective management of labor pain without the need for additional medication in most cases, with hypotension noted and without sedation or maternal bradycardia. Nonopioid neuraxial adjuncts may be used when pregnant people desire strict opioid avoidance or the analgesic efficacy of neuraxial opioid is deemed insufficient and after excluding a failed or malpositioned epidural catheter (Class IIa, Level C-EO). Epidural clonidine may be given as an epidural bolus for initiation of labor analgesia (50–100mcg), for management of breakthrough pain, or added to the epidural solution (1–2mcg/mL) if epidural local anesthetic boluses and local anesthetic or opioid adjustments have failed to provide adequate analgesia (Class IIa, Level C-EO). Neuraxial dexmedetomidine for labor analgesia should follow standard clinical applications (Class IIb, Level C-EO), with sedation and respiratory depression monitoring applied if not already utilized in institutional protocols (Class I, Level C-EO). Combining alpha2-agonist agents is not recommended (Class III, Level C-EO). If used, neuraxial adjuvants should be preservative free (Class I, Level C-EO). There are no high-quality trials examining the role of systemic dexmedetomidine in laboring people with OUD, and there are no available data regarding other nonopioid neuraxial adjuvants such as epinephrine or neostigmine.

Risk of bias assessment in included studies

Two review authors (NML, OR) will independently assess the risk of bias (low, high, or some concerns) of the result for the critical outcomes reported in each study using the RoB 2 tool. We will use the RoB 2 Excel tool, available at www.riskofbias.info/welcome/rob‐2‐0‐tool/current‐version‐of‐rob‐2. We plan to assess the risk of bias on the effect of assignment to the interventions (the intention‐to‐treat effect) for the results of the following critical outcomes, measured at the time points reported by the study authors, which typically cover a range from 30 minutes to three hours postadministration of the drug in question.

Degree of sedation
Degree of analgesia

We will use the following five domains to assess the risk of bias in the results in the individually randomised trials.

Bias arising from the randomisation process
Bias due to deviations from intended interventions
Bias due to missing outcome data
Bias in measurement of an outcome
Bias in selection of the reported result

For cluster‐RCTs, we will include a sixth domain (domain 1b) specific to the trial design to assess bias (i.e. bias arising from the timing of identification and recruitment of individual participants in relation to timing of randomisation).

We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or with the input of a third review author with a clinical background (KT). A detailed description of the signalling questions in each domain and how overall judgement is made is available in Supplementary material 3.

Data extraction and management

Two review authors (NML and OR) will independently extract and code all data for each included study, using a data collection form designed specifically for this review, and generated by the Covidence platform. We plan to pilot the form using at least two studies. We will resolve disagreements or discrepancies through discussion or in consultation with a third author (KT).

We will extract the following characteristics from each included study.

Identifying information: first author; year of publication; the date of the study; declared possible conflicts of interest
Study design and setting: trial design; duration; country and setting of trial
Population: sex; birth weight; gestational age; age and weight at recruitment; eligibility criteria; number of participants; cluster (if applicable); unit of allocation (e.g. individuals or NICU); number randomised to groups
Interventions and comparison: details on dexmedetomidine (constituents, concentration, dose, frequency, route of delivery); comparator; co‐interventions
Outcomes, as described in Outcome measures. Specifically, we plan to extract the following characteristics of the outcomes, as detailed in Chapter 5 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions: outcome domain or title; measurement tool or instrument (including definition of clinical outcomes or endpoints) together with the length and direction of the scale with definitions of any thresholds if appropriate; specific metric used to characterise each participant's results, e.g. change of end score, in the form of dichotomous or continuous data; method of aggregation (e.g. mean and standard deviation, or proportion of people with an event); timing of outcome measurements.

We will screen for duplicate entries of participants by matching the initial number of participants recruited against the total number at each step in the conduct of the study. If a discrepancy is discovered, we will look for an explanation in the article (e.g. multiple enrolments of the same participant in different painful procedures). We plan to contact the authors of the study for clarification or additional information when necessary.

We will describe ongoing studies and document available information such as the primary author, research question(s), methods and outcome measures, together with anticipated dates of commencement and completion, if reported, in the characteristics of ongoing studies table.

We will report detailed characteristics of included studies, excluded studies, and studies awaiting assessment in characteristics tables, and we will provide an overview of synthesis and included studies (OSIS) table.

### FDA warnings regarding use of general anesthetics and sedation drugs in young children and pregnant women [^564a9b5d]. ACOG (2016). Medium credibility.

Clinical application: limitations and concerns — pregnancy anesthesia exposure and FDA label warnings emphasize that when a nonobstetric surgery is performed during pregnancy, it is because it is medically indicated, that when analgesia is needed for delivery (included cesarean delivery) it is usually regional analgesia and not general anesthesia, and that it is unlikely that the period of fetal exposure would reach hypothetically harmful ranges. The FDA states that health care professionals should "balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in young children and pregnant women against the potential risk, especially for procedures that may last longer than 3 hours", and ACOG agrees with and supports this approach; however, adding label warnings may cause patients and providers to inappropriately reject medically indicated drugs, and the risks of inappropriately withholding them include delaying medically indicated procedures, withholding a medically indicated procedure or substituting it with a less-appropriate procedure, and unnecessary discomfort or pain.

trials based upon the dose-ranging findings of the initial pharmacokinetic studies. A separate open-label study will be conducted for the 28 weeks gestational age to < 1 month chronological age group. Efficacy will be evaluated based on the percentage of patients who do not require rescue midazolam sedation using a. and efficacy endpoints. The PWR requested that the primary efficacy endpoint should be the percentage of patients who didn't require rescue midazolam for sedation. A sufficient number of patients to provide a power of at least 80% to detect a statistically significant difference in the primary efficacy endpoint must complete the studies. Pediatric patients must be approximately evenly distributed between Reference ID: 3312516 5. by a maintenance infusion for up to 24 hours. Sedation/pain score was assessed using the Neonatal Pain, Agitation, and Sedation Scale.

Rescue medication was administered as needed for sedation and pain based on the N-PASS score.

2. 4 Results and Conclusions Table 11 presents the percentages of subjects who required rescue midazolam for sedation. No subjects of 28 through 36 weeks gestational age required rescue midazolam. Among subjects of 36 to 44 weeks gestational age, one subject in dose level 1, one subject in dose level 2 and two. subjects in dose level 3 required rescue midazolam. Neither data from Study DEX-09-08 alone or in combination with Study DEX-11-06 suggested that subjects receiving a higher dose of Precedex were less likely to require rescue midazolam for sedation compared to subjects receiving a lower dose. The highest dose level even had numerically higher percent of subjects. 100% 100% ≥ 36 to ≤ 45 weeks 98% 98% 98% all subjects 100% 100% 99% Source: Clinical Study Report.

### A systematic scoping review of peridelivery pain management for pregnant people with opioid use disorder: from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology and society for maternal fetal medicine [^c2845184]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of pregnant people with opioid use disorder (OUD), including those receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), is increasing. Challenges associated with pain management in people with OUD include tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and risk for return to use. Yet, there are few evidence-based recommendations for pain management in the setting of pregnancy and the postpartum period, and many peripartum pain management studies exclude people with OUD. This scoping review summarized the available literature on peridelivery pain management in people with OUD, methodologies used, and identified specific areas of knowledge gaps. PubMed and Embase were comprehensively searched for publications in all languages on peripartum pain management among people with OUD, both treated with MOUD and untreated. Potential articles were screened by title, abstract, and full text. Data abstracted were descriptively analyzed to map available evidence and identify areas of limited or no evidence. A total of 994 publications were imported for screening on title, abstracts, and full text, yielding 84 publications identified for full review: 32 (38.1%) review articles, 14 (16.7%) retrospective studies, and 8 (9.5%) case reports. There were 5 randomized controlled trials. Most studies (64%) were published in perinatology (32; 38.1%) journals or anesthesiology (22; 26.2%) journals. Specific areas lacking trial or systematic review evidence include: (1) methods to optimize psychological and psychosocial comorbidities relevant to acute pain management around delivery; (2) alternative nonopioid and nonpharmacologic analgesia methods; (3) whether or not to use opioids for severe breakthrough pain and how best to prescribe and monitor its use after discharge; (4) monitoring for respiratory depression and sedation with coadministration of other analgesics; (5) optimal neuraxial analgesia dosing and adjuncts; and (6) benefits of abdominal wall blocks after cesarean delivery. No publications discussed naloxone coprescribing in the labor and delivery setting. We observed an increasing number of publications on peripartum pain management in pregnant people with OUD. However, existing published works are low on the pyramid of evidence (reviews, opinions, and retrospective studies), with a paucity of original research articles (< 6%). Opinions are conflicting on the utility and disutility of various analgesic interventions. Studies generating high-quality evidence on this topic are needed to inform care for pregnant people with OUD. Specific research areas are identified, including utility and disutility of short-term opioid use for postpartum pain management, role of continuous wound infiltration and truncal nerve blocks, nonpharmacologic analgesia options, and the best methods to support psychosocial aspects of pain management.

### Childbirth pain, labor epidural analgesia, and postpartum depression: recent evidence and future directions [^87ec3cc0]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Postpartum pain and PPD can also affect postpartum opioid requirements. A retrospective cohort study showed that in comparison with women without PPD, those with PPD following CD reported higher daily and average numeric rating pain scores postpartum (2.4 vs 1.7 average; P < 0.001) and used more morphine milligram equivalents each day during their postpartum hospitalization (121 mg [60.5–214.5] vs 75 mg [28.5–133.5], P < 0.001). However, effective pain control may protect against PPD in women who have undergone CD. Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of analgesic agents on pain control and the incidence of PPD. Yu et alreported that dexmedetomidine administered via patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) after CD could be useful for alleviating PPD on postoperative days 7 and 42. Similar results were reported by We et alwho showed that tramadol PCIA can help in reducing the risk of PPD 4 weeks postoperatively. These findings are promising because medical advancements can improve the delivery experience, and it is possible to minimize postpartum pain with effective pain management, which may present a significant opportunity for the prevention of PPD.

On the basis of these associations, it is reasonable to infer that the mitigation of labor pain through epidural analgesia may decrease the incidence of PPD. Good pain relief during delivery can give the mother better opportunities to cope after delivery and may thus help the mother to better interact with her infant. Since LEA is the most effective, and the gold standard, for labor analgesia and is increasingly available, an investigation on this topic is of interest and value. In some previous studies, provision of LEA was hypothesized to reduce the risk of PPD. However, some study results have contradicted these findings. Thus, despite numerous studies, the association between LEA exposure and PPD risk has not been well established.

In this review, 16 studies including 3 meta-analyses were selected after thorough evaluation (Tables 1 and 2), which assessed the association between LEA and PPD.

### Analgesic outcomes in opioid use disorder patients receiving spinal anesthesia with or without intrathecal clonidine for cesarean delivery: a retrospective investigation [^359590ff]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) has risen among obstetric patients over time in parallel with the opioid epidemic in the United States, with one study reporting the incidence of OUD increased from 1.5 to 6.5 per 1000 delivery hospitalizations from 1999 to 2014. Opioid abuse or dependence in pregnancy increases the risk for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes including maternal death, cardiac arrest, placental abruption, preterm labor, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth and neonatal abstinence syndrome. In addition, it can be particularly challenging to effectively manage postoperative pain after cesarean delivery in this patient population. Compared to control patients, previous retrospective studies have demonstrated patients maintained on either buprenorphine or methadone maintenance therapy have significantly higher daily opioid requirements after cesarean delivery, receiving approximately oral oxycodone 80–90mg per 24 hours. Uncontrolled pain following delivery is also independently predictive of both chronic pain and postpartum depression at 8 weeks. There are, however, only a few published case reports and small case series to guide pain management strategies for these patients. Previous authors have described intravenous (IV) patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), IV ketamine and dexmedetomidine infusions, regional blocks, and continuous epidural infusions containing combinations of local anesthetic, opioids and clonidine.

The use of neuraxial clonidine has demonstrated prolonged sensory and motor blockade, reduced 24-hour opioid consumption, and longer time to first analgesic request after cesarean delivery compared to control patients not receiving clonidine. However, the effects of intrathecal (IT) clonidine have not been specifically studied in obstetric patients with OUD. Neuraxial clonidine may be of particular benefit in patients with OUD given that it is a non-opioid medication and these patients can be resistant to the effects of opioids. Clonidine also has analgesic properties, working in part by stimulating post-synaptic alpha 2 adrenergic receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and reducing afferent transmission of painful stimuli. Given the potential analgesic benefits of IT clonidine coupled with the lack of published material on the use of this medication in obstetric patients with OUD, we were compelled to complete a retrospective investigation among patients that delivered at our institution. In this retrospective study we sought to compare OUD patients undergoing cesarean delivery that received IT clonidine to a control group that did not receive IT clonidine and observe potential differences in analgesic outcomes (24-hour opioid requirements, pain scores, time to first post-operative pain medication, IV patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) use and regional nerve blocks) or side-effects (hypotension, vasopressor dosing and bradycardia).

### Multimodal acute pain management in the parturient with opioid use disorder: a review [^2040b3a1]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Ketamine

Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that has been used for pain relief during labor and delivery. It works by blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the brain, which helps to reduce pain perception. It is metabolized in the liver and has a half-life of 45 minutes. Ketamine has also been shown to have some potential benefits for the parturient with OUD, as it may reduce the need for opioids and help to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms. A retrospective study examined the use of ketamine for pain relief in women with OUD who were undergoing labor and found that ketamine was associated with a lower rate of postdelivery opioid use and a shorter hospital stay compared to other forms of analgesia. Another randomized controlled study included 60 patients who underwent cesarean delivery and were given a single intravenous 30 mg bolus of ketamine. The results revealed decreased pain scores and opioid consumption in the first 24 hours post-operatively. Several studies have showed that ketamine and its metabolites appear in low levels in breast milk. Although these results suggest that risk to breastfed neonates is low, ketamine breast milk transmission and its use in pregnant patients with OUD has not been studied; thus, breastfed neonates of mothers who receive ketamine should still be carefully monitored.

Dexmedetomidine

Dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, is now commonly used as an adjuvant for sedative, analgesic, and anti-sympathetic effects in general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, nerve block anesthesia, topical anesthesia, and postoperative analgesia. There are potential side effects like hypotension and bradycardia, which must be taken into consideration by clinicians. A suggested dosing for post cesarean delivery analgesia is intravenous bolus 1 mcg/kg over 10–20 minutes, followed by an intravenous infusion of 0.4–1.2 mcg/kg/hour.

Dexmedetomidine is a sedative agent with limited dosing, safety, and efficacy information in the neonatal population. This comprehensive review describes the available evidence summarizing the use of dexmedetomidine in various neonatal populations. We identified 21 studies and 1 case report supporting the efficacy and short-term safety of DEX in neonates. Reported dosing ranges from 0.5–1.5mcg/kg/h with or without loading doses. Clinically relevant adverse effects include bradycardia and hypotension. Future studies are needed to determine long-term safety and facilitate clinical applicability.

Depression and anxiety during pregnancy are common, and patients and providers are faced with complex decisions regarding various treatment modalities. A structured discussion of the risks and benefits of options with the patient and her support team is recommended to facilitate the decision-making process. This clinically focused review, with emphasis on the last 3 years of published study data, evaluates the major risk categories of medication treatments, namely pregnancy loss, physical malformations, growth impairment, behavioral teratogenicity, and neonatal toxicity. Nonpharmacological treatment options, including neuromodulation and psychotherapy, are also briefly reviewed. Specific recommendations, drawn from the literature and the authors' clinical experience, are also offered to help guide the clinician in decision-making.

### A systematic review and narrative synthesis on the histological and neurobehavioral long-term effects of dexmedetomidine [^86a843b0]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In December 2016, the FDA issued a warning about the use of general anesthetics and sedative drugs in young children (0‐3 years of age) and pregnant women in their third trimester. 1 There is conflicting evidence that currently used anesthetics can affect children's brain development. 2, 3, 4 Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha‐2 adrenoceptor agonist, is a sedative with analgesic sparing properties. Therefore, it has been suggested as an alternative nontoxic sedative drug. 5 It is already clinically widely used as a sedative in adults and increasingly used in pediatric health care for sedation. 6 Due to its sedative, analgesic and anesthetic‐sparing properties, dexmedetomidine can be used for anesthesia or procedural sedation. This might be advantageous in reducing the toxicity of anesthesia and minimizing concerns about adverse effects on children's brains. Still little is known, however, about the toxicity and long‐term effects (more than 48 hours after anesthesia) of dexmedetomidine in humans, especially in children. 5, 7, 8

Therefore, we performed a systematic review to qualitatively summarize the available information from preclinical studies in young animals and clinical studies in children on the effects of dexmedetomidine on neurotoxicity and neurobehavioral outcome.

### Bibliometric analysis on global analgesia in labor from 2002 to 2021 [^afb468e3]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

In contrast to the US, recent research in China has focused on the effects of anxiety and depression on childbirth. During pregnancy, delivery, and the puerperium, women are under great physical and mental stress. The process of childbirth is a persistent and intense source of stress for the mother, and the interaction between her poor mental state and labor pain creates a vicious cycle that induces a stress response that may threaten the health of the mother and child during delivery. Some Chinese scholars have reported that many factors contribute to the failure of epidural anesthesia, including the choice of drug dosage, type and mode of delivery, and timing. Among them, maternal psychological factors are important influencing factors. Not only that, anxious and depressed emotional state can have a great impact on postpartum hemorrhage. The Japanese study on nulliparous women focused on the effect of continuous background infusion (CBI) on Patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCRA). A study by T Okutomi et alconcluded that when nulliparous women use background infusion, it reduces the amount of PCEA used, but does not reduce the total amount of ropivacaine and fentanyl used per hour after the start of the procedure. However, at the same time, other studies concluded that PCEA combined with CBI produced better analgesia while reducing the number of doses administered by the anesthesiologist.

For labor analgesia drugs have also been the focus of research in various countries. The most cited article is the use of tramadol, in which it is mentioned that when tramadol is used for labor analgesia, there is no significant difference in pain relief, labor interval, etc. compared to pethidine, but pethidine shows more and more severe adverse effects. In some other studies tramadol was found to have no respiratory depressant effect on the mother and newborn unlike pethidine, therefore tramadol is recommended for obstetric analgesia. Dexmedetomidine has various pharmacological effects such as sedation, analgesia, and anti-sympathetic. Some studies have shown that intravertebral application of dexmedetomidine can enhance the analgesic and sedative effects of intravertebral anesthesia, which brings new opportunities for the use of dexmedetomidine for epidural labor analgesia. It is also a new research hotspot for labor analgesia in China.

PRISMA Flowchart selection of included clinical studies. This figure shows an overview of the systematic search results and selection of the studies included for this systematic review. It shows the search found 240 studies, which we reduced to 0 studies included for the clinical part of this systematic review [Color figure can be viewed at]

The risk of bias analysis showed that allocation concealment (timing of randomization) was adequate in all studies and that all but one study were free from selective outcome reporting (Table 1).

Random outcome assessment was reported in none of the 20 studies; blinding for performance (eg, blinding of caregivers and researchers) was reported in seven studies and blinding for detection in 10 studies. No study was completely free from risk of bias (Table 1).

Study characteristics of the 20 included preclinical studies are reported in Table 2. The sample size ranged from 9 to 102 per study and from 2 to 25 animals per group (see Table S1, listing all study characteristics). Studies compared the effect of dexmedetomidine to that of another anesthetic (n = 15), control (saline) (n = 3), or both anesthetic and control (n = 2). In five studies, the anesthetics were administered to the mother during pregnancy and subsequently studied in the newborn animal. In 15 studies, the anesthetics were administered to young animals (P7‐P21). Eighteen studies concerned rats, one study pregnant monkeys, and one study pregnant ewes. Dexmedetomidine was mostly injected intraperitoneally, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously. In the monkey 14 and ewe 15 studies, it was injected intravenously and in one other study intracerebroventricularly. 16 It was given as a single or repeated bolus with an interval varying between 1 hour and 7 days. The total dose of dexmedetomidine per animal ranged from 2 to 525 µg/kg. In 17 studies, dexmedetomidine was administered in combination with another anesthetic agent, including ketamine (75 mg/kg intraperitoneal or intravenous infusion at 20 to 50 mg/kg/h for a period of 12 hours), 14, 17, 18 propofol (intraperitoneal 30 mg/kg/d for a period of 7 days to 100 mg/kg and 1.2 mg/kg/min as continuous infusion for 6 hours), 19, 20, 21, 22 and inhalation anesthetic (isoflurane 0.75%‐2.0%, sevoflurane 2.5%‐4% up to 6 hours). 15, 16, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31

Reporting bias assessment

We will contact study authors to request missing information, such as details on randomisation, blinding, or dropouts, to address the incomplete data issues. For unpublished data, we will flag any domain where details are insufficient as having unclear or high risk of bias. We will scrutinise discrepancies between study protocols (if available) and reported outcomes to ensure outcome reporting bias is minimised. Even in abstracts, we will look for information on the study's design (e.g. randomisation process, blinding, sample size). If critical methodological information is missing or unclear, we will rate the risk of bias in the corresponding domain/s as 'some concerns' or 'high'. If the abstract or unpublished study only provides preliminary results without sufficient detail, we will mark the study as having a potential high risk of bias. We will conduct sensitivity analyses by excluding unpublished studies and abstracts to see how they impact the overall results.

We will use funnel plots to screen for publication bias where there are a sufficient number of studies (> 10) reporting the same outcome. If publication bias is suggested by significant asymmetry of the funnel plot on visual assessment, we will incorporate the finding in our assessment of certainty of the evidence, leading to a downgrade in certainty. We will also report the findings narratively in the corresponding part of the Results section.

If our review includes fewer than 10 studies eligible for meta‐analysis, the ability to detect publication bias will be largely diminished, and we will simply note our inability to rule out possible publication bias or small study effects.

ABM Clinical Protocol #15 — dexmedetomidine, FDA exposure advisory, and neuromuscular blockers indicates that dexmedetomidine has low oral availability and that a single study of milk levels following infusion used during cesarean delivery determined that a breastfed infant would receive a relative infant dose (RID) of 0.04–0.098%. The United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 issued a Drug Safety Communication warning of the risk of using general anesthesia and some sedative medications in young children and pregnant women, focusing on possible effects on brain development when these agents are used repeatedly or for more than 3 hours, and it notes that there is no evidence to suggest a similar concern over use of anesthetic agents and medications in a breastfeeding mother. It adds that neuromuscular blocking agents are safe for the breastfeeding infant, as they have very low lipid solubility and are largely distributed in the extracellular fluid volume.

### Practice bulletin no. 162: prenatal diagnostic testing for genetic disorders [^a225f75b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Prenatal diagnostic testing for genetic disorders — definitions, objectives, limitations, and benefits are outlined: Prenatal genetic diagnostic testing is intended to determine, with as much certainty as possible, whether a specific genetic disorder or condition is present in the fetus, whereas prenatal genetic screening is designed to assess whether a patient is at increased risk of having a fetus affected by a genetic disorder. The objective of prenatal genetic testing is to detect health problems that could affect the woman, fetus, or newborn and provide the patient and her obstetrician–gynecologist or other obstetric care provider with enough information to allow a fully informed decision about pregnancy management. Prenatal genetic testing cannot identify all abnormalities or problems in a fetus, and any testing should be focused on the individual patient's risks, reproductive goals, and preferences. It is important that patients understand the benefits and limitations of all prenatal screening and diagnostic testing, including the conditions for which tests are available and the conditions that will not be detected by testing. It also is important that patients realize that there is a broad range of clinical presentations, or phenotypes, for many genetic disorders and that results of genetic testing cannot predict all outcomes. Stated benefits include reassuring patients when results are normal, identifying disorders for which prenatal treatment may provide benefit, optimizing neonatal outcomes by ensuring the appropriate location for delivery and the necessary personnel to care for affected infants, and allowing the opportunity for pregnancy termination.

### Consensus statement on pain management for pregnant patients with opioid use disorder from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^4732d843]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Nonopioid neuraxial adjuvants for cesarean patients with OUD — evidence: For postoperative analgesia, neuraxial clonidine has been described as an adjuvant for patients with OUD; in one small observational study after cesarean delivery (n = 7), a postoperative epidural infusion of bupivacaine 0.1% with clonidine 1.2mcg/mL or bupivacaine 0.0625% with clonidine 2 mcg/mL kept pain scores low (from 0 to 5/10 maximum) with an average infusion time of 27 hours. In one case report, intravenous dexmedetomidine was titrated from 0.2 to 0.7 μg/kg/h for 2 to 3 days after cesarean delivery, and it has been reported as associated with reduced parenteral sufentanil utilization for 24h after surgery; however, no studies have evaluated the impact of sedation side effects on breastfeeding, early ambulation, or other patient-centered goals. Intrathecal epinephrine (100 or 200 μg) administration is known to increase the duration of both sensory and motor blockades during and after cesarean delivery, but its impact on postoperative analgesic requirement and pain score is debatable and there is no study on neuraxial epinephrine effectiveness among patients with OUD undergoing cesarean delivery. In pregnant people without OUD, single-dose epidural neostigmine (75 to 300 μg) during cesarean delivery reduced pain scores for the first 24 hours (numeric rating score 5.4 (0.2) with saline vs 3.5 (0.3) with neostigmine) though sedation was more frequent with 300 μg; a meta-analysis identified 16 randomized controlled trials evaluating intrathecal or epidural neostigmine, of which 3 evaluated cesarean delivery, and intrathecal neostigmine increased nausea risk (OR, 8.99 [95% CI, 4.74–17.05], P < .001); there are no available studies on neostigmine for pain management after cesarean delivery among people with OUD.

### Synopsis of the 2023 U.S. department of VA and U.S. DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of pregnancy [^e795b27d]. Military Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Evidence quality and recommendation strength — The Work Group used the GRADE approach to craft each recommendation and determine its strength, and per the GRADE approach, recommendations must be evidence based and cannot be made based on expert opinion alone. The GRADE approach uses domains to inform recommendation strength: confidence in the quality of the evidence; balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes; patient values and preferences; and other considerations, as appropriate (e.g., resource use, equity, acceptability, feasibility, subgroup considerations). Using these four domains, the Work Group determined the relative strength of each recommendation (Strong or Weak), and the strength of a recommendation is defined as the extent to which one can be confident that the desirable effects of an intervention outweigh its undesirable effects. A Strong recommendation generally indicates High or Moderate confidence in the quality of the available evidence, a clear difference in magnitude between the benefits and harms of an intervention, similar patient values and preferences, and understood influence of other implications (e.g., resource use, feasibility). When evidence is insufficient, the Work Group might include a statement of insufficient evidence, might decide to exclude this type of statement, might remain silent where an absence of evidence occurs for a rarely used intervention, or that an intervention might have a favorable balance of benefits and harms but might be a standard of care for which no recent evidence has been generated.

### Factors that impact on women's decision-making around prenatal genomic tests: an international discrete choice survey [^279739bd]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Ongoing innovations in prenatal diagnosis, such as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and prenatal exome sequencing (ES), are increasing the possibility of finding a genetic diagnosis for the 2%–5% of pregnancies where a fetal anomaly has occurred. Obtaining a genetic diagnosis following an abnormal ultrasound scan in pregnancy can have multiple clinical benefits: a diagnosis enables accurate counseling around prognosis; informs decision making about pregnancy management; guides delivery planning and perinatal management and facilitates reproductive autonomy and psychological preparation.

Traditionally, prenatal diagnosis has relied on cytogenetic analysis, including karyotyping, and targeted genetic testing for suspected single gene disorders. Over the last decade, CMA has become a commonly used first‐line test, bringing higher diagnostic yields than karyotyping. More recently, prenatal testing options have widened further to include genome‐wide sequencing approaches such as ES and targeted panels which yield more diagnoses than either karyotyping or CMA alone.CMA and ES facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the fetal genome, but as diagnostic yields increase so does the chance of findings that have prognostic uncertainties such as variants of uncertain significance (VUS), susceptibility loci with low penetrance, as well as known variants that are unrelated to the original reason for testing (secondary findings ‐ SFs) which may or may not be looked for (the latter sometimes called 'incidental findings'), and which may increase an individual's risk for developing a condition but may not be 100% penetrant.

### Striving for balance in decisions on antenatal pharmacotherapy [^79660e24]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Most individuals use medication during pregnancy. However, decision making on antenatal pharmacotherapy presents considerable ethical and scientific challenges. Amid a sociocultural paradigm prioritising the elimination of fetal risks, available evidence and guidance are limited, and current decision making on antenatal drugs mostly proceeds in an ad-hoc and, often, biased manner. This approach might undermine the health of both mother and child. The need for a systematic approach towards antenatal drug decisions is becoming even more pressing with the growing knowledge of pregnancy-induced changes in drug disposition and effects. With this new complexity, pregnancy-specific doses might be necessary, potentially altering the balance between maternal and fetal benefits and risks. In this Viewpoint, we argue that ethical principles and a pregnant individual's values must be integrated alongside existing evidence when making decisions on antenatal drug use and dosing. We use the example of sertraline to outline practical strategies for achieving this goal. This approach is urgently needed to foster better-informed and balanced decisions on antenatal pharmacotherapy.

Telemedicine — access, outcomes, and patient experience in prenatal care indicates telemedicine is effective for medical care when in-person services are not necessary or can be completed through alternative means, can improve access to services, reduce patient and health system costs, and improve patient experience, and if access to care is increased through telemedicine visits, perinatal outcomes are equivalent to or improved when compared with in-person visits; in observational studies not all patients preferred telemedicine and satisfaction gains may be greatest for those who live the farthest from their care location. A 2023 systematic review including two randomized controlled trials, four nonrandomized comparative studies, and one survey reported equivalence of maternal and neonatal outcomes and improved maternal experience of care with telemedicine, but the models of care were heterogeneous (one to six visits), the quality of evidence was low, and studies were underpowered to detect rare outcomes; research on maternal mental health is mixed, and observational studies demonstrate that telehealth may be especially beneficial for interprofessional care or consultations.

### Dexmedetomidine for analgesia and sedation for procedural pain or discomfort in newborn infants [^9ea5e967]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Two review authors (NML, KT) will independently assess the certainty of the evidence for each of the outcomes above. We will consider evidence from RCTs as high certainty but downgrade the evidence by one level for serious (or two levels for very serious) limitations based upon the following: design (overall judgment on risk of bias), consistency across studies, directness of the evidence, precision of estimates and presence of publication bias. In considering the risk of bias, we will use the overall bias judgement (Supplementary material 3) to feed into the GRADE assessment. We will use the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool to create summary of findings tables to report the certainty of the evidence for the following comparisons, regardless of data availability.

Dexmedetomidine versus placebo
Dexmedetomidine versus opioids
Dexmedetomidine versus other non‐opioids
Dexmedetomidine versus other non‐opioid and opioid combinations
Dexmedetomidine versus non‐pharmacological measure

The GRADE approach results in an assessment of the certainty of a body of evidence in one of four grades.

High: We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate: We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
Low: Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low: We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

We will justify all decisions to downgrade the certainty of the evidence using footnotes and make comments to aid the reader's understanding of the review where necessary. We will report results with reference to Cochrane's MECIR Manual, Standards for the reporting of new Cochrane Intervention Reviews. We will construct the wording of the results statements in accordance with recommended narrative statements as described in Chapter 15, Table 15.6.b of the Cochrane Handbook.

Consumer involvement

No consumer was involved in the development of this protocol, although we use some of the outcomes stipulated in the core outcome set in neonatology, which were developed with the involvement of consumers, including infants' families and carers.

Measures of treatment effect

Dichotomous data

Where possible, we will express the treatment effect using the risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD), and the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH), if RD is significant, each with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Continuous data

For continuous data, we will express the treatment effect using the mean difference (MD) or standardised mean difference (SMD), each with a 95% CI.

We will undertake meta‐analysis for each of the intervention groupings prespecified in our review criteria. If there is insufficient clarity in the reported data, for example, whether the standard deviation (SD) or standard error (SE) is reported, we will contact the study authors for clarification. If clarification cannot be obtained, we will explicitly report any assumption we make on the data in our analysis.

We will narratively summarise skewed data reported as medians and interquartile ranges separately, without including them in the meta‐analysis.

### Dexmedetomidine for analgesia and sedation for procedural pain or discomfort in newborn infants [^eea2e3ed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Neonates managed in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) undergo multiple procedures daily, and many of these procedures are uncomfortable or painful. The most premature and critically ill, who are at the greatest risk of neurodevelopmental impairment, often require the largest number of painful invasive procedures, at a time when preterm infants are expected to grow and develop within the protective confines of the uterine environment. Newborn infants, including those born extremely preterm, not only have the capacity to perceive pain, but do so probably at a lower threshold than older infants, children, and adults. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of newborn infants' brains in response to acute noxious stimulation revealed that painful stimuli increased activity in 18 out of the 20 brain regions involved in pain in adults. These regions, involved in processing sensations and emotions, were activated at lower sensory thresholds than adults, supporting the notion that newborns probably have heightened sensitivity to pain compared to the rest of the population.

### Consensus statement on pain management for pregnant patients with opioid use disorder from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^c5527549]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Monitoring during and after labor for pregnant people with opioid use disorder (OUD) is addressed as follows: There are no studies explicitly examining whether pregnant people with OUD require additional monitoring during or after labor. When high doses of systemic opioids were used for labor or peripartum analgesia, the combination of respiratory depression and moderate sedation were observed 2.5 times more frequently among opioid-dependent patients, and analgesia was not acceptable as evidenced by higher postoperative pain scores. In the absence of coadministered systemic opioids beyond MOUD, there is no evidence of increased risk of respiratory depression for pregnant people with OUD receiving dilute neuraxial opioids. For neuraxial labor analgesia, usual standards for and duration of monitoring is recommended to be applied (Class I, Level C-EO), but if acute opioid toxicity or interacting sedating medications are present, additional monitoring for respiratory depression is indicated (Class I, Level C-LD). To diminish provider biases and assist with developing informed treatment plans, providers and nurses should be educated about the potential for increased pain post-vaginal delivery with higher vaginal laceration including potential risks for sedation/respiratory depression in pregnant people with OUD (Class I, Level C-EO).

### Sedation and analgesia from prolonged pain and stress during mechanical ventilation in preterm infants: is dexmedetomidine an alternative to current practice? [^ff69c404]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2022). High credibility.

Key messages

Mechanical ventilation is a potentially painful intervention. Opioids and benzodiazepines are widely used to provide analgesia and sedation in mechanically ventilated infants.
Evidence suggests that opioids may be ineffective analgesics and there may be adverse consequences such as respiratory depression and detrimental long-term neurodevelopmental effects.
Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, provides analgesia and simulates natural sleep with maintenance of spontaneous breathing and upper airway tone.
Emerging observational studies suggest that dexmedetomidine use in mechanically ventilated infants may reduce exposure to opioids/benzodiazepines and enable quicker weaning and extubation.
Data on safety and efficacy are scant. Adequately powered randomised controlled trials investigating use of dexmedetomidine in preterm infants are required.

Selection of studies

We will manage references identified by literature searches in reference management software and screen them using Covidence. The selection process will be guided by the Criteria for considering studies for this review. Two review authors (NML, OR, or MF) will independently undertake title/abstract review. Two review authors (NML, OR) will independently assess the full text of potentially relevant studies identified during title/abstract screening. At either stage, we will resolve disagreements by discussion or by consulting with a third review author (KT).

We will include studies reported as conference abstracts if they include sufficient data for extraction and analysis. In cases where there are insufficient data, we will attempt to contact study authors or identify the full report of the study. If we are unable to obtain sufficient information, we will cite the abstract in the list of studies awaiting assessment. In cases of missing or incomplete data, we will attempt to contact study authors for clarification or additional data. We will report our contact, or attempted contact, with study authors in the review.

If we identify studies in languages not read by review authors, we will use an online translation service such as Google Translate; if the translation is sufficient, we will use it. If it is insufficient, we will attempt to identify an individual conversant in the language of the report to translate the study. If translation by one of these methods is insufficient, we will place the study in the list of studies awaiting assessment.

If we identify a study or studies conducted by authors of this review, other authors will independently undertake selection, data extraction, risk of bias and GRADE assessment of the study or studies. In the event that multiple review authors are involved in an included study, we will recruit additional independent colleagues to undertake these tasks, with either acknowledgement or authorship depending on their contribution.

We will collate multiple reports of the same study so that each study, rather than each report, is the unit of interest in the review. We will record the selection process and report it both narratively and in a PRISMA flow diagram.

Methods

Research and design

This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Anhui Women and Child Health Care Hospital (No. 2017(10)) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants in the trial. The study was registered at Chictr.org.cn on 29/05/2020 with the registration number ChiCTR2000033356. This manuscript adheres to the applicable CONSORT guidelines.

Participants

From June to December 2020, healthy nulliparous women at 37 to 42 gestational weeks in spontaneous labor and desiring epidural labor analgesia at Anhui Women and Child Health Care Hospital were eligible. Inclusion in this study was based on the following criteria: (1) maternal age ranging from 20 to 35 years; (2) American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-II; (3) body mass index (BMI) 20–35 kg/cm 2; (4) singleton and spontaneous labor with cervical dilatation 2–3 cm; and (5) spontaneous labor pain with a visual analogue scale (VAS) score > 5 cm (VAS scores: 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable). The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) parturients refused to participate; (2) ASA class III-IV; (3) parturients complicated with severe cardiopulmonary or brain dysfunction; (4) parturients with HR < 50 bpm; (5) parturients had a history of opioid abuse; (6) parturients suffered from severe mental disorders and could not cooperate with the anesthesiologist; (7) parturients with BMI < 20 or > 35 kg/cm 2 because they often require an appropriately adjusted administration scheme for epidural labor analgesia; (8) cervical dilatation > 3 cm; (9) parturients with multiple deliveries or preterm deliveries (< 37 weeks); (10) any contraindications to epidural puncture, such as spinal deformity or coagulation dysfunction; and (11) those requiring cesarean section or induction of labor or delivery within 1 h after epidural catheterization. None of the parturients received any other analgesic treatment before the implementation of labor analgesia.

### Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (Precedex) [^fd23da40]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a study in the pregnant rat, placental transfer of dexmedetomidine was observed when radiolabeled dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously.

8.2 Lactation

 Risk Summary

Available published literature reports the presence of dexmedetomidine in human milk following intravenous administration (see DATA). There is no information regarding the effects of dexmedetomidine on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. Advise women to monitor the breastfed infant for irritability. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for PRECEDEX and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PRECEDEX or from the underlying condition.

Data

In two published clinical studies, a total of 14 women were given intravenous dexmedetomidine 6 mcg/kg/hour for 10 minutes after delivery followed by continuous infusion of 0.2–0.7 mcg/kg/hour. Breast milk and maternal blood samples were collected at 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours after discontinuation of dexmedetomidine. Plasma and milk dexmedetomidine concentrations were detectable up to 6 hours in most subjects, up to 12 hours in one subject and undetectable in all at 24 hours. The milk-to-plasma ratio from single paired maternal milk and plasma concentrations at each time point ranged from 0.53 to 0.95. The relative infant dose was estimated to range from 0.02 to 0.098%.

### FDA warnings regarding use of general anesthetics and sedation drugs in young children and pregnant women [^87213745]. ACOG (2016). Medium credibility.

FDA warnings regarding use of general anesthetics and sedation drugs in pregnancy — key points are that the warning is based on animal and pediatric data with no cited data in pregnant women, and the clinical significance is not known while the likelihood that a pregnant woman and her fetus would be vulnerable for the time periods suggested is extremely low. ACOG notes that its and obstetrician-gynecologists' input was not requested and expresses concern that the warning could potentially dissuade providers from providing medically indicated care during pregnancy. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other obstetric providers should continue to follow ACOG's clinical guidance as outlined in Committee Opinion 474, Nonobstetric Surgery During Pregnancy, and it is important to involve ACOG and obstetric providers in safety announcements that affect obstetric care.

### Dexmedetomidine for analgesia and sedation for procedural pain or discomfort in newborn infants [^52ff9bf1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Dealing with missing data

We will analyse the studies using the intention‐to‐treat principle, namely, analysing participants in the group to which they were initially randomised. We will determine the rates of missing data from each study and assess the number of infants who were initially randomised against the total number analysed. We will consider a missing rate greater than 20% as significant. We will contact the authors or sponsor of the individual studies to request relevant information pertaining to the missing data. If we find a significant missing rate with no reasonable explanation, including clarification from the authors, or markedly different rates between the assigned groups, we will judge the study to be at high risk of bias due to missing data.

If we consider the data are likely to be missing at random, we will analyse the data without imputing any missing values. However, if we suspect that the data are unlikely to be missing at random, for example, if there is a marked difference in the proportion of missing data between groups, or the reasons for missingness are considered to be related to the outcomes, we will undertake an imputation of missing data. For the imputation, we will assume that all cases of missing data have developed a poor outcome, following one of the recommended options in Chapter 10.12.2 of the Cochrane Handbook. We will then conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of excluding these studies with imputed missing data on the overall pooled estimate.

Where relevant, we will impute missing standard deviations using the coefficient of variation (CV) or calculate them from other available statistics, including standard errors, confidence intervals, t values, and P values.

### Dexmedetomidine for analgesia and sedation for procedural pain or discomfort in newborn infants [^acfe6c42]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

These recent clinical observations suggest that exposure to commonly recommended analgosedative agents raises neurodevelopmental and behavioural concerns in neonates, prompting us to reconsider our options and underlining the importance of examining emerging alternative strategies.

Description of the intervention and how it might work

Dexmedetomidine is a selective alpha 2 ‐adrenergic agonist similar to clonidine, but with much greater affinity for alpha 2 ‐receptors over alpha 1 ‐receptors. The sedative and anxiolytic effects of dexmedetomidine result primarily from stimulation of alpha 2 ‐adrenergic receptors in the locus ceruleus of the brainstem, leading to a reduction of central sympathetic output and thus greater firing of inhibitory neurons. The presence of dexmedetomidine at alpha 2 ‐adrenergic receptors in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord modulates the release of substance P (a neuro‐acting peptide) and produces its analgesic effects.

Dexmedetomidine has the advantage of providing both sedation and analgesia in addition to its benzodiazepine‐ and opioid‐sparing properties when used in combination with sedatives and analgesics including fentanyl, morphine, midazolam, lorazepam, ketamine, and chloral hydrate. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dexmedetomidine and midazolam or propofol for sedation in adults demonstrated easy arousal and no respiratory depression, less delirium, and less frequent tachycardia and hypertension.

### Dexmedetomidine as a part of general anaesthesia for caesarean delivery in patients with pre-eclampsia: a randomised double-blinded trial [^455ad929]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

During general anaesthesia, endotracheal intubation of patients with pre-eclampsia causes stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and catecholamine release, which may lead to maternal and neonatal complications.

Objective

To attenuate both the stress response and the haemodynamic response to tracheal intubation in patients with pre-eclampsia.

Design

A randomised, double-blind, controlled study.

Setting

Single University Hospital.

Patients

Sixty patients aged 18 to 45 years with pre-eclampsia receiving general anaesthesia for caesarean section.

Interventions

The patients were randomly allocated to three groups. Groups D1and D2 received an infusion of dexmedetomidine 1μgkg over the 10min before induction of general anaesthesia, then 0.4 and 0.6μgkgh dexmedetomidine, respectively. Group C received equivalent volumes of 0.9% saline.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the effect of dexmedetomidine on mean arterial blood pressure measured before induction of general anaesthesia at 1 and 5min after intubation, and then every 5min until 10min after extubation. The secondary outcomes were blood glucose and serum cortisol (measured before induction of general anaesthesia, and at 1 and 5min after intubation), postoperative visual analogue pain scores, time to first request for analgesia, the total consumption of analgesia, Ramsay sedation score, maternal and placental vein blood serum levels of dexmedetomidine and neonatal Apgar score at 1 and 5min.

Results

At all assessment times, the mean arterial pressures were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine groups than in the control group. Compared with group C, the heart rate was significantly lower in both groups D1 and D2. In group D2, the heart rate was lower than in group D1. Serum glucose and cortisol were significantly higher in the controls than in either group D1 or D2. Group D2 patients were significantly more sedated on arrival in the recovery room followed by D1. Time to first analgesia was significantly longer in groups D2 and D1 than in group C, and the visual analogue pain scores were significantly lower in groups D1 and D2 than in group C at 1, 2, 3 and 5h. Total morphine consumption was significantly lower in groups D1 and D2 than in the control group. There was no difference in Apgar scores across the three groups despite significantly higher dexmedetomidine concentrations in group D2 (both maternal and placental vein) than in group D1.

Conclusion

Administration of dexmedetomidine in doses 0.4 and 0.6μgkgh was associated with haemodynamic and hormonal stability, without causing significant adverse neonatal outcome.

### Dexmedetomidine hydrochloride (dexmedetomidine) [^a5f7f198]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

8.1 Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C

There are no adequate and well controlled studies of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection use in pregnant women. In an in vitro human placenta study, placental transfer of dexmedetomidine occurred. In a study in the pregnant rat, placental transfer of dexmedetomidine was observed when radiolabeled dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously. Thus, fetal exposure should be expected in humans, and dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus.

Teratogenic effects were not observed in rats following subcutaneous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis (from gestation day 5 to 16) with doses up to 200 mcg/kg (representing a dose approximately equal to the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on body surface area) or in rabbits following intravenous administration of dexmedetomidine during the period of fetal organogenesis (from gestation day 6 to 18) with doses up to 96 mcg/kg (representing approximately half the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose based on plasma area under the time-curve comparison). However, fetal toxicity, as evidenced by increased post-implantation losses and reduced live pups, was observed in rats at a subcutaneous dose of 200 mcg/kg. The no-effect dose in rats was 20 mcg/kg (representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison). In another reproductive toxicity study when dexmedetomidine was administered subcutaneously to pregnant rats at 8 and 32 mcg/kg (representing a dose less than the maximum recommended human intravenous dose based on a body surface area comparison) from gestation day 16 through weaning, lower offspring weights were observed. Additionally, when offspring of the 32 mcg/kg group were allowed to mate, elevated fetal and embryocidal toxicity and delayed motor development was observed in second generation offspring.

8.2 Labor and Delivery

The safety of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection during labor and delivery has not been studied.

8.3 Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether dexmedetomidine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Radio-labeled dexmedetomidine administered subcutaneously to lactating female rats was excreted in milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when dexmedetomidine hydrochloride injection is administered to a nursing woman.

### Decision-making for prenatal genetic screening: how will pregnant women navigate a growing number of aneuploidy and carrier screening options? [^d7c64b5d]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study highlights the challenges that prenatal genetic screening presents for both pregnant patients and their obstetric healthcare providers. Our findings raise important clinical and ethical questions about how best to ensure that patients can make autonomous, informed decisions about their screening options. That includes not only ensuring that patients have the information and resources they need to make decisions about those options, but also understanding patients' needs and values in the process so that the final decision best reflects their goals.

While knowledge levels for both kinds of screening were low at baseline, participants had greater familiarity with AS at the onset of prenatal care compared to CS. Knowledge deficits were noted across several informational categories, including the conditions contained in these screenings, the risk factors for a fetus being diagnosed with chromosomal or genomic variant, the interpretation of screen results, and the implications of those risk assessments on their pregnancy and future reproductive decision-making. In many regards, these findings were expected. Prior studies have demonstrated patient knowledge deficits and challenges for informed decision-making for prenatal AS factors have persisted despite the continued growth of cfDNA screening. Other studies have demonstrated deficits in patient knowledge and decision-making for CS. While some of these are due to patient-related factors, others are due to healthcare-related factors, including impediments in provider knowledge and adherence to evidence-based guidelines about their use.

Our findings indicate that it will require significant time and effort for healthcare providers to overcome the patients' deficits in knowledge. This is problematic, given that providers have increasingly less time during clinical encounters to engage in lengthy conversations. These results point to the increasing workload required at the first prenatal visit to ensure patients are prepared to make informed prenatal genetic screens decisions. Ideally, prenatal genetic screening options should be offered at the onset of prenatal care. While final decisions about the use of prenatal genetic screens may not be made at the initiation of prenatal care, the counseling that occurs at this time sets the stage for patients' informed access to genetic information about the pregnancy. In reality, these discussions do not occur in isolation, but during the time at which other important aspects of prenatal healthcare delivery must be discussed (e.g. the role of folic acid, immunization), with the addition of significant topical issues (e.g. COVID-19). These factors affect how much time and effort can be allocated during this visit to support patients' understanding of screening and diagnostic testing options and the implications of their choices on the outcome of the pregnancy.

Preclinical studies in small animal models as well as nonhuman primates suggested loss or death of brain cells and consequent impaired neurocognitive function following anesthetic exposure in neonates and late gestation fetuses. Human studies in this area are limited and currently inconclusive. On Dec. 14, 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning regarding impaired brain development in children following exposure to certain anesthetic agents used for general anesthesia, namely the inhalational anesthetics isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane, and the intravenous agents propofol and midazolam, in the third trimester of pregnancy. Furthermore, this warning recommends that health care professionals should balance the benefits of appropriate anesthesia in young children and pregnant women against potential risks, especially for procedures that may last > 3 hours or if multiple procedures are required in children < 3 years old. The objective of this article is to highlight how the Food and Drug Administration warning may impact the anesthetic and surgical management of the obstetric patient. Neuraxial anesthesia (epidural or spinal anesthesia) is more commonly administered for cesarean delivery than general anesthesia. The short duration of fetal exposure to general anesthesia during cesarean delivery has not been associated with learning disabilities. However, the fetus can also be exposed to both intravenous and inhalation anesthetics during nonobstetric or fetal surgery in the second and third trimester; this exposure is typically longer than that for cesarean delivery. Very few studies address the effect of anesthetic exposure on the fetus in the second trimester when most nonobstetric and fetal surgical procedures are performed. It is also unclear how the plasticity of the fetal brain at this stage of development will modulate the consequences of anesthetic exposure. Strategies that may circumvent possible untoward long-term neurologic effects of anesthesia in the baby include: (1) use of nonimplicated (nongamma-aminobutyric acid agonist) agents for sedation such as opioids (remifentanil, fentanyl) or the alpha-2 agonist, dexmedetomidine, when appropriate; (2) minimizing the duration of exposure to inhalational anesthetics for fetal, obstetric, and nonobstetric procedures in the pregnant patient, as much as possible within safe limits; and (3) commencing surgery promptly and limiting the interval between induction of anesthesia and surgery start time will help decrease patient exposure to inhalational agents. While the Food and Drug Administration warning was based on duration and repetitive nature of exposure rather than concentration of inhalational agents, intravenous tocolytics can be considered for intraoperative use, to provide uterine relaxation for fetal surgery, in lieu of high concentrations of inhalational anesthetic agents. Practitioners should consider the type of anesthesia that will be administered and the potential risks when scheduling patients for nonobstetric and fetal surgery.

### Dexmedetomidine for analgesia and sedation for procedural pain or discomfort in newborn infants [^0d7744c6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Synthesis methods

We plan to perform meta‐analysis of critical and important outcomes in the planned comparisons, as stated in Types of interventions, as well as of predefined subgroups, subject to the availability of data (either published or supplied by the trial investigators) using RevMan. We will utilise standard methodologies for meta‐analysis as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We will conduct meta‐analysis using the inverse variance method for continuous outcomes, and the Mantel‐Haenzel method for dichotomous outcomes.

Unless otherwise specified, we will report the fixed‐effect model, based on the underlying assumption that it is more reasonable to assume the true effect sizes of studies on neonates as a common fixed point rather than a range. Neonatal populations are relatively homogenous in terms of physiological responses as they are less likely to be influenced by factors that lead to variations in effect estimates, such as comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and long‐term exposures, namely, factors that take time to develop. Additionally, interventions administered to neonates are considered relatively easier to be standardised due to the presence of a controlled environment in the NICU and standard basic care protocol across the world in regions with sufficient resources to set up an NICU. In this context, a fixed‐effect model would be reasonable as it is better equipped than the random‐effects model to detect small effect sizes, which may be useful for individualised decision‐making.

We will calculate the RR, RD, and NNTB or NNTH if the RD is significant, each with 95% CI, for categorical outcomes; and use the MD with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Where continuous outcomes are measured using different scales, we will express the treatment effect as the SMD with 95% CI.

If meta‐analysis cannot be performed, we will synthesise study findings using the approach suggested in the Synthesis Without Meta‐analysis (SWIM) guidance, as recommended in Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

### Effect of epidural dexmedetomidine in single-dose combined with ropivacaine for cesarean section [^08fdadfc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

When parturients undergo cesarean section under EA, they can stay awake, achieve early family contact and early food intake, which maintain the popularity of this anesthesia techniques. However, the benefits mentioned above do come at a cost. The surgery procedure could easily result in parturients psychological stress which can further progress to anxiety and hyperalgesic responses. Patient satisfaction with sedation has been investigated widely and is generally very high. Therefore, it is very important to offer sedation in obstetric anesthesia. However, of equal importance is the maternal-neonatal contact immediately after birth, which can be affected by deep sedation. Thus, moderate or conscious sedation is more appropriate, let alone it's much more cost efficient and safer than deep sedation. Dexmedetomidine acts through eliminating the inhibitory effect of the locus coeruleus on basal forebrain γ -amino butyric acid to produce sedative and hypnotic effects, from which patients are easily aroused. At present study, the sedation level of parturients with dexmedetomidine was significantly higher than those without it. Gratifyingly, no parturient was experiencing sedation level of score ≥ 4 at the time of fetus delivery due to conscious sedation of dexmedetomidine which guaranteed the mother-baby bonding.

Satisfaction is a multidimensional concept, with influencing factors spanning physiological, psychological, and social aspects. Maternal satisfaction is associated with factors such as pain, sedation, and occurrence of adverse reactions. In our study, although dexmedetomidine significantly reduced maternal pain scores, as previously mentioned, a 1.0 difference in NRS pain score may not necessarily hold clinical significance, thus the alleviation of pain may have limited impact on satisfaction. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine improved maternal sedation levels, yet none of the parturients experienced excessive sedation in this study; therefore, the dexmedetomidine used did not adversely affect maternal-infant contact, making the sedative effect negligible in influencing satisfaction. Additionally, the occurrence rates of adverse reactions were similar between the two groups of parturients. These factors may explain the close similarity in satisfaction between the two groups of parturients.

### A review of prenatal care delivery to inform the Michigan plan for appropriate tailored healthcare in pregnancy panel [^0ff7b5eb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To perform a literature review of key aspects of prenatal care delivery to inform new guidelines.

Data Sources

A comprehensive review of Ovid MEDLINE, Elsevier's Scopus, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Methods Of Study Selection

We included studies addressing components of prenatal care delivery (visit frequency, routine pregnancy assessments, and telemedicine) that assessed maternal and neonatal health outcomes, patient experience, or care utilization in pregnant individuals with and without medical conditions. Quality was assessed using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Methodology approach. Articles were independently reviewed by at least two members of the study team for inclusion and data abstraction.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Of the 4,105 published abstracts identified, 53 studies met inclusion criteria, totaling 140,150 participants. There were no differences in maternal and neonatal outcomes among patients without medical conditions with reduced visit frequency schedules. For patients at risk of preterm birth, increased visit frequency with enhanced prenatal services was inconsistently associated with improved outcomes. Home monitoring of blood pressure and weight was feasible, but home monitoring of fetal heart tones and fundal height were not assessed. More frequent weight measurement did not lower rates of excessive weight gain. Home monitoring of blood pressure for individuals with medical conditions was feasible, accurate, and associated with lower clinic utilization. There were no differences in health outcomes for patients without medical conditions who received telemedicine visits for routine prenatal care, and patients had decreased care utilization. Telemedicine was a successful strategy for consultations among individuals with medical conditions; resulted in improved outcomes for patients with depression, diabetes, and hypertension; and had inconsistent results for patients with obesity and those at risk of preterm birth.

Conclusion

Existing evidence for many components of prenatal care delivery, including visit frequency, routine pregnancy assessments, and telemedicine, is limited.
