## Question

what is mycoplasma genitalium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what Mycoplasma genitalium is — covering its biology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostics, treatment, and public health implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the organism's biological nature and pathogenesis. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and transmission patterns. Next, I will evaluate the clinical syndromes in men and women. After that, I need to check the diagnostic methods and resistance testing. Then, I should review treatment strategies in the context of antimicrobial resistance. Finally, I will consider public health guidance, screening policies, and knowledge gaps to synthesize a concise conclusion.

> Let me first confirm the basic microbiology. Mycoplasma genitalium is a tiny cell-wall–deficient bacterium in the Mollicutes class, notable for extremely slow growth and fastidious nutritional requirements, which is why culture is impractical for clinical use; NAATs have therefore become essential for detection. Wait, I should not overstate that culture is "impossible"; it is achievable in specialized research settings but not feasible for routine diagnosis, which operationally makes molecular testing the clinical standard. It adheres to genital epithelial cells via a specialized terminal organelle that concentrates adhesins such as P110, supporting motility, colonization, and likely cell invasion, all of which facilitate persistence and immune evasion [^111He9WZ] [^115Yi3ii].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and transmission. MG is a sexually transmitted pathogen with modest prevalence in general-population surveys but substantially higher prevalence in sexual health clinic populations; for example, MyGeniUS reported 16.6% in US SHCs versus about 1.7% in NHANES, with higher prevalence in females than males, consistent with longer infection duration and asymptomatic carriage. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said it is definitively the "second most common" bacterial STI; I need to be careful and specify this ranking applies in many high-risk clinic settings rather than universally across all populations. Age patterns typically peak in younger individuals and decline with age, and MG is also common at rectal sites in MSM, though symptomatic proctitis attribution remains variable across studies [^11342s7r] [^116J7FRo] [^112GeX5D] [^116R83jk].

> I will now examine clinical syndromes in men. I should confirm MG's role in nongonococcal urethritis; surveillance data show MG in over a quarter of urethritis cases in men, and clinical features do not reliably distinguish MG from other NGU etiologies. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about other sites; proposed links with epididymo-orchitis, proctitis, and reactive arthritis exist, but the evidence remains weaker and often confounded, so I should qualify those associations accordingly [^1149651m] [^116dBvGy].

> Now, I need to consider women's health outcomes. MG is associated with cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease, and there is accumulating evidence for upper tract involvement including histologic endometritis. Let me verify reproductive sequelae; meta-analytic data suggest associations with preterm birth and spontaneous abortion, though I should emphasize heterogeneity and the need for more prospective data. An evidence synthesis estimated roughly 4.9% of MG infections may progress to PID, substantially lower than chlamydia but still clinically meaningful. I should confirm that guidelines remain cautious about routine screening given current evidence gaps [^113CYcKJ] [^115P3Uro] [^116xMfsT].

> Next, I should review diagnostics. Given culture constraints, NAATs are the gold standard, and FDA-cleared commercial assays have expanded access beyond reference laboratories. Because macrolide and quinolone resistance is common and rising, genotypic assays for 23S rRNA macrolide-resistance–mediating mutations and gyrA/parC quinolone resistance markers are increasingly important to guide therapy. Let me double-check serology; historically limited by cross-reactivity with M. pneumoniae, but the newer MG075-based immunoassay shows promise for population exposure studies, though it does not replace NAAT for acute diagnosis [^111He9WZ] [^115gVoTJ] [^112ktDAG] [^111Fg4B4].

> I will now examine antimicrobial resistance and treatment. Macrolide resistance is hyperendemic in many regions, with US and Asia-Pacific data often around 60–70% or higher, and quinolone resistance is emerging, threatening last-line agents. Wait, let me verify treatment strategy; contemporary guidance favors sequential resistance-guided therapy when available: doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days to reduce bacterial load, followed by high-dose azithromycin if macrolide-susceptible, or moxifloxacin if macrolide-resistant, achieving approximately 92–95% cure in high-resistance settings. I should confirm that single-dose azithromycin 1 g has declining efficacy and selects resistance; extended 1.5 g regimens do not reliably improve outcomes, and doxycycline pretreatment reduces selection of macrolide resistance. For highly resistant infections, sitafloxacin or combination regimens have been used where available, but data remain limited and regional access varies [^116stXX9] [^111b8n2A] [^112pCnJo] [^113G2tDp] [^1127ZNA9] [^117BGQQY].

> But wait, what about initial empiric therapy and stewardship. I need to ensure alignment with guideline shifts; to preserve macrolide activity and avoid inducing resistance, many programs replaced empiric azithromycin with doxycycline for NGU or cervicitis syndromes in 2021, while reserving macrolides for confirmed macrolide-susceptible MG after resistance testing or defaulting to moxifloxacin when resistance testing is unavailable in high-resistance locales. BASHH also recommends MG testing in NGU settings, underscoring the role of targeted diagnostics to optimize therapy and limit resistance amplification [^116stXX9] [^116iKuPt].

> Next, I should review public health considerations. Routine screening of asymptomatic populations is not currently recommended because benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness are not yet established; focus remains on diagnostic testing in persons with compatible syndromes and on partner management. I should double-check HIV interactions; MG has been associated with approximately twofold higher HIV acquisition risk in observational studies, supporting prompt diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic individuals and their partners while recognizing evidence limitations and the need for trials to link MG control with improved reproductive and HIV outcomes [^112CowZm] [^1128x6Dh] [^11518PG3] [^112LpwQY].

> Let me synthesize and conclude. Mycoplasma genitalium is a fastidious, cell wall–absent bacterial STI that commonly causes nongonococcal urethritis in men and is associated with cervicitis, PID, and endometritis in women, with probable adverse reproductive sequelae in some settings. Its clinical impact is magnified by high rates of asymptomatic carriage and widespread macrolide resistance with emerging quinolone resistance, making NAAT with resistance testing and sequential, resistance-guided therapy critical to achieving high cure while minimizing resistance selection. Given unresolved questions around screening and long-term outcomes, clinical management should emphasize targeted testing in symptomatic patients and antimicrobial stewardship, while research priorities focus on reproductive outcomes and novel treatments to avert further evolution toward an untreatable "superbug" phenotype [^111He9WZ] [^11342s7r] [^111b8n2A] [^113LHaL1] [^112LpwQY].

Mycoplasma genitalium is a **sexually transmitted bacterium** [^112LpwQY] that causes urethritis in men [^1149651m] and cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility in women [^116xMfsT]. It is **difficult to culture**, so diagnosis relies on nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) [^116rR6gC] [^111He9WZ]. Treatment is complicated by high macrolide resistance and rising fluoroquinolone resistance [^113LHaL1]; **resistance-guided therapy** is recommended: doxycycline followed by azithromycin or moxifloxacin based on susceptibility [^111b8n2A] [^111VGaWR]. Screening is not recommended for **asymptomatic individuals** [^112CowZm], but testing is advised for symptomatic patients and their partners [^111b8n2A].

---

## Microbiological characteristics

Mycoplasma genitalium **lacks a cell wall**, rendering it inherently resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics [^113LHaL1]. Its **small genome (~580 kb)** encodes minimal metabolic pathways, contributing to fastidious growth requirements. The organism grows extremely slowly and is **difficult to culture**, necessitating reliance on molecular diagnostics [^116rR6gC] [^115gVoTJ].

---

## Epidemiology

Prevalence is approximately **1.1% in men and 2.3% in women aged 21–23 years** [^112b4G2F] in the general population. Prevalence is higher among younger individuals [^116J7FRo], men who have sex with men (MSM), and people with multiple sexual partners. Transmission is primarily through **sexual contact**, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex [^116YdPNJ].

---

## Clinical manifestations

### In men

In men, **urethritis** usually presents as nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) [^1149651m] characterized by urethral discharge, dysuria, and urethral irritation, while **epididymitis** (inflammation of the epididymis) is less common [^116dBvGy].

---

### In women

In women, **cervicitis** may be asymptomatic or present with vaginal discharge, bleeding, or pelvic pain [^116xMfsT]. Pelvic inflammatory disease [^113CYcKJ] is associated with **infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain** [^116qe6iA]; infection has also been linked to increased risks of preterm birth and spontaneous abortion [^116xMfsT].

---

## Diagnosis

- **NAATs**: Nucleic acid amplification tests (PCR, TMA) [^115gVoTJ] are the gold standard due to high sensitivity and specificity [^111He9WZ].
- **Specimen types**: First-void urine, vaginal swabs, endocervical swabs, and rectal swabs.
- **Resistance testing**: Detection of macrolide resistance mutations (23S rRNA) [^112ktDAG] and fluoroquinolone resistance mutations (parC, gyrA) is recommended [^111b8n2A] [^111He9WZ].

---

## Treatment

- **First-line therapy**: Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days, followed by azithromycin (if macrolide-susceptible) or moxifloxacin (if macrolide-resistant) [^111b8n2A] [^111VGaWR].
- **Resistance-guided therapy**: Sequential treatment based on resistance testing [^111b8n2A] significantly improves cure rates [^1136DcB1].
- **Alternative therapies**: Pristinamycin or sitafloxacin for highly resistant infections, though availability may be limited [^117BGQQY].

---

## Antibiotic resistance

- **Macrolide resistance**: High prevalence globally [^113LHaL1], primarily due to mutations in the 23S rRNA gene [^115phLcw].
- **Fluoroquinolone resistance**: Increasingly reported [^112ktDAG], associated with mutations in parC and gyrA genes [^111He9WZ].
- **Treatment challenges**: Resistance significantly complicates management, necessitating resistance-guided therapy [^111He9WZ] [^1176YXfM].

---

## Public health implications

Mycoplasma genitalium is recognized as an **emerging STI** [^112LpwQY] with significant reproductive health consequences [^111He9WZ]. Limited surveillance and reporting hinder effective public health responses [^112CowZm]. Prevention relies on **condom use** and sexual health education.

---

## Current research and knowledge gaps

Key gaps include limited understanding of the **natural history** [^112LpwQY] and long-term consequences of infection [^111b8n2A], a **lack of evidence** supporting routine screening in asymptomatic individuals [^112CowZm], and the need for **new antimicrobial agents** and improved resistance testing methods [^113LHaL1] [^111b8n2A].

### Mycoplasma genitalium infection and female reproductive tract disease: A meta-analysis [^116xMfsT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

To determine the association between Mycoplasma genitalium infection and female reproductive tract syndromes through meta-analysis, English-language, peer-reviewed studies were identified via PubMed, Embase, Biosis, Cochrane Library, and reference review. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Random-effects models were employed to calculate summary estimates, and between-study heterogeneity was evaluated using I² statistics. Publication bias was assessed via funnel plots and the Begg and Egger tests, and methodological quality was rated.

Mycoplasma genitalium infection was significantly associated with an increased risk of cervicitis (pooled odds ratio [OR], 1.66 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.35–2.04]), pelvic inflammatory disease (pooled OR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.31–3.49]), preterm birth (pooled OR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.25–2.85]), and spontaneous abortion (pooled OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.10–3.03]). The risk of infertility was similarly elevated (pooled OR, 2.43 [95% CI, 0.93–6.34]). In subanalyses accounting for coinfections, all associations were stronger and statistically significant. Testing of high-risk symptomatic women for M. genitalium may be warranted.

Contribution to urogenital syndromes: Mycoplasma genitalium prevalence was 2-fold higher in males with, than in those without, urogenital symptoms (22.4% vs 9.0%; aPR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.55–3.19). Mycoplasma genitalium was detected in over one-quarter (26.8%) of males with urethritis and was significantly associated with urethritis (aPR: 1.7; 1.22–2.50). No other clinical characteristics were associated with male MG infection.

In females, Mycoplasma genitalium prevalence was similar regardless of symptoms (18.9% vs 15.4%; aPR: 1.2; 0.83–1.62). It was detected in 21.1% with vaginitis, 11.8% with cervicitis, 15.4% with PID, and 15.2% with no diagnosed syndrome. No clinical characteristics were associated with female MG infection in adjusted analyses.

- **Coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae**: A subset of people had CT (n = 1152) and GC (n = 1149) data. The prevalence of CT was 12.9%; GC prevalence was 11.3%. Mycoplasma genitalium was detected in 28.2% of CT and 23.9% of GC infections. After adjusting for sampling criteria (site, birth sex, symptoms), MG was associated with CT (aPR: 1.7; 1.13–2.53) but not GC. Mycoplasma genitalium was detected in 26.5% of CT/GC-negative urethritis, 10.8% of CT/GC-negative vaginitis, and 11.1% of CT/GC-negative PID, but not in CT/GC-negative cervicitis. Because many diagnoses lacked data on CT/GC (38% urethritis, 65% vaginitis, 47% cervicitis) or numbers were small (PID), we do not report associations adjusted for CT/GC.

**Resistance-guided therapy**: Where diagnostic assays that can detect macrolide resistance mutations are available, sequential resistance-guided therapy is feasible and results in higher cure rates. Under sequential resistance-guided therapy, initial empiric treatment with doxycycline is followed by a second antibiotic (either azithromycin or moxifloxacin) based on the pathogen's susceptibility profile. Tetracycline resistance in M. genitalium develops infrequently, and treatment with doxycycline reduces the organism load, subsequently limiting the development of resistance to the second antibiotic. In Australia, where this approach was developed, macrolide-susceptible infections are treated with high-dose azithromycin (1 g, then 500 mg/d for 3 days) after the initial doxycycline regimen, whereas macrolide-resistant infections are treated with moxifloxacin (400 mg/d for 7 days) after the initial doxycycline regimen. In a setting where macrolide resistance was high (> 70%) and quinolone resistance moderate (13%–22%), cure rates for doxycycline followed by azithromycin were 95.4% and 92.0% for doxycycline followed by moxifloxacin; selection for macrolide resistance occurred in only 4.6%. Given high macrolide resistance in the United States, the 2021 CDC treatment guidelines recommend resistance-guided therapy where possible and sequential treatment with doxycycline followed by moxifloxacin when resistance testing is not available.

### Latest advances in laboratory detection of Mycoplasma genitalium [^111He9WZ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). High credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is an important sexually transmitted pathogen affecting both men and women. Its extremely slow growth in vitro and very demanding culture requirements necessitate the use of molecular-based diagnostic tests for its detection in clinical specimens. The recent availability of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared commercial molecular-based assays has enabled diagnostic testing to become more widely available in the United States and no longer limited to specialized reference laboratories.

Advances in the knowledge of the epidemiology and clinical significance of M. genitalium as a human pathogen, made possible by the availability of molecular-based testing, have led to updated guidelines for diagnostic testing and treatment that have been published in various countries. This review summarizes the importance of M. genitalium as an agent of human disease, explains the necessity of obtaining a microbiological diagnosis, describes currently available diagnostic methods, and discusses how the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has complicated treatment alternatives and influenced the development of diagnostic tests for resistance detection, with an emphasis on developments over the past few years.

This article summarizes the epidemiologic evidence linking Mycoplasma genitalium to sexually transmitted disease syndromes, including male urethritis, female cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and adverse birth outcomes. It discusses the relationship of this bacterium to human immunodeficiency virus infection and reviews the available literature on the efficacy of standard antimicrobial therapies against M. genitalium.

### Mycoplasma genitalium as a cause of pelvic inflammatory disease [^1146aZ1d]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is an increasingly recognized cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

- **Case**: A 17-year-old female adolescent presented with chronic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. Test results for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhea were negative, and multiple radiologic test results were normal. The patient failed several empiric courses of therapy over one year. Laparoscopy revealed findings consistent with PID. Nucleic acid amplification test results were positive for M genitalium.

- **Summary and conclusion**: M genitalium causing PID can be challenging to diagnose because of its often atypical presentation. Further epidemiological studies are needed to understand the burden of disease and to establish testing and treatment guidelines.

### Mycoplasma genitalium in the us (MyGeniUS): Surveillance data from sexual health clinics in 4 US regions [^112GeX5D]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Although few people were younger than 18 years, our observation that Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) was most common in younger people and prevalence declined with increasing age was consistent with population-level data from the United Kingdom. This age trend suggests that partial immunity may develop, a hypothesis supported by the detection of local and systemic anti-MG antibodies in other studies. Notably, the decline in infection with increasing age was most evident in symptomatic people, suggesting that any partial immunity may protect against symptomatic infection. Although the age trend was clearest in females, it was also present in symptomatic men who have sex with women (MSW), shifted by approximately 5 years, consistent with heterosexual age-mixing patterns.

Our findings confirm the association of MG with male urethritis. The proportion of male urethritis cases with MG we observed in 2020 (26.8%) was similar to US sexual health clinic (SHC) patients in 2017–2018 (28.7%), suggesting little change over time. In contrast, we observed no significant relationship between MG and female sexually transmitted infection (STI) syndromes, reflecting either a true absence of association or the small number of cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) diagnoses. Cervical infections are not always associated with prominent symptoms, and speculum examinations — required to make a clinical diagnosis of cervicitis — are generally not performed in asymptomatic women in our clinics. Cervicitis was probably incompletely ascertained, hindering our ability to evaluate associations with MG. Larger, carefully designed prospective studies are needed to define the contribution of MG to female syndromes and determine the implications.

### Mycoplasma genitalium antimicrobial resistance in community and sexual health clinic patients, Auckland, New Zealand [^112ktDAG]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The management of *Mycoplasma genitalium* infections is challenging because the limited treatment options have been affected by rapidly evolving resistance to antimicrobial drugs. Molecular approaches are the preferred method of *M. genitalium* detection, and resistance is determined genotypically. Mutations in 23S rRNA are associated with macrolide resistance and azithromycin treatment failures, whereas fluoroquinolone resistance is linked with mutations in the quinolone resistance–determining region, specifically in the gyrA and parC genes.

Azithromycin is the first-line treatment for *M. genitalium* infections in New Zealand; second-line treatment relies on moxifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone. A high proportion (72%) of macrolide resistance has been reported in sexual health clinic (SHC) patients in our region, and elsewhere in New Zealand, fluoroquinolone resistance is reported in 23.3% of *M. genitalium*–positive specimens from SHC attendees. This is consistent with the high prevalence of macrolide and fluoroquinolone resistance in the Asia–Pacific region.

### Mycoplasma genitalium infection in adults reporting sexual contact with infected partners, Australia, 2008–2016 [^1177e83Z]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Data on the likelihood of Mycoplasma genitalium infection in sexual contacts, particularly for men who have sex with men (MSM), are needed to form an evidence base for guidelines. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of patients attending a sexual health clinic in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, during 2008–2016. We calculated the proportion of contacts with M. genitalium infection and determined factors associated with infection. Among those patients reporting sexual contact with a person infected with M. genitalium, 48.2% of women, 31.0% of heterosexual men, and 41.7% of MSM were infected. Among heterosexual contacts, women were twice as likely to be infected; among MSM, rectal infection was more common than urethral infection; and among persons within heterosexual partnerships, concordance of infection was high. High positivity among female and MSM contacts and high concordance in heterosexual partnerships provide some justification for presumptive treatment; however, clinicians should consider antimicrobial drug resistance and toxicity of quinolones.

### Symptoms, sites, and significance of Mycoplasma genitalium in men who have sex with men [^116R83jk]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium causes nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in men and is associated with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), spontaneous abortion, and premature labor in women. Most guidelines recommend azithromycin as a first-line treatment; however, macrolide resistance is widespread and increasing in many countries. In a recent study of M. genitalium urethritis in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 39% of cases were in men who have sex with men (MSM); macrolide resistance was detected almost twice as often in MSM as in women or heterosexual men (76% of MSM vs. 39% for women and heterosexual men combined; p = 0.005). We hypothesized that this difference may have arisen from frequent treatment of MSM for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections, resulting in exposure of asymptomatic M. genitalium infections to azithromycin.

M. genitalium has been proposed as a cause of proctitis in MSM, but few studies have examined this association. Soni et al. found M. genitalium in 4.4% of rectal swabs from 438 MSM in England as well as found no association with rectal symptoms. Francis et al. found M. genitalium in 5.4% of rectal swabs from 500 MSM in the United States but found only a weak association with rectal symptoms. Bissessor et al. reported that bacterial load of rectal M. genitalium was higher in MSM with proctitis compared with those with asymptomatic infection, and detection was more common in HIV-positive than HIV-negative MSM (21% vs. 8%; p = 0.006). A meta-analysis in 2009 of 19 mostly cross-sectional or case–control studies found an association between M. genitalium and proctitis.

### Mycoplasma genitalium infection in adults reporting sexual contact with infected partners, Australia, 2008–2016 [^116Z9QdK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

During the study period, a total of 441 presentations to the clinic were made by patients reporting sexual contact with a person with *Mycoplasma genitalium* infection (Figure). We excluded repeat presentations by the same person (n = 25), those missing laboratory test results (n = 16), those missing more than 50% of the queried behavioral data (n = 1), and those not meeting our definition of a contact (n = 22). These exclusions left 377 (85.5%) persons (139 women, 126 heterosexual men, and 112 MSM) for analysis.

- **Figure**: Flowchart for 441 persons examined at Melbourne Sexual Health Centre who reported sexual contact with a *Mycoplasma genitalium*–infected partner, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, August 2008–July 2016. Dashed lines indicate persons excluded for analysis or subanalysis. MG, *Mycoplasma genitalium*; MSM, men who have sex with men.

- **Baseline characteristics of study population**: We summarized the baseline characteristics of the study population. The median age of 139 female contacts was 26 years (interquartile range [IQR] 22–32 years). A total of 132 (95.0%) women were heterosexual, whereas 7 (5.0%) reported sex with men and women. The median age among 126 heterosexual male contacts of *M. genitalium*–infected patients was 28 years (IQR 24–35 years). The median age among 112 MSM contacts of *M. genitalium*–infected patients was 29 years (IQR 25–36 years). Most contacts in all three groups reported that their notifying partner was their regular partner, and most reported less than 100% condom use during the preceding three months.

### Mycoplasma genitalium infection in men [^116dBvGy]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is one of the major causes of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) worldwide but an uncommon sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the general population. The risk of sexual transmission is probably lower than for Chlamydia trachomatis. Infection in men is usually asymptomatic, and it is likely that most men resolve the infection without developing disease. The incubation period for NGU caused by Mycoplasma genitalium is probably longer than for NGU caused by C. trachomatis.

The clinical characteristics of symptomatic NGU have not been shown to identify the pathogen-specific etiology. Effective treatment of men and their sexual partner(s) is complicated as macrolide antimicrobial resistance is now common in many countries, conceivably due to the widespread use of azithromycin 1 g to treat STIs and the limited availability of diagnostic tests for M. genitalium. Improved outcomes in men with NGU and better antimicrobial stewardship are likely to arise from the introduction of diagnostic M. genitalium nucleic acid amplification testing, including antimicrobial resistance testing in men with symptoms of NGU as well as in their sexual partner(s). The cost-effectiveness of these approaches needs further evaluation.

The evidence that M. genitalium causes epididymo-orchitis, proctitis, and reactive arthritis, and facilitates human immunodeficiency virus transmission in men, is weak, although biologically plausible. In the absence of randomized controlled trials demonstrating cost-effectiveness, screening of asymptomatic men cannot be recommended.

### Outcomes of resistance-guided sequential treatment of Mycoplasma genitalium infections: A prospective evaluation [^112pCnJo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Treating Mycoplasma genitalium with a sequence of first using doxycycline to reduce bacterial load, and then applying a resistance assay to select either high-dose azithromycin or sitafloxacin, cured over 92% of infections in a population with high levels of antibiotic resistance.

### Mycoplasma genitalium in the US (MyGeniUS): Surveillance data from sexual health clinics in 4 US regions [^116stXX9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

The high prevalence of macrolide resistance (59.1%) is consistent with other recent reports. In systematic surveillance in 2019, Public Health England detected MRMs in 69% of symptomatic MG infections identified in public clinics, only slightly higher than the prevalence in our symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Previous estimates of macrolide resistance range widely, including 0–11% in non-US settings with infrequent azithromycin use, 30–41% in US pregnant women, and 60–90% in US clinic populations. The global increase in macrolide resistance in MG motivated the development of resistance-guided therapy approaches and contributed to the replacement of azithromycin with doxycycline as first-line therapy for urethritis and cervicitis in the 2021 CDC STI Treatment Guidelines. Ideally, MG treatment decisions would not be made without resistance testing. However, resistance testing is not widely available in the United States. Given this, the high prevalence of macrolide resistance that we observed supports CDC guidelines to use moxifloxacin instead of azithromycin to treat MG until resistance testing is possible.

The association of vaginitis, cervicitis, and PID diagnoses with MRMs may reflect previous azithromycin treatment, subsequent symptom resolution, and eventual recrudescence of a macrolide-resistant infection. More data on MRMs in women are needed. The lack of association between MRMs and CT/GC coinfection emphasizes that prior rather than azithromycin treatment selects for resistance. Unlike other reports, we observed no association between MRMs and…

### Mycoplasma genitalium and other reproductive tract infections in pregnant women, Papua New Guinea, 2015–2017 [^111bjexx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Much about the range of pathogens, frequency of coinfection, and clinical effects of reproductive tract infections (RTIs) among pregnant women remains unknown. We report on RTIs, including Mycoplasma genitalium, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, along with other reproductive health indicators in 699 pregnant women in Papua New Guinea during 2015–2017.

We found Mycoplasma genitalium, an emerging pathogen in Papua New Guinea, in 12.5% of participants. These infections showed no evidence of macrolide resistance. In total, 74.1% of pregnant women had more than one RTI; most of these infections were treatable. We detected sexually transmitted infections (excluding syphilis) in 37.7% of women. Our findings showed that syndromic management of infections is greatly inadequate. Additionally, 98.4% of women had never used barrier contraception. These findings will inform efforts to improve reproductive healthcare in Papua New Guinea.

### Detection and quantification of Mycoplasma genitalium in male patients with urethritis [^111tn6FJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Detection and quantification of Mycoplasma genitalium were evaluated in 83 patients with urethritis (group 1), 60 patients with urethral symptoms but no urethritis (group 2), and 50 asymptomatic men (group 3). Quantification of M. genitalium was carried out using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of first-pass urine samples. The rate of detection of M. genitalium was significantly higher in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3 (p < 0.0001). The mean observed concentration of M. genitalium was 1.2×10⁴ equivalent genomes/mL of urine (range, 50 to 8×10⁴ equivalent genomes/mL). Analysis of M. genitalium load in serial urine samples collected before and after the administration of antibacterial treatment showed an association between clinical and microbiological responses, with a shift to negative PCR results in symptom-free patients. Our results illustrate the usefulness of monitoring the M. genitalium load in evaluating the susceptibility of M. genitalium to antibacterial treatment.

### Mycoplasma genitalium adhesin P110 binds sialic-acid human receptors [^115Yi3ii]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Mycoplasmas are arguably among the most successful pathogens, establishing intimate interactions with epithelial cells and causing chronic diseases in humans and a wide range of animals. However, the mechanisms employed by these microorganisms to colonize their hosts and subvert the immune system are still poorly understood. It is noteworthy that several mycoplasma species invade their target cells and survive within the intracellular environment, which provides a safe harbor from host defenses.

M. genitalium is a motile bacterium that attaches to human epithelial cells of the genital tract by means of a specialized tip structure that agglutinates its main cytadhesins and a variety of cytoskeletal proteins. M. genitalium cytadhesins are multipurpose proteins and, besides their key role in cell adherence, they are important for locomotion and cell invasion. Therefore, they represent bona fide virulence factors crucial for colonization, dissemination, and persistence.

To gain understanding into the function of the cytadherence machinery of mycoplasmas, in this study we have determined the crystal structure of P110, a major adhesin of M. genitalium and an immunodominant protein of this emergent sexually transmitted pathogen.

### Clinical characteristics associated with Mycoplasma genitalium among female sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya [^111LQmtB]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium is high in vulnerable populations of women in low-resource settings. However, the epidemiology of infection in these populations is not well established. To determine the prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium and its association with cervical cytology and other correlates, we recruited 350 female sex workers (FSW), aged 18 to 50 years, in Nairobi, Kenya, for a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire was administered at baseline to obtain information on sociodemographics and sexual behaviors.

Women underwent a pelvic exam during which a physician collected cervical-exfoliation samples for conventional cytology and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing. Samples were tested for M. genitalium and other STI organisms, including Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, and the E6/E7 mRNA of human papillomavirus (HPV) using Aptima nucleic amplification assays.

The prevalence of M. genitalium was 12.9%. FSW who engaged in sexual intercourse during menses were less likely to have M. genitalium infection than those who did not, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.3 and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 0.1 to 0.9. M. genitalium was also less prevalent among FSW who had worked in prostitution for more than five years (6.2%) compared to those who had worked for less than three years (17.6%) (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.8). FSW who reported more frequent condom use were more likely to be infected with M. genitalium than those who reported less frequent use (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 11.6). These correlates differ from those found in M. genitalium studies conducted with FSW.

### Mycoplasma genitalium infection among HIV-infected pregnant African women and implications for mother-to-child transmission of HIV [^114Yd89q]. AIDS (2019). Low credibility.

Many sexually transmitted infections increase the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV; however, the effect of Mycoplasma genitalium is not known. We hypothesized that M. genitalium infection would be common among HIV-infected pregnant women and could be associated with in-utero and intrapartum MTCT.

- **Design**: Observational case-cohort study.

- **Methods**: The study used specimens from a Kenyan perinatal MTCT cohort (1999–2005) involving HIV-infected women and their infants, who received short-course zidovudine for prevention of MTCT. Vaginal swabs collected at 32 weeks gestation were tested for M. genitalium using a transcription-mediated amplification assay. Infant perinatal HIV infection was determined at birth and 4 weeks of age by DNA PCR. Using a case-cohort design, a random sample was generated with a 3:1 control:case ratio; prevalence and correlates of M. genitalium were assessed with chi-squared and t-tests. Predictors of infant outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression.

- **Results**: Among 220 HIV-infected pregnant women evaluated, 47 women (21.4%) had M. genitalium. Antenatal M. genitalium infection was associated with higher HIV RNA in plasma (5.0 vs. 4.6 log₁₀ copies/ml in M. genitalium-positive vs. M. genitalium-negative women, P = 0.02) at 32 weeks. Women with M. genitalium were less likely to report prior sexually transmitted infections and genital ulcers (both P = 0.05). There was no association found between exposure to M. genitalium and perinatal MTCT (odds ratio = 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.35, 1.51, P = 0.39).

### Mycoplasma genitalium infections in women attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic in New Orleans [^111jzX6m]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium has been significantly and nonsignificantly associated with cervicitis, urethritis, or vaginal discharge. This study examined the associations of M. genitalium with selected sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and demographic, behavioral, and clinical factors among women attending a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in New Orleans.

- **Methods**: Women aged ≥ 18 years who presented to the New Orleans STD clinic provided sociodemographic data and sexual behavior; STI, obstetric, and gynecologic history; and urine, vaginal, endocervical, and rectal specimens. Specimens were tested for M. genitalium, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma species, and yeast. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was diagnosed by Nugent score, and cervicitis was defined as ≥ 30 polymorphonuclear leukocytes per high-power microscopic field on a cervical Gram stain or yellow mucopus on an endocervical swab.

- **Results**: Among 400 women studied, M. genitalium was independently significantly associated with age < 25 years (P < .03), and with ≥ 2 sexual partners in the last 12 months (P < .003). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.75; p = 0.103), C. trachomatis (AOR, 1.43; p = 0.247), and T. vaginalis (AOR, 1.60; p = 0.120) independently increased the odds of infection with M. genitalium. Controlling for other STIs and BV, there was a positive trend for M. genitalium to predict cervicitis (AOR, 3.18 [95% confidence interval, .99–10.2]; p = 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: Mycoplasma genitalium in our study displayed the potential to influence cervicitis diagnoses significantly.

### Outcomes of resistance-guided sequential treatment of Mycoplasma genitalium infections: A prospective evaluation [^113G2tDp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

The outcomes in the doxycycline-azithromycin treatment arm are better than in contemporary studies of azithromycin treatment of unselected M. genitalium. A meta-analysis of 21 studies of single-dose 1 g azithromycin showed that proportions cured fell from 85% before 2009 to 67% afterward, consistent with a rising prevalence of resistance. In the three randomized trials comparing doxycycline and single-dose azithromycin for NGU, proportions with M. genitalium cured following azithromycin declined from 87% to 67% to 40% in studies published in 2009, 2011, and 2013, respectively.

A meta-analysis by Horner et al. found that single-dose 1 g azithromycin failed in 13.9% of 353 cases known to be macrolide susceptible, resulting in the selection of macrolide resistance in 12.0% (95% CI, 7.1%–16.9%). With doxycycline pretreatment and an increased dose of azithromycin, we observed selection of macrolide resistance in only 2 of 76 macrolide-susceptible cases (2.6% [95% CI, 0.3%–9.2%]).

While Horner et al.'s meta-analysis reported selected resistance in a similar proportion of cases (3/82 [3.7%]) treated with azithromycin 1.5 g over 5 days, in a recent study at our center, 4 of 34 (11.8%) cases treated with the 1.5-g azithromycin regimen developed selected resistance. Horner et al.'s meta-analysis excluded 56 cases treated with 1.5 g azithromycin that had previously received doxycycline and, interestingly, there were no cases of selected resistance among these. As the proportion of cases with selected resistance in our study (2.6%) is not significantly lower than any of these estimates, we cannot draw definitive conclusions without further analysis.

### Weighing potential benefits and harms of Mycoplasma genitalium testing and treatment approaches [^1143MkUu]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Evidence for an association between M. genitalium infection and spontaneous abortion is conflicting. An initial meta-analysis reported a significantly increased risk in M. genitalium–infected persons, but subsequent studies did not observe this. Using NAAT, M. genitalium has been detected in the endotrachea of neonates, bronchoalveolar lavage samples from children aged 0–5 years, and ocular samples from infants born to infected mothers, suggesting that transmission of M. genitalium during vaginal delivery might occur. However, positive NAATs might only reflect residual DNA; larger studies are needed to determine the extent of maternal-to-child transmission.

- **Testing considerations**:
	- Screening, diagnostic testing, and tests of cure each have different goals. Screening tests are undertaken in asymptomatic persons to provide treatment, limit sequelae, and prevent transmission. Diagnostic tests are performed in symptomatic persons to direct treatment at a specific pathogen and eliminate the organism. Tests of cure are undertaken to confirm eradication of pathogens. Recommendations for each type of testing are typically grounded in a robust body of evidence. When there is less robust evidence, as with M. genitalium, potential benefits must be weighed against potential harms.

### Diagnostic assessment of Mycoplasma genitalium in culture-positive women [^1151nh1k]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2004). Low credibility.

Detection of Mycoplasma genitalium-mediated, chlamydia-negative nongonococcal urethritis and other M. genitalium-linked infectious etiologies has been very challenging. Although M. genitalium is considered a leading cause of genitourinary symptoms in men and women, extreme difficulties in its cultivation due to its highly fastidious nature and the lack of routine and effective diagnostic tests have slowed the generation of clinical data that directly implicate the presence of M. genitalium in disease pathogenesis.

In this study, we compared enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), immunoblot, and PCR assays in M. genitalium culture-positive women over 1 to 3 years of clinical visits to determine the usefulness of independent diagnostic strategies. Furthermore, the value of combinatorial diagnostic assessments is described, which provides insights into the dynamics of M. genitalium-host interactions.

Overall, we show that neither ELISA nor PCR, alone or in combination, provides the sensitivity required to confidently predict the existence of viable M. genitalium organisms in cervical and vaginal samples. Additionally, culture-positive women exhibited a range of antibody responsiveness to M. genitalium based on ELISA and immunoblot assessments, indicating immune diversity among this high-risk population.

### Mycoplasma genitalium in women: Current knowledge and research priorities for this recently emerged pathogen [^116qe6iA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Health consequences of sexually transmitted diseases disproportionately affect women, making it important to determine whether newly emerged pathogens cause sequelae. Although the pathogenic role of Mycoplasma genitalium in male urethritis is clear, fewer studies have been conducted among women to determine its pathogenic role in the female reproductive tract. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an important cause of infertility and ectopic pregnancy, and Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are recognized microbial causes.

Emerging data demonstrate an association between M. genitalium and PID, and limited data suggest associations with infertility and preterm birth, yet the attributable risk for female genital tract infections remains to be defined. Further investigations are needed to better define the impact of M. genitalium on women's reproductive health. Importantly, prospective studies evaluating whether screening programs and targeted treatment of M. genitalium improve reproductive outcomes in women are necessary to guide public health policy for this emerging pathogen.

### Antimicrobial-resistant sexually transmitted infections: Gonorrhoea and Mycoplasma genitalium [^113LHaL1]. Nature Reviews Urology (2017). Low credibility.

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major concern worldwide and already compromises treatment effectiveness and control of several bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium are evolving into so-called superbugs that can become resistant, both in vitro and clinically, to essentially all antimicrobials available for treatment, causing exceedingly difficult-to-treat or untreatable STIs and threatening global public health.

Widespread AMR in these bacteria is likely to persist and even worsen in the future due to the high number of infections, widespread and uncontrolled use of antimicrobials, limited surveillance of AMR and clinical failures, as well as the extraordinary capacity of these bacteria to develop AMR. This development would not only result in an increased prevalence of N. gonorrhoeae and M. genitalium infections but also in a considerably increasing number of severe complications affecting reproductive health.

To combat this threat, clinicians need to be aware of the guidelines on diagnostic procedures, recommended treatment regimens, as well as therapeutic options for multidrug-resistant bacteria. AMR testing needs to be more frequently performed to inform treatment decisions and elucidate how AMR compromises treatment effectiveness, guiding research for effective future therapies.

### Azithromycin treatment failure in Mycoplasma genitalium-positive patients with nongonococcal urethritis is associated with induced macrolide resistance [^115phLcw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is a common cause of nongonococcal urethritis. Treatment trials have shown that doxycycline is inefficient, whereas a 5-day course of azithromycin eradicates the bacterium from 95% of infected men. The aim of the study was to establish the reason for the occasional treatment failures.

- **Methods**: Seven M. genitalium strains isolated from men who experienced azithromycin treatment failure were tested for in vitro susceptibility to macrolides using a cell culture-based method. The genetic basis for the drug resistance was established by sequencing parts of the 23S ribosomal RNA gene and the genes encoding the L4 and L22 proteins. Nine sets of specimens obtained before and after treatment from patients who experienced azithromycin treatment failure were examined using sequencing of polymerase chain reaction products.

- **Results**: The seven strains that were isolated from patients who experienced treatment failure with azithromycin had minimum inhibitory concentrations > 8 microg/mL for azithromycin and erythromycin. Three different mutations at positions 2058 and 2059 (Escherichia coli numbering) in region V of the 23S rRNA gene were found. Of the nine patients with specimens obtained before and after treatment, only two had an initial specimen in which the mutation was present, indicating that drug resistance was induced as the result of an inappropriate dosage of azithromycin.

- **Conclusion**: Development of macrolide resistance was shown to correlate with subsequent azithromycin treatment failure. The genetic basis for the drug resistance was shown.

### Incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease associated with Mycoplasma genitalium infection: Evidence synthesis of cohort study data [^115P3Uro]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We synthesized evidence from the POPI sexual-health cohort study and estimated that 4.9% (95% credible interval, 0.4–14.1%) of Mycoplasma genitalium infections in women progress to pelvic inflammatory disease versus 14.4% (5.9–24.6%) of chlamydial infections. For validation, we predicted PID rates in four age groups that agree well with surveillance data.

### Outcomes of resistance-guided sequential treatment of Mycoplasma genitalium infections: A prospective evaluation [^1136DcB1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates that over 92% of anogenital M. genitalium infections can be cured in a population where two-thirds of cases are macrolide-resistant and 20% of macrolide-resistant cases are likely quinolone-resistant. This was achieved by pretreating with doxycycline and selecting a second antimicrobial with a macrolide-resistance assay.

- **Selection of macrolide resistance**: Occurred in less than 3% of macrolide-susceptible infections treated with sequential therapy. Replacing azithromycin with doxycycline for initial treatment of STI syndromes has the dual advantage of reducing overall use of azithromycin and reducing M. genitalium load.

We hypothesize that reduction in bacterial load before commencing the second antimicrobial contributed to the high proportion cured and reduced the rate of selected macrolide resistance. In our clinic population, adherence to this regimen was high and antimicrobials were generally well tolerated. However, fourth-generation fluoroquinolones are expensive, and almost 20% of patients taking sitafloxacin reported some adverse events. Further research is required to determine if all components of this treatment protocol (i.e. doxycycline pretreatment, choice, and dosage of antibiotics) are necessary to achieve these high levels of cure.

### Mycoplasma genitalium from basic science to public health: Summary of the results from a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases technical consultation and consensus recommendations for future research priorities [^112LpwQY]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

This article lays out the research priorities for Mycoplasma genitalium research agreed upon by the participants in a 2016 National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-funded Technical Consultation focused on this organism. The state of knowledge concerning the microbiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations of infection, treatment, and public health significance of M. genitalium reviewed at the meeting is described in detail in the individual articles included in this supplemental edition of The Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Here we summarize the points made in these articles most relevant to the formulation of the research priorities listed in this article. The most important recommendation resulting from this Technical Consultation is the initiation of clinical trials designed to determine definitively whether screening for and treatment of M. genitalium infections in women and their sexual partners improve reproductive health in women and/or prevent human immunodeficiency virus transmission.

### Efficacy of antimicrobial therapy for Mycoplasma genitalium infections [^1176YXfM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium has been causally linked with nongonococcal urethritis in men and cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, preterm birth, spontaneous abortion, and infertility in women, yet treatment has proven challenging. To inform treatment recommendations, we reviewed English-language studies describing antimicrobial susceptibility, resistance-associated mutations, and clinical efficacy of antibiotic therapy, identified via a systematic search of PubMed supplemented by expert referral.

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) from some contemporary isolates exhibited high-level susceptibility to most macrolides and quinolones, and moderate susceptibility to most tetracyclines, whereas other contemporary isolates had high MICs to the same antibiotics. Randomized trials demonstrated poor efficacy of doxycycline and better, but declining, efficacy of single-dose azithromycin therapy. Treatment failures after extended doses of azithromycin similarly increased, and circulating macrolide resistance was present in high levels in several areas.

Moxifloxacin remains the most effective therapy, but treatment failures and quinolone resistance are emerging. Surveillance of M. genitalium prevalence and antimicrobial resistance patterns is urgently needed.

### Prevalence and correlates of Mycoplasma genitalium infection among female sex workers in Kampala, Uganda [^114yA5iS]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The importance of Mycoplasma genitalium in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-burdened sub-Saharan Africa is relatively unknown. We assessed the prevalence and explored determinants of this emerging sexually transmitted infection (STI) in high-risk women in Uganda.

- **Methods**: Endocervical swabs from 1,025 female sex workers in Kampala were tested for Mycoplasma genitalium using a commercial Real-TM polymerase chain reaction assay. Factors associated with prevalent Mycoplasma genitalium, including sociodemographics, reproductive history, risk behavior, and HIV and other STIs, were examined using multivariable logistic regression.

- **Results**: The prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium was 14% and higher in HIV-positive women than in HIV-negative women (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.12–2.41). Mycoplasma genitalium infection was less prevalent in older women (adjusted OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41–0.90 for women ages 25–34 years vs. < 25 years; adjusted OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.15–0.71 for women ≥ 35 years vs. those < 25 years) and in those who had been pregnant but never had a live birth (adjusted OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.04–4.88). Mycoplasma genitalium was associated with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (adjusted OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.13–2.98) and with Candida infection (adjusted OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.18–0.91), and there was some evidence of association with Trichomonas vaginalis (adjusted OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.00–2.44).

- **Conclusions**: The relatively high prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium and its association with prevalent HIV urgently calls for further research to explore the potential implications for public health.

### Detection of human IgG antibodies against using a recombinant MG075 antigen [^111Fg4B4]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted pathogen that can cause a range of reproductive tract diseases in both men and women. To disentangle the relationship between M. genitalium infection(s) and subsequent reproductive health complications at the population level, accurate serological tools are needed. The major challenge in developing specific M. genitalium serological tests is the extensive cross-reactivity with the closely related ubiquitous respiratory tract pathogen, Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

In this report, we describe the development of an immunoblot assay based on a recombinant fragment of the M. genitalium MG075 protein present in lipid-associated membrane extracts. A sensitivity of 87.1% was achieved based on testing antibody responses in sera from 101 adults with PCR-confirmed M. genitalium infection. A specificity of 95.2% was obtained through the evaluation of sera from 166 children under 15 years of age with and without M. pneumoniae infection, who were unlikely to have been exposed to sexually transmitted M. genitalium. The development of a serological assay capable of accurately distinguishing M. genitalium and M. pneumoniae will enable a better understanding of associations between M. genitalium and adverse reproductive sequelae.

- **Importance**: Mycoplasma genitalium is the second most common sexually transmitted bacterial infection after chlamydia. The long-term consequences of the infection are still under investigation, but reliable tools for monitoring exposure by detection of antibodies have been lacking specificity due to the presence of cross-reactivity.

### Time to manage Mycoplasma genitalium as an STI: but not with azithromycin 1 g [^115TcJw2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to discuss Mycoplasma genitalium, a sexually transmitted infection that causes significant morbidity in men and women and is a co-factor in HIV transmission. However, commercial diagnostic tests for M. genitalium are not generally available, and sub-optimal treatment is often administered. We review the literature on the burden of infection, its clinical presentation, and the effectiveness of treatment regimens.

Recent findings indicate that both in-vivo and in-vitro data strongly suggest M. genitalium is an important cause of urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and potentially asymptomatic proctitis. Studies consistently demonstrate suboptimal eradication rates with the treatment regimens recommended as first-line for nongonococcal urethritis. Concurrently, there has been a rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance in M. genitalium, with macrolide resistance now appearing to be endemic in some centers, and quinolone resistance is beginning to emerge.

In summary, in the absence of specific M. genitalium diagnostic and antimicrobial resistance testing, azithromycin 1g should not be used for managing patients with symptomatic disease potentially caused by M. genitalium. This review offers an alternative evidence-based approach to managing such patients that should, theoretically, reduce the risk of the development of antimicrobial resistance.

### Molecular diagnostics update for the emerging (if not already widespread) sexually transmitted infection agent Mycoplasma genitalium: Just about ready for prime time [^115gVoTJ]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is an important and emerging agent of sexually transmitted infection in females and males, carrying the potential for postinfection genital tract sequelae. Past efforts to identify this organism on a routine basis, which were problematic due to the fastidious nature of the bacterium and its antigenic intricacies, have recently become supplemented by molecular diagnostics. A number of these assays are available commercially. This minireview describes the format and performance indices of a number of M. genitalium DNA- and RNA-based amplification assays; many of these assays have contributed to an improved clinical and epidemiologic understanding of this organism.

### Azithromycin failure in Mycoplasma genitalium urethritis [^111xWh49]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

We report significant failure rates (28%, 95% confidence interval 15%-45%) after administering 1 g azithromycin to men with Mycoplasma genitalium-positive nongonococcal urethritis. In vitro evidence supported reduced susceptibility of M. genitalium to macrolides. Moxifloxacin administration resulted in rapid symptom resolution and eradication of infection in all cases. These findings have implications for management of urethritis.

### Mycoplasma genitalium: Should we treat and how [^114btdfY]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is associated with acute and chronic urethritis in men. Existing data on infection in women are limited and inconsistent, but suggest that M. genitalium is associated with urethritis, cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and possibly female infertility. Data are inconclusive regarding the role of M. genitalium in adverse pregnancy outcomes and ectopic pregnancy.

- **Treatment options**: Available data suggest that azithromycin is superior to doxycycline in treating M. genitalium infection. However, azithromycin-resistant infections have been reported on three continents, and the proportion of azithromycin-resistant M. genitalium infection is unknown. Moxifloxacin is the only drug that currently seems to uniformly eradicate M. genitalium.

- **Testing and recommendations**: Detection of M. genitalium is hampered by the absence of a commercially available diagnostic test. Persons with persistent pelvic inflammatory disease, or clinically significant persistent urethritis or cervicitis, should be tested for M. genitalium, if possible. Infected persons who have not previously received azithromycin should receive that drug. Persons in whom azithromycin therapy fails should be treated with moxifloxacin.

### Association of Mycoplasma genitalium and HIV infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1128x6Dh]. AIDS (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to systematically review research on the association between Mycoplasma genitalium and HIV infection in adults, and to summarize the findings in a meta-analysis.

- **Design**: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted.

- **Methods**: Epidemiological studies examining the relationship between Mycoplasma genitalium and HIV infection, published prior to June 2008, were identified through a comprehensive review of the literature. A random-effects meta-analysis was employed to calculate the summary odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Further stratified analyses were conducted based on geographical area and type of control population. Sensitivity analyses were also performed to assess between-study heterogeneity and publication bias.

- **Results**: Nineteen eligible studies were identified, with the prevalence of M. genitalium ranging from 3.1% to 47.5%. Seventeen studies found a higher likelihood of HIV infection among participants with M. genitalium, with this association reaching statistical significance in 12 studies. The summary odds ratio was 2.01 (95% CI = 1.44–2.79). The association was notably stronger in subgroup analyses, particularly among studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 2.17–3.11) and studies utilizing healthy control populations (OR = 2.57, 95% CI = 2.05–3.22). There was compelling evidence of between-study heterogeneity in the overall analysis, but this was significantly reduced in the subgroup analyses. There was no statistical evidence indicating publication bias.

- **Conclusion**: The data revealed a strong association between M. genitalium and HIV infections in these primarily cross-sectional observational studies.

### Outcomes of resistance-guided sequential treatment of Mycoplasma genitalium infections: A prospective evaluation [^116VqVXg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Treatment outcomes

Of the 77 macrolide-susceptible cases receiving doxycycline followed by 2.5 g of azithromycin, 73 were microbiologically cured (94.8% [95% CI, 87.2%–98.6%]), and 4 had positive tests of cure (5.2% [95% CI, 1.4%–12.8%]). Macrolide-resistance mutations were detected in the post-treatment samples of 3 out of the 4 failures by the resistance PCR assay. Sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene in the post-treatment samples confirmed that 3 were macrolide-resistant, and 1 was wild type. This wild type was detected 40 days post-treatment in a woman reporting no missed doses and full condom use with a new partner. Subsequent sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene in the pretreatment samples from these 4 individuals detected macrolide-resistance mutations (MRMs) in 1 sample (with a post-treatment MRM detected) that had not been detected by the resistance PCR assay.

Thus, the selection of MRMs was observed in only 2 of the azithromycin failures (2/76 macrolide-susceptible infections; 2.6% [95% CI, 0.3%–9.2%]). Of the 167 macrolide-resistant cases treated with doxycycline followed by sitafloxacin, 154 were microbiologically cured (92.2% [95% CI, 87.1%–95.8%]), and 13 had positive tests of cure (7.8% [95% CI, 4.2%–12.9%]). Overall, 227 out of 244 cases (93.0% [95% CI, 89.1%–95.9%]) were cured. The proportion cured did not differ among sexual risk groups, sites of infection, and symptom status, ranging between 91.1% and 95.1% in these groups.

### Enhanced sexually transmitted infection screening for Mycoplasma genitalium in human immunodeficiency virus-infected US Air Force personnel [^115uf6B9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Three-site genital and extragenital screening for Mycoplasma genitalium in 102 asymptomatic Air Force members with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection revealed 19 (18.6%) cases of M. genitalium, commonly (58%) in rectal samples. Because M. genitalium is associated with both HIV acquisition and transmission, these findings suggest that it should be included in routine screening of HIV-infected individuals for sexually transmitted infections.

### High prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Mycoplasma genitalium in nongonococcal urethritis: The need for routine testing and the inadequacy of current treatment options [^115vkJpR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium and Chlamydia trachomatis are recognized causes of common genital tract morbidities, such as pelvic inflammatory disease and nongonococcal cervicitis in women and nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in men. UK- and US-based antimicrobial treatment guidelines for these syndromes are aimed at Chlamydia infection, which is more frequently detected and has a strong evidence base for causing chronic disease. However, M. genitalium is not usually recommended among organisms for routine testing during standard sexually transmitted infection screening.

NGU is diagnosed using both clinical presentation and Gram-stained urethral smear microscopy. It is empirically treated with a 1-week oral course of doxycycline or a single oral dose of 1 g of azithromycin. Both treatments are effective against C. trachomatis, although clinical failure to eradicate Chlamydia with single-dose azithromycin has been reported.

- **Treatment efficacy for M. genitalium**: Doxycycline has poor efficacy, as evidenced by high rates of clinical failure with tetracyclines. Treatment failure with single-dose azithromycin is increasingly evident and is associated worldwide with strains possessing single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its ribosomal RNA gene (domain V, 23S rRNA). Moxifloxacin, a fluoroquinolone demonstrating efficacy against M. genitalium, is recommended following treatment failure with macrolides and tetracyclines. Fluoroquinolone resistance–associated SNPs in gyrase (gyrA) or topoisomerase IV (parC) genes have been detected in M. genitalium from patients exhibiting fluoroquinolone treatment failure and phenotypic resistance.

### Outcomes of resistance-guided sequential treatment of Mycoplasma genitalium infections: A prospective evaluation [^111VGaWR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Rising macrolide and quinolone resistance in Mycoplasma genitalium necessitates new treatment approaches. We evaluated outcomes of sequential antimicrobial therapy for M. genitalium guided by a macrolide-resistance assay.

- **Methods**: In mid-2016, Melbourne Sexual Health Centre switched from azithromycin to doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days) for nongonococcal urethritis, cervicitis, and proctitis. Cases were tested for M. genitalium and macrolide-resistance mutations (MRMs) by polymerase chain reaction. Directly after doxycycline, MRM-negative infections received 2.5 g azithromycin (1 g, then 500 mg daily for 3 days), and MRM-positive infections received sitafloxacin (100 mg twice daily for 7 days). Assessment of test of cure and reinfection risk occurred 14–90 days after the second antibiotic.

- **Results**: Of 244 evaluable M. genitalium infections (52 women, 68 heterosexual men, 124 men who have sex with men) diagnosed from 20 June 2016 to 15 May 2017, MRMs were detected in 167 (68.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 62.2%-74.2%]). Treatment with doxycycline decreased bacterial load by a mean 2.60 log₁₀ (n = 56; P < .0001). Microbiologic cure occurred in 73 of 77 MRM-negative infections (94.8% [95% CI, 87.2%-98.6%]) and in 154 of 167 MRM-positive infections (92.2% [95% CI, 87.1%-95.8%]). Selection of macrolide resistance occurred in only 2 of 76 (2.6% [95% CI, .3%-9.2%]) macrolide-susceptible infections.

- **Conclusions**: In the context of high levels of antimicrobial resistance, switching from azithromycin to doxycycline for presumptive treatment of M. genitalium offers an effective strategy.

### Mycoplasma genitalium and other reproductive tract infections in pregnant women, Papua New Guinea, 2015–2017 [^117NmHfn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Associations between infections were investigated among pregnant women. Of the 78 women with Mycoplasma genitalium infections, 28 (35.9%) had more than one concurrent sexually transmitted infection (STI) detected: 20 (25.6%) had Chlamydia trachomatis infections, 13 (16.7%) had Trichomonas vaginalis infections, and 6 (7.7%) had Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections. Co-infections were most frequent among women with Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections, with 80% (28/35) having another STI. Most women with Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections also had Chlamydia trachomatis infections (71.4%; 25/35), Trichomonas vaginalis infections (22.8%; 8/35), or Mycoplasma genitalium infections (17.1%; 6/35). Syphilis was excluded from co-infection estimates because the test did not distinguish between current and previous infections.

Of the 170 women with bacterial vaginosis (BV), 40.6% (69/170) had a co-infection. The most common co-infections were Chlamydia trachomatis (24.1%; 41/170), Trichomonas vaginalis (12.3%; 21/170), Mycoplasma genitalium (12.3%; 21/170), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (7.6%; 13/170).

Figure 1 illustrates the relationships among sexually transmitted infections in pregnant women in East New Britain, Papua New Guinea, from 2015 to 2017. Each line indicates more than two co-infections in one participant. The length of each sector corresponds to the number of monoinfections. Abbreviations: MG, Mycoplasma genitalium; CT, Chlamydia trachomatis; NG, Neisseria gonorrhoeae; TV, Trichomonas vaginalis.

### Developing a public health response to Mycoplasma genitalium [^112CowZm]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Although Mycoplasma genitalium is increasingly recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen, there is currently no defined public health response to this relatively newly identified sexually transmitted infection. Existing data are insufficient to justify routinely screening any defined population for M. genitalium infection. More effective therapies, data on the acceptability of screening and its impact on clinical outcomes, and better information on the natural history of infection will likely be required before the value of potential screening programs can be adequately assessed.

Insofar as diagnostic tests are available or become available in the near future, clinicians and public health agencies should consider integrating M. genitalium testing into the management of persons with sexually transmitted infection (STI) syndromes associated with the infection (i.e. urethritis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease) and their sex partners. Antimicrobial-resistant M. genitalium is a significant problem and may require clinicians and public health authorities to reconsider the management of STI syndromes in an effort to prevent the emergence of even more resistant M. genitalium infections.

### Mycoplasma genitalium in the US (MyGeniUS): Surveillance data from sexual health clinics in 4 US regions [^11342s7r]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

- **Discussion**: Mycoplasma genitalium prevalence among symptomatic and asymptomatic sexual health clinic (SHC) attendees in six US cities was 16.6%; site-specific prevalence ranged from 9.9% in Seattle to 23.5% in St. Louis. Only Seattle had implemented MG testing prior to the start of surveillance (October 2018), and Seattle's lower prevalence may reflect previous detection and treatment of long-duration prevalent infections. The overall prevalence was nearly 10 times higher than the prevalence in reproductive-age persons participating in NHANES 2017–2018 (1.7%; 95% CI 1.1–2.7%), which is not surprising. Most NHANES participants had a low likelihood of STIs (nearly 50% had fewer than five lifetime partners), whereas SHC attendees report more sexual risk behaviors. The 16.6% prevalence we observed was remarkably similar to a multicenter study in SHCs from 2013–2014, but somewhat higher than diverse US clinic types (10.3%) or Midwestern primary care clinics (6.8% in males, 11.4% in females). This difference is likely attributable to higher overall STI prevalence in SHCs.

As with most bacterial STIs, MG was more common among females than males. The higher prevalence in females may reflect a longer duration of genital infection (possibly due to the absence of symptoms in many) and/or more efficient transmission through penile-vaginal sex than other sexual behaviors. The higher prevalence in females may also be related to bacterial vaginosis (BV); BV in women is common and may enhance susceptibility to MG. The lower prevalence in males may also reflect the anatomic site of infection. We tested only urogenital specimens.

### Mycoplasma genitalium in the US (MyGeniUS): Surveillance data from sexual health clinics in 4 US regions [^116J7FRo]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Age-specific prevalence of Mycoplasma genitalium among persons attending urban sexual health clinics during September–December 2020 was examined, stratified by sex and sex/gender of sex partner. Abbreviations used include: Asx (asymptomatic), MG (Mycoplasma genitalium), MSM (men who have sex with men), MSW (men who have sex with women), Sx (symptomatic), WSM (women who have sex with men), and WSW (women who have sex with women).

- **Figure 1**: Age-specific prevalence data, noting that WSW with fewer than 18 years were suppressed due to only one individual in that age category. Additionally, four males reported another/unknown gender of sex partner and were excluded from calculations among MSW and MSM.

- **Figure 2 (A, B)**: Age-specific prevalence data stratified by symptom status, sex, and sex of sex partner. As with Figure 1, data for WSW under 18 years were suppressed, and the same exclusions applied to the four males who reported another/unknown gender of sex partner.

### Characteristics of Mycoplasma genitalium urogenital infections in a diverse patient sample from the United States: Results from the Aptima Mycoplasma genitalium evaluation study (AMES) [^112212rK]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Low credibility.

Data from a large prospective multicenter clinical validation study of a nucleic acid amplification in vitro diagnostic test for Mycoplasma genitalium were analyzed to describe the prevalence of M. genitalium infection, risk factors, and disease associations in female and male patients seeking care in diverse geographic regions of the United States. Among 1,737 female and 1,563 male participants, the overall prevalence of M. genitalium infection was 10.3% and was significantly higher in persons aged 15 to 24 years than in persons aged 35 to 39 years (for females, 19.8% versus 4.7% [odds ratio {OR} = 5.05; 95% confidence interval {CI} = 3.01 to 8.46]; for males, 16.5% versus 9.4% [OR = 1.91; 95% CI = 1.20 to 3.02]).

The risk for M. genitalium infection was higher in black than in white participants (for females, 12.0% versus 6.8% [OR = 1.88; 95% CI = 1.30 to 2.72]; for males, 12.9% versus 6.9% [OR = 2.02; 95% CI = 1.38 to 2.96]) and higher in non-Hispanic than in Hispanic participants (for females, 11.2% versus 6.0% [OR = 1.97; 95% CI = 1.25 to 3.10]; for males, 11.6% versus 6.8% [OR = 1.80; 95% CI = 1.14 to 2.85]). Participants reporting urogenital symptoms had a significantly elevated risk of M. genitalium infection compared to that for asymptomatic individuals (for females, OR = 1.53 [95% CI = 1.09 to 2.14]; for males, OR = 1.42 [95% CI = 1.02 to 1.99]).

Women diagnosed with vaginitis and cervicitis had a higher prevalence of M. genitalium infection than women without those diagnoses, although this was statistically significant only for vaginitis (for vaginitis, OR = 1.88 [95% CI = 1.37 to 2.58]).

### Association between Mycoplasma genitalium and acute endometritis [^113CYcKJ]. Lancet (2002). Low credibility.

Up to 70% of cases of pelvic inflammatory disease do not have a known cause. We recruited 115 women who presented to a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases in Nairobi, Kenya, with pelvic pain that had persisted for 14 days or less, to look for an association between Mycoplasma genitalium and endometritis. Using PCR, we detected M. genitalium in the cervix, endometrium, or both in nine (16%) of 58 women with histologically confirmed endometritis and in one (2%) of 57 women without endometritis (p = 0.02). Our results suggest that infection with M. genitalium is strongly associated with acute endometritis in this population.

### Infectious proctitis: What every gastroenterologist needs to know [^115U9Qrs]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) is a sexually transmitted pathogen responsible for non-chlamydial, non-gonococcal urogenital infections in men (10–35%) and genital tract infections in women. This includes pelvic inflammatory disease and related female reproductive complications, such as spontaneous abortion, pre-term birth, and infertility. Proctitis, when present, is clinically less pronounced or asymptomatic.

The pathogenic role of M. genitalium in proctitis has been described but remains unclear and lacks a strong association. Recently, an Australian study showed high rates of M. genitalium coinfection with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the rectum, with M. genitalium present in 13–14% of MSM (men who have sex with men).

There is no evidence that asymptomatic infection warrants treatment, as many patients spontaneously clear the organism. Therefore, asymptomatic screening is not recommended; testing for M. genitalium is only indicated in symptomatic proctitis after excluding other common etiologies. The detection of M. genitalium-specific nucleic acid in clinical specimens by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) is the best diagnostic method. This should be followed, if possible, with an assay for macrolide resistance mutations. In M. genitalium infection, proctoscopy reveals nonspecific findings in rectal mucosae similar to other infections, such as erythema, erosions, and mucopurulent exudate.

Regarding therapy, only a few antimicrobial classes have activity against mycoplasma. Azithromycin has a cure rate of 85–95%; however, macrolide resistance is an emerging problem worldwide.

### Distribution of macrolide resistant Mycoplasma genitalium in urogenital tract specimens from women enrolled in a US clinical study cohort [^1179q48U]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the distribution of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma genitalium in multiple urogenital specimens collected from women enrolled in a prospective multicenter US clinical study.

- **Methods**: Four female urogenital specimens (vaginal swab, urine, endocervical swab, ectocervical brush/spatula) collected from each subject were tested using a transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay for M. genitalium. TMA-positive specimens were evaluated by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and bidirectional Sanger sequencing of M. genitalium 23S rRNA to identify the presence of macrolide-resistance–mediating mutations (MRMs) at base positions 2058/2059.

- **Results**: Of 140 women with ≥ 1 TMA-positive specimens, 128 (91.4%) yielded M. genitalium 23S rRNA sequence. MRMs were found in 52% of vaginal specimens, 46.3% of urine specimens, 37.8% of endocervical specimens, and 46% of ectocervical specimens. There were 44 unique specimen type/sequence phenotype combinations of M. genitalium infection. Most (81; 63.3%) women had single specimen-sequence phenotype (macrolide-susceptible, MRM, or both) infections, while 24 (18.8%) women had multiple specimen-sequence phenotype concordant infections, and 23 (17.9%) women had multiple specimen-sequence phenotype discordant infections. The sensitivity for any single specimen type to detect overall urogenital tract macrolide-resistant M. genitalium infection status was 96.3% for vaginal swab samples, 82.6% for urine samples, 70.8% for endocervical swab samples, and 82.1% for ectocervical brush/spatula samples.

### Symptoms, sites, and significance of Mycoplasma genitalium in men who have sex with men [^115Jf5g6]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

During the period from August 23, 2016, to September 27, 2017, a total of 1,028 men who have sex with men (MSM) were triaged as asymptomatic and invited to participate in the study. Of these, 17 declined: 3 declined the additional rectal swab specimen collection, and 14 declined for reasons unrelated to the study, such as distress or being unable to return to the clinic. Of the remaining 1,011 participants, a total of 6 rectal swabs were unassessable due to an internal control failure, and 4 did not provide a urine sample. Consequently, these 10 patients were excluded from the analysis, leaving 1,001 men with assessable samples from both collection sites.

Participants had a median age of 28.8 years, with an interquartile range of 24.3 to 34.1 years. A total of 107 participants (10.7%) were HIV positive, and 142 (15.9%) of the HIV-negative men were taking or commencing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis medication (PrEP).

### Azithromycin and doxycycline resistance profiles of U.S. Mycoplasma genitalium strains and their association with treatment outcomes [^113BByiv]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is a sexually transmitted bacterium associated with nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) in men and cervicitis, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease in women. Effective treatment is challenging due to the inherent and increasingly acquired antibiotic resistance in this pathogen. In our treatment trial conducted from 2007 to 2011 in Seattle, WA, we demonstrated poor efficacy of azithromycin (AZM) and doxycycline (DOX) against M. genitalium among men with NGU.

In the present study, we cultured M. genitalium from 74 out of 80 (92.5%) PCR-positive men at enrollment (V-1) and determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of AZM (N = 56 isolates) and DOX (N = 62 isolates).

Susceptibility to AZM was bimodal. MICs were more than 8μg/ml in 44.6% of cases, while 8 out of 18 men had isolates that featured AZM MICs of exactly 8μg/ml. Conversely, DOX MICs ranged from less than 0.125 to 2μg/ml and showed no correlation with microbiologic (P = 0.71) or clinical treatment failure (P = 0.41), demonstrating no relationship between DOX MICs and treatment efficacy.

Given the rapid spread of AZM resistance and the emergence of quinolone resistance, these findings are concerning for treatment outcomes.

### The association between Mycoplasma genitalium and HIV-1 acquisition in African women [^11518PG3]. AIDS (2012). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is an emerging sexually transmitted infection (STI) and has been associated with reproductive tract infections and HIV in cross-sectional studies. In this longitudinal study, we assess whether M. genitalium is associated with the risk of acquiring HIV-1 infection.

- **Design**: Nested case-control study within a large prospective study in Zimbabwe and Uganda

- **Methods**: A total of 190 women who seroconverted to HIV-1 during follow-up (cases) were matched with up to two HIV-negative controls. Mycoplasma genitalium testing was performed by PCR-ELISA, using archived cervical samples from the HIV-1 detection visit and the last HIV-negative visit for cases, and equivalent visits in follow-up time for controls. Risk factors for HIV-1 acquisition were analyzed using conditional logistic regression, with M. genitalium as the primary exposure.

- **Results**: Mycoplasma genitalium was a common infection in these populations, with a prevalence of 14.8% and 6.5% among cases and controls, respectively, at the visit prior to HIV-1 detection, and it was more prevalent than other nonviral STIs. We found a greater than two-fold independent increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition among women infected with M. genitalium at the visit prior to HIV-1 acquisition (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–5.80), and at the time of HIV-1 acquisition (AOR = 2.18; 95% CI 0.98–4.85). An estimated 8.7% (95% CI 0.1–12.2%) of incident HIV-1 infections were attributable to M. genitalium.

This is the first longitudinal study to assess the relationship between M. genitalium and HIV-1 acquisition in African women.

### Mycoplasma genitalium: Accurate diagnosis is necessary for adequate treatment [^116rR6gC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium is very difficult to grow in culture but has been more easily studied for disease associations since the advent of molecular amplification assays. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other molecular assays have demonstrated an association with adverse disease outcomes, such as urethritis or nongonococcal urethritis in men and adverse reproductive sequelae in women, for example, cervicitis, endometritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), including an association with the risk for human immunodeficiency virus. The lack of commercially available diagnostic assays has limited widespread routine testing. Increasing reports of high rates of resistance to azithromycin detected in research studies have heightened the need for available commercial diagnostic assays and standardized methods for detecting resistance markers. This review covers available molecular methods for the diagnosis of M. genitalium and assays to predict the antibiotic susceptibility to azithromycin.

- **Methods**: A PubMed (US National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health) search was conducted for literature published between 2000 and 2016, using the search terms Mycoplasma genitalium, M. genitalium, diagnosis, and detection.

- **Results**: Early PCR diagnostic tests focused on the MPa adhesion gene and the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Subsequently, a transcription-mediated amplification assay targeting ribosomes was developed and widely used to study the epidemiology of M. genitalium. Newer methods have proliferated and include quantitative PCR for organisms.

### Azithromycin 1.5g over 5 days compared to 1g single dose in urethral Mycoplasma genitalium: Impact on treatment outcome and resistance [^1127ZNA9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

We evaluated the impact of extended azithromycin (1.5g over 5 days) on the selection of macrolide resistance and microbiological cure in men with Mycoplasma genitalium urethritis during 2013–2015. This was compared to cases treated with azithromycin 1g in 2012–2013.

- **Methods**: Microbiological cure was determined for men with M. genitalium urethritis treated with azithromycin 1.5g using quantitative polymerase chain reaction specific for M. genitalium DNA on samples taken 14–100 days post-treatment. Pre- and post-treatment macrolide resistance mutations were detected by sequencing the 23 S gene.

- **Results**: There was no difference in proportions with microbiological cure between azithromycin 1.5g and 1g: 62/106 (58%; 95% confidence interval, 49%-68%) and 56/107 (52%; 95%CI 42%-62%), P = 0.34, respectively. Similarly, there was no difference in the proportion of wild-type 23 S rRNA (presumed macrolide sensitive) infections cured after 1.5g and azithromycin 1g: 28/34 (82%; 95%CI 65%-92%) and 49/60 (82%; 95%CI 70%-90%), P = 1.0, respectively. There was no difference between 1.5g and 1g in the proportions of wild-type infections with post-treatment resistance mutations: 4/34 (12%; 95%CI 3%-27%) and 11/60 (18%; 95%CI 10%-30%), respectively, P = 0.40. Pre-treatment resistance was present in 51/98 (52%; 95%CI 42%-62%) cases in 2013–2015 compared to 47/107 (44%; 95%CI 34%-54%) in 2012–2013, P = 0.25.

- **Conclusions**: Extended azithromycin 1.5g was no more effective than a single 1g dose at achieving cure of M. genitalium urethritis and importantly did not reduce the selection of macrolide resistance.

### Mycoplasma genitalium infection in adults reporting sexual contact with infected partners, Australia, 2008–2016 [^116dLcqY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. The study is retrospective and relies on self-report of exposure to infection without laboratory confirmation. As such, the data reflect the prevalence of infection only among those persons who seek care reporting exposure to M. genitalium rather than among all of those exposed. We have no information on contacts of infected patients who did not attend the clinic, and these persons are likely to be systematically different from those who did seek out testing and treatment. These findings might also not be generalizable to non–STI clinic populations or to other populations with a different background prevalence of M. genitalium infection. Although we considered the notifying partner the index patient for analytical purposes, we cannot ascertain the transmission direction between sex partners or whether transmission occurred through a third person. Sexual behavioral data were self-reported and hence subject to recall bias. The most notable limitation was the lack of dual-site testing for MSM contacts, which limited our ability to report precise estimates of infection among MSM and to examine concordance in MSM dyads.

### Symptoms, sites, and significance of Mycoplasma genitalium in men who have sex with men [^112ZBSBB]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

We compared the urine test positivity for Mycoplasma genitalium and Chlamydia trachomatis in the asymptomatic study population (n = 1,001) with the positivity in 1,019 men who have sex with men (MSM) presenting with symptoms of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) during the study period. Both M. genitalium (8.1% vs. 2.7%; OR 3.20 [95% CI 2.03–5.18]) and C. trachomatis (14.5% vs. 1.7%; OR 9.99 [95% CI 5.89–18.07]) were more commonly detected in MSM with symptoms of NGU than in asymptomatic MSM. Note that cases were treated as NGU but not confirmed by urethral Gram stain.

### Comparison of two testing strategies for Mycoplasma genitalium in emergency department patients across a statewide health system [^112b4G2F]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Mycoplasma genitalium (Mgen) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) with an estimated prevalence in the general population of 2.3% in women and 1.1% in men aged 21–23 years. A cross-sectional study conducted in a community emergency department (ED) determined that the prevalence of Mgen was 14.8% in asymptomatic female patients. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2021 STI Treatment Guidelines recommend testing for Mgen in select circumstances.

This study aims to determine what testing strategy in ED patients results in the most appropriate treatment of Mgen based on CDC recommendations.

This multicenter, retrospective, pre- and post-intervention cohort study assessed adherence to CDC recommendations for appropriate management of Mgen in ED patients. Inclusion criteria were patients at least 18 years of age, discharged from one of the 15 ED sites within the health system studied, who were tested for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis (T. vaginalis), and Mgen. Subjects were excluded if they were pregnant, sexually assaulted, or had indeterminate STI results.

- **Cohort 1**: Patients evaluated from May 2022 through July 2022, where Mgen was incorporated into the standard STI testing panel.

- **Cohort 2**: Consisted of patients evaluated from September 2022 through November 2022. Testing for Mgen in cohort 2 was optional, and a testing algorithm based on CDC recommendations was applied.

### Doxycycline and sitafloxacin combination therapy for treating highly resistant Mycoplasma genitalium [^117BGQQY]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial-resistant Mycoplasma genitalium is becoming increasingly common and creating major treatment challenges. We present early data on combination therapy with doxycycline and sitafloxacin to treat highly resistant M. genitalium. We found the regimen was well tolerated and cured 11 out of 12 infections that had failed prior regimens with moxifloxacin and pristinamycin.
