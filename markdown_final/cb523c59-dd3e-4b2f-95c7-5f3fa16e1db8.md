## Question

What are the treatment options for pulpitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment options for pulpitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing reversible from irreversible pulpitis because that dictates the intervention. Then, I should verify immediate pain control strategies and when definitive endodontic treatment versus extraction is indicated. Next, I need to check the role of antibiotics and when they are appropriate. After that, I will review procedural details and risks during endodontic therapy, pediatric considerations, and restoration planning. Finally, I should confirm follow-up priorities, red flags, and any adjunct or investigational options that might come up.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame, because the treatment hinges on whether the pulp can recover. Reversible pulpitis usually presents with brief, non‑lingering pain to cold, without spontaneous night pain or periapical changes, and the aim is to preserve pulp vitality; in contrast, irreversible pulpitis features lingering thermal pain, spontaneous episodes, and often progresses to necrosis and apical disease if untreated, so the aim is to remove the inflamed or infected tissue or the tooth itself [^113zYuA4] [^116DrWcy].

> For reversible pulpitis, hold on, let's not jump to aggressive procedures; the plan should prioritize removing the irritant and maintaining vitality with conservative caries control. I should double‑check that selective carious tissue removal, stepwise excavation, and sealing strategies reduce bacterial load and symptoms while avoiding unnecessary pulp exposure, and that direct or indirect pulp capping with bioactive materials is appropriate when the pulp is vital and symptoms are mild and non‑lingering [^1161cLLE] [^113zYuA4].

> For irreversible pulpitis, I need to ensure the definitive source control is operative, not systemic. Access to the pulp with pulpotomy or pulpectomy and completion of root canal treatment is the standard to relieve pain and prevent progression; extraction is an alternative when the tooth is non‑restorable or the patient preference dictates this path, and I should confirm that both choices provide source control of the nociceptive driver [^114fNkTj] [^116BydPU] [^116DrWcy].

> Now, on acute pain control, let me think about perioperative and postoperative strategies. Non‑opioid analgesics are the mainstay, but I should confirm that opioids are reserved only when alternatives are inadequate and for the shortest duration possible per labeling; intraoperative adjuncts like supplemental intraligamentary injections can improve anesthesia in hot pulps, and randomized data suggest fentanyl as a supplemental intraligamentary agent enhanced analgesia during debridement stages compared with local anesthetic alone, though this is a niche technique requiring careful risk–benefit consideration [^116B7iwA] [^111Pv4B7].

> On antibiotics, wait, let me verify a common pitfall: it's tempting to think antibiotics relieve irreversible pulpitis pain; but when I check the evidence, systemic antibiotics do not reduce pain or analgesic use in irreversible pulpitis without systemic or spreading infection, and should not be used as primary therapy in that scenario; for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess, guidelines and multiple Cochrane reviews concur that antibiotics are indicated only with systemic involvement or spreading cellulitis, lymphadenitis, or diffuse swelling, with operative source control prioritized otherwise [^117Dz72q] [^112MC1vJ] [^114nqXGY] [^117R6kXZ] [^113DW4FB].

> Next, I should review key procedural considerations during endodontic therapy, because technique affects outcomes and safety. Mechanical preparation plus chemical disinfection is required; sodium hypochlorite is a cornerstone irrigant, though I need to ensure careful technique to avoid NaOCl accidents given documented risks of soft‑tissue injury, while recognizing the uncertainty about the optimal irrigant concentration or alternative agents; instrumentation may be done with hand or ultrasonic methods, with no clear superiority in clinical outcomes; and I should double‑check that completing treatment in one versus multiple visits shows little difference in long‑term success, so scheduling can be individualized to presentation and infection control [^117WqGt1] [^117NUzuj] [^114fNkTj] [^116QcGNx].

> If disease persists or recurs with periapical pathology after primary therapy, I will now examine retreatment options. Non‑surgical endodontic retreatment is often first‑line to address persistent intraradicular infection; when indicated, endodontic microsurgery with root‑end resection and retrograde filling is a reasonable alternative, and I need to check that material choice for retrograde sealing can influence success, supporting careful selection during apical surgery [^113Dih6h] [^114iUKRA] [^117SxjzK].

> Pediatric considerations require a pause so I can verify priorities for primary teeth. In children with extensive decay reaching the pulp, pulpotomy or pulpectomy is standard depending on vitality and extent, with medicaments such as MTA or formocresol variably used; I should confirm that evidence does not identify a single clearly superior technique across all contexts, so clinician judgment and tooth‑specific factors guide the choice, aiming to maintain the tooth when feasible [^1133YR8a] [^114fdVfo].

> After endodontic therapy, let me ensure restoration planning is addressed because coronal seal influences prognosis. I should double‑check that while many root‑filled posterior teeth ultimately benefit from cuspal coverage, comparative evidence between full crowns and direct restorations is limited and mixed, so restoration choice should be based on residual tooth structure and risk of fracture; concurrently, modern caries management principles for residual lesions still apply to protect pulp and periapical health [^115DcVBb] [^116bLAuk] [^1161cLLE].

> But wait, what about adjunct or investigational modalities often mentioned to patients. Lasers and antimicrobial photodynamic therapy show in vitro bactericidal effects and potential adjunctive benefit when combined with standard endodontic measures, yet clinical evidence remains limited; I should emphasize these are not substitutes for conventional debridement and disinfection and should be considered investigational in routine care [^114BpYU7] [^114WZJUW].

> To keep the pathophysiology in mind, I should confirm that pulpitis pain and progression reflect host–microbe interactions, with cytokine and RANKL‑mediated pathways linked to early pulpitis and apical bone signaling, and that age and host genetics can modulate pain intensity and susceptibility, although these insights do not alter acute management decisions today; this helps me counsel patients about variability in symptom severity and disease course while staying focused on source control [^111K4Fo3] [^116d9HeL] [^114iM7Zy] [^112FAQPT] [^115Rvzev] [^114B1qvM] [^114ZkL3k] [^116wp3ww].

> Finally, let me reconsider follow‑up and red flags so I do not miss complications. Delays in treating irreversible pulpitis can lead to pulpal necrosis with progression to symptomatic apical periodontitis, abscess, and even fascial space infection; I need to check for fever, malaise, diffuse swelling, trismus, or lymphadenitis that would warrant urgent drainage and antibiotic therapy in addition to definitive dental treatment, and ensure timely reassessment after interim measures to confirm symptom resolution and healing trajectory [^116DrWcy] [^114JKeUQ] [^114nqXGY] [^117R6kXZ].

Pulpitis treatment depends on whether the condition is **reversible** or **irreversible**. For reversible pulpitis, **remove the irritant** (caries, defective restorations), perform selective or stepwise caries removal [^1161cLLE], and restore the tooth to maintain pulp vitality [^113zYuA4]. For irreversible pulpitis, definitive care is **root canal therapy or extraction** [^114fNkTj]; antibiotics are not indicated unless there is systemic involvement or spreading infection [^114nqXGY] [^117Dz72q] [^117R6kXZ]. Pain is managed with NSAIDs [^114WFcMB], and opioids are reserved for severe cases when alternatives are inadequate [^116B7iwA]. Early intervention prevents progression to pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis [^114JKeUQ] [^111K4Fo3].

---

## Diagnosis and classification

Accurate diagnosis is **essential for treatment planning** [^114dGmtx]. Pulpitis is classified into two categories: **reversible pulpitis**, marked by mild inflammation — typically from caries, defective restorations, or trauma — with short, sharp pain to thermal stimuli that resolves when the stimulus is removed; and **irreversible pulpitis**, marked by severe, persistent inflammation — often from extensive caries, deep restorations, or trauma — with spontaneous pain, prolonged thermal sensitivity, and difficulty localizing the affected tooth [^116DrWcy].

---

## Treatment of reversible pulpitis

The primary goal is to remove the irritant and restore the tooth to **maintain pulp vitality** [^113zYuA4]. Recommended treatments include:

- **Removal of irritants**: Caries removal, replacement of defective restorations, and elimination of other irritants [^1161cLLE].

- **Restorative procedures**: Selective carious tissue removal, stepwise carious tissue removal, or conventional restoration techniques [^1161cLLE].

- **Vital pulp therapy**: Direct or indirect pulp capping, or pulpotomy, depending on the extent of pulp exposure and inflammation [^113zYuA4].

---

## Treatment of irreversible pulpitis

Irreversible pulpitis requires **definitive treatment** to prevent progression to pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis. Primary options are **root canal therapy (RCT)** — removal of inflamed pulp tissue, cleaning and shaping the root canal system, and obturation with biocompatible materials [^114fNkTj] [^117WqGt1] — or **extraction**, indicated when the tooth is non-restorable or the patient prefers extraction over RCT.

---

## Pain management strategies

Effective pain management is crucial in pulpitis treatment [^114WFcMB]. Recommended strategies include **nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)** as first-line therapy for dental pain, and **opioids** only for severe pain when NSAIDs are insufficient or contraindicated [^116B7iwA] [^111Pv4B7].

---

## Role of antibiotics

Antibiotics are generally not indicated for pulpitis unless there is **systemic involvement** or a **spreading infection** [^113DW4FB]. Clinical guidelines recommend antibiotics only for systemic signs — fever, malaise, or lymph node involvement — or for cellulitis or diffuse swelling [^114nqXGY] [^117R6kXZ].

---

## Potential complications of untreated pulpitis

Untreated pulpitis can cause **significant complications**, including:

- **Pulp necrosis**: Death of pulp tissue, leading to chronic infection [^114JKeUQ].

- **Apical periodontitis**: Inflammation and destruction of periradicular tissues [^111K4Fo3].

- **Dental abscess**: Accumulation of pus, causing severe pain and swelling [^113bNp7S].

- **Tooth loss**: Resulting from extensive infection and structural damage [^116DrWcy].

---

## Emerging and experimental treatments

Recent research has explored **novel therapeutic approaches** for pulpitis, such as:

- **Regenerative endodontics**: Stem cell-based therapies and bioactive scaffolds to promote pulp regeneration [^1137jx9e].

- **Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT)**: Combined with conventional endodontic treatment to enhance bacterial eradication [^114WZJUW].

- **Laser therapy**: Er:YAG laser irradiation for bacterial elimination in root canals [^114BpYU7].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies are essential to reduce **recurrence** [^116DrWcy]. Key measures include maintaining oral hygiene with regular brushing, flossing, and professional cleanings; reducing sugar intake and avoiding highly cariogenic foods; and attending regular dental check-ups for early detection and management of caries and other issues [^112FoRf1]. Pulpitis treatment involves removing irritants, restoring the tooth, and managing pain, while antibiotics are used only when there is systemic involvement or spreading infection [^114nqXGY]. Untreated pulpitis can lead to serious complications, so **early intervention is important** [^114JKeUQ].

Irreversible pulpitis, characterized by acute and intense pain, is one of the most frequent reasons patients seek emergency dental care. Apart from tooth removal, the customary method of alleviating the pain of irreversible pulpitis involves drilling into the tooth, removing the inflamed pulp (nerve), and cleaning the root canal. However, a significant number of dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics to stop the pain of irreversible pulpitis. This review updates the previous version published in 2016.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^114nqXGY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Dental pain can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for these conditions should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists frequently prescribe antibiotics in the absence of these signs. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This review is the second update of the original version first published in 2014.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (26 February 2018 (discontinued)), CENTRAL (2022, Issue 10), MEDLINE Ovid (23 November 2022), Embase Ovid (23 November 2022), CINAHL EBSCO (25 November 2022), and two trials registries, and performed a grey literature search. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication.

### Dental topics for plastic surgeons, part three: Infection and trauma of the dentition [^114JKeUQ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Delays in the treatment of a tooth with irreversible pulpitis may eventually progress to pulpal necrosis, an end-stage pathology. The affected teeth may initially show a pinkish discoloration that can progress to a persistent gray with failure to return to normal color. This process may be accompanied by prolonged periapical inflammation, increased tooth sensitivity, tenderness to percussion, and arrested root development.

Treatment of primary necrotic teeth should strive to reduce the impact on the succedaneous permanent tooth. Depending on the condition of the tooth, the patient's age, and the position of the permanent succedaneous tooth, the pediatric dentist may recommend endodontic therapy or extraction of the affected tooth to prevent damage to its permanent successor. Permanent teeth with pulpal necrosis are addressed with endodontic therapy or tooth extraction. If the infective process spreads beyond the tooth structure and into the surrounding bone, it may expand into the soft tissues of the head and neck. Pathophysiologically, the pulp chamber within the tooth acts as a direct conduit to the underlying sterile alveolar bone and soft tissue and may result in periapical disease and associated complications.

- **Periapical disease**: In the setting of irreversible pulpitis and non-vital/necrotic teeth, the area surrounding the tooth apices may become inflamed with the development of cysts or abscesses. These pathologies are closely related and often transition reversibly from one to another.

### Pulp management for caries in adults: Maintaining pulp vitality [^113zYuA4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

There is a range of treatment options for the management of the pulp in extensively decayed teeth. These include direct and indirect pulp capping, pulpotomy, or pulpectomy. If the tooth is symptomatic or if there are periapical bone changes, endodontic treatment is required. However, if the tooth is asymptomatic but the caries is extensive, there is no consensus on the best method of management.

Recently, there has been a move towards using alternative materials and methods such as the direct or indirect placement of bonding agents and mineral trioxide aggregate. Most studies have investigated the management of asymptomatic carious teeth, with or without an exposed dental pulp, using various capping materials (e.g. calcium hydroxide, Ledermix, Triodent, Biorex). However, there is no long-term data regarding the outcome of the management of asymptomatic, carious teeth according to different regimens.

- **Objectives**: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of techniques used to treat asymptomatic carious teeth and maintain pulp vitality.

- **Search strategy**: Electronic searches of the following databases were undertaken: The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (March 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to week 4, February 2006), EMBASE (1974 to 13 March 2006), National Research Register (March 2006), and Science Citation Index - SCISEARCH (1981 to March 2006). Detailed search strategies were developed for each database.

### Percocet [^116B7iwA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Percocet is indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic, for which alternative treatments are inadequate.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration [see WARNINGS], reserve Percocet for patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics) have not been tolerated or are not expected to be tolerated, or have not provided adequate analgesia or are not expected to provide adequate analgesia.

Percocet should not be used for an extended period of time unless the pain remains severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and alternative treatment options continue to be inadequate.

### Interventions for treating cavitated or dentine carious lesions [^1161cLLE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Traditionally, cavitated carious lesions and those extending into dentine have been treated by 'complete' removal of carious tissue, i.e. non-selective removal and conventional restoration (CR). Alternative strategies for managing cavitated or dentine carious lesions involve minimal or no removal of carious tissue. These strategies include selective carious tissue removal (or selective excavation, SE), stepwise carious tissue removal (SW), sealing carious lesions using sealant materials, sealing using preformed metal crowns (Hall Technique, HT), and non-restorative cavity control (NRCC).

- **Objectives**: To determine the comparative effectiveness of interventions such as CR, SE, SW, sealing of carious lesions using sealant materials or preformed metal crowns (HT), or NRCC. These interventions aim to treat carious lesions conventionally considered to require restorations, including cavitated or micro-cavitated lesions, or occlusal lesions that are clinically non-cavitated but clinically/radiographically extend into dentine in primary or permanent teeth with vital (sensitive) pulps.

- **Search methods**: An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 21 July 2020 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. Randomised clinical trials comparing different levels of carious tissue removal against each other, placebo, or no treatment were included. Participants had permanent or primary teeth (or both) with vital pulps (i.e. no irreversible pulpitis/pulp necrosis), and carious lesions conventionally considered to need a restoration.

### Dental topics for plastic surgeons, part three: Infection and trauma of the dentition [^113BguFU]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Condensing osteitis and chronic osteomyelitis with proliferative periostitis (or Garre sclerosing osteomyelitis) (Fig. 5) are two other relatively common entities associated with a localized inflammatory response in the maxillofacial region. Condensing osteitis, also known as focal sclerosing osteomyelitis, involves areas of bony sclerosis adjacent to apical infections or pulpal necrosis. It is effectively managed by treating the underlying tooth infection. Garre sclerosing osteomyelitis is typically found in the pediatric population and often results from an odontogenic source of infection or inflammation. This disorder is characterized by the formation of multiple parallel layers of reactive bone due to stimulation of the overlying periosteum. Treatment of the underlying source of inflammation typically leads to resolution and restoration of normal bone after 6 to 12 months. In some instances, osseous recontouring may be necessary.

There are other less common variants of osteomyelitis such as diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis, primary chronic osteomyelitis, and chronic tendoperiostitis. Although an in-depth discussion of these often non-surgical pathologies is beyond the scope of this article, brief descriptions of each are provided. Diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis results after an unknown stimulus (potentially prior chronic bacterial infection) stimulates sclerosis of the surrounding bone.

### Periapical fluid RANKL and IL-8 are differentially regulated in pulpitis and apical periodontitis [^111K4Fo3]. Cytokine (2014). Low credibility.

The dental pulp space can become infected due to a breach in the surrounding hard tissues, leading to inflammation of the pulp (pulpitis), soft tissue breakdown, and eventually bone loss around the root apex (apical periodontitis). The sequence of molecular events leading to apical periodontitis is not yet fully understood. The main inflammatory mediator associated with neutrophil chemotaxis is interleukin-8 (IL-8), while bone resorption is closely tied to the dyad of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG).

The levels of RANKL, OPG, and IL-8 were studied in periapical tissue fluid of human teeth (n = 48) diagnosed with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (SIP) and asymptomatic apical periodontitis (AAP). SIP represents the starting point of the disease, while AAP reflects an established steady state. Periapical tissue fluid samples were collected using paper points and assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Target protein levels per case were calibrated against the corresponding total protein content, as determined fluorometrically.

Results showed that RANKL was expressed at significantly higher levels in SIP compared to AAP (P < 0.05), while OPG was under the detection limit in most samples. In contrast, IL-8 levels were significantly lower in SIP compared to AAP (P < 0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis between RANKL and IL-8 showed a significantly negative correlation between the two measures (rho = -.44, P < 0.05). These findings suggest that in the development of apical periodontitis, periapical bone resorption signaling, as determined by

### Antibiotic use for irreversible pulpitis [^112MC1vJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Irreversible pulpitis, characterized by acute and intense pain, is a common reason for emergency dental care. The usual method for relieving pain involves drilling into the tooth, removing the inflamed pulp (nerve), and cleaning the root canal. Despite this, many dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics as a means to alleviate the pain of irreversible pulpitis.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic antibiotics for irreversible pulpitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (up to 5 September 2013); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 5 September 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 5 September 2013); and the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov). There were no language restrictions in the searches of the electronic databases.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials were included if they compared pain relief with systemic antibiotics and analgesics against placebo and analgesics in the acute preoperative phase of irreversible pulpitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors screened studies and extracted data independently. We assessed the quality of the evidence of included studies using GRADEPro software. Pooling of data was not possible, and a descriptive summary is presented.

- **Main results**: One trial, assessed at low risk of bias and involving 40 participants, was included in this update.

### Genome-wide association study of pulpal and apical diseases [^114ZkL3k]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The Estonian Biobank (EstBB) is a population-based biobank with approximately 200,000 participants. Of these, 83% were individuals of Estonian origin, 14% were of Russian origin, and 3% belonged to other ethnicities. In this study, the data freeze 2020v4 was utilized. All biobank participants signed a broad informed consent form, and information on ICD-10 codes is regularly obtained through linkage with the national Health Insurance Fund and other relevant databases. The majority of electronic health records have been collected since 2004. The three phenotypes examined were:

1. Any diagnosis in ICD-10 category K04, named as phenotype pulpal and apical diseases
2. Pulpitis (K04.0)
3. Necrosis of pulp or apical periodontitis (K04.1, K04.2, K04.4, K04.5, K04.6, K04.7)

### Odontogenic orofacial infections [^113bNp7S]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Acute dental abscess is a frequent and sometimes underestimated disease of the oral cavity. The acute dental abscess usually occurs secondary to caries, trauma, or failed endodontic treatment. After the intact pulp chamber is opened, colonization of the root canals occurs with a variable set of anaerobic bacteria, which colonize the walls of the necrotic root canals, forming a specialized mixed anaerobic biofilm. Asymptomatic necrosis is common; however, abscess formation occurs when these bacteria and their toxic products breach into the periapical tissues through the apical foramen, inducing acute inflammation and pus formation.

The main signs and symptoms of the acute dental abscess (often referred to as a periapical abscess or infection) are pain, swelling, erythema, and suppuration, usually localized to the affected tooth. Despite this, the abscess can eventually spread, causing a severe odontogenic infection characterized by local and systemic involvement culminating in sepsis syndrome. The vast majority of dental abscesses respond to antibiotic treatment. However, in some patients, surgical management of the infection may be indicated.

This work involves a retrospective analysis of patients with dental orofacial infections referred to the Unit of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery of the University of Verona from 1991 to 2011.

### Gene expression profile of pulpitis [^1146uU8E]. Genes and Immunity (2016). Low credibility.

The cost, prevalence, and pain associated with endodontic disease necessitate an understanding of the fundamental molecular aspects of its pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify the genetic contributors to pulpal pain and inflammation. Inflamed pulps were collected from patients diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis (n = 20), while normal pulps from teeth extracted for various reasons served as controls (n = 20). Pain levels were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Genome-wide microarray analysis was performed using the Affymetrix GeneTitan Multichannel Instrument. The difference in gene expression levels was determined by the significance analysis of the microarray program using a false discovery rate (q-value) of 5%. Genes involved in immune response, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and signaling, integrin cell surface interactions, and others were expressed at relatively higher levels in the pulpitis group. Moreover, several genes known to modulate pain and inflammation showed differential expression in asymptomatic and mild pain patients (⩾30mm on VAS) compared with those with moderate to severe pain. This exploratory study provides a molecular basis for the clinical diagnosis of pulpitis. With an enhanced understanding of pulpal inflammation, future studies on the treatment and management of pulpitis, and on pain associated with it, can have a biological reference to bridge treatment strategies with pulpal biology.

### Genome-wide association study of pulpal and apical diseases [^115Rvzev]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Genetic variations in Class II HLA genes were associated with endodontic infections. The lead SNPs were also associated with caries, suggesting that genetic variation in the HLA region may be involved in the initiation and progression of both diseases. HLA molecules of this class are almost solely expressed in professional antigen-presenting cells activated by microbial infections, generating the humoral immune response.

In our gene ontology analyses of the protein-coding gene families, the results were dominated by MHC Class II-related pathways: pulpal and apical diseases and pulpitis were associated with genetic variants near HLA-DRB1, whereas necrosis of the pulp or apical periodontitis was associated with variation near HLA-DQA1. These variants were associated with downregulation of HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB5, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DQB1-AS1, and the upregulation of HLA-DQA2 and HLA-DQB2 in multiple tissues. Of these, HLA-DRB1 had a particularly high expression level in the dental pulp.

The HLA allele analyses emphasized the importance of A✱32:01 (frequency 4%) as protective and DRB4✱01:03 (22%), DRB1✱04:01 (9%), DQA1✱03:01 (11%), and DQB1✱03:02 (12%) as risk alleles. Altogether, 14 HLA alleles were associated with the phenotypes in the discovery analyses, and four of these associations could be replicated in other populations. Although in populations of European ancestry, haplotype HLA-DRB1✱04-DQA1✱03-DQB1✱03:02 is associated with the highest risk of type 1 diabetes, the associations of single alleles with endodontic infections were independent of autoimmune diseases.

### Direct composite resin fillings versus amalgam fillings for permanent posterior teeth [^115pQESQ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Traditionally, amalgam has been used for filling cavities in posterior teeth, and it continues to be the restorative material of choice in some low- and middle-income countries due to its effectiveness and relatively low cost. However, there are concerns over the use of amalgam restorations with regard to mercury release in the body and the environmental impact of mercury disposal. Dental composite resin materials are an aesthetic alternative to amalgam, and their mechanical properties have developed sufficiently to make them suitable for restoring posterior teeth. Nevertheless, composite resin materials may have potential for toxicity to human health and the environment.

The United Nations Environment Programme has established the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which is an international treaty that aims "to protect the human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds". It entered into force in August 2017, and as of February 2021, it had been ratified by 127 governments. Ratification involves committing to the adoption of at least two of nine proposed measures to phase down the use of mercury, including amalgam in dentistry.

In light of this, we have updated a review originally published in 2014, expanding the scope of the review by undertaking an additional search for harms outcomes. Our review synthesizes the results of studies that evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety of amalgam versus composite resin restorations and evaluates the level of certainty we can have in that evidence.

### Common dental emergencies [^116DrWcy]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Dental caries, a bacterial disease of the teeth characterized by the destruction of enamel and dentine, is often the underlying cause of dental pain. When a carious lesion impinges on the dental pulp, pulpitis follows, and ultimately, necrosis of the pulp occurs. Untreated necrosis may lead to a localized abscess or a spreading infection into the surrounding soft tissue, resulting in cellulitis. Immediate treatment involves antibiotic therapy for cellulitis, perhaps with drainage of abscesses, while definitive treatment requires root canal therapy or extraction of the involved tooth.

- **Pericoronitis**: Inflammation of the soft tissue overlying a partially erupted tooth. Localized cases respond to irrigation, although secondary cellulitis can develop. Definitive treatment may require surgical extraction of the underlying tooth or excision of the gum flap.

- **Avulsion of a permanent tooth**: Secondary to trauma, this is a true dental emergency. The tooth should be reimplanted on the spot, and the patient should be seen immediately by a dentist for splinting and antibiotic prophylaxis.

Most dental problems can be prevented with regular dental care and steps to minimize risks of oral trauma.

### Ultrasonic versus hand instrumentation for orthograde root canal treatment of permanent teeth [^1129oBvD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Endodontic treatment of root canals, or root canal treatment, is a frequently performed dental procedure. It is carried out on teeth in which irreversible pulpitis has led to necrosis (death) of the dental pulp (nerve). Removal of the necrotic tissue remnants and the cleaning and shaping of the root canal are important phases of root canal treatment. Treatment options include the use of hand and rotary instruments and methods using ultrasonic or sonic equipment.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this review were to determine the relative clinical effectiveness of ultrasonic versus hand instrumentation for orthograde root canal treatment of permanent teeth.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles and a personal database of trial reports in an attempt to locate additional published and unpublished trials. No language restriction was applied. The last electronic search was conducted in September 2006.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials involving people over 18 years of age with single and multiple permanent teeth with a completely formed apex and with no evidence of internal resorption, requiring root canal treatment, were included. Patients undertaking re-treatment of a tooth were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Screening of eligible studies was conducted in duplicate and independently by two review authors. Results were to be expressed as fixed or random-effects models using mean d.

### Chronic pain and infection: Mechanisms, causes, conditions, treatments, and controversies [^114WFcMB]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Between September 2021 and January 2022, we searched the following databases for articles pertaining to chronic pain and infection: PubMed, Embase, OVID, and Google Scholar, without language or date restrictions. We cross-referenced the major search terms "chronic pain", "pain", "vaccine", "antibiotic", "antiviral", "mechanism", "infection", and "complication" with various iterations and subcategories of these keywords to correspond with various pathogens, drug treatments, mechanisms (e.g. "bystander activation"), and chronic pain conditions. We prioritized peer-reviewed systematic reviews and large clinical trials but included narrative reviews, case series, and retrospective studies as indicated. In addition to primary sources, we searched reference lists of retrieved articles.

### Surgical versus non-surgical endodontic re-treatment for periradicular lesions [^114iUKRA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). High credibility.

Though the success rates of initial endodontic treatment have been improving over the years, periapical disease is still not uncommon. The most common therapeutic options for re-treating teeth with periapical pathosis are non-surgical orthograde treatment and surgical treatment. The choice between these treatments should be based on an assessment of their respective benefits, primarily healing, and risks, as shown in studies with a high level of evidence.

- **Objectives**: To test the null hypothesis of no difference in outcome between surgical and non-surgical therapy for endodontic re-treatment of periradicular lesions.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched with appropriate strategies. Handsearching included eight dental journals. Bibliographies of relevant clinical trials and articles were checked to identify studies outside the handsearched journals. Seven manufacturers of instruments in endodontics or endodontic surgery, as well as authors of identified RCTs, were contacted to identify unpublished or ongoing RCTs. No language restriction was applied. The last electronic search was conducted on April 3, 2007.

- **Selection criteria**: All RCTs concerning the re-treatment of teeth with periapical pathosis using both surgical and non-surgical approaches, with a follow-up of at least one year, were considered for analysis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: A quality assessment was conducted.

### Endodontic procedures for retreatment of periapical lesions [^113Dih6h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

When primary root canal therapy fails, periapical lesions can be retreated with or without surgery. Root canal retreatment is a non-surgical procedure that involves the removal of root canal filling materials from the tooth, followed by cleaning, shaping, and obturating of the canals. Root-end resection is a surgical procedure that involves the exposure of the periapical lesion through an osteotomy, surgical removal of the lesion, removal of part of the root-end tip, disinfection, and commonly, retrograde sealing or filling of the apical portion of the remaining root canal. This review updates one published in 2008.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of surgical and non-surgical therapy for the retreatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. Another objective is to assess the effects of surgical root-end resection under various conditions, for example, when different materials, devices, or techniques are used.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Trials Register (up to 10 February 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 1), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 10 February 2016), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 10 February 2016). We searched the US National Registry of Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials (up to 10 February 2016). We placed no restrictions regarding language and publication date. We handsearched the reference lists of the studies retrieved and key journals in the field of endodontics.

### Aging exaggerates pulpal pain sensation by increasing the expression levels of nociceptive neuropeptides and inflammatory cytokines [^114iM7Zy]. Cytokine (2023). High credibility.

Dental pain is a main clinical problem in the elderly population, posing special challenges for healthcare services with its assessment and treatment. However, the age-induced alteration in dental pain perception and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully clarified.

- **Methods**: Here, the effect of aging on nociceptive behaviors following inflammatory dental pulp pain was evaluated. Since prostaglandins, nociceptive neuropeptides, and inflammatory cytokines play critical roles in the development of aging and pain signaling, the expression levels of COX-2, CGRP, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and its converting enzyme TACE were assessed in the trigeminal ganglion of young and aged rats with dental pain. Dental pulp pain was induced by intradental application of capsaicin (100 μg). Immunofluorescence (COX-2 and CGRP) and western blot techniques were used.

- **Results**: The data showed that aged animals have a different pattern of pain. The mean nociceptive scores were significantly greater in aged rats at 10 and 15 minutes after capsaicin injection. In aged rats, dental pain persisted for over 7 hours, whereas it disappeared at 300 minutes in young rats. Molecular data showed that dental pain significantly increased the expression of COX-2, CGRP, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and TACE in the trigeminal ganglion of both young and aged rats. Additionally, the levels of these parameters, except TACE, in capsaicin-treated aged animals were significantly (p < 0.05) greater than in capsaicin-treated young rats.

- **Conclusion**: It seems that the induction of pro-inflammatory pathways is more pronounced in aged rats experiencing dental pain, indicating an exaggerated pain response due to aging.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^117R6kXZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). High credibility.

Dental pain can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with these conditions should be the removal of the source of inflammation or infection through local, operative measures. Systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection, such as cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling, or systemic involvement, including fever and malaise. Despite this, there is evidence that dentists frequently prescribe antibiotics in the absence of these signs. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies within both the individual and the community. This review is an update of the original version that was published in 2014.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (up to 26 February 2018), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 26 February 2018), and MEDLINE Ovid.

### Oral manifestations in the post-COVID-19 condition: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^116RdGCc]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Low credibility.

In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency caused by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Transmission of the disease has been found to occur from person to person via respiratory tract droplets or contact. Individuals may experience symptoms such as fever, cough, and fatigue. The acute condition of COVID-19 typically shows remission within 2 to 6 weeks. However, between 10% and 20% of patients report long-term manifestations of persistent symptoms, new symptoms, or diseases. This condition is defined by WHO as a post-COVID-19 condition and occurs in individuals with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually beginning 3 months after acute COVID-19.

Although immunization has drastically impacted the reduction of cases and deaths from acute COVID-19, post-COVID-19 conditions are frequently described. There are reports of symptoms different from those that occurred in the acute phase. The most cited symptoms are fatigue, difficulty breathing, decreased memory and concentration, and loss of taste and smell. Despite the growing volume of research on post-COVID-19 conditions, studies addressing oral manifestations are still scarce, especially regarding symptoms other than loss of smell and taste. In fact, oral symptoms are not frequently described in clinical studies on COVID-19, and among the few existing studies, taste alterations are the most commonly reported oral manifestation.

Oral manifestations will continue to affect individuals with post-COVID conditions, similar to other persistent symptoms. It is essential to deepen our understanding of these oral health impacts to better support affected individuals.

### Cytokine induction by Streptococcus mutans and pulpal pathogenesis [^116d9HeL]. Infection and Immunity (2000). Low credibility.

Chronic pulpal inflammation under caries appears to be elicited by bacterial antigens that diffuse into the pulp through dentinal tubules. This prompted the hypothesis that cytokines elicited by antigens from Streptococcus mutans, which frequently dominates shallow lesions, could play a major role in eliciting the initial T-cell response in the pulp. To test this, we examined the ability of S. mutans to stimulate T cells and elicit cytokines and used Lactobacillus casei, which often predominates in deep carious lesions where B cells and plasma cells predominate, as a control. In addition, the presence of cytokines in the pulp was analyzed at the mRNA level.

S. mutans elicited potent gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures and reduced the CD4/CD8 ratio by promoting CD8(+) T cells. Multiple inflammatory cytokine mRNAs (IFN-gamma, interleukin 4 [IL-4], and IL-10) were detected in human dental pulp. A higher prevalence of IFN-gamma (67%) than IL-4 (19%) or IL-10 (29%) was obtained in shallow caries, suggesting a type 1 cytokine mechanism in early pulpitis where S. mutans predominates. In contrast, in deep caries, no differences in cytokine frequency were observed. Furthermore, the presence of IFN-gamma in the pulp correlated with the presence of S. mutans.

The extraordinary induction of type 1 cytokines and the preferential activation of CD8(+) T cells by S. mutans offers an explanation for the etiology of the CD8(+) T-cell-dominant lesion in early pulpitis and suggests that S. mutans may have a major impact on the initial lesion.

### Pulp treatment for extensive decay in primary teeth [^1133YR8a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

In children, dental caries (tooth decay) is among the most prevalent chronic diseases worldwide. Pulp interventions are indicated for extensive tooth decay. Depending on the severity of the disease, three pulp treatment techniques are available: direct pulp capping, pulpotomy, and pulpectomy. After treatment, the cavity is filled with a medicament. Materials commonly used include mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), calcium hydroxide, formocresol, or ferric sulphate. This is an update of a Cochrane Review published in 2014 when insufficient evidence was found to clearly identify one superior pulpotomy medicament and technique.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of different pulp treatment techniques and associated medicaments for the treatment of extensive decay in primary teeth.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 10 August 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2017, Issue 7), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 10 August 2017), Embase Ovid (1980 to 10 August 2017), and the Web of Science (1945 to 10 August 2017). OpenGrey was searched for grey literature. The US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

### Genome-wide association study of pulpal and apical diseases [^116wp3ww]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

FinnGen cohort

The FinnGen cohort is a large-scale biobank initiative that integrates genomic data with information from Finnish health registries. These national health registries record health events using ICD-based diagnosis codes and include the National Hospital Discharge Registry (inpatient and outpatient), Causes of Death Registry, National Infectious Diseases Registry, Cancer Registry, Primary Health Care Registry (outpatient), and Medication Reimbursement Registry. The Finnish care guidelines for endodontic infections provide instructions on the usage of ICD-10 diagnosis codes in clinical situations. These codes, recorded by dentists at every dental visit, are stored in the health registers. FinnGen Release 12 (September 2023) included data from 520,210 participants. We defined individuals with pulpal or periapical infections by identifying ICD-10 category K04 diagnosis codes from the hospital (n = 1018), primary care (n = 120,881), and cause of death registries (n = 3). Diagnoses from the hospital discharge registry have been available since 1995, and primary care registry data have been available since 2011.

The frequencies of ICD-10 diagnosis codes for pulpal and apical diseases are presented in Supplementary Figure 1. Codes K04.01, K04.02, K04.03, K04.04, and K04.05 are not included in the Finnish ICD-10 code library; thus, individuals with these codes were excluded from statistical analyses. We used three phenotypes for the genome-wide association study (GWAS): 1) any diagnosis in category K04, named as phenotype "Pulpal and apical diseases"; 2) Pulpitis (K04.0, K04.00, K).

### Single crowns versus conventional fillings for the restoration of root filled teeth [^115DcVBb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Endodontic treatment involves the removal of the dental pulp and its replacement with a root canal filling. Restoration of root-filled teeth can be challenging due to structural differences between vital and non-vital root-filled teeth. Direct restoration involves the placement of a restorative material, such as amalgam or composite, directly into the tooth. Indirect restorations consist of cast metal or ceramic (porcelain) crowns. The choice of restoration depends on the amount of remaining tooth structure, which may influence long-term survival and cost. The comparative in-service clinical performance of crowns versus conventional fillings used to restore root-filled teeth is unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of restoration of endodontically treated teeth (with or without post and core) by crowns versus conventional filling materials.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE via OVID, CINAHL via EBSCO, LILACS via BIREME, and the reference lists of articles, as well as ongoing trials registries. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. The date of the last search was 13 February 2012.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials in participants with permanent teeth that have undergone endodontic treatment. Single full coverage crowns were compared with any type of filling materials for direct restoration, as well as indirect partial restorations (e.g. inlays and onlays). Comparisons considered the type of post and core used.

### Irrigants for non-surgical root canal treatment in mature permanent teeth [^117WqGt1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Root canal treatment is carried out on teeth in which irreversible pulpitis has led to necrosis of the dental pulp. This treatment option serves as an alternative to dental extraction. Mechanical preparation and irrigation with antiseptic or antibacterial solutions are key to destroying bacteria and cleaning the infected root canal. Irrigants should effectively deactivate bacteria in the entire root canal space without causing adverse tissue reactions. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and chlorhexidine are commonly used; however, there is uncertainty regarding the most effective solution, concentration, or combination.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of irrigants used in the non-surgical root canal treatment of mature permanent teeth.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (up to 5 July 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 4), MEDLINE via Ovid (1950 to 5 July 2012), EMBASE via Ovid (1980 to 5 July 2012), and LILACS via BIREME (1980 to 5 July 2012). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.

- **Selection criteria**: The study included randomised controlled trials in single or multi-rooted permanent teeth with pulpal or periapical pathology, or both, which require root canal treatment. The comparison was between irrigants either against each other, inactive irrigant, or placebo. Combinations of irrigants were allowed, including when used with EDTA (ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid) or similar chelating agents.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed risk of…

### Sodium hypochlorite accidents in endodontic practice: Clinical evidence and state of the art [^117NUzuj]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is widely utilized in endodontics for its effective antimicrobial properties and ability to dissolve necrotic tissues. However, its use is not devoid of risks, including potential severe tissue damage and chemical burns. This systematic review evaluates the documented risks of using NaOCl in endodontic treatments. It compares its safety and efficacy with other endodontic irrigants, such as EDTA and chlorhexidine.

This review followed the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses" guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO. Comprehensive searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases, with additional hand searches in grey literature. Studies were selected reporting adverse effects related to NaOCl used in endodontic procedures, ranging from randomized controlled trials to case reports. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were systematically performed using standardized tools.

Seventeen studies were included, detailing instances from chemical burns to severe allergic reactions and tissue necrosis associated with NaOCl use. The risk of bias was predominantly low across the studies. Sodium hypochlorite demonstrated a higher efficacy in microbial eradication and tissue dissolution than other irrigants, though it also showed a higher incidence of severe complications when mishandled.

Sodium hypochlorite remains a cornerstone in endodontic disinfection due to its potent antimicrobial and tissue dissolution properties. However, its application must be meticulously managed to prevent complications.

### The presurgical workup before third molar surgery: How much is enough [^113RV39L]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

We sought to assess the indications for patient referral for computed tomography (CT) scan before third molar extraction. The influence of the data obtained from the CT scans on the surgical outcome and morbidity was also evaluated.

- **Patients and methods**: There were 189 patients in the study, consisting of 120 females and 69 males. Sixty-five patients were referred to receive a CT scan and formed the study group. The remaining patients were included in the control group.

- **Results**: There were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to demographic data and tooth and root angulations. Indications for tooth extraction, such as pain, swelling, pericoronitis, caries, endodontic problems, pathology, and prosthetic considerations, were similar. The proximity of the tooth root to the inferior alveolar canal was the only statistically significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.001). The treatment plan outcomes for extraction, surgical extraction, and follow-up were comparable. The surgeon changed the initial decision from "surgical extraction" to "follow-up" in only one case after the CT scan.

- **Conclusions**: Within the limits of the present study, it can be concluded that the main reason for CT scan referral is the proximity of the third molar root to the inferior alveolar canal (< 1 mm). The data obtained from the CT scan had minimal effect on the final surgical outcome. The routine use of a CT scan in cases of third molar extractions cannot be recommended.

### Interventions for the management of external root resorption [^1134irG9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

External root resorption is a pathological process that occurs due to various mechanical or chemical stimuli such as infection, pressure, trauma, or orthodontic tooth movement. Although predominantly detected by radiography, root resorption may also be identified by clinical symptoms such as pain, swelling, and mobility of the tooth. Treatment alternatives are case-dependent and aim to remove the cause and regenerate the resorptive lesion.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of any interventions used in the management of external root resorption in permanent teeth.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the following databases in April 2010: The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (via OVID) (1950 to April 2010), and EMBASE (via OVID) (1980 to April 2010). We also searched two regional bibliographic databases (IndMED and Iranmedex) and hand-searched five Iranian dental journals using appropriate free text terms for this review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials comparing any type of intervention, including root canal medications and canal filling, splinting or extraction of teeth, or the surgical removal of any relevant pathology. Comparisons were made with each other, placebo, or no treatment applied to permanent teeth with any type of external root resorption confirmed by clinical and radiological examination.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^113DW4FB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Dental pain can have a considerable detrimental effect on an individual's quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain arising from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis or an acute apical abscess should be the removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures. Systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection, such as cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling, or systemic involvement like fever or malaise. Despite these recommendations, there is evidence that dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics for these conditions. There is a concern that this practice could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies both within individuals and within the community as a whole.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided, with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 1 October 2013); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 1 October 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 October 2013).

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Clinical and radiological manifestations, pathophysiology, and outstanding questions [^116wEimm]. The Lancet Neurology (2015). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the identification and diagnosis of PRES in patients presenting with specific neurological symptoms and risk factors. This tool is particularly useful in differentiating PRES from other neurological conditions with similar presentations.

- **Key components**: The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the presence of at least one acute neurological symptom, at least one risk factor, specific findings on brain imaging, and the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Acute neurological symptoms may include seizures, encephalopathy, confusion, headache, or visual disturbances.

- **Risk factors**: These encompass severe hypertension or blood pressure fluctuations, renal failure, immunosuppressant therapy, chemotherapy, eclampsia, or an autoimmune disorder.

- **Brain imaging**: The brain imaging should either be normal, show bilateral vasogenic edema, or cytotoxic edema with a pattern indicative of PRES.

The diagnostic criteria for PRES are met if all four components are present. If any of these components are absent, the diagnostic criteria for PRES are not met, suggesting the need for further investigation into alternative diagnoses. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of PRES, facilitating early recognition and appropriate management of this condition.

### A double-blind comparison of a supplemental interligamentary injection of fentanyl and mepivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine for irreversible pulpitis [^111Pv4B7]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2007). Low credibility.

The analgesic efficacy of supplemental interligamentary fentanyl injection for the management of endodontic debridement patients was investigated through a randomized, double-blind study. Forty patients who presented with acute symptomatic irreversible pulpitis of the upper first molar tooth participated in the study. Patients were scheduled for endodontic debridement, for which infiltration anesthesia with 1.8 mL of 2% mepivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 was the standard primary anesthetic technique. Patients were randomly divided into two equal groups. The first group received a supplemental interligamentary injection with 0.4 mL fentanyl 0.05 mg/ml, while the second group received a supplemental interligamentary injection with 0.4 mL mepivacaine with epinephrine 1:200,000. The intraligamental-injected drug was administered as 0.2 mL on the mesial and 0.2 mL on the distal aspect of the tooth. Results indicated that fentanyl provided relatively greater analgesia, yielding satisfactory relief during different stages of the procedure, including access cavity preparation, pulpotomy, and pulp extirpation. Fentanyl is effective when used in conjunction with local anesthetics to provide adequate analgesia during endodontic debridement, and this finding provides strong evidence that peripheral actions are involved in the analgesia produced by opioid drugs in inflammatory pain.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^112FoRf1]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

In children and adults with ongoing oral manifestations, we recommend treatment with active vitamin D and phosphate supplementation to improve dentin mineralization, reduce the number of dental abscesses, and reduce the severity of periodontitis (Grade B, moderate recommendation).

- **Dental visits for children**: In children, in addition to standard preventive care, we recommend dental visits every 6 months and suggest sealing pits and fissures with flowable resin composite on both temporary and permanent teeth, as soon and as frequently as required (Grade C, weak recommendation).

- **Clinical investigation for pulp necrosis**: We suggest a thorough clinical investigation searching for pulp necrosis, looking for signs such as color changes, fistula, swelling, abscess, cellulitis, or pain. Performing retrocoronal and/or periapical radiographs or orthopantomogram is recommended to search for enlarged pulp chambers and periapical bone loss, depending on findings from a clinical examination (Grade B, weak recommendation).

- **Optimizing treatment before orthodontics**: We suggest optimizing conventional medical treatment of X-linked hypophosphataemia before the initiation of orthodontic treatment (Grade C, moderate recommendation).

- **Periodontal therapy for adults**: In adults, we recommend twice-yearly visits to perform conventional supportive periodontal therapy, which should include periodontal risk assessment and supragingival and subgingival debridement if necessary (Grade B, moderate recommendation).

- **Dental implant surgery in adults**: We suggest that dental implant surgery should be performed after 3–6 months of medical treatment, which should be continued for 6 months following implant surgery; healing time should be extended up to 6 months (Grade C, weak recommendation).

### Dent disease: Clinical practice recommendations [^1137Jjfq]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Low credibility.

The clinical practice recommendations (Boxes 1–3) reflect the expert consensus opinion of the authors, which were commented on by a large Delphi panel and were endorsed by at least 70% of participants, as well as the respective ERA and ESPN working groups.

We acknowledge that there is little evidence to guide the treatment of Dent disease and that our recommendations in this respect are based mainly on pathophysiological considerations rather than data from clinical trials. The slow, insidious course of Dent disease is a major obstacle for the design of such trials. Prospective data collection in Dent disease registries, in combination with genetic testing, is ongoing and may help identify high-risk patients for potential trials in the future.

### Single crowns versus conventional fillings for the restoration of root-filled teeth [^116bLAuk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Endodontic treatment involves the removal of the dental pulp and its replacement with a root canal filling. The restoration of root-filled teeth can be challenging due to structural differences between vital and non-vital root-filled teeth. Direct restoration involves the placement of a restorative material, such as amalgam or composite, directly into the tooth. Indirect restorations consist of cast metal or ceramic (porcelain) crowns. The choice of restoration depends on the amount of remaining tooth and may influence durability and cost. The decision to use a post and core in addition to the crown is clinician-driven. The comparative clinical performance of crowns or conventional fillings used to restore root-filled teeth is unknown. This review updates the original, which was published in 2012.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of restoration of endodontically treated teeth (with or without post and core) by crowns versus conventional filling materials.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE via OVID, CINAHL via EBSCO, LILACS via BIREME. We also searched the reference lists of articles and ongoing trials registries. There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. The search is up-to-date as of 26 March 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials in participants with permanent teeth that have undergone endodontic treatment. Single full coverage crowns were compared with any type of filling materials for direct restoration.

### Hand and ultrasonic instrumentation for orthograde root canal treatment of permanent teeth [^114fNkTj]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). High credibility.

Endodontic treatment of root canals, or root canal treatment, is a frequently performed dental procedure conducted on teeth where irreversible pulpitis has led to necrosis (death) of the dental pulp (nerve). Removal of the necrotic tissue remnants and cleaning and shaping of the root canal are crucial phases of this treatment. Treatment options include the use of hand and rotary instruments and methods utilizing ultrasonic or sonic equipment.

- **Objectives**: The objectives of this review were to determine the relative clinical effectiveness of hand instrumentation versus ultrasonic instrumentation alone or in conjunction with hand instrumentation for orthograde root canal treatment of permanent teeth.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles to locate additional published and unpublished trials. No language restriction was applied.

### Interventions for the management of external root resorption [^111bgELZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

External root resorption is a pathological process that tends to occur following a wide range of mechanical or chemical stimuli, such as infection, pressure, trauma, or orthodontic tooth movement. Although it is predominantly detected by radiography, root resorption may sometimes be identified by clinical symptoms, such as pain, swelling, and mobility of the tooth. Treatment alternatives are case-dependent and aim to address the cause of the resorption and aid the regeneration of the resorptive lesion.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of any interventions that can be used in the management of external root resorption in permanent teeth.

- **Search methods**: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (up to 14 October 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 14 October 2015), and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 14 October 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register (http://clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials of permanent teeth with any type of external root resorption confirmed by clinical and radiological examination, comparing one type of intervention (root canal medications and canal filling, splinting or extraction of teeth, or the surgical removal of any relevant.

### Single versus multiple visits for endodontic treatment of permanent teeth [^116BydPU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Root canal treatment (RoCT), or endodontic treatment, is a common procedure in dentistry. The primary indications for RoCT are irreversible pulpitis and necrosis of the dental pulp caused by carious processes, tooth cracks or chips, or dental trauma. Successful RoCT is characterized by an absence of symptoms and clinical signs in teeth without radiographic evidence of periodontal involvement. The success of RoCT depends on various factors related to the preoperative condition of the tooth, as well as the endodontic procedures.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effectiveness of single- and multiple-visit RoCT, measured as tooth extraction due to endodontic problems and radiological success. To assess the difference in short- and long-term complications between single- and multiple-visit RoCT.

- **Search strategy**: The following databases were searched for relevant trials: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Handsearching was performed for the major oral medicine journals. References of included studies and reviews were checked. Endodontics experts were contacted through e-mail. No language limitations were imposed. The date of the last search was 6th March 2007.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of patients needing RoCT were included. Surgical endodontic treatment was excluded. The outcomes considered were the number of teeth extracted for endodontic problems; radiological success after at least 1 year, meaning the absence of any periapical radiolucency; postoperative pain; painkiller use; swelling; or sinus tract formation.

### Laser therapy for dentinal hypersensitivity [^11635xhx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Dentinal hypersensitivity is characterized by short, sharp pain from exposed dentine that occurs in response to external stimuli such as cold, heat, osmotic, tactile, or chemicals, and cannot be explained by any other form of dental defect or pathology. Laser therapy has become a commonly used intervention and might be effective for dentinal hypersensitivity.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of in-office employed lasers versus placebo laser, placebo agents, or no treatment for relieving pain of dentinal hypersensitivity.

- **Search methods**: Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 20 October 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2020, Issue 9), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 20 October 2020), Embase Ovid (1980 to 20 October 2020), CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to 20 October 2020), and LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database; from 1982 to 20 October 2020). Conference proceedings were searched via the ISI Web of Science and ZETOC, and OpenGrey was searched for grey literature. The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

### Genome-wide association study of pulpal and apical diseases [^116QLoWM]. Nature Communications (2025). Low credibility.

Infections of the dental pulp are common sequelae of microbial activity and host susceptibility, affecting over 80% of the adult population. We performed a genome-wide association study on endodontic infections utilizing Finnish health registry and genotype data from FinnGen. Cases [132,124 (27.2%)] had at least one ICD10-diagnosis code of pulpal or apical diseases, whereas 353,106 individuals without diagnoses served as controls. We investigated two clinical sub-phenotypes: pulpitis and necrosis of pulp or apical periodontitis.

Our analysis resulted in significant associations in 12 chromosomes and 15 independent loci, such as those near the HORMAD2 gene and those in the HLA region. The imputed HLA alleles, especially DRB1 * 04:01 and DQB1 * 03:01, were associated with endodontic infections. Bioinformatic analysis of the top variants indicated several potential regulatory variants involved in the MHC class II protein complex, humoral immune responses, and antigen processing. Our study widens understanding on how immune dysregulation resulting from immunogenetic variation is involved in the pathogenesis of endodontic infections.

### Materials for retrograde filling in root canal therapy [^117SxjzK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Root canal therapy is a sequence of treatments involving root canal cleaning, shaping, decontamination, and obturation. It is conventionally performed through a hole drilled into the crown of the affected tooth, namely orthograde root canal therapy. When it fails, retrograde filling, which seals the root canal from the root apex, is a good alternative. Many materials are used for retrograde filling. Since none meets all the criteria an ideal material should possess, selecting the most efficacious material is of utmost importance. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2016.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects of different materials used for retrograde filling in children and adults for whom retrograde filling is necessary to save the tooth.

- **Search methods**: An Information Specialist searched five bibliographic databases up to 21 April 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished, and ongoing studies. We also searched four databases in the Chinese language.

- **Selection criteria**: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different retrograde filling materials, with the reported success rate assessed by clinical or radiological methods, for which the follow-up period was at least 12 months.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Records were screened in duplicate by independent screeners. Two review authors extracted data independently and in duplicate. Original trial authors were contacted for any missing information. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the included studies.

### Genome-wide association study of pulpal and apical diseases [^112FAQPT]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Genetic factors, beyond hard tissue composition, may influence the oral microbial community structure, host response, or the interactions between microbes and host. Genetic variations of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)−1, −2, and −3, interleukin 1β, and heat shock protein (HSP)−1L and A6 have been associated with different endodontic phenotypes using a candidate gene approach. Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of apical periodontitis among patients with deep caries did not identify significant loci. Furthermore, a polygenic risk score from the summary statistics was not associated with endodontic infections in an independent biobank linked with ICD diagnosis codes.

To increase knowledge on host genetic variants predisposing to endodontic infections, we performed a GWAS on FinnGen participants with diagnosis codes of pulpal and apical diseases derived from Finnish national health registers.

### Pulp treatment for extensive decay in primary teeth [^114fdVfo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Dental decay in primary teeth remains a considerable health problem. When decay extends to involve the dental pulp, pulp treatment techniques are often used to manage both symptomatic and asymptomatic teeth.

- **Objectives**: Assess the relative effectiveness of various pulp treatment techniques in retaining primary molar teeth with decay involving the pulp for at least 12 months. It also compares pulp treatment techniques and extractions in avoiding long-term sequelae.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (August 2002); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2002); MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2002); EMBASE (1980 to August 2002); Science Citation Index Expanded (1981 to August 2002); Social Science Citation Index (1981 to August 2002); Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (1982 to August 2002); System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (August 2002). Key journals were handsearched. There was no restriction on the language of publication.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different pulp treatment techniques (with each other, with extraction, or with no treatment) for extensive decay in primary molar teeth. Primary outcomes were extractions following pulp treatment and long-term effects.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out independently and in duplicate. Authors were contacted for additional information where necessary.

- **Main results**: Eighty-two studies were identified but only…

### Teeth: Malignant neoplasms in the dental pulp [^1113WaVc]. The Lancet Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Common pathologies of the dental pulp differentiate between acute and chronic inflammatory states caused by caries or dental trauma. Inflammations of the dental pulp as a result of neoplastic alterations are generally considered non-existent. In fact, using the search phrase "dental pulp" combined with "sarcoma", "carcinoma", or "neoplasms" in PubMed when using the MeSH search mode yielded no reports on primary malignant neoplasms. However, a hand search yields clinical reports on pulpal tumours that were published over a century ago. In this essay, the results of a hand search in historic published work are presented. Furthermore, deductive reflections are done on general tumour pathogenesis with respect to specific anatomical prerequisites of the dental pulp. Because of the restricted space in a tooth, tumour expansion will probably lead to the formation of irritation dentine by secondary odontoblasts and, subsequently, to a haemorrhage infarct of the pulp. One hypothesis states that a purported neoplasm of the dental pulp leads to a chronic appositive pulpitis and, sooner or later, will be treated likewise by root-canal treatment or extraction. Further research, including stem-cell studies, is recommended.

### Genome-wide association study of pulpal and apical diseases [^114B1qvM]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The DMFS (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces) index was available for 84,690 individuals analyzing the phenotype of pulpal and apical diseases, consisting of 36,137 cases and 48,553 controls. For the phenotype of pulpitis, the data included 62,106 individuals, with 13,552 cases and 48,553 controls. Additionally, for the phenotype of necrosis or apical periodontitis, 78,145 individuals were studied, with 29,592 cases and 48,553 controls, all from FinnGen Release 11.

The results from the FinnGen discovery GWAS, using ICD10-codes, were replicated in a subset of FinnGen consisting of COROGENE and the Northern Finland Birth Cohorts (NFBC) 1966 and 1986 (Replication Study 1), and in the Estonian Biobank (Replication Study 2). Additionally, lead SNPs were investigated in the NFBC 1966 and 1986 cohorts (Replication Study 3), which included comprehensive detailed oral health data from clinical and radiographic examinations.

- **Northern Finland Birth Cohorts 1966 and 1986**: These studies are life-span cohort studies focusing on individuals born in 1966 and 1986 in the two northernmost provinces of Finland. Comprehensive oral health examinations were included in the NFBC 1966 study (with 1,964 participants) in 2012–2013, and in the NFBC 1986 study (with 1,807 participants) in 2019–2020.

Findings of deep caries, categorized under ICDAS codes 5–6, along with questionnaire data and diagnosed apical lesions from panoramic x-rays, were utilized to create two proxy phenotypes for pulpitis and pulpal pathology:

- **Deep caries and regular pain**: This phenotype combines the findings of deep caries with reported regular dental pain to indicate recent and ongoing pulpitis-related symptoms.

### Do gingival soft tissues benefit from the application of a papilla preservation flap technique in endodontic surgery [^111xf8Bm]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

A healthy gingival condition after endodontic surgery may depend on adequate soft tissue management. The aim of this study was to compare two incision techniques, papilla base incision (PBI) and intrasulcular flap (IS), currently used in endodontic surgery.

- **Materials and methods**: In this nonrandomized controlled clinical trial, patients requiring endodontic surgery on a single tooth were enrolled. PBI was used in one group and IS was used in the other. The primary outcomes were changes in periodontal probing depth, gingival recession, and height of interproximal mesial and distal papillae. Outcome variables were assessed preoperatively and six months after surgery. Between-group differences were evaluated through appropriate statistical analysis, with significance set at a P value equal to .05.

- **Results**: Each group was composed of 12 patients, and the two groups were comparable at baseline. Two weeks after surgery, papilla height decreased significantly in the IS group (2.05 and 1.80 mm at the mesial and distal aspects, respectively), whereas no significant decrease in papilla height was observed in the PBI group (0.10 and 0.20 mm). No statistically significant difference between groups was observed after six months. No significant difference between groups was found for gingival recession or probing depth at any follow-up time.

- **Conclusions**: Better soft tissue preservation in the early postoperative period was achieved using the PBI approach compared with the IS approach. The PBI can be recommended for endodontic surgical procedures involving esthetic areas.

### Diagnosis demystified: CT as diagnostic tool in endodontics [^114dGmtx]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis in endodontics is usually based on clinical and radiographical presentations, which are only empirical methods. The role of the healing profession is to apply knowledge and skills towards maintaining and restoring the patient's health. Recent advances in imaging technologies have improved the accuracy of interpretation and diagnosis. CT is proving to be an effective tool in solving endodontic mysteries through its three-dimensional visualization.

CT imaging offers many diagnostic advantages, producing reconstructed images in selected projections and low-contrast resolution far superior to that of all other X-ray imaging modalities. This case report is an endeavor towards effective treatment planning of cases with root fracture and root resorption, using spiral CT as an adjuvant diagnostic tool.

### Single versus multiple visits for endodontic treatment of permanent teeth [^116QcGNx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Root canal treatment (RoCT), or endodontic treatment, is a common procedure in dentistry. The main indications for RoCT are irreversible pulpitis and necrosis of the dental pulp caused by carious processes, tooth cracks or chips, or dental trauma. Successful RoCT is characterized by an absence of symptoms (i.e. pain) and clinical signs (i.e. swelling and sinus tract) in teeth without radiographic evidence of periodontal involvement (i.e. normal periodontal ligament). The success of RoCT depends on a number of variables related to the preoperative condition of the tooth, as well as the endodontic procedures. This review updates the previous version published in 2007.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether completion of root canal treatment (RoCT) in a single visit or over two or more visits, with or without medication, makes any difference in terms of effectiveness or complications.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 14 June 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 5), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 14 June 2016), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 14 June 2016). We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials to 14 June 2016. We did not place any restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of people needing RoCT.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^113SoPBM]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Children and adult patients with XLH might present with spontaneous endodontic infections in apparently intact teeth. Dental abscesses can develop on both deciduous and permanent teeth. The endodontic infection might be asymptomatic for months or years, or it might evolve into dental abscesses, causing pain and swelling. The spread to surrounding anatomical structures can cause maxillofacial cellulitis.

Dental complications in patients with XLH are secondary to poorly mineralized dentin. On dental radiographs, the pulp chambers of deciduous or permanent teeth are larger than usual with long pulp horns extending to the dentino-enamel junction. XLH is not associated with increased susceptibility to caries.

- **Periodontitis**: The frequency and severity of periodontitis is increased in adult patients with XLH and can lead to tooth loss. Cementum thickness, a central component of the periodontium, is reduced and associated with mineralization defects of the alveolar bone, which impairs the attachment of the ligament fibers. On radiographs from adult patients, the lamina dura might be absent and the alveolar bone around teeth is frequently reduced.

### Inflammation down regulates stromal cell-derived factor 1α in the early phase of pulpitis [^111kn9FL]. Cytokine (2022). Low credibility.

The key to preventing pulp necrosis in the early stage of pulpitis is to promote tissue repair, which begins with cell migration. Stromal cell-derived factor 1α (SDF-1α) has been proven to promote cell migration. Related research has so far concentrated on the biological effects of SDF-1α, while its expression in pulpitis is still unclear. We investigated the effect of inflammation on SDF-1α in dental pulp and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.

First, rat pulpitis models were established by exposing pulp. SDF-1α was decreased on the 3rd day but increased on the 7th day. Next, lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg.LPS) was applied to dental pulp cells (DPCs). Within 24 hours, SDF-1α decreased, but after 48 hours, it steadily increased. Similarly, SDF-1α expression in human chronic pulpitis tissues was also increased.

To investigate the effect of altered SDF-1α on DPC migration, cell supernatants collected following Pg.LPS treatment were utilized to stimulate DPCs, and the number of migrated cells was correlated with changes in SDF-1α secretion.

Finally, we explored the regulatory mechanisms of SDF-1α down-regulation in the early phase of pulpitis. Within 24 hours, the JNK/c-Jun pathway was activated in DPC inflammation. When the JNK pathway was suppressed, SDF-1α rose. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) and apoptosis signal-regulated kinase-interacting protein 1 (AIP1) were up-regulated. Knockdown of them abolished Pg.LPS-induced activation of JNK and c-Jun(Ser63) and significantly enhanced SDF-1α.

Our findings indicated that in the early phase of pulpitis, inflammation down-regulates SDF-1α, but this regulation is complex and involves multiple signaling pathways.

### Modern trends in dental medicine: An update for internists [^1137jx9e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Traumatic injuries, genetic diseases, and external harmful agents such as bacteria and acids often compromise tooth integrity. There is an unmet medical need to develop alternative, innovative dental treatments that complement traditional restorative and surgery techniques. Stem cells have transformed the medical field in recent years. The combination of stem cells with bioactive scaffolds and nanostructured materials is increasingly beneficial in regenerative dental medicine. Stem cell-based regenerative approaches for the formation of dental tissues will significantly improve treatments and have a major impact on dental practice. At the time of writing, there is no established and reliable stem cell-based treatment translated into dental clinics; however, advances and improved technological knowledge are promising for successful dental therapies in the near future. Here, we review some of the contemporary challenges in dental medicine and describe the benefits and future possibilities of certain novel approaches in the emerging field of regenerative dentistry.

### The Er:YAG laser in endodontics: Results of an in vitro study [^114BpYU7]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Until recently, the main field of Er:YAG laser application was the removal of dental hard substances within the scope of cavity preparation. Nowadays, several new delivery systems are available, permitting the application of the Er:YAG laser in endodontics. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation on root canals in vitro.

- **Study design/materials and methods**: For this purpose, 220 extracted human teeth were endodontically processed and subsequently irradiated at different settings using an Er:YAG laser, imitating in vivo irradiation procedures. The teeth were then subdivided into three groups and subjected to bacteriological evaluations, scanning electron microscopy, and temperature measurements.

- **Results**: The bacteriological evaluation revealed a decisive bactericidal effect of the Er:YAG laser in the root canal. The bactericidal effect was dependent on the applied output power and specific for the different species of bacteria investigated. Scanning electron microscopy showed discrete removal of dentine from the root canal walls. The temperature rise during irradiation was moderate when standardized power settings were used.

- **Conclusion**: The investigations indicate that the Er:YAG laser is a suitable tool for the elimination of bacteria in root canals under in vitro conditions.

### Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy combined with conventional endodontic treatment to eliminate root canal biofilm infection [^114WZJUW]. Lasers in Surgery and Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

To compare the effectiveness of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (PDT), standard endodontic treatment, and the combined treatment to eliminate bacterial biofilms present in infected root canals, a study was conducted.

- **Study design/materials and methods**: Ten single-rooted, freshly extracted human teeth were inoculated with stable bioluminescent Gram-negative bacteria, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to form 3-day biofilms in prepared root canals. Bioluminescence imaging was employed to serially quantify bacterial burdens. PDT used a conjugate between polyethylenimine and chlorin(e6) as the photosensitizer (PS) and 660-nm diode laser light delivered into the root canal via a 200-micron fiber. This was compared and combined with standard endodontic treatment using mechanical debridement and antiseptic irrigation.

- **Results**: Endodontic therapy alone reduced bacterial bioluminescence by 90%, while PDT alone reduced bioluminescence by 95%. The combination reduced bioluminescence by > 98%, and importantly, the bacterial regrowth observed 24 hours after treatment was much less for the combination (P < 0.0005) than for either single treatment.

Bioluminescence imaging is an efficient way to monitor endodontic therapy, and antimicrobial PDT may have a role to play in optimized endodontic therapy.
