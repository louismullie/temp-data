## Question

Are there any specific antibiotic regimens recommended for pediatric patients with ruptured appendix and suspected sepsis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about specific antibiotic regimens for pediatric patients with ruptured appendix and suspected sepsis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and how it changes empiric coverage. Then, I should verify the sepsis-specific timing and spectrum requirements. Next, I will review pediatric intra-abdominal infection guidance for source control and duration. After that, I should examine comparative evidence for specific regimens, including monotherapy versus combination therapy. Finally, I will integrate stewardship, de-escalation, and a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with dosing and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: ruptured appendix in children represents a complicated intra-abdominal infection with polymicrobial flora and a risk of sepsis, so empiric therapy must cover gram-negatives, anaerobes, and consider gram-positors including streptococci and enterococci, with escalation if shock or resistant risk is present [^9df0b637] [^8e26915e].

> I need to ensure sepsis timing is addressed immediately: for suspected pediatric sepsis, broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics should be started as soon as possible, ideally within 1 hour of recognition, with early reassessment and de-escalation once cultures return and the child stabilizes; delays beyond roughly 5.5 hours are associated with increased mortality in pediatric sepsis cohorts, so I should not wait for cultures if the child is unstable [^d3ea2284] [^54524df0] [^b348e469].

> Next, I should review pediatric intra-abdominal infection guidance to anchor duration and stewardship: in children with perforated appendicitis, total antibiotic duration should generally not exceed 7 days, and shorter courses of 3–5 days are acceptable if source control is adequate and the child is clinically improving; extending IV therapy beyond 7 days does not reduce abscess formation and should be avoided absent treatment failure or inadequate source control [^0b6d9faf] [^93e78dd6] [^18d704cb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about regimen choice; I should verify comparative data. Historically, many centers used dual therapy such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, but a multicenter randomized trial in children with perforated appendicitis showed that piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy reduced intra-abdominal abscess rates versus cefuroxime plus metronidazole, without increasing adverse events, supporting monotherapy in this setting when local epidemiology permits [^cb6b4462].

> Wait, let me verify the microbiology supporting narrower options: contemporary pediatric peritoneal cultures in complicated appendicitis show predominance of anaerobes, E. coli, and Streptococcus anginosus group, with very low resistance to ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside plus metronidazole, suggesting that a regimen like ampicillin plus gentamicin plus metronidazole can be effective and stewardship-friendly in many children without high-risk features; however, I should confirm local susceptibility patterns before choosing this path [^4ba4d3b4].

> I should double-check the sepsis-specific escalation logic: for children with septic shock or high risk for multidrug-resistant pathogens, broader coverage with an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam such as piperacillin-tazobactam or a carbapenem is appropriate, with consideration of adding vancomycin if MRSA risk is present; conversely, routine double gram-negative coverage or universal vancomycin is not supported and should be avoided unless risk factors dictate otherwise [^9df0b637] [^4b3f0493].

> Let me consider source control because antibiotics alone are insufficient: urgent appendectomy or drainage of abscess when present is essential; in selected stable children with a well-formed abscess, initial nonoperative management with antibiotics and image-guided drainage may be reasonable, but persistent or generalized peritonitis mandates operative source control to mitigate failure risk [^f6085c78] [^7de4211e].

> I will now examine duration and transition to oral therapy: once the child is hemodynamically stable, afebrile for 24–48 hours, tolerating enteral intake, and showing improving leukocyte counts, conversion to oral therapy to complete a total of 5–7 days is acceptable; early switch to oral agents after 48 hours has been specifically endorsed in pediatric complicated appendicitis pathways, and total durations beyond 7 days should be reserved for treatment failure or inadequate source control [^0c48b837] [^0b6d9faf].

> But wait, what if cultures change the picture? I should confirm that cultures are obtained when feasible, especially in severe disease or treatment failure, and that empiric therapy is narrowed or stopped within 48 hours based on culture results and clinical trajectory; in non-immunocompromised children with stable vitals and no red flags, routine blood cultures are not mandated, but I need to individualize based on severity and local epidemiology [^b348e469] [^30b5d7b9] [^236f7592].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified regimen while I keep verifying dosing: for most previously healthy children with ruptured appendix and suspected sepsis, piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy provides appropriate breadth and has RCT-level pediatric data supporting lower abscess rates; if piperacillin-tazobactam is unavailable or local resistance patterns favor it, ceftriaxone plus metronidazole remains a reasonable alternative, and in settings with high ESBL prevalence or severe sepsis, a carbapenem such as meropenem may be indicated; for children with beta-lactam allergy, aztreonam plus metronidazole plus vancomycin is a conditional option reserved for higher-risk scenarios [^cb6b4462] [^9df0b637] [^71a5fd83].

> I should confirm dosing and product-specific constraints: for piperacillin-tazobactam in children 2 months and older, FDA labeling supports use in complicated appendicitis and peritonitis with pediatric dosing by weight, noting that some fixed-dose DUPLEX presentations are not suitable for fractional dosing; if using ampicillin plus gentamicin plus metronidazole, I need to ensure age-appropriate dosing and therapeutic drug monitoring for aminoglycosides, and adjust for renal function as needed [^80f2c739] [^19855f7a].

> Hold on, I should verify the monitoring and stopping rules: daily assessment for fever curve, leukocyte trend, tolerance of feeds, and pain control should guide IV-to-oral transition and total duration; in children who fail to improve by 48–72 hours, I need to reassess for missed source control, resistant organisms, or alternative diagnoses and consider imaging or intervention rather than simply extending antibiotics [^0b6d9faf] [^b348e469].

> In summary, I need to ensure the plan remains concise and evidence-aligned: start broad-spectrum therapy promptly in suspected sepsis, prefer piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy when available based on pediatric RCT data, tailor to local epidemiology and severity, secure source control surgically or via drainage when indicated, limit total antibiotic duration to 5–7 days with early oral step-down when clinically ready, and de-escalate or stop at 48 hours if cultures and clinical course allow; this approach balances efficacy, safety, and stewardship in pediatric ruptured appendicitis with suspected sepsis [^cb6b4462] [^0b6d9faf] [^9df0b637] [^0c48b837].

---

For pediatric ruptured appendix with suspected sepsis, **start broad-spectrum IV antibiotics within 1 hour** [^d3ea2284] of recognition, targeting gram-negatives, anaerobes, and streptococci [^9df0b637]. Recommended regimens include **piperacillin-tazobactam** [^cb6b4462] or **ceftriaxone plus metronidazole** [^4ba4d3b4]; add vancomycin if MRSA risk is present [^9df0b637]. Continue IV therapy for 3–5 days [^93e78dd6], then step down to oral therapy to complete 7–10 total days if the child is clinically improved. Adjust therapy to culture results and clinical response, and avoid routine extension beyond 7 days unless there is treatment failure or inadequate source control [^0b6d9faf].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

Empiric antibiotic therapy should cover **gram-negative rods, anaerobes, and streptococci** [^9df0b637]. The following regimens are recommended:

| **Antibiotic regimen** | **Coverage** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Piperacillin-tazobactam | - Gram-negative rods <br/> - Anaerobes <br/> - Streptococci | - Preferred single-agent therapy [^cb6b4462] <br/> - Supported by RCT data showing reduced intra-abdominal abscess rates [^cb6b4462] |
| Ceftriaxone + metronidazole | - Gram-negative rods <br/> - Anaerobes | - Alternative regimen [^4ba4d3b4] <br/> - Effective and widely used |
| Add vancomycin if MRSA risk | MRSA | - Add if risk factors present [^9df0b637] <br/> - e.g. prior colonization, severe sepsis, or local high prevalence |

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by clinical response and source control. General principles include:

- **IV therapy**: 3–5 days [^93e78dd6] if the child is clinically improving (afebrile, improving WBC, tolerating oral intake).
- **Total duration**: 7–10 days, including oral step-down therapy [^0d698044].
- **Shorter courses**: 3–5 days may suffice if source control is adequate and the child is clinically well [^notfound].

---

## Clinical response and adjustment of therapy

Antibiotic therapy should be **adjusted based on clinical response and culture results**:

- **Clinical improvement**: If the child improves clinically, continue the current regimen and transition to oral therapy when feasible [^0c48b837].
- **Clinical deterioration**: If the child deteriorates or fails to improve, reassess for inadequate source control, resistant organisms, or alternative diagnoses, and adjust therapy accordingly [^b6dad09e].
- **Culture results**: Tailor antibiotic therapy to culture and sensitivity results when available [^c5afd416].

---

## Special considerations

- **Source control**: Surgical intervention (appendectomy or drainage) is essential for adequate source control and should not be delayed unnecessarily [^f6085c78].
- **Monitoring**: Close monitoring of clinical status, laboratory parameters (WBC, CRP), and imaging if indicated is essential to guide therapy [^28716b3e].
- **Antibiotic stewardship**: Avoid unnecessary prolongation of antibiotic therapy beyond 7 days unless there is treatment failure or inadequate source control [^0b6d9faf].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Empiric therapy**: Piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole; add vancomycin if MRSA risk is present [^cb6b4462] [^9df0b637].
- **Duration**: IV therapy for 3–5 days, then oral therapy to complete 7–10 total days if clinically improved [^93e78dd6].
- **Adjustment**: Modify therapy based on clinical response and culture results [^c5afd416].
- **Source control**: Ensure timely surgical intervention or drainage when indicated [^f6085c78].

---

Empiric therapy with **piperacillin-tazobactam** or **ceftriaxone plus metronidazole** (add vancomycin if MRSA risk is present) [^9df0b637], given within 1 hour of recognition [^d3ea2284], is recommended for pediatric ruptured appendix with suspected sepsis. Continue IV therapy for 3–5 days, then transition to oral therapy to complete 7–10 total days if clinically improved. Adjust therapy based on clinical response and culture results, and avoid routine extension beyond 7 days unless there is treatment failure or inadequate source control [^0b6d9faf].

Discussion

There is no single evidence-based antibiotic treatment strategy for uncomplicated or perforated appendicitis, particularly because there is no indisputable evidence for any optimal antimicrobial therapy after surgery for appendicitis in children. Despite a marked decline in associated mortality during the past 50 years, perforation and complication rates remain unchanged, because they are influenced strongly by factors untouched by the intervening therapeutic advances. Scanty data exist about optimal duration of postoperative antibiotic treatment, whereas it is important to treat patients with adequate antimicrobial therapy and to avoid overtreatment.

Some authors advocate a predefined duration of antimicrobial treatment, whereas others discontinue antibiotics depending on the patient's clinical signs regardless of length of therapy. Unfortunately, studies that have investigated antibiotic regimens and included duration of postoperative antibiotic treatment as a point of interest often included children with perforated as well as gangrenous appendicitis, thereby assembling a different population, with a lower rate of postoperative intra-abdominal abscesses. The recently published guidelines from the Therapeutic Agents Committee of the Surgical Infection Society for antimicrobial therapy in children recommend that, with respect to perforated appendicitis, treatment duration should be based on the patient's response to treatment and intravenous therapy should be continued until the patient is afebrile, has normal white blood cell counts — in brief, has no symptoms of infection left at all. However, these recommendations are partly based on studies that included children with gangrenous appendicitis. Gangrenous appendicitis is a different entity with an intact intestinal lining that should be treated by resection, with only 24 h of postoperative antibiotics. In the current study, only children with perforated appendicitis were included to narrow the spectrum of the disease and to examine the influence of antibiotic therapy in a patient population that is most prone to develop intra-abdominal abscesses. By selecting this predisposed group, we designed to enlarge the possible effects of the different antibiotic treatment protocols.

Pediatric appendicitis — certainty and applicability indicate that the certainty of the above evidence was evaluated as low for pediatrics, with critical outcomes primarily limited by small sample size and nonsignificant confidence intervals. This recommendation likely does not apply equally to adult and pediatric patients who are immunocompromised or have widely perforated appendicitis (i.e. purulent fluid in all quadrants of the abdomen), and particularly in the immunocompromised group, the initial presentation and morbidity of postoperative abscess may differ from the general population.

### Are we hitting the target? the effectiveness of distinct antibiotic regimens in pediatric appendectomies [^ce298671]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, a range of different antibiotics are administered perioperatively during appendectomy surgery in the pediatric population. One reason for the lack of a uniform treatment regimen is the paucity of large studies on microbiologic data and susceptibility patterns.

Methods

A retrospective, monocentric study on antibiotic susceptibility, including 1258 pediatric patients undergoing appendectomy from 2012 to 2020 was performed. Predictors for prolonged length of stay (LOS) and complications were determined using regression analysis, and objective criteria for broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens were identified. Simulations of the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens against identified bacterial susceptibility results were conducted.

Results

The most important predictors for prolonged LOS and an increased incidence of infectious complications are elevated preoperative C-reactive protein levels, high intraoperative severity gradings and insufficient primary antibiotic treatment. Based on our results, a simple antibiotic treatment, consisting of cefuroxime-metronidazole (C-M) or ampicillin-sulbactam (AS), is sufficient in around 85% of all patients; both options being equally efficient. In severe appendicitis, the likelihood of resistance is 31% and 32% for C-M and AS, respectively. For piperacillin-tazobactam and C-M-tobramycin, the incidence of bacterial resistance decreases to 12%. Resistance is reduced to 8% for AS-tobramycin treatment. The patient populations benefiting most from an extended antibiotic regimen are those with a high intraoperative severity grading.

Conclusions

Evidence suggests that an insufficient antibiotic regimen is associated with a prolonged LOS and a higher rate of infectious complications, justifying the expansion of a simple antibiotic regimen in cases of severe intraabdominal findings. In all other cases, a simple antibiotic treatment with AS is recommended.

### Antibiotics and appendicitis in the pediatric population: an American Pediatric Surgical Association outcomes and clinical trials committee systematic review [^0d698044]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to review evidence-based data regarding the use of antibiotics for the treatment of appendicitis in children.

Data Source

Data were obtained from PubMed, MEDLINE, and citation review.

Study Selection

We conducted a literature search using "appendicitis" combined with "antibiotics" with children as the target patient population. Studies were selected based on relevance for the following questions: (1) What perioperative antibiotics should be used for pediatric patients with nonperforated appendicitis? (2) For patients with perforated appendicitis treated with appendectomy: a. What perioperative intravenous antibiotics should be used? b. How long should perioperative intravenous antibiotics be used? c. Should oral antibiotics be used? (3) For patients with perforated appendicitis treated with initial nonoperative management, what antibiotics should be used in the initial management?

Results

Children with nonperforated appendicitis should receive preoperative, broad-spectrum antibiotics. In children with perforated appendicitis who had undergone appendectomy, intravenous antibiotic duration should be based on clinical criteria. Furthermore, broad-spectrum, single, or double agent therapy is as equally efficacious as but is more cost-effective than triple agent therapy. If intravenous antibiotics are administered for less than 5 days, oral antibiotics should be administered for a total antibiotic course of 7 days. For children with perforated appendicitis who did not initially undergo an appendectomy, the duration of broad-spectrum, intravenous antibiotics should be based on clinical symptoms.

Conclusions

Current evidence supports the use of guidelines as described above for antibiotic therapy in children with acute and perforated appendicitis.

### Appendectomy or not? An update on the evidence for antibiotics only versus surgery for the treatment of acute appendicitis in children [^5f33e545]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Appendicitis is a common diagnosis in children being evaluated in the emergency department. After diagnosis, standard treatment has been surgical appendectomy; however, in recent years there is a growing body of evidence evaluating the possibility of nonoperative management in both children and adults. This review will present the current state of the pediatric literature that suggests patients may be successfully treated with antibiotics alone (ie, without surgery), but that a proportion of these patients will have recurrent appendicitis. Given that the literature regarding the option of antibiotic-only management compared with surgery is not yet definitive, there are many factors for providers to discuss with families and patients when considering treatment for acute appendicitis.

Uncomplicated appendicitis during appendectomy — culture practice. In adults and children with uncomplicated appendicitis undergoing an appendectomy, the panel suggests not routinely obtaining intra-abdominal cultures (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk for antibiotic-resistant organisms and intra-abdominal cultures are generally warranted, and at the time of surgery, if complicated disease is suspected or recognized, intra-abdominal cultures may be advised.

There is significant debate regarding the duration of antibiotics for treating complicated appendicitis, and due to the link between antibiotic use and resistance there has been increased emphasis on its judicious use; although there is no clear definition of short course, 3–5 days is often used as a cutoff.

### Appendicitis… [^c718da3f]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Key Points Appendicitis is always initiated by obstruction of the appendiceal lumen. Although not usually required for diagnosing appendicitis, in equivocal cases ultrasonography, and in select cases computed tomography, can be useful in establishing the diagnosis. Mild uncomplicated cases of appendicitis may be treated with antibiotics alone. Most patients with appendicitis will need surgical intervention. Without medical or surgical intervention, the appendix will eventually rupture, causing peritonitis. Morbidity and mortality of appendicitis is high in children older than 2 years.

### Response-based therapy for ruptured appendicitis reduces resource utilization [^bfa3f670]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

We examined the effectiveness of a postoperative ruptured appendicitis protocol that eliminated Pseudomonas coverage and based the duration of IV antibiotic treatment and length of hospital stay on the patient's clinical response.

Methods

In our new protocol, IV antibiotics were administered until the patient met discharge criteria: adequate oral intake, pain control with oral medications, and afebrile for 24h. We collected data on all patients with ruptured appendicitis at our institution following protocol implementation (May 1, 2012, to April 30, 2013) and compared them to a control group.

Results

306 patients were treated (154 prior protocol, 152 new protocol). The new clinical response-based protocol led to a decrease in hospital stay from 134h (SD 66.1) to 94.5h (SD 61.7) (p < 0.001) and total cost of care per patient also decreased from $13,610 (SD $6859) to $9870 (SD $5670) (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Our clinical response-based protocol for pediatric patients with ruptured appendicitis decreased LOS, cost, and IV antibiotics use without significant changes in adverse events.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^d3ea2284]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric sepsis — antimicrobial therapy category definitions specify that empiric antimicrobial therapy is initial antimicrobial therapy started for suspected infection in the absence of definitive microbiologic pathogen identification and may consist of single or multiple agents but should be broad spectrum in nature and should be based on local, regional, or national pathogen epidemiology and patient risk factors. Targeted/definitive antimicrobial therapy is antimicrobial therapy targeted to specific pathogen(s), usually after microbiologic identification, and may consist of single or multiple agents, but should not be broader than required to treat the specific pathogen(s) after microbiologic identification. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is an antimicrobial regimen with activity against multiple different groups of bacteria or other pathogens considered to be likely causes of the clinical presentation and may consist of single or multiple agents. Multiple-drug antimicrobial therapy is when more than one antimicrobial agent is needed to expand coverage, decrease the likelihood of resistance to any particular single agent, or provide synergy to treat a suspected or known pathogen.

Evidence-based guidelines for managing patients with intra-abdominal infection were prepared by an Expert Panel of the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace those previously published in 2002 and 2003. The guidelines are intended for treating patients who either have these infections or may be at risk for them. New information, based on publications from the period 2003–2008, is incorporated into this guideline document. The panel has also added recommendations for managing intra-abdominal infection in children, particularly where such management differs from that of adults; for appendicitis in patients of all ages; and for necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates.

### Prolonged antibiotic treatment does not prevent intra-abdominal abscesses in perforated appendicitis [^f450d918]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Appendicitis is the most common acute condition that requires surgery in children. Yet there is no consensus regarding the optimal antimicrobial treatment for children with uncomplicated or complicated appendicitis. Appendicitis has a broad spectrum of severity and therapy should be categorized accordingly. Of all children with appendicitis, those with perforated appendicitis are especially prone to develop intra-abdominal abscesses. Children with perforated appendicitis are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics. However, there is no common opinion about the time period during which antibiotic treatment should be given. Nor is it clear whether prolonged antibiotic treatment reduces the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess formation. Recently, the Therapeutic Agents Committee of the Surgical Infection Society published guidelines on antimicrobial therapy for children with appendicitis in general, including recommendations for treatment of children operated on for perforated appendicitis, based on the available literature. However, little or no evidence exists to decide whether prolonged use of postoperative antibiotic treatment prevents intra-abdominal abscess formation in this particular patient group. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate whether prolonged use of antibiotics after surgery reduces intra-abdominal abscess formation in children with perforated appendicitis.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^226a966a]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The need to speed up diagnostic testing results is a central theme in recent policy initiatives to combat sepsis. Clinical microbiology is currently undergoing radical changes in diagnosing bloodstream infections (BSIs). Compared to conventional methods, fast clinical microbiology techniques can analyse microbiological samples accurately, identify pathogens along with the possible presence of major resistance genes, leading to the rapid confirmation of clinical suspicions of sepsis and warranting an early switch to a targeted antibiotic therapy. By applying these new methods to the diagnostic workflow of septic patients, the administration of appropriate antibiotics can promptly start, resulting in better clinical outcomes and decreased mortality.

A promising automated assay has recently been developed for IAIs, which can simultaneously identify a large panel of pathogen species (including both bacteria and fungi), toxins genes, and antibiotic resistance markers directly from intra-abdominal-specific solid and liquid samples. A total of 300 clinical samples were tested with this technique by Ciesielczuk et al. showing an overall sensitivity of 89.3% and specificity of 99.5%. When compared to standard methods, turnaround time in pathogen identification and full antibiotic susceptibility testing was reduced respectively by an average of about 17 and 41 h.

Although this promising premise requires more evidence, this panel suggests that fast microbiological methods should play a supportive role in acquiring a microbiological diagnosis and not substitute the actual gold standard method (standard culture).

What is the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with IAIs?

4. IAIs should represent a not-to-miss opportunity for antimicrobial stewardship interventions. When adequate source control has been achieved, the antibiotic treatment duration can be substantially shortened (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

5. In patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, laparoscopic appendectomy should be the standard treatment. If source control is adequate, it is unnecessary to administer post-operative antibiotic therapy to patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

6. Antibiotic therapy alone can be performed in selected patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis without appendicolith, advising for the possibility of high recurrence rates and misdiagnosing of complicated appendicitis (High quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

One potential concern may relate to the risk of Clostridioides Difficile Infection (CDI), a serious antibiotic-related complication that has been reported among children undergoing treatment for appendicitis. A retrospective cohort study of the Pediatric Health Information System has recently reported that only 0.2% of the nearly 106,000 patients developed CDI, suggesting that this event is rare. Furthermore, the antibiotic treatment duration is a key issue. Indeed, evidence is now available showing that prolonged antibiotic treatment can lead to the emergence of resistant bacteria. Accordingly, local antibiotic protocols have been established in some centers for the optimization of treatments for pediatric acute appendicitis. For instance, Surlemont et al. have proposed that to limit antibiotic overuse, treatment should not exceed 48 h for uncomplicated appendicitis, eventually prolonged to 5 days for perforated appendicitis/peritonitis.

Another important matter of concern is represented by the selection of the antibiotic to be given intravenously. All the 3 studies used carbapenems with broad spectrum, namely meropenem and the combination piperacillin/tazobactam, whereas most of the antimicrobial stewardship programs now suggest the use of narrow-spectrum antibiotic combinations (i.e. ceftriaxone/metronidazole, amoxicillin/clavulanate) for the treatment of appendicitis to limit the increasing prevalence of multidrug resistance. It must be, indeed, considered that in most European countries (such as Italy, Greece, Portugal, and Spain) the presence of carbapenems-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has become a serious life-threatening condition, and carbapenem-sparing regimens have been advocated. Thus, meropenem should not be considered as the first treatment option in countries with a high rate of resistance to carbapenems. Worthy of mention, some recent studies have confirmed the optimal clinical efficacy and safety of amoxicillin associated with clavulanic acid for the treatment of acute appendicitis in children. Accordingly, short-term therapy with this combined regimen should be considered as first-line treatment for uncomplicated peritonitis in children.

Recurrence and Long-term Follow-up

In most studies, appendectomy was recommended for antibiotic-treated patients who initially had symptom resolution and experienced recurrence. Twelve trials (35%) allowed patients with recurrent appendicitis to be retreated with antibiotics, including among pregnant women. In the largest experience in adults, 14 of 22 participants with recurrence were retreated with antibiotics, and in the largest pediatric experience, 30 of 75 children, in all cases successfully. No study described a long-term follow-up strategy, such as with regard to possible missed appendiceal cancer.

Pediatric sepsis — definitions of antimicrobial therapy types are as follows: Empiric antimicrobial therapy is "initial antimicrobial therapy started for suspected infection in the absence of definitive microbiologic pathogen identification", and "may consist of single or multiple agents but should be broad spectrum in nature" and "should be based on local, regional, or national pathogen epidemiology and patient risk factors". Targeted/definitive antimicrobial therapy is "antimicrobial therapy targeted to specific pathogen(s), usually after microbiologic identification", and "may consist of single or multiple agents, but should not be broader than required to treat the specific pathogen(s) after microbiologic identification". Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is "an antimicrobial regimen with activity against multiple different groups of bacteria or other pathogens considered to be likely causes of the clinical presentation", and "may consist of single or multiple agents". Multiple-drug antimicrobial therapy is indicated when "more than one antimicrobial agent is needed to either 1) expand the spectrum of coverage…; 2) decrease the likelihood of resistance…; or 3) provide synergy to treat a suspected or known pathogen".

### Perforated appendicitis in children: is there a best treatment? [^15e73e77]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was performed to provide outcome data for the development of evidenced-based management techniques for children with appendicitis in the authors' hospital.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of 1,196 consecutive children with appendicitis over a 5-year period (1996 to 2001) at a metropolitan hospital.

Results

The median age was 9 years (7 months to 18 years). The perforation rate was 38.9%, and the nonappendicitis rate was 5.6%. Predictors of perforation included age less than 8 years, Hispanic ethnicity, generalized abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness, and increased number of bands. In perforated cases, the median length of stay was 5 days, and the complication rate was 13.5%. There was no difference in complication rates related to type or timing of antibiotics or related to the individual surgeon. There was no difference in infection rates related to type of wound management.

Conclusions

Children with perforated appendicitis are treated effectively by a less expensive broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen, expeditious operation by open or laparoscopic technique, primary wound closure, and postoperative intravenous antibiotics until they are afebrile for 24 hours and have a white blood cell count of less than 12,000/mm3. This approach is to be used in our prospective, randomized analysis of children treated on or off a clinical pathway.

Acute appendicitis — adults: CT is advised as the initial imaging step, with the guideline specifying "CT as the initial imaging modality to diagnose acute appendicitis (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)". When CT is chosen, "Intravenous (IV) contrast is usually appropriate whenever a CT is obtained in adults with suspected acute appendicitis; however, CT without IV contrast also has high diagnostic accuracy in detecting acute appendicitis and may be appropriate". Additional testing is generally unnecessary because "immediate additional imaging studies beyond CT are usually not necessary", and if CT is negative but suspicion persists clinicians should "consider observation and supportive care, with or without antibiotics; if clinical suspicion is high, consider surgical intervention". The document also notes that "US, when definitively positive or definitively negative, and MRI are also reasonably accurate and may precede CT, depending on the patient and clinical circumstances".

### Management of appendiceal mass and abscess in children; early appendectomy or initial non-operative treatment? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^63bae23b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In the pediatric population, complex appendicitis is common, especially in children < 7 years old. Approximately 35% of children with acute appendicitis present with the complex form. Although a uniform definition of complex appendicitis is lacking, in most studies it represents a spectrum ranging from gangrenous appendicitis to perforated appendicitis with generalized peritonitis. Generally, complex appendicitis can be divided into two main subgroups: without appendiceal mass and/or abscess (75%) and with appendiceal mass and/or abscess (25%).

In general, complex appendicitis and its treatment are associated with significant morbidity (complications occurring in up to 30% of patients), prolonged length of hospital stay, and high costs. Heterogeneity in the treatment of children with an appendiceal mass and/or abscess (e.g. initially non-operative treatment versus early appendectomy) still exists in daily practice. Some (pediatric) surgeons prefer initially non-operative treatment consisting of intravenous antibiotics (with or without percutaneous drainage), since this strategy is associated with less complications. Others favor early appendectomy because a second trip to the hospital in order to perform an interval appendectomy can be avoided and, if the interval appendectomy is not performed as same day procedure, a shorter length of hospital stay is expected. This is one of the main reasons why early appendectomy is recommended by the Dutch guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of acute complex appendicitis as well. This recommendation is merely based on expert opinion and in contrast to the limited and low-quality evidence.

### Analysis of outcomes associated with outpatient management of nonoperatively treated patients with appendicitis [^a8e02e3f]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Interventions

Protocol-specified antibiotics consisted of a minimum of a once-daily intravenous regimen (eg, ertapenem or ceftriaxone and high-dose metronidazole) or scheduled doses with coverage for 24 hours followed by oral antibiotics to complete a 10-day total course. Clinical teams selected antibiotics based on guideline recommendations for intra-abdominal infections from the Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Discharge criteria, including from the ED, were specified in the study protocol as follows: (1) the patient was stable and had stable and near-normal vital signs; (2) the patient was afebrile; (3) the patient's symptoms were controlled with oral analgesics; (4) the patient could tolerate oral fluids and medications; (5) the patient and clinician agreed that discharge was acceptable; and (6) a timely outpatient follow-up visit was confirmed. Interpretation of these criteria and the decision for outpatient management was at the discretion of the patient's treating physicians. Participants could be cared for solely in the ED or subsequently in an observation unit or hospital based on physician discretion and availability of these care sites. Appendectomy was recommended for participants who developed diffuse peritonitis and/or severe sepsis or septic shock at any time or who experienced worsening symptoms after 48 hours of antibiotic use. However, these criteria were not required for appendectomy to be performed, and the treating clinician and participant ultimately decided on an appendectomy.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^d39630e9]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics

Most antibiotic regimens were consistent with 2010 and 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Surgical Infection Society (SIS) guidelines for treatment of mild-to-moderate community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. Initial parenteral antibiotic regimens used included a second- or third-generation cephalosporin (e.g. cefmetazole, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone) plus metronidazole (or tinidazole) or single-agent regimens of amoxicillin-clavulanate (or ampicillin-sulbactam), piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem (ertapenem or meropenem). Oral (and alternative parenteral) regimens, started upon hospital discharge, included a fluoroquinolone or an advanced generation cephalosporin plus metronidazole, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Four trials (12%) used intravenous and oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (or ampicillin-sulbactam), which are recommended against by IDSA and SIS guidelines. In three pediatric trials, ciprofloxacin was used. One pilot RCT allowed outpatient management facilitated by administration of long-acting ertapenem. Daily-dosed ceftriaxone and metronidazole have also been used. Conservatively managed patients have been shown to experience more, mostly mild, antibiotic-related side effects compared with appendectomy patients.

Total intravenous and oral antibiotic duration ranged from 4 to 15 days. The most common total antibiotic duration was 10 days, which was used in 12 trials (35%).; seven trials (21%) used 7 days. The shortest duration was 4 days, used in four trials (12%).,

Pain Control

Although worsening or persistent pain were criteria for antibiotic nonresponse leading to appendectomy, pain control regimens generally were not specified in published trials, with only six (18%) reporting analgesia, and none describing extent of pain control. Three trials (9%) used a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), diclofenac, as a scheduled regimen, two (6%) used morphine, and one (3%) an unspecified narcoticas needed, and one (3%) used paracetamol and dextropropoxyphene for outpatients.

### Appendicitis in children: a ten-year update of therapeutic recommendations [^7f3c665d]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background/Purpose

In 1990, the authors reported excellent outcomes using a standard protocol to treat pediatric appendicitis. This protocol has been simplified further and a large retrospective review was conducted to assess current outcomes.

Methods

All patients treated for presumed appendicitis between April 1997 and December 1999 were reviewed. All patients received preoperative gentamicin and clindamycin. Patients with complicated appendicitis received postoperative ampicillin, gentamicin, and clindamycin or metronidazole. All wounds were closed primarily without drains. Patients with complicated appendicitis were discharged when their ileus resolved, they remained afebrile for 24 hours, and had a normal leukocyte count.

Results

A total of 648 patients were reviewed. A total of 9.4% of appendices were pathologically normal, 55.6% were simple acute, 15.7% were gangrenous, and 19.3% were perforated. Hospital stay was 2.21 ± 2.04 days for normal, 1.39 ± .89 for simple acute, 2.97 ± 1.25 for gangrenous, and 6.31 ± 3.51 days for perforated appendices. There were no wound infections in patients with normal or simple acute appendices. Two minor intraabdominal infections (0.56%) occurred in patients with simple appendicitis. Patients with complicated appendicitis (gangrenous or perforated) had wound infection and intraabdominal infection rates of 2.6% and 4.4%, respectively.

Conclusions

The authors' current protocol results in reasonable hospital stays and good outcomes. It serves as an evidence-based standard of care for the treatment of pediatric appendicitis.

### Appendicectomy versus antibiotics for acute uncomplicated appendicitis in children: an open-label, international, multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^ffd32ec3]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Support for the treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis with non-operative management rather than surgery has been increasing in the literature. We aimed to investigate whether treatment of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics in children is inferior to appendicectomy by comparing failure rates for the two treatments.

Methods

In this pragmatic, multicentre, parallel-group, unmasked, randomised, non-inferiority trial, children aged 5–16 years with suspected non-perforated appendicitis (based on clinical diagnosis with or without radiological diagnosis) were recruited from 11 children's hospitals in Canada, the USA, Finland, Sweden, and Singapore. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to the antibiotic or the appendicectomy group with an online stratified randomisation tool, with stratification by sex, institution, and duration of symptoms (≥ 48 h vs < 48 h). The primary outcome was treatment failure within 1 year of random assignment. In the antibiotic group, failure was defined as removal of the appendix, and in the appendicectomy group, failure was defined as a normal appendix based on pathology. In both groups, failure was also defined as additional procedures related to appendicitis requiring general anaesthesia. Interim analysis was done to determine whether inferiority was to be declared at the halfway point. We used a non-inferiority design with a margin of 20%. All outcomes were assessed in participants with 12-month follow-up data. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02687464).

Findings

Between Jan 20, 2016, and Dec 3, 2021, 936 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to appendicectomy (n = 459) or antibiotics (n = 477). At 12-month follow-up, primary outcome data were available for 846 (90%) patients. Treatment failure occurred in 153 (34%) of 452 patients in the antibiotic group, compared with 28 (7%) of 394 in the appendicectomy group (difference 26.7%, 90% CI 22.4–30.9). All but one patient meeting the definition for treatment failure with appendicectomy were those with negative appendicectomies. Of those who underwent appendicectomy in the antibiotic group, 13 (8%) had normal pathology. There were no deaths or serious adverse events in either group. The relative risk of having a mild-to-moderate adverse event in the antibiotic group compared with the appendicectomy group was 4.3 (95% CI 2.1–8.7; p < 0.0001).

Interpretation

Based on cumulative failure rates and a 20% non-inferiority margin, antibiotic management of non-perforated appendicitis was inferior to appendicectomy.

### Timing and spectrum of antibiotic treatment for suspected sepsis and septic shock: why so controversial? [^e64a8518]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis guidelines and mandates encourage increasingly aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobials for suspected sepsis and septic shock. This has caused considerable controversy due to weaknesses in the underlying evidence and fear that overly strict antibiotic deadlines may harm patients by perpetuating or escalating overtreatment. Indeed, a third or more of patients currently treated for sepsis and septic shock have noninfectious or nonbacterial conditions. These patients risk all the potential harms of antibiotics without their possible benefits. Updated Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines now emphasize the importance of tailoring antibiotics to each patient's likelihood of infection, risk for drug-resistant pathogens, and severity-of-illness.

Therefore, given these circumstances, an informed patient choice is crucial. In a study published by Hanson et al.in 2018, 9.4% of the surveyed adult population responded that they would opt for NOM in the case of appendicitis. This number increased to 14.5% when asked about choosing for their children. The study focused on discussing the failure rates of NOM, and indeed, the authors themselves speculate that different numbers would have been obtained if the success rates were presented to patients.

Additional rigorous qualitative research will be necessary to investigate the factors behind the strikingly different outcomes observed in these two studies and to gain a deeper understanding of patient preferences in various situations.

Long-term risks associated with NOM warrant careful consideration. Prolonged or broad-spectrum antibiotic use, often required in NOM protocols, raises concerns about the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which could have significant public health implications. Furthermore, retaining the appendix may pose a theoretical risk of missed pathology, including rare malignancies, though these events remain uncommon. Balancing these potential risks with the benefits of avoiding surgery and its associated complications highlights the need for optimized antibiotic stewardship and continued long-term studies to assess the safety and feasibility of NOM in pediatric populations.

It is important to note a limitation in our study stemming from the complexity of establishing appropriate endpoints for comparing treatments across diverse forms of uncomplicated appendicitis. Additionally, it should be noted that the inclusion of only three RCTs resulted in a total population of 269 patients, which may not be considered a substantially large number.

Furthermore, there is a restricted set of outcome parameters hindering the evaluation of factors like hospital stay and costs. Small patient cohorts reduce statistical power, particularly in analyzing appendicoliths. Variable follow-up durations (1 to 4 years) may bias long-term complication assessment. Infants below 5 years are not addressed, and results lack age-specific reporting. Additionally, the structural similarity of those over 14 years to adults questions the findings' generalizability to a broader pediatric population. These limitations underscore the need for cautious interpretation across diverse age groups in pediatrics.

Acute appendicitis — children/adolescents (subsequent imaging after equivocal US): "In children and adolescents with suspected acute appendicitis, if initial US is equivocal/non-diagnostic and clinical suspicion persists, the panel suggests obtaining an abdominal MRI or CT as subsequent imaging to diagnose acute appendicitis rather than obtaining another US (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence)". The remarks state that US can remain equivocal and MRI may require sedation, while CT involves radiation: "US is generally available but is also operator-dependent and can yield equivocal results. MRI is not always readily available, and sedation may be required for young children. CT is generally readily available but involves radiation exposure and may require use of IV contrast or sedation". For CT technique, "CT with IV contrast is usually appropriate when performed in children with suspected acute appendicitis after equivocal ultrasound; however, CT without IV contrast may be appropriate". Alternatives to further imaging are also noted: "Depending on the clinical situation, observation may be appropriate instead of subsequent imaging", and "If there is a strong clinical suspicion for appendicitis after equivocal imaging, exploratory laparoscopy or laparotomy may also be considered if subsequent imaging delays appropriate management".

### Guidelines for perioperative care for emergency laparotomy enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) society recommendations: part 1-preoperative: diagnosis, rapid assessment and optimization [^2103c948]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Once sepsis is suspected clinically, validated management algorithms should be completed with a sense of urgency. These algorithms all include the empiric administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics (after relevant cultures have been obtained when possible), and cardiovascular resuscitation using intravenous fluids titrated to clinical endpoints. Specific antibiotic choice should be guided by local protocols in line with antimicrobial stewardship. Further evaluation and escalation should also follow these algorithms (Fig. 1). The NELA 2019 report found that there was major room for improvement in speed and urgency of management with only 19% of patients with suspected sepsis receiving antibiotics within the first hour. Studies have shown an association between early risk scoring, active management and a reduction in mortality. Blood lactate has been used as a marker of risk, and in monitoring of response to resuscitation in line with the Surviving Sepsis guidelines.

Fig. 1
The hour-1 surviving sepsis campaign bundle of care. From Levy et al.

Recommendations:
All patients for emergency laparotomy should be assessed with a validated sepsis score as early in their presentation as possible. This should be repeated at appropriate intervals in line with severity of signs and sepsis risk stratification guidance.
If SIRS, sepsis or septic shock are diagnosed, or when the underlying surgical pathology makes the patient at high risk of infection or sepsis, such as patients with peritonitis or hollow viscus perforation, treatment should begin immediately in line with the Surviving Sepsis management algorithms including measurement of lactate. Delay to antibiotic administration in patients with sepsis increases mortality.
Monitoring of blood lactate as a marker of risk and in assessment of physiological response to resuscitation should be considered even in the absence of sepsis.

Level of evidence: High-large prospective cohort studies and international guidelines.
Recommendation grade: Strong.

### Meta-analysis of antibiotics versus appendicectomy for non-perforated acute appendicitis [^c57eacea]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Data extraction

Using standard pilot‐tested forms along with detailed instructions and working in teams of two, reviewers extracted data independently. A clinician–methodologist adjudicator resolved disagreements. Finally, authors were contacted to check the data for accuracy, and to provide additional information regarding the original studies, when needed.

The following data were extracted: sample size, participants' characteristics, antibiotic regimens and details of surgical management (laparoscopic or open, any antibiotic use), and the following outcomes (for both treatment groups): major complications at 1 year, including Clavien–Dindo complication classification grade III or above (conditions requiring endoscopic, radiological or surgical intervention, or causing organ dysfunction or death), such as appendiceal perforation, as well as deep infections, incisional hernias and adhesive bowel obstruction not requiring intervention; minor complications at 1 year, such as superficial wound infections, diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort; confirmed or suspected recurrence of appendicitis between 1 month and 1 year; rate of appendicectomy within 1 month of intervention; duration of hospital stay; and duration of sick leave.

Risk of bias

In the risk‐of‐bias assessment, each study was evaluated using a modified version of the Cochrane Collaboration's instrument 27 according to four criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding and completeness of data. For each criterion, studies were judged to be at either high or low risk of bias.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^9df0b637]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric sepsis — empiric therapy selection guidance states that for previously healthy children with community-acquired sepsis, a third-generation cephalosporin may be sufficient, while vancomycin should be added in settings where MRSA or ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococci are prevalent and an aminoglycoside may be added or a carbapenem substituted when ceftriaxone resistance in gram-negative bacteria is common. For immunocompromised patients or hospital-acquired sepsis, antimicrobial therapy should begin with an anti-pseudomonal third- or higher-generation cephalosporin, a broad-spectrum carbapenem, or an extended-range penicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor combination. For neonates, therapy should also include ampicillin for listeria and consideration for empiric acyclovir if there is a clinical concern for HSV. For a suspected or documented intra-abdominal source, therapy should include broad coverage for gastrointestinal pathogens including anaerobic bacteria, using either an extended-range penicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor combination or carbapenem, or by adding clindamycin or metronidazole. During local influenza season in patients with proven sepsis with sepsis complicating an influenza-like illness, empiric antiviral therapy should be started while awaiting the respiratory virus testing. Patients at higher risk of antibiotic-resistant infection because of past infection or colonization, local epidemiology, or recent broad-spectrum antibiotic use should receive an individually tailored empiric therapeutic regimen, and in suspected toxic shock syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis empiric treatment should include clindamycin or linezolid to limit toxin production and enhance bacterial clearance; in regions endemic for rickettsial or parasitic pathogens, clinicians should consider adding relevant empiric coverage. For children at risk for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimens may require more than one agent to broadly cover potential pathogens.

Use of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older with intra-abdominal infections including appendicitis and/or peritonitis is supported by evidence from well-controlled studies and pharmacokinetic studies in adults and in pediatric patients. This includes a prospective, randomized, comparative, open-label clinical trial with 542 pediatric patients 2 to 12 years of age with intra-abdominal infections (including appendicitis (complicated by rupture or abscess) and/or peritonitis), in which 273 pediatric patients received piperacillin and tazobactam [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Use of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection in pediatric patients 2 months of age and older with nosocomial pneumonia is supported by evidence from well-controlled studies in adults with nosocomial pneumonia, a simulation study performed with a population pharmacokinetic model, and a retrospective, cohort study of pediatric patients with nosocomial pneumonia in which 140 pediatric patients were treated with Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and 267 patients treated with comparators (which included ticarcillinclavulanate, carbapenems, ceftazidime, cefepime, or ciprofloxacin) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Because of the limitations of the available strengths and administration requirements (i.e., administration of fractional doses is not recommended) of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection, and to avoid unintentional overdose, this product is not recommended for use if a dose of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection, that does not equal 2.25 g, 3.375 g, or 4.5 g is required, and an alternative formulation of piperacillin and tazobactam for injection should be considered [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

The safety and effectiveness of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection have not been established in pediatric patients less than 2 months of age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12) and Dosage and Administration (2)].

Dosage of Piperacillin and Tazobactam for Injection and Sodium Chloride Injection in pediatric patients with renal impairment has not been determined.

### A prospective, multi centre, randomized clinical study to compare the efficacy and safety of ertapenem 3 days versus ampicillin-sulbactam 3 days in the treatment of localized community acquired intra-abdominal infection. (T.E. A. study: three days ertapenem vs three days ampicillin-sulbactam) [^30513980]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The recommendations outlined in the latest guidelines published by the Surgical Infection Society (SIS) and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) regarding the proper duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with intra-abdominal infections are limited and non-specific According to these guidelines, an "antimicrobial therapy for established infections should be continued until resolution of clinical signs of infection occurs, including normalization of temperature and WBC count and return of gastrointestinal function".

Such ambiguity is primarily attributable to the lack of clinical trials conducted on the topic of the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy.

These vague guidelines have manifested themselves in clinical practice; in most trials for antibiotic therapy, a fixed period ranging from 5 to 14 days is used for all patients presenting with community-acquired intra-abdominal infection, irrespective of severity of the peritonitis.

It should be noted that secondary peritonitis encompasses several different diseases and, as such, its severity has been known vary significantly.

It has been demonstrated that most patients enrolled in trials involving antibiotic treatment of IAI present with a mild form of the acute illness, which in 35–55% (and, in some studies, up to 70%) of cases is represented by acute appendicitis. It should also be noted that many patients do not suffer from a fully developed and widely spread infection but rather experience a localized infection or simple contamination.

This means that many patients receive superfluous and unnecessary antibiotic treatments. Many non-random trials demonstrated that, by tailoring the duration of the antibiotic therapy to the extent of the infection as assessed during surgery, the same clinical results could be obtained in all groups of treated patients without the use of excessive antibiotic treatment regimens. A recent systematic meta-analysis of twenty-eight studies on the duration of antibiotic therapy in cases of advanced pediatric appendicitis demonstrated that limiting the duration of antibiotic use to only 3 days was not associated with higher rates of intra-abdominal abscesses or wound infection.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian council for the optimization of antimicrobial use [^37f59719]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

While microbiological cultures have limited influence on common community-acquired IAIs (CA-IAIs) such as acute appendicitis, in the current era marked by the widespread circulation of MDR bacteria in both hospital and community settings, the burden of AMR cannot be disregarded. Microbiological testing is very important in managing hospital-acquired IAIs, where the risk of resistant pathogens is high. Antibiotic therapy reassessment based on microbiologic culture and susceptibility testing is suggested in critically ill patients. In critically ill hospitalized patients, the expert panel recommends obtaining a minimum of two sets of blood cultures before initiating antimicrobial therapy. It can improve diagnostic sensitivity, as it revealed a pathogen in more than half of the patients in which blood cultures were performed. These findings are notably higher compared to the 6% observed by Montravers et al. Microbiological testing is of great importance not only to define the therapeutic strategy for patients at risk of AMR but also to allows the clinician to better know the local epidemiology.

Is antibiotic therapy reassessment based on the results of microbiological culture and susceptibility testing needed in patients with IAIs?

3. In patients with IAIs antibiotic, therapy should be reassessed as soon as possible when the results of microbiological culture and susceptibility testing are available (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Microbiological diagnosis is crucial, because it may help clinicians to prescribe the most appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy. Simultaneously, recognising the specific pathogen causing the infection can guide personalized and targeted antimicrobial therapy.

Microbiological cultures represent the gold standard methods for a correct microbiological diagnosis. Unfortunately, they are burdened by extended turnaround times. Delaying in starting an appropriate antimicrobial treatment has been associated with poorer patient' outcomes, especially in patients with sepsis and septic shock. As emphasized in the meta-analysis by Bassetti et al. the use of an inadequate antibiotic regimen has been strongly associated with unfavourable outcomes in critically ill patients (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.38–0.50), and increased length of hospital stay, and hospital costs.

### Current practice patterns in the treatment of perforated appendicitis in children [^09b56186]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of perforated appendicitis in children often involves a combination of surgical and medical therapy. The aim of this study was to document the degree of consensus in the current management of perforated appendicitis in children.

Study Design

A survey was sent to all practicing pediatric surgeons in North America in April 2000 who were members of the American Pediatric Surgical Association for 1999–2000. Survey questions pertained to preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative practice patterns, particularly those issues related to use of antibiotic therapy.

Results

Among eligible surgeons, 80.2% completed the survey. Although more than 80% of respondents practiced in an academic setting, only 17% of surgeons used a formal clinical practice guideline to direct care. Responses varied substantially in the duration of postoperative antibiotic therapy, the use of intravenous or oral agents or both, and the duration of hospitalization. A considerable number of patients are receiving a portion of their intravenous antibiotic therapy as outpatients.

Conclusions

There is little apparent consensus in the many aspects of perioperative and postoperative care of perforated appendicitis in children across North America. Only a fraction of surgeons currently uses a formal clinical practice guideline for treatment of perforated appendicitis, although increased pressures to develop more cost-effective therapeutic strategies can encourage development of additional guidelines. Definitive evidence to inform development of such guidelines and enhance consensus is lacking. Further studies are needed across institutions to better inform clinical decisions in light of a changing practice environment and treatment alternatives.

Complicated appendicitis is defined as cases with preoperative evidence of abscess or perforation, and approximately 30% of adult and pediatric patients with appendicitis present with complicated appendicitis. Adult evidence included one RCT and one retrospective study with direct comparative data; in the RCT nonoperative arm, of the 30 RCT patients managed nonoperatively, 28 had attempted IR drainage, and ultimately 16 had aspiration of their abscess while 3 had drains placed.

### Methods of conservative antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated appendicitis: a systematic review [^9c0d7058]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Meta-analyses and a recent guideline acknowledge that conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics can be successful for patients who wish to avoid surgery. However, guidance as to specific management does not exist.

Methods

PUBMED and EMBASE search of trials describing methods of conservative treatment was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.

Results

Thirty-four studies involving 2,944 antibiotic-treated participants were identified. The greatest experience with conservative treatment is in persons 5 to 50 years of age. In most trials, imaging was used to confirm localized appendicitis without evidence of abscess, phlegmon, or tumor. Antibiotics regimens were generally consistent with intra-abdominal infection treatment guidelines and used for a total of 7 to 10 days. Approaches ranged from 3-day hospitalization on parenteral agents to same-day hospital or ED discharge of stable patients with outpatient oral antibiotics. Minimum time allowed before response was evaluated varied from 8 to 72 hours. Although pain was a common criterion for nonresponse and appendectomy, analgesic regimens were poorly described. Trials differed in use of other response indicators, that is, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and reimaging. Diet ranged from restriction for 48 hours to as tolerated. Initial response rates were generally greater than 90% and most participants improved by 24 to 48 hours, with no related severe sepsis or deaths. In most studies, appendectomy was recommended for recurrence; however, in several, patients had antibiotic retreatment with success.

Conclusion

While further investigation of conservative treatment is ongoing, patients considering this approach should be advised and managed according to study methods and related guidelines to promote informed shared decision-making and optimize their chance of similar outcomes as described in published trials. Future studies that address biases associated with enrollment and response evaluation, employ best-practice pain control and antibiotic selection, better define cancer risk, and explore longer time thresholds for response, minimized diet restriction and hospital stays, and antibiotic re-treatment will further our understanding of the potential effectiveness of conservative management.

### IMPPACT (intravenous monotherapy for postoperative perforated appendicitis in children trial): randomized clinical trial of monotherapy versus multi-drug antibiotic therapy [^cb6b4462]. Annals of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Perforated appendicitis is the most common cause of intraabdominal abscess (IAA) in children. The optimal postoperative antibiotic regimen to reduce IAA has evolved in the last decade from triple-drug to 2-drug therapy (CM). Recent retrospective studies show decreased infectious complications with monotherapy PT. To date prospective comparative data are lacking. Therefore, a prospective randomized trial comparing PT versus CM was conducted.

Methods

A multi-institutional prospective randomized trial was performed in children with perforated appendicitis comparing postoperative antibiotic regimens PT or CM. The primary outcome was 30-day postoperative IAA formation. Perforation was strictly defined as a hole in the appendix or fecalith in the abdomen, documented with intraoperative photographs.

Results

One hundred sixty-two patients were enrolled during the study period. No differences in age, weight, or duration of presenting symptoms were identified. In addition, length of stay, duration of intravenous antibiotic treatment, discharge oral antibiotic treatment, and antibiotic-related complications did not differ between groups. Compared to the CM group, the PT group had significantly lower IAA rate [6.1% vs 23.8%, odd ratio (OR) 4.80, P = 0.002], lower postoperative computed tomography imaging rate (13.9% vs 29.3%, OR 2.57, P = 0.030), and fewer emergency room visits (8.8% vs 26.4%, OR 3.73, P = 0.022). Multivariate logistic regression analysis found the use of CM versus PT (OR 9.21, P = 0.021) to be the most significant predictor for developing IAA.

Conclusions

In children with perforated appendicitis, postoperative monotherapy with PT is superior to standard 2-drug therapy with CM and does not increase antibiotic-related complications or antibiotic exposure duration.

### Prolonged antibiotic treatment does not prevent intra-abdominal abscesses in perforated appendicitis [^929ae4e6]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

The current study was set up as a retrospective study with the primary purpose to compare two antibiotic treatment regimens in two patient groups with an equally high risk of abscess formation postoperatively. However, whereas the multicenter design of the study enabled us to weigh both regimens, it also increased the amount of variability between both treatment groups. For example, the mean age in hospital B is significantly lower than in hospital A. It is reported in literature that appendicitis may manifest itself more severe in younger children. Therefore, in theory, it is possible that the negative impact of age blurs the beneficial effect of prolonged antibiotic treatment, and the same assumption can be made for the sex difference and surgical approach, even though comparison of the two surgical protocols revealed no differences in general. To exclude the influence of potentially confounding factors, such as age, sex, and surgical technique on abscess formation, each factor has been taken into account in multivariate regression risk analysis, which revealed that no other potential risk factors apart from female sex predispose to intra-abdominal abscess development postoperatively. Because both participating centers are university hospitals, surgical procedures were performed by multiple surgeons and residents under supervision. This explains the relatively high risk of open surgery, because to enable residents to learn the standard open procedure, after diagnosis of a positive appendix using a scope without inflating the abdomen, open appendectomy may have been performed when the resident was not yet trained to perform laparoscopic appendectomy. It would have been more elegant to compare treatment groups within one hospital to eliminate the risk of confounding variables.

Both patient groups were identical regarding the onset and type of antibiotics. Although children in hospital B received gentamicin as part of the standard antibiotic protocol, and only 18.8% of children in hospital A did, we believe that we compared two adequate and equivalent antibiotic regimens. As stated, our purpose was to compare the duration of adequate antibiotic treatment to determine whether a more aggressive antibiotic approach would reduce the risk of intra-abdominal abscess formation. Whereas the postoperative intra-abdominal abscess rate found in the current study is relatively high, it is still within the range reported in previous studies for the pediatric population operated on for perforated appendicitis (3–24%). Using a strict definition for perforated appendicitis elevates the abscess rate within this population, and because clear definitions for both perforated appendicitis and intra-abdominal abscess were applied in the current study, this could explain the high abscess rates that were found.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^ae44ec8f]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is an extremely common disease with a variety of medical and surgical treatment approaches. A multidisciplinary expert panel was convened to develop evidence-based recommendations to support clinicians and patients in decisions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted from 2010 to 2022 to answer 8 key questions relating to the diagnosis of appendicitis, operative or nonoperative management, and specific technical and post-operative issues for appendectomy. The results of this systematic review were then presented to a panel of adult and pediatric surgeons. Evidence-based recommendations were formulated using the GRADE methodology by subject experts.

Results

Conditional recommendations were made in favor of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis being managed operatively, either delayed (> 12h) or immediate operation (< 12h), either suction and lavage or suction alone, no routine drain placement, treatment with short-term antibiotics postoperatively for complicated appendicitis, and complicated appendicitis previously treated nonoperatively undergoing interval appendectomy. A conditional recommendation signals that the benefits of adhering to a recommendation probably outweigh the harms although it does also indicate uncertainty.

Conclusions

These recommendations should provide guidance with regard to current controversies in appendicitis. The panel also highlighted future research opportunities where the evidence base can be strengthened.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^8e26915e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Inappropriate therapy in critically ill patients may have a strong negative impact on outcome. An ineffective or inadequate antimicrobial regimen is one of the variables more strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes in critically ill patients. Broad empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients with organ dysfunction (sepsis) and septic shock.

International guidelines for the management of sepsis and septic shock (the Surviving Sepsis Campaign) recommend intravenously administered antibiotics as soon as possible and in any case within the first hour of onset of sepsis and the use of broad-spectrum agents with adequate penetration of the presumed site of infection.

Finally, selection of empirical therapy should take into account the infection source because etiological distribution varies according to the source site, with a prevalence of Gram positive and Candida in the high gastrointestinal tract and a progressive increase of anaerobes and Gram negative towards the lower gastrointestinal tracts.

The epidemiology of intra-abdominal flora in critically ill patients with secondary and tertiary abdominal sepsis was studied by de Ruiter et al. A 5-year prospective observational cohort study was performed in patients admitted to the ICU with abdominal sepsis syndrome, defined as a perforation of the digestive tract and inflammatory response with organ failure. Abdominal fluid was taken for microbial culture from 221 of the 239 patients admitted with abdominal sepsis. Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (AGNB) were found in 53% of the cultures of the abdominal fluid taken at the time of operation, of which 45% were E. coli; in 36% of patients, more than one AGNB was found. The incidence of AGNB was the highest in colorectal perforations (68.6%) and perforated appendicitis (77.8%) and the lowest in gastroduodenal perforations (20.5%). Gram-positive bacteria were found in 42.5% of the abdominal fluid cultures and most frequently in colorectal perforations (50.0%). Candida was found in 19.9% of patients, with 59.1% of these cultures being Candida albicans. The incidence of Candida was 41.0% in gastroduodenal perforations and 11.8% in colorectal perforation. Anaerobic bacteria were cultured in 77.8% of patients with perforated appendicitis. Over time, the prevalence of AGNB in abdominal fluid decreased from 117 patients (52.9%) in the first culture to one patient (6.7%) in week 4 (efficacy 87%). The prevalence of Gram-positive bacteria increased from 42.5 to 86.7% in a 4-week period.

### SAGES guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of appendicitis [^ddeb5de8]. Surgical Endoscopy (2024). High credibility.

Decision criteria and additional considerations — adult and pediatric patients with complicated appendicitis initially treated with antibiotics should weigh malignancy risk, age, preferences, and access to care. For both adult and pediatric patients with complicated appendicitis initially treated with antibiotics, one of the major considerations regarding interval appendectomy is the concern for missing a malignancy. Of note, patients with neoplasms were all over 40 years of age, and therefore the benefits of interval appendectomy may be less in pediatric patients or younger adults. The document notes strong patient, surgeon, or parental preference for an appendectomy, that patients with a family history of malignancy may benefit from stronger consideration of interval appendectomy, that patients with poor access to care may prefer a planned interval appendectomy, and that given the longer lifespan after appendicitis there could be a higher rate of recurrence in pediatric and younger adult patients.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^4b3f0493]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric sepsis empiric therapy — use of multi-drug regimens in high-risk children: In children with immune compromise and/or at high risk for multidrug-resistant pathogens, we suggest using empiric multi-drug therapy when septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction is present/suspected (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Empiric therapy may be single- or multi-drug, but should be broad spectrum in nature, and for select patients this may necessitate adding a glycopeptide (vancomycin) for MRSA or a second gram-negative agent (e.g., an aminoglycoside in addition to a beta-lactam or second/third-generation cephalosporin) when resistance is a concern; however, routinely including an aminoglycoside or a glycopeptide for synergy or "double-coverage" as part of an empiric regimen is not supported by the available data.

Pediatric sepsis empiric antimicrobial therapy — population-specific regimens include the following directives: "For previously healthy children with community-acquired sepsis, a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) may be sufficient". "Vancomycin should be added in settings where MRSA or ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococci are prevalent, and addition of an aminoglycoside or substitution of a carbapenem is appropriate in settings where ceftriaxone resistance is common in gram-negative bacteria". "For immunocompromised patients or hospital-acquired sepsis, antimicrobial therapy should begin with an anti-pseudomonal third- or higher-generation cephalosporin (e.g., cefepime), a broad-spectrum carbapenem (e.g., meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin), or an extended-range penicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor combination (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam)". "For neonates, therapy should also include ampicillin for listeria and consideration for empiric acyclovir if there is a clinical concern for HSV". "For patients with a suspected or documented intra-abdominal source of infection, therapy should include broad coverage for gastrointestinal pathogens, including anaerobic bacteria, with either an extended-range penicillin/β-lactamase inhibitor combination or carbapenem, or addition of clindamycin or metronidazole". "For patients with sepsis complicating an influenza-like illness during the local influenza season, empiric antiviral therapy should be started while awaiting the respiratory virus testing". "Patients at higher risk of antibiotic-resistant infection because of past infection or colonization, local epidemiology, or recent broad-spectrum antibiotic use should receive an individually tailored empiric therapeutic regimen". "In cases of suspected toxic shock syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis, empiric treatment should include clindamycin or linezolid to limit toxin production and enhance bacterial clearance". "Finally, for sepsis treated in regions endemic for rickettsial or parasitic pathogens (e.g., malaria), clinicians should consider adding relevant empiric coverage". Additionally, "for children at risk for multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimens may require more than one agent to broadly cover such potential pathogens".

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^5aa79ee0]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

In the past 20 years, the incidence of intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) caused by MDROs has risen dramatically. Quinolone resistance, prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria, prevalence and mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in the local environment, and the place of recent traveling should be always taken into account when antibiotic therapy is administered empirically. Generally, the most important factors in predicting the presence of resistant pathogens are acquisition in a healthcare setting (particularly if the patient becomes infected in the ICU or has been hospitalized for more than 1 week), corticosteroid use, organ transplantation, baseline pulmonary or hepatic disease, and previous antimicrobial therapy.

Previous antibiotic therapy is one of the most important risk factors for resistant pathogens. Inappropriate therapy in critically ill patients may have a strong negative impact on the outcome. An ineffective or inadequate antimicrobial regimen is one of the variables more strongly associated with unfavorable outcomes in critically ill patients. Broad empiric antibiotic therapy should be started as soon as possible in patients with organ dysfunction (sepsis) and septic shock. International guidelines for the management of sepsis and septic shock (the Surviving Sepsis Campaign) recommend intravenously administered antibiotics as soon as possible and in any case within the first hour of onset of sepsis and the use of broad-spectrum agents with adequate penetration of the presumed site of infection.

The results of microbiological testing may have great importance for the choice of therapeutic strategy of every patient, in particular, in the adaptation of targeted antibiotic treatment. They provide an opportunity to expand the antibiotic regimen if the initial choice was too narrow but also allow de-escalation of antibiotic therapy if the empirical regimen was too broad. Antibiotic de-escalation has been associated with lower mortality rates in ICU patients and is now considered a key practice for antimicrobial stewardship purposes. The duration of antibiotic therapy has been studied appropriately in the setting of intra-abdominal infections (IAIs).

In the event of uncomplicated IAIs, the infection involves a single organ and does not extend to the peritoneum. When the source of infection is treated effectively by surgical excision, postoperative antibiotic therapy is not necessary, as demonstrated in managing uncomplicated acute appendicitis or cholecystitis.

### Appendectomy versus antibiotic treatment for acute appendicitis [^64054a0d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis is one of the most common emergency general surgical conditions worldwide. Uncomplicated/simple appendicitis can be treated with appendectomy or antibiotics. Some studies have suggested possible benefits with antibiotics with reduced complications, length of hospital stay, and the number of days off work. However, surgery may improve success of treatment as antibiotic treatment is associated with recurrence and future need for surgery.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated/simple acute appendicitis compared with appendectomy for resolution of symptoms and complications.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers (World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov) on 19 July 2022. We also searched for unpublished studies in conference proceedings together with reference checking and citation search. There were no restrictions on date, publication status, or language of publication.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only. We included studies where most participants were adults with uncomplicated/simple appendicitis. Interventions included antibiotics (by any route) compared with appendectomy (open or laparoscopic).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodology expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Primary outcomes included mortality and success of treatment, and secondary outcomes included number of participants requiring appendectomy in the antibiotic group, complications, pain, length of hospital stay, sick leave, malignancy in the antibiotic group, negative appendectomy rate, and quality of life. Success of treatment definitions were heterogeneous although mainly based on resolution of symptoms rather than incorporation of long-term recurrence or need for surgery in the antibiotic group.

Main Results

We included 13 studies in the review covering 1675 participants randomised to antibiotics and 1683 participants randomised to appendectomy. One study was unpublished. All were conducted in secondary care and two studies received pharmaceutical funding. All studies used broad-spectrum antibiotic regimens expected to cover gastrointestinal bacteria. Most studies used predominantly laparoscopic surgery, but some included mainly open procedures. Six studies included adults and children. Almost all studies aimed to exclude participants with complicated appendicitis prior to randomisation, although one study included 12% with perforation. The diagnostic technique was clinical assessment and imaging in most studies. Only one study limited inclusion by sex (male only). Follow-up ranged from hospital admission only to seven years. Certainty of evidence was mainly affected by risk of bias (due to lack of blinding and loss to follow-up) and imprecision. Primary outcomes It is uncertain whether there was any difference in mortality due to the very low-certainty evidence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 4.95; 1 study, 492 participants). There may be 76 more people per 1000 having unsuccessful treatment in the antibiotic group compared with surgery, which did not reach our predefined level for clinical significance (risk ratio (RR) 0.91, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.96; I² = 69%; 7 studies, 2471 participants; low-certainty evidence). Secondary outcomes At one year, 30.7% (95% CI 24.0 to 37.8; I² = 80%; 9 studies, 1396 participants) of participants in the antibiotic group required appendectomy or, alternatively, more than two-thirds of antibiotic-treated participants avoided surgery in the first year, but the evidence is very uncertain. Regarding complications, it is uncertain whether there is any difference in episodes of Clostridium difficile diarrhoea due to very low-certainty evidence (Peto OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.89; 1 study, 1332 participants). There may be a clinically significant reduction in wound infections with antibiotics (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.68; I² = 16%; 9 studies, 2606 participants; low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether antibiotics affect the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess or collection (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.61 to 4.07; I² = 19%; 6 studies, 1831 participants), or reoperation (Peto OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.16; 1 study, 492 participants) due to very low-certainty evidence, mainly due to rare events causing imprecision and risk of bias. It is uncertain if antibiotics prolonged length of hospital stay by half a day due to the very low-certainty evidence (MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.01; I² = 97%; 11 studies, 3192 participants). The incidence of malignancy was 0.3% (95% CI 0 to 1.5; 5 studies, 403 participants) in the antibiotic group although follow-up was variable. Antibiotics probably increased the number of negative appendectomies at surgery (RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.54 to 6.49; I² = 17%; 5 studies, 707 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotics may be associated with higher rates of unsuccessful treatment for 76 per 1000 people, although differences may not be clinically significant. It is uncertain if antibiotics increase length of hospital stay by half a day. Antibiotics may reduce wound infections. A third of the participants initially treated with antibiotics required subsequent appendectomy or two-thirds avoided surgery within one year, but the evidence is very uncertain. There were too few data from the included studies to comment on major complications.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^c5afd416]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign — empiric antimicrobial coverage and de-escalation in pediatric sepsis specifies: We recommend empiric broad-spectrum therapy with one or more antimicrobials to cover all likely pathogens (BPS); once the pathogen(s) and sensitivities are available, we recommend narrowing empiric antimicrobial therapy coverage (BPS); and if no pathogen is identified, we recommend narrowing or stopping empiric antimicrobial therapy according to clinical presentation, site of infection, host risk factors, and adequacy of clinical improvement in discussion with infectious disease and/or microbiological expert advice (BPS). Empiric therapy should cover a broad range of pathogens that are likely to cause the infection, and broad-spectrum therapy is recommended for initial empiric therapy of children with septic shock or sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. The initial choice of empiric antimicrobials should take into account the specific clinical history, and patients with recent or current hospital exposure should receive empiric therapy that considers known infection or colonization and any recent antimicrobial exposure. Institutions or regions should identify the most appropriate first-line single-agent antimicrobial, when available an infectious diseases clinician should be consulted, and other nonbacterial pathogens suspected as a cause of infection should also be targeted on a case-by-case basis.

Italian multidisciplinary Consensus Conference for the antimicrobial treatment of Intra-abdominal Infections

What is the optimal timing to start antibiotic therapy in patients with IAIs?

1. In patients with IAIs, empiric antibiotic therapy should be started after a treatable infection has been recognized or highly suspected. Timing of administration should be based on the patient's clinical status (Moderate quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Antibiotic therapy in patients with IAIs is initially empiric because the identification of pathogens and their susceptibility patterns determined by the standard microbiological culture typically needs 24 h or more.

Timing of administration should be based on the patient's clinical status. In non-critically ill patients, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be started when an IAI is recognized or highly suspected. Survival benefit from adequate empiric antibiotic therapy has not been consistently shown, even in patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia. Conversely, in patients with sepsis or septic shock, the prompt administration of appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy can significantly influence the outcome, regardless of the anatomical site of infection.

According to the current literature, a strong correlation exists between each hour of delayed administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and mortality in patients with septic shock. However, this relationship is less pronounced in patients with sepsis who do not experience shock.

When should microbiological cultures be obtained in patients with IAIs?

2. In patients with IAIs at risk of resistant pathogens and in critically ill patients', cultures from peritoneal fluid should be always obtained. In critically ill hospitalized patients, a minimum of two sets of blood cultures before initiating antimicrobial therapy should be always obtained (Very low quality of evidence, strong recommendation).

Microbiological testing results are crucial in choosing a therapeutic strategy and in guiding a targeted antibiotic treatment. This testing allows clinicians to individualize the spectrum of the antibiotic regimen, broadening it if the initial choice was too narrow, but more commonly narrowing an empiric regimen spectrum that was too broad.

### Safety and efficacy of antibiotics compared with appendicectomy for treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^f87c8a86]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Appendicectomy has been the mainstay for the treatment for acute appendicitis since it was first reported by McBurney in 1889, and the general assumption since the 19th century has been that in the absence of surgical intervention the disease often progresses from uncomplicated to perforated appendicitis. The advent of laparoscopic surgery and the low threshold for operative intervention have led to a risk of high negative appendicectomy rates with unnecessary surgery related morbidity. Only 20% of patients present with complicated appendicitis, and non-operative management with antibiotics and supportive treatment has been explored as a therapeutic option for patients with early uncomplicated appendicitis, with resolution in most of them. Antibiotic treatment was often considered as a bridge to surgery in patients with suspected appendicitis but no clear indications for appendicectomy such as signs of perforation or peritonitis. However, the routine use of antibiotics in patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis was not well supported, owing to inherent pitfalls in the quality and design of individual studies. The role of antibiotic treatment in acute uncomplicated appendicitis may have been overlooked mainly on the basis of tradition rather than evidence, considering that other intra-abdominal inflammatory processes such as colonic diverticulitis are primarily managed non-operatively.

This time honoured practice has been challenged recently with reports of less morbidity associated with antibiotic treatment than surgery in uncomplicated acute appendicitis. With the availability of diagnostic modalities such as computed tomography and ultrasonography, the small group of patients presenting with complicated appendicitis can be identified. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that despite the increasing trend for surgical exploration for suspected appendicitis over the years, the incidence of perforated appendicitis has been similar across all age groups. However, the management of the large majority with uncomplicated appendicitis warrants further evaluation.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the trials, including a Cochrane review comparing antibiotic treatment and appendicectomy, published in recent years summarised the evidence as either in favour of antibiotic treatment or inconclusive. This could possibly result from inclusion of trials with poor methods or retracted since publication, or from simplifying the evidence as a summary of both randomised and non-randomised studies. The meta-analysis presented here provides a valid and up to date summary of the relevant literature, including a recently published randomised controlled trial of 339 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of uncomplicated appendicitis. It excludes the study that has been retracted subsequent to publication, as well as another for which it was not clear if patients were randomised. The aim of this meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was to compare antibiotic treatment with appendicectomy for the treatment of uncomplicated acute appendicitis, with particular reference to safety and efficacy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES jerusalem guidelines [^ef461766]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Statement 3.1 Short, in-hospital surgical delay up to 24 h is safe in uncomplicated acute appendicitis and does not increase complications and/or perforation rate in adults. Surgery for uncomplicated acute appendicitis can be planned for the next available list minimizing delay wherever possible (better patient comfort, etc.). Short, in-hospital delay with observation and repeated trans-abdominal US in pregnant patients with equivocal appendicitis is acceptable and does not seem to increase the risk of maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. Recommendation 3.1 We recommend planning laparoscopic appendectomy for the next available operating list within 24 h in case of uncomplicated acute appendicitis, minimizing the delay wherever possible [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Strong; 1B].

Statement 3.2 Delaying appendectomy for uncomplicated acute appendicitis for up to 24 h after admission does not appear to be a risk factor for complicated appendicitis, postoperative surgical site infection, or morbidity. Conversely, appendectomies performed after 24 h from admission are related to increased risk of adverse outcomes. Recommendation 3.2 We recommend against delaying appendectomy for acute appendicitis needing surgery beyond 24 h from the admission [QoE: Moderate; Strength of recommendation: Strong; 1B].

Q.3.2: Does in-hospital delay increase the rate of complications or perforation for pediatric patients with uncomplicated acute appendicitis?

In children appendectomy performed within the first 24 h from presentation is not associated with an increased risk of perforation or adverse outcomes. Similarly, in the multivariate logistic regression analysis by Almstrom et al. increased time to surgery was not associated with increased risk of histopathologic perforation, and there was no association between the timing of surgery and postoperative wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess, reoperation, or readmission.

Data from NSQIP-Pediatrics demonstrated that a 16-h delay from emergency department presentation or a 12-h delay from hospital admission to appendectomy was not associated with an increased risk of SSI. Compared with patients who did not develop an SSI, patients who developed an SSI had similar times between emergency department triage and appendectomy (11.5 h vs 9.7 h, P = 0.36) and similar times from admission to appendectomy (5.5 h vs 4.3 h, P = 0.36). Independent risk factors for SSI were complicated AA, longer symptom duration, and presence of sepsis/septic shock.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^3067a5cc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Acute Appendicitis

Acute appendicitis is the most common intra-abdominal condition requiring emergency surgery.

The Surgical Infection Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have generated guidelines for the management and treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections on 2010.

Operative intervention for acute, non-perforated appendicitis is the treatment of choice. Non-operative management of patients with acute, non-perforated appendicitis can be considered if there is a marked improvement in the patient's condition prior to operation (Recommendation 1 A).

Antibiotic treatment has been shown to be effective in treating selected patients with acute appendicitis. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of antibiotic therapy alone with that of surgery for acute appendicitis. A meta-analysis of these RCTs concluded that while antibiotics may be useful as primary treatment for selected patients, antibiotics are unlikely to replace appendectomy at present. Selection bias and crossover to surgery in the RCTs suggest that appendectomy is still the gold standard therapy for acute appendicitis. A support for a less emergent approach comes from clinical trials analyzing time to perforation, which indicate this to be an unusual early event.

Both open and laparoscopic approaches to appendectomy are appropriate (Recommendation 1 A).

A systematic review that included 45 randomized trials compared the diagnostic and therapeutic effects of laparoscopic and conventional open appendectomy in the treatment of suspected acute appendicitis. The most consistent findings were an approximately 50% reduction in wound infections but a threefold increase in intra-abdominal abscesses in the laparoscopic appendectomy group. However, subsequently, two large studies have shown that patients undergoing a laparoscopic technique were more likely to be readmitted within 28 days of surgery and that the risk for a complication was higher in the laparoscopic appendectomy group with uncomplicated appendicitis. Taken together, open appendectomy may be preferred, although laparoscopic appendectomy is useful in selected subgroups of patients. Use of either approach should be decided by the surgeon's expertise. The laparoscopic approach is useful for obese patients, elderly patients and patients whose diagnosis is uncertain, especially women of childbearing age.

### Contemporary microbiology and antimicrobial treatment of complicated appendicitis: the value of a short-term study [^4ba4d3b4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial stewardship interventions to curtail the use of third-generation cephalosporins and antipseudomonal penicillins for the treatment of complicated appendicitis in children are challenging given the tendency to treat complicated disease with broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Reasons for this are unclear, but there is a paucity of contemporary microbiologic data associated with the child presenting with either acute perforated or gangrenous appendicitis. This study aimed to justify the appropriateness of an empiric regimen consisting of ampicillin, tobramycin/gentamicin plus metronidazole and to analyze duration of postoperative therapy.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study from February 1, 2017, to October 31, 2018, in children who underwent appendectomy or interventional radiologic drainage for primary complicated appendicitis. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had a pathogen isolated from peritoneal fluid culture that was not susceptible to the recommended empiric therapy. The secondary outcomes were the total duration of antimicrobial therapy and the proportion of patients with a postoperative infectious complication within 30 days after intervention.

Results

Of 425 children with primary acute appendicitis, 158 (37%) had complicated appendicitis at presentation. Culture was performed in 53 (40%) of the 133 who underwent a surgical or interventional radiologic intervention. The group with peritoneal cultures was more likely to present with longer symptom duration before admission [3 (interquartile range, 2–5) vs 2 (interquartile range, 1–2) days; P < 0.001] and with purulent peritonitis [47% (25/53) vs 13% (10/80); P < 0.001]. The most common pathogens isolated were anaerobes (81%), Escherichia coli (74%) and Streptococcus anginosus group (62%). Only 4% of isolated bacteria were resistant to empiric therapy. Postoperative infectious complications were documented in 23 (17%) patients and were not associated with the presence of a resistant pathogen or the choice of antimicrobial agents but with more severe disease and higher C-reactive protein values (303 vs 83mg/L; P = 0.03) at presentation.

Conclusions

In a cohort of previously healthy children presenting with complicated appendicitis requiring surgical drainage, the most common bacteria from peritoneal cultures continue to be S. anginosus, aminoglycoside-susceptible Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobes. In an attempt to reduce extended-spectrum cephalosporin use, these data were useful in supporting the use of metronidazole with ampicillin and an aminoglycoside, rather than third-generation cephalosporins.

### Postoperative antibiotics, outcomes, and resource use in children with gangrenous appendicitis… [^ab910212]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Exposure Continuation of antibiotics after appendectomy. Main Outcomes and Measures Rate of 30-day postoperative SSI including both incisional and organ space infections. Complementary hospital and patient-level analyses were conducted to explore the association between postoperative antibiotic use and severity-adjusted outcomes. The hospital-level analysis explored the correlation between postoperative antibiotic use and observed to expected SSI rate ratios after adjusting for differences in disease severity among hospital populations. In the patient-level analysis, propensity score matching was used to balance groups on disease severity, and outcomes were compared using mixed-effects logistic regression to adjust for hospital-level clustering.

With these considerations, the goal of this analysis was to evaluate whether use of postoperative antibiotics was associated with improved outcomes in children with nonperforated appendicitis with GSE findings from 16 children's hospitals, collectively representing a wide range of patient populations and practice environments. Establishing the benefit, if any, of postoperative antibiotics in children with GSE findings would potentially have important implications for optimizing SSI prevention or antimicrobial stewardship, depending on the relative comparative effectiveness associated with extended treatment. Of children who received postoperative antibiotics, 532 received intravenous antibiotics on postoperative day 1 with the most common regimens being piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone.

The results of this analysis have important implications for optimizing antimicrobial stewardship in the treatment of children with nonperforated appendicitis associated with GSE findings. Overuse of antibiotics has been associated with increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection, acute kidney injury, and adverse events including anaphylaxis. 17, 18 Furthermore, prolonged antibiotic treatment has been identified as a major driver of antimicrobial resistance. 6, 7, 19 It is important to emphasize that surgical site infections were rare in this cohort of children whether or not postoperative antibiotics were used, and continuation of antibiotics postoperatively was not associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in SSI rates. The results of this cohort study suggest that postoperative antibiotics should not be used in children with nonperforated appendicitis with GSE findings.

When considering the potential magnitude of national practice variation in the use of postoperative antibiotics that can be extrapolated from these data, elimination of postoperative antibiotic use in children with nonperforated appendicitis with GSE findings could substantially improve antimicrobial stewardship in the management of pediatric appendicitis.

Methods/design

Trial design

The APPY trial has been designed as a pragmatic, parallel-group, unmasked, non-inferiority, multicentre, international, RCT. The protocol has been developed in accordance with the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) guidelineand the trial will be conducted and reported according to the CONSORT statement. The trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02687464.

Participants

Children (5–16 years of age) with suspected acute uncomplicated appendicitis will be enrolled. All children with suspected acute non-perforated appendicitis will be assessed by the on-call surgeon who will determine eligibility for the study. This will be based on a clinical and/or ultrasound (US) or CT diagnosis of acute non-perforated appendicitis. The parent(s) and child will be informed of the trial and invited to participate.

Inclusion criteria

children (age 5–16 years)
clinical and/or radiological diagnosis (US and/or CT scan) of acute non-perforated appendicitis
written informed parental consent in accordance with local regulations and institutional policy
written informed child assent in accordance with local regulations and institutional policy

Exclusion criteria

suspicion of perforated appendicitis
presentation with an appendix mass or phlegmon (on physical examination and/or imaging)
non-operative management (two or more doses of intravenous antibiotic) initiated at an outside institution
previous episode of appendicitis or appendix mass/phlegmon treated non-operatively
current treatment for malignancy
positive pregnancy test
diagnosis of cystic fibrosis

Randomisation

After signed informed consent, a standardised data set will be collected from all participants at all participating institutions. Patients enrolled in the study will be randomised to groups (1:1 ratio) using an online stratified randomisation tool, allowing instant assignment to treatment group 24 hours per day with concealment of allocation. Allocation to groups will be stratified taking into account factors that may affect outcome of treatment: (1) Gender: Male; Female; (2) Duration of symptoms < 48 hours; > 48 hours; and (3) Centre. Due to the nature of the interventions blinding will not be possible, and as imaging is not an inclusion criterion, it is not possible to stratify by presence/absence of faecolith.

Interventions

Patients will be allocated to non-operative antibiotic treatment or appendectomy. Figure 1 illustrates patient flow through the two treatment pathways during the acute admission following randomisation.

Pediatric sepsis empiric antimicrobial management — timing and reassessment: Most microbiological cultures show significant growth within 24 to 36 hours, so empiric treatment should be reevaluated after no more than 48 hours following initiation. If no pathogen is identified and bacterial/fungal infection is deemed unlikely, clinicians should stop empiric antimicrobial therapy to reduce unnecessary exposure. Decisions to continue, narrow, or stop therapy must often be made on the basis of clinician judgment and indirect clinical information, and complex patients should be discussed with pediatric infectious diseases and/or microbiology specialists to ensure likely pathogens are treated and that antimicrobials are stopped when no longer necessary.

Key Points

Question

Is the timing of antibiotic administration associated with sepsis-attributable mortality in pediatric sepsis?

Findings

In this multicenter cohort study of 19 515 pediatric patients with sepsis recognized within 1 hour of emergency department arrival, antibiotic administration beyond 330 minutes was associated with an increase in 3-day and 30-day sepsis-attributable mortality.

Meaning

These findings suggest that long delays in antibiotic therapy are associated with increased risk of mortality among children with sepsis.

### Distilling the key elements of pediatric appendicitis clinical practice guidelines [^982a8613]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Use of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have been shown to reduce care delays, optimize resource utilization, and improve patient outcomes. We conducted a systematized review to identify key elements that should be included in an evidence-based CPG for pediatric appendicitis.

Methods

We characterized key decision points and content areas from CPGs developed from 2000 to 2019 that were identified using publicly available platforms and manual search/personal communications.

Results

Twenty-seven CPGs were reviewed with content saturation achieved after reviewing eight. We found 16 key elements spanning from triage to postoperative care. Elements with high accord among CPGs included use of laparoscopy and delay of postoperative imaging for abscess screening until postoperative day seven. For simple appendicitis, all CPGs endorsed antibiotic cessation, diet advancement, and early activity, and 11 CPGs included same-day discharge. Elements with heterogeneity in decision-making included antibiotic selection/duration for perforated appendicitis, criteria defining perforation, and utility of postoperative laboratory evaluations.

Conclusions

Development of an evidence-based CPGs for pediatric appendicitis requires attention to a finite number of key decision points and content areas. Existing literature demonstrates improved patient outcomes with CPG implementation.

### A critical analysis of the literature on time-to-antibiotics in suspected sepsis [^697f189b]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends immediate antibiotics for all patients with suspected sepsis and septic shock, ideally within 1 hour of recognition. Immediate antibiotic treatment is lifesaving for some patients, but a substantial fraction of patients initially diagnosed with sepsis have noninfectious conditions. Aggressive time-to-antibiotic targets risk promoting antibiotic overuse and antibiotic-associated harms for this subset of the population. An accurate understanding of the precise relationship between time-to-antibiotics and mortality for patients with possible sepsis is therefore critical to finding the best balance between assuring immediate antibiotics for those patients who truly need them versus allowing clinicians some time for rapid investigation to minimize the risk of overtreatment and antibiotic-associated harms for patients who are not infected. More than 30 papers have been published assessing the relationship between time-to-antibiotics and outcomes, almost all of which are observational cohort studies. Most report significant associations but all have important limitations. Key limitations include focusing just on the sickest subset of patients (only patients requiring intensive care and/or patients with septic shock), blending together mortality estimates from patients with very long intervals until antibiotics with patients with shorter intervals and reporting a single blended (and thus inflated) estimate for the average increase in mortality associated with each hour until antibiotics, and failure to control for large potential confounders including patients' presenting signs and symptoms and granular measures of comorbidities and severity of illness. In this study, we elaborate on these potential sources of bias and try to distill a better understanding of what the true relationship between time-to-antibiotics and mortality may be for patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute appendicitis: 2020 update of the WSES jerusalem guidelines [^91838487]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Acute appendicitis (AA) is among the most common causes of acute abdominal pain. Diagnosis of AA is still challenging and some controversies on its management are still present among different settings and practice patterns worldwide. In July 2015, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) organized in Jerusalem the first consensus conference on the diagnosis and treatment of AA in adult patients with the intention of producing evidence-based guidelines. An updated consensus conference took place in Nijemegen in June 2019 and the guidelines have now been updated in order to provide evidence-based statements and recommendations in keeping with varying clinical practice: use of clinical scores and imaging in diagnosing AA, indications and timing for surgery, use of non-operative management and antibiotics, laparoscopy and surgical techniques, intra-operative scoring, and peri-operative antibiotic therapy.

Methods

This executive manuscript summarizes the WSES guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AA. Literature search has been updated up to 2019 and statements and recommendations have been developed according to the GRADE methodology. The statements were voted, eventually modified, and finally approved by the participants to the consensus conference and by the board of co-authors, using a Delphi methodology for voting whenever there was controversy on a statement or a recommendation. Several tables highlighting the research topics and questions, search syntaxes, and the statements and the WSES evidence-based recommendations are provided. Finally, two different practical clinical algorithms are provided in the form of a flow chart for both adults and pediatric (< 16years old) patients.

Conclusions

The 2020 WSES guidelines on AA aim to provide updated evidence-based statements and recommendations on each of the following topics: (1) diagnosis, (2) non-operative management for uncomplicated AA, (3) timing of appendectomy and in-hospital delay, (4) surgical treatment, (5) intra-operative grading of AA, (6), management of perforated AA with phlegmon or abscess, and (7) peri-operative antibiotic therapy.

### Prolonged antibiotic treatment does not prevent intra-abdominal abscesses in perforated appendicitis [^5533ca01]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Treatment of intra-abdominal abscesses

Whereas in two (6.9%) patients, the intra-abdominal abscess resolved without intervention, the standard antibiotic treatment was prolonged in three (10.3%) other children, without performing a surgical procedure to eliminate the abscess. Fifteen (51.7%) children were treated by incision and drainage of the abscess — transanally or percutaneously. Nine (31.0%) children underwent formal surgery for abscess drainage and lavage a total of 14 times (mean per child, 1.4).

### Antibiotics in complicated pediatric appendicitis… [^28716b3e]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Mortality from appendicitis rarely occurs, and morbidity has been decreasing with the development of new therapies. The use of perioperative antibiotics has reduced the incidence of the most serious infectious complication, postsurgical intra-abdominal abscess formation. Three to 14 days of antibiotic therapy generally are recommended for patients with gangrenous or perforated appendicitis, although the ultimate decision about the duration of treatment remains with the treating physician. Hoelzer and associates identified criteria to determine when adequate antibiotic therapy has been administered and when it may be discontinued safely. Decreasing the duration of treatment would shorten the length of hospital stays and lower the cost of treatment while reducing the risk of drug-related toxicities. Thirty-three consecutive children who underwent surgery for grossly apparent perforation or gangrenous appendicitis received preoperative or perioperative antibiotics.

Antibiotic therapy was continued postoperatively until patients were able to eat, were afebrile and had a normal white blood cell count with immature neutrophil counts of less than 3 percent. At this point, patients were considered to have met the criteria to stop antibiotic therapy and were discharged. Patients were monitored for at least two months after discharge. Of the 32 children who met the criteria, all but one recovered without recurrent intra-abdominal abscess or wound infection. Thus, the predictive value for the criteria was 97 percent. One child did not meet the criteria before antibiotics were discontinued. He was able to eat and had a normal white blood cell count, so he was discharged despite a temperature of 38. 5°C. He was readmitted seven days later with an intra-abdominal abscess below the appendectomy incision.

Therefore, the predictive value of failure to meet the criteria was 100 percent. The authors conclude that combining physical examination with laboratory evaluation accurately determines when antibiotic treatment can be discontinued safely. They recommend, however, that because of their small sample size, evaluation of the criteria in a larger clinical study is necessary.

### Management of neonates born at ≥ 35 0 / 7 weeks' gestation with suspected or proven early-onset bacterial sepsis [^9c2d7fb3]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically with respect to neonates, management, AAP 2018 guidelines recommend to discontinue antibiotic therapy by 36–48 hours of incubation when blood cultures are sterile, unless there is clear evidence of site-specific infection. Avoid continuing empirical antibiotic therapy in response to laboratory test abnormalities alone, particularly among well-appearing term infants.
