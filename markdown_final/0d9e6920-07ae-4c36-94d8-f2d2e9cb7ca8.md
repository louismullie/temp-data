## Question

initial gout flare treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the initial treatment of an acute gout flare. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and clarifying when to aspirate a joint. Then, I should assess flare severity, number of joints, timing, and functional impact. Next, I will screen for contraindications and comorbidities that gate which anti-inflammatory agent is safe. After that, I'll select among first-line options (NSAIDs, low-dose colchicine, or corticosteroids) and consider special populations. I will then address whether and how to initiate urate-lowering therapy (ULT) during the flare and set up anti-inflammatory prophylaxis. Finally, I'll define monitoring, success/failure criteria, escalation strategies, and close with education and follow-up linked to treat-to-target principles.

> Let me first confirm the clinical picture is consistent with an acute gout flare, and I should not miss mimics like septic arthritis. Sudden onset of severe mono- or oligoarticular pain, swelling, erythema, and tenderness, especially at the first MTP, is typical, but I need to check whether there is diagnostic uncertainty; if so, synovial fluid analysis for monosodium urate crystals is recommended by ACP when clinical judgment indicates testing is needed, particularly for first monoarticular flares where ruling out infection is paramount [^111NWXYW].

> I need to consider timing and severity because earlier anti-inflammatory treatment yields better outcomes. Treatment initiated within the first 24–48 hours appears most effective, and while I initially thought any start within a week would be equivalent, wait, the product information for commonly used NSAIDs emphasizes early initiation during the first 24–48 hours, which aligns with general treat-to-target flare control principles in acute care [^1174YxQC] [^1112yejL].

> Next, I should review comorbidities and contraindications carefully, because they drive the choice of agent and dose. In severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min), I need to avoid colchicine and NSAIDs due to toxicity risk, and in moderate CKD, colchicine dosing must be reduced with close monitoring; strong P-gp or CYP3A4 inhibitors like cyclosporine or clarithromycin are a red flag for colchicine toxicity, and I should double-check for statin co-use given myopathy risk, especially with CKD [^114WSd67] [^112D3qBA]. For active peptic ulcer disease or high GI bleeding risk, I should avoid NSAIDs or co-prescribe gastroprotection if NSAIDs are absolutely necessary, and in cardiovascular disease or decompensated heart failure, NSAIDs may be contraindicated; corticosteroids can worsen glycemic control in diabetes, so I need to anticipate and monitor hyperglycemia if used [^112iwfhS] [^116xUkZR]. Hold on, I should verify infection status early as well; IL-1 inhibitors should not be started in patients with active infection [^112ZXcoP].

> Now I will select a first-line anti-inflammatory agent, remembering that guidelines consider NSAIDs, low-dose colchicine, and corticosteroids as equally appropriate initial choices, with selection driven by patient factors and preferences. The ACR 2020 and ACP 2017 guidelines endorse any of these three classes for acute flares as first line, emphasizing low-dose colchicine when that agent is used, and shared decision-making around risks and comorbidities [^1137Cqjh] [^116D1smR] [^111ZX6nR]. I initially considered prioritizing NSAIDs across the board, but hold on, equal ranking is guideline-concordant and safer because comorbidities often preclude NSAIDs or colchicine [^1137Cqjh] [^116D1smR].

> If I choose an NSAID, I should use a full anti-inflammatory dose for a short course, started promptly. For example, meloxicam 15 mg daily for about 5–7 days is a common regimen started within 24–48 hours of flare onset; although I almost stated this is an on-label indication for gout, wait, let me verify the supplied SPL dosing guidance here and use it as a practical dosing example while still individualizing choice to patient GI/CV/renal risk and co-prescribing gastroprotection when warranted [^1174YxQC] [^112iwfhS]. NSAIDs typically relieve symptoms in most patients within a week with a maximum time to resolution around 28 days, but I need to ensure renal function and GI risk are acceptable before prescribing [^116LFPLW].

> If I select colchicine, I should confirm that the low-dose regimen is preferred over high-dose because it improves tolerability with similar efficacy. The ACR and ACP recommend low-dose colchicine for flares: 1.2 mg once, followed by 0.6 mg one hour later, then 0.6 mg every 12–24 hours starting 12 hours after the second dose; I initially thought high-dose colchicine may be required in severe pain, but wait, I should adhere to the low-dose strategy given the narrower therapeutic window and better safety profile, and adjust or avoid in CKD and with interacting medications [^114gFZYv] [^111zAZ1i] [^116D1smR] [^112D3qBA]. Evidence for colchicine is supportive but not expansive, so I need to monitor closely for GI toxicity and myopathy, especially with statins or renal impairment [^1132ms2q] [^112D3qBA] [^1135R2x9].

> If corticosteroids are chosen, I should tailor route and dose to joint burden and patient-specific issues. For monoarticular disease, intra-articular triamcinolone is efficient and avoids systemic effects; for oligo/polyarticular flares or when injection is not feasible, oral prednisone/prednisolone 30–40 mg daily with a short taper over 7–10 days is reasonable, and intramuscular or intravenous options are available for hospitalized or NPO patients; I should remember that corticosteroids are particularly useful in CKD when NSAIDs and colchicine are unsafe, and that randomized data suggest similar short-term efficacy to NSAIDs with potentially fewer GI side effects, though I must anticipate hyperglycemia and mood changes and watch for rebound flares on withdrawal [^116eZv8m] [^116zBWTg] [^116vxpQt] [^116xUkZR] [^115mVtZi].

> I need to apply special-population modifications carefully. In severe renal impairment, first-line therapy should be corticosteroids by oral, intra-articular, or parenteral routes while avoiding colchicine and NSAIDs; if steroids are contraindicated or ineffective, I should consider IL-1 blockade with caution, not forgetting to screen for infection first [^114WSd67] [^112ZXcoP] [^116TNCvZ]. For hospitalized, treatment-resistant cases, anakinra 100 mg subcutaneously daily has been associated with rapid pain improvement in observational series, and intramuscular ACTH can be effective, although the evidence base remains limited and uncontrolled; I should reserve these for refractory or highly comorbid cases after standard options are exhausted [^113fsh4v].

> If monotherapy is insufficient after 24–48 hours, I should not hesitate to escalate. Wait, I should verify guideline support for combination therapy; BSR permits combining treatments in inadequate responders and endorses joint aspiration with intra-articular corticosteroid for accessible monoarthritis, which often yields prompt relief with minimal systemic toxicity, so I should integrate these options before declaring failure [^114uppzZ] [^116eZv8m].

> Now, regarding urate-lowering therapy during a flare, I need to balance tradition with current evidence. Historically, we deferred ULT until flares resolved, but the ACR 2020 guideline conditionally recommends that ULT can be initiated during an acute flare when anti-inflammatory therapy is co-prescribed, and randomized trials initiating allopurinol or febuxostat during flares did not prolong pain or flare duration; I initially worried this would worsen symptoms, but the trials and guideline synthesis suggest it does not, which can streamline care and improve adherence if we provide prophylaxis and treat the flare aggressively [^1178sm23] [^114EdBSE] [^111kgTxe] [^111CCUfh] [^116LFPLW]. Longer-term disease control still hinges on achieving and maintaining serum urate below 6 mg/dL, which is associated with reduced future flares and crystal dissolution, reinforcing a treat-to-target approach [^114Pzu3i] [^116EK3Q5].

> If I initiate or intensify ULT, I must co-prescribe anti-inflammatory prophylaxis and continue it adequately. I should double-check the duration and options: ACR recommends 3–6 months minimum of prophylaxis, using colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily (dose-reduced in CKD), or a low-dose NSAID such as naproxen 250 mg twice daily if no contraindications, with low-dose prednisone (≤ 10 mg/day) as a third-line option when others are unsuitable; while I first considered stopping earlier once urate hit target, hold on, meta-analytic data show a spike in flares after stopping prophylaxis at 3 months, supporting at least 3–6 months and longer if flares continue [^113GgTZp] [^112D3qBA] [^117QyWfG] [^114o8nJD] [^113UXfU7] [^114D7JUb]. Evidence demonstrates colchicine prophylaxis reduces flare frequency and severity during ULT initiation, but I must weigh adverse event risks, particularly with CKD and polypharmacy, and review contemporary safety data as I tailor the regimen [^114EkSKA] [^112qMohF] [^1142NHAX].

> I will now examine monitoring and response targets so I can adjust therapy promptly. Primary outcomes include rapid pain reduction (ideally ≥ 50% within 24–48 hours), diminishing swelling, tenderness, and erythema, with typical total resolution by 7–10 days in uncomplicated cases, though some flares may extend to 2–4 weeks; validated scales, including Likert ratings used in gout trials, can standardize assessments, and daily check-ins early in therapy can guide escalation if needed [^116LFPLW] [^111d2qs4]. I should confirm tolerability and screen for adverse effects specific to the chosen agent at 48–72 hours and again at one to two weeks, adjusting the plan as needed [^116D1smR].

> I need to define success and failure clearly to guide escalation. Treatment success is achieving rapid pain relief, resolution of inflammatory signs by about a week, and no early recurrence under prophylaxis; in terms of patient-important outcomes, achieving a patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS) or low disease activity (LDA) on flare frequency anchors follow-up targets, with ≤ 1 flare per 6 months aligning with acceptable states in recent analyses [^1111M1Ut] [^117GAi7G]. Treatment failure is inadequate pain control by 48–72 hours, expanding joint involvement, or intolerance; in such cases, I should increase dose within safety limits, switch to an alternate first-line class, use combination therapy, and consider IL-1 inhibition for refractory cases with contraindications to standard agents, escalating to inpatient parenteral therapy if severity warrants [^114uppzZ] [^116TNCvZ] [^116ZEH7Y].

> Let me consider education and follow-up because these prevent recurrence and improve adherence. I should explain that prompt anti-inflammatory treatment provides rapid relief and that starting ULT during a flare is acceptable if we co-prescribe prophylaxis; I need to counsel on trigger mitigation such as alcohol moderation, hydration, and dietary purine reduction, but emphasize that long-term control depends on titrating ULT to reach serum urate < 6 mg/dL and maintaining it, which leads to crystal dissolution and fewer flares over time; structured follow-up at 3–7 days for the acute episode, monthly for 3–6 months during ULT titration, and then every 6–12 months for maintenance is prudent [^114EdBSE] [^114Pzu3i] [^1137Cqjh].

> In summary, I should verify that the flow from diagnosis to long-term control is coherent: confirm acute gout clinically and with synovial fluid when uncertain, initiate anti-inflammatory therapy early using NSAIDs, low-dose colchicine, or corticosteroids based on comorbidities, escalate or combine if needed, tailor for CKD and other special contexts, consider starting ULT during the flare with co-prophylaxis, continue prophylaxis for 3–6 months or longer, monitor response and adverse effects closely, define success by rapid pain relief and flare control consistent with PASS/LDA, and reinforce education and treat-to-target serum urate for durable remission [^111NWXYW] [^1137Cqjh] [^116D1smR] [^113GgTZp] [^116EK3Q5].

Initial gout flare treatment should be started **within 24 hours** of symptom onset [^1137Cqjh] using one of three first-line options: NSAIDs at full anti-inflammatory doses, low-dose colchicine (1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later) [^1132ms2q] [^114gFZYv], or corticosteroids (oral, intra-articular, or intramuscular) [^116D1smR]. The choice depends on patient comorbidities and contraindications [^114WSd67]; avoid NSAIDs in renal, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal risk, and reduce colchicine dose in renal impairment [^116xUkZR]. If monotherapy is insufficient, **combine two agents** [^114uppzZ] (e.g. colchicine plus NSAID or corticosteroid). IL-1 inhibitors are reserved for refractory flares or when standard therapies are contraindicated [^112ZXcoP] [^116TNCvZ]. Continue existing urate-lowering therapy during flares, and **initiate ULT during a flare if indicated** [^1178sm23], with anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for 3–6 months [^113GgTZp].

## First-line pharmacologic therapies

The primary goal in acute gout flares is to **rapidly reduce inflammation and pain**; the following medications are recommended as first-line therapy:

| **Medication class** | **Recommended agents** | **Dosage and administration** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| NSAIDs | - Indomethacin <br/> - Naproxen <br/> - Ibuprofen <br/> - Meloxicam | - Indomethacin: 50 mg TID <br/> - Naproxen: 750 mg loading, then 250 mg Q8H <br/> - Ibuprofen: 800 mg TID <br/> - Meloxicam: 15 mg daily [^1174YxQC] | - Avoid in renal impairment, gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular disease [^114WSd67] <br/> - Use gastroprotection if indicated [^112iwfhS] |
| Colchicine | - Colchicine | - 1.2 mg loading dose, then 0.6 mg one hour later [^1132ms2q] <br/> - Maximum 1.8 mg/day [^114gFZYv] | - Reduce dose in renal impairment [^114TZDE4] <br/> - Avoid with strong CYP3A4 or P-gp inhibitors [^114WSd67] |
| Corticosteroids | - Prednisone <br/> - Prednisolone <br/> - Methylprednisolone <br/> - Triamcinolone | - Prednisone: 30–40 mg/day for 5–7 days [^116vxpQt] <br/> - Methylprednisolone: 40 mg IM <br/> - Triamcinolone: 40 mg IM [^116eZv8m] <br/> - Intra-articular injection for monoarticular flares [^1137Cqjh] | - Preferred in patients with contraindications to NSAIDs or colchicine [^116D1smR] <br/> - Monitor for hyperglycemia, hypertension, infection |

---

## Combination therapy

If monotherapy is insufficient, **combine two agents** [^114uppzZ] (e.g. colchicine with an NSAID or a corticosteroid).

---

## Alternative therapies

**IL-1 inhibitors** (anakinra, canakinumab) [^112ZXcoP] are reserved for refractory flares or when standard therapies are contraindicated [^116TNCvZ].

---

## Non-pharmacologic interventions

**Rest, ice, elevation, and hydration** are recommended as adjuncts to pharmacologic therapy.

---

## Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) considerations

Continue existing **ULT** during acute flares, and **initiate ULT during a flare if indicated** [^1178sm23]; provide anti-inflammatory prophylaxis [^114EdBSE] for 3–6 months [^113GgTZp].

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Educate patients on **early recognition and self-management** of flares, and arrange follow-up to monitor response and adjust therapy [^114Pzu3i].

---

Initial gout flare treatment should be **started within 24 hours** [^1137Cqjh] of symptom onset using one of three first-line options: NSAIDs at full anti-inflammatory doses [^116D1smR], low-dose colchicine (1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later) [^1132ms2q] [^114gFZYv], or corticosteroids (oral, intra-articular, or intramuscular). The choice depends on patient comorbidities and contraindications; avoid NSAIDs in renal, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal risk, and reduce colchicine dose in renal impairment [^114WSd67]. If monotherapy is insufficient, **combine two agents** (e.g. colchicine plus NSAID or corticosteroid) [^114uppzZ]. IL-1 inhibitors are reserved for refractory flares or when standard therapies are contraindicated [^112ZXcoP] [^116TNCvZ]. Continue existing urate-lowering therapy during flares, and **consider initiating ULT during a flare if indicated** [^1178sm23], with anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for 3–6 months [^113GgTZp].

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1132ms2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

This is an updated Cochrane Review, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

- **Objectives**: To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP registries to 28 August 2020. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (placebo or active) in acute gout; low-dose colchicine at clinically relevant doses compared with placebo was the primary comparison. The major outcomes were pain, participant global assessment of treatment success (proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours), reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events, total adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane in this review update.

- **Main results**: We included four trials (803 randomised participants), including two new trials, in this updated review. One three-arm trial compared high-dose colchicine (52 participants) and low-dose colchicine (74 participants).

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^112TCXef]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Several limitations to the study need to be mentioned. First, this was a single-blinded trial. Although we tried our best to make the placebo look similar to febuxostat, some experienced observers could still distinguish between the placebo and the experimental drug, leading to inevitable observational bias.

Second, although the sensitivity and specificity of the 2015 ACR/EULAR criteria for gout were higher compared to the 1977 acute gout classification criteria, the limitations of the three central examination centers, such as the use of dual-energy CT and the ultrasound model, meant that the consistency of diagnosis in each center could not be guaranteed. The 1977 acute gout classification criteria are also recognized and commonly used standards in clinical trials and are not limited by examination conditions. Hence, we used the 1977 acute gout classification criteria.

Diclofenac is a commonly used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with more side effects, such as liver damage, kidney damage, and gastrointestinal bleeding. For this reason, the exclusion criteria might imply that patients had milder gout. Due to the rapid changes in inflammation and the difficulty for subjects to visit the hospital daily for the first 7 days, we assessed joint inflammation on days 1, 3, 5, and 7, and on days 2, 4, and 6 by video calls. However, this may affect the accuracy of the data.

Finally, we observed that the initiation of febuxostat during an acute gout flare did not prolong the duration of the flare. The mean sUA levels in the feb…

### Corticosteroid or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for the treatment of acute gout: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^116vxpQt]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) are used as first-line agents to treat acute gout. Recent trials suggest a possible first-line role for corticosteroids.

- **Methods**: We conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) evaluating corticosteroid versus NSAID therapy (nonselective and selective) as treatment for acute gout. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL were systematically searched through August 2016. Outcomes included pain, bleeding, joint swelling, erythema, tenderness, activity limitation, response to therapy, quality of life, time to resolution, supplementary analgesics, and adverse events. Evidence quality was summarized using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) system.

- **Results**: Six eligible trials (817 patients) were identified. The mean study follow-up was 15 days (range 4–30). Risks of bias were generally low. In low- to moderate-quality evidence, corticosteroids did not have different effects on pain score at < 7 days [standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.09, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.08] or at ≥ 7 days (SMD 0.32, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.92) when compared with NSAID. There was no evidence of different risks of gastrointestinal bleeding [relative risk (RR) 0.09, 95% CI 0.01–1.67]. There was no evidence of different responses to therapy on pain at < 7 days (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.80–1.44) and ≥ 7 days, time to disease resolution, or number of supplementary analgesics used (MD 2.10 drugs, 95% CI -1.01 to 5.21). There was a lower risk of indigestion (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27–0.92), and nausea (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11–0.54).

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^1178sm23]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gout, particularly concerning the indications for urate-lowering therapy, the ACR 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of urate-lowering therapy during a gout flare, rather than after the flare has resolved. This recommendation applies when the decision is made to begin urate-lowering therapy in patients experiencing a gout flare.

### Investigating gout flares: Beyond a definition [^117QkxRi]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Gout flares are a paramount component of disease burden inflicted by gout onto the patient. Furthermore, they are included in the core domain set for long-term gout studies recognized by Outcome Measures in Rheumatology. Along with a validated classification criterion for gout, gout investigators have turned their efforts into defining and characterizing the gout flare. This brief review summarizes the efforts that have been done to define and characterize a gout flare in clinical studies.

- **Recent findings**: Recent findings include a validated definition of a gout flare that has been utilized in novel clinical studies, use of technology to monitor for gout flares and their effects on patient life, and qualitative analyses into the disease burden that a patient undergoes.

- **Summary**: Although guidelines for core outcome domains have been well established, there is question in methods of measuring and reporting gout flares in long-term trials. Furthermore, there is question as to the effectiveness of the agreed upon instruments' abilities to fully capture the disease burden experienced by patients with gout. A combination of outcome measurements, including binary data (gout flare present or absent), along with a comprehensive measurement of disease burden over time would theoretically provide a more accurate description of the disease and serve as a basis for intervention development.

### Treating to target: A strategy to cure gout [^114Pzu3i]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gout attacks and the long-term complications of gout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals in the joints and soft tissues, causing both acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of long-term treatment is to reduce the serum urate (sUA) level to 6 mg/dl (≤ 360 micromol/l), which is below the saturation point of MSU, so that new crystals cannot form and existing crystals are dissolved. Serial joint aspiration studies confirmed the disappearance of crystals with effective urate-lowering therapy. There is good evidence that achieving an sUA < 6 mg/dl (360 micromol/l) results in freedom from acute gout attacks, along with the shrinkage and eventual disappearance of tophi.

Gout patients must be informed about their diagnosis and educated about gout management, including the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Patients starting urate-lowering therapy need to understand the importance of prophylactic therapy with colchicine or NSAIDs to reduce the risk of 'mobilization flares' in the first few months. In the long term, reducing the sUA below the target level will result in gout being effectively cured.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: A randomized clinical trial [^111CCUfh]. Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

- **Secondary outcomes**: Pain scores for the placebo and febuxostat groups were 2.87 vs. 2.89 (P = 0.932) at baseline. There were no statistically significant differences on days 1, 3, and 5. On day 7, the patient's assessment of pain decreased to 0.13 vs. 0.26 (P = 0.057). Initial mean joint swelling scores for the placebo and febuxostat groups were 1.99 vs. 1.93 (P = 0.700). There were no statistically significant differences on days 1, 3, and 5. On day 7, joint swelling scores decreased to 0.13 vs. 0.20 (P = 0.468).

- **Manifestation scores**: Initial mean joint tenderness scores for the placebo and febuxostat groups were 1.61 vs. 1.60 (P = 0.871). There were no statistically significant differences on days 1, 3, and 5. On day 7, the joint tenderness scores decreased to 0.14 vs. 0.19 (P = 0.387). Initial mean joint erythema scores for the placebo and febuxostat groups were 1.46 vs. 1.40 (P = 0.387). There were no statistically significant differences on days 1, 3, and 5. On day 7, the joint erythema scores decreased to 0.10 vs. 0.15 (P = 0.550).

### New ACR guidelines for gout management hold some surprises [^114cd7ap]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Despite exciting progress in the understanding and treatment of gout, management of this condition remains suboptimal. In the face of this inadequacy, new guidelines provide recommendations both for therapeutic approaches to hyperuricemia and for the management and anti-inflammatory prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis.

### A randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of arhalofenate for reducing flare in patients with gout [^114uiQx4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis. It is manifested by extremely painful joint attacks, also called flares, which have a major impact on quality of life. Gout results from the deposition of urate crystals in joints. Chronic hyperuricemia, the biochemical signature of the disease, leads to the deposition of urate crystals in articular structures, and the disruption of these crystals is believed to trigger flares. Beyond its articular consequences, the hyperuricemia of gout is independently associated with multiple morbidities, including hypertension, increased cardiovascular risks, and progressive kidney disease. Currently available urate-lowering therapies, while effective for decreasing serum uric acid (UA) levels, dramatically increase the chance of experiencing a flare attack, probably by disrupting intraarticular urate crystals. This paradoxical effect may be associated with gout patients' difficulty in understanding and adhering to their treatment.

Gout treatment guidelines recommend colchicine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the prevention of flares, notably when initiating urate-lowering therapy. However, colchicine is poorly tolerated, and its prescription is limited in time because of associated toxicities such as azoospermia, bone marrow suppression, neuropathy, and myopathy. Colchicine is also associated with numerous potential drug–drug interactions, a significant concern in polymedicated gout patients. Therefore, a new treatment that both prevents gout flares and lowers serum UA levels is needed.

### Which attributes are most and least important to patients when considering gout flare burden over time? A best-worst scaling choice study [^1168Z7tU]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Several factors contribute to the patient experience of gout flares, including pain intensity, duration, frequency, and disability. It is unknown which of these factors are most important to patients when considering flare burden over time, including those related to the cumulative experience of all flares or the experience of a single worst flare. This study aimed to determine which flare attributes are the most and least important to the patient experience of flare burden over time.

- **Methods**: Participants with gout completed an anonymous online survey. Questions were aimed at identifying which attributes of gout flares, representing both individual and cumulative flare burden, were the most and least important over a hypothetical 6-month period. A best-worst scaling method was used to determine the importance hierarchy of the included attributes.

- **Results**: Fifty participants were included. Difficulty doing usual activities during the worst flare and pain of the worst flare were ranked as the most important, whereas average pain of all flares was considered the least important. Overall, attributes related to the single worst gout flare were considered more important than attributes related to the cumulative impact of all flares.

- **Conclusion**: When thinking about the burden of gout flares over time, patients rank activity limitation and pain experienced during their worst gout flare as the most important contributing factors, whereas factors related to the cumulative impact of all flares over time are relatively less important.

### A randomized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study of arhalofenate for reducing flare in patients with gout [^114UKLoj]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The primary outcome measure of efficacy was the flare incidence from baseline to week 12. The flare incidence was calculated as the number of flares in a treatment arm divided by the total period of time with available electronic diary data. A flare was defined as an episode of patient‐reported acute articular or bursal pain that occurred at rest and was typical of past gout attacks. In addition, both of the following criteria had to be met: the intensity of pain at rest had to be ≥ 4 on an 11‐point numerical rating scale, and the pain had to be determined by the patient and/or the investigator to require anti-inflammatory/analgesic treatment. Finally, at least 2 of 3 possible joint symptoms (swelling, warmth, or tenderness) had to be present, and at least one of the following had to be present: rapid onset of pain, decreased range of joint motion, or joint redness. All these were reported by the patient in response to simple questions appearing in the electronic diary (e.g. "was the pain of rapid onset?"). Patients had the opportunity to assess their understanding of each question during the training session.

Secondary efficacy outcome measures included the percent reduction in serum UA level and the proportion of patients with a serum UA level of < 6 mg/dl. Other efficacy outcome measures such as quality of life were considered exploratory.

Safety outcome measures were serious adverse events (SAEs), discontinuation from the study for reasons of safety, treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and changes in laboratory parameter values.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: A systematic review [^113fsh4v]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

A single-centre retrospective study reported outcomes for 26 hospitalized patients who received anakinra for treatment-resistant flares, defined as an inadequate response to colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids and/or contraindications to these medications. Several anakinra dosing regimens were used, depending on each patient's weight, renal function, extent of joint involvement, and response to initial treatment. Multiple courses of anakinra were administered in seven patients, five of whom received the additional courses during different hospital admissions. There was no comparator group. Improvements in pain scores to below 3 on a 10-point scale were observed in 67% of anakinra courses within 24 h of treatment and in 85% by 48 h. Symptom resolution occurred in 73% of patients by day 5; by day 10, all but one patient had fully responded. Anakinra was well tolerated, with no attributable adverse events.

Another single-centre retrospective study reported on the use of intramuscular ACTH 1 mg in 181 hospitalized gout patients. There was no comparator group. Response to ACTH, defined as attenuation of signs of inflammation and no requirement for corticosteroids, NSAIDs, colchicine, or analgesics for 2 days, was observed in 78% of participants. Most non-responders were re-treated with a further injection of ACTH and, of these, 83% responded. A repeat flare was suffered by 11% of participants, following a median of 4 days. Few attributable adverse events were reported, with local injection site reactions observed in 2% of participants.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: A randomized clinical trial [^1178vY6y]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Gout is a common arthritic condition that results from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Urate-lowering treatment (ULT) is important for patients with gout. Previous guidelines have provided conflicting recommendations on whether ULT could be initiated during an acute gout flare. Generally, ULT should be initiated after an acute flare has resolved to avoid prolongation of symptoms. The incidence of gout flares has been positively correlated with the reduction of serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the first few months after initiating ULT.

However, ULT could be initiated during an acute flare to reduce the number of outpatient treatment visits required and hence increase patient compliance. The 2016 EULAR Gout Management Recommendations have not provided clear guidance on this. Additionally, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the management of gout conditionally recommend that pharmacological urate-lowering therapy could be initiated during an acute gout flare based on anti-inflammatory treatment. This recommendation was graded moderate based on two small randomized clinical trials and an observational study.

Two small randomized clinical trials observed that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. Febuxostat (40 mg/day) had a superior urate-lowering effect compared with limited allopurinol doses (maximum 200–300 mg/day). At present, no studies have been published regarding the initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flares.

Our objective in this study was to examine whether initiating febuxostat for an acute gout flare prolongs the current episode.

### Global, regional, and national burden of gout, 1990–2020, and projections to 2050: A systematic analysis of the global burden of disease study 2021 [^116UE4pN]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, manifesting as acute flares of severe joint pain, swelling, redness, and warmth in one or more joints, which can progress to chronic destructive arthropathy. The prevalence of gout is higher in males than females and increases with age. Although a high serum urate concentration is the most important risk factor for the development of gout, genetic factors have a strong influence on the occurrence of gout, and a range of risk factors, such as medications, comorbidities, and environmental exposures, are also implicated. Many factors that contribute to hyperuricaemia are also risk factors for incident gout, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease, factors commonly seen in younger people with gout. Gout has been associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal comorbidities.

- **Effective management strategies**: Treatment of the acute flares and ameliorating the long-term consequences that contribute to disability. Recommendations for managing acute flares include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or glucocorticoids. To prevent recurrent gout flares, the primary goal is to reduce serum urate concentrations, and lifelong administration of urate-lowering drugs is crucial. Lifestyle modifications, such as bodyweight loss, and educational programs focusing on dietary improvement could also be useful for long-term prevention of episodes or flares in people with gout.

Gout can lead to reduced mobility and impaired physical function.

### Management of gout in chronic kidney disease: a G-CAN consensus statement on the research priorities [^114TZDE4]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Drugs used for flares and prophylaxis

For drugs used in the management of gout flares or flare prophylaxis when starting ULT (namely NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids, and IL-1 inhibitors), the efficacy outcomes of interest are the resolution or prevention of gout flares, respectively. For this G-CAN consensus statement, safety outcomes for each drug were individualized. The specific issues identified with medications used for the management of gout flares and prophylaxis in people with CKD are discussed below, and the G-CAN-proposed research priorities are outlined.

- **G-CAN-proposed research priorities for gout drugs in CKD**:

	- **Colchicine**:
		- Treatment of gout flares: Safe and effective dosing of colchicine in chronic kidney disease (CKD): how should the AGREE trial modify a colchicine dose in different stages of CKD? How should colchicine be used in people with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis? Is the risk of drug interactions with colchicine greater in patients with CKD? Whether the dose of colchicine should be altered when used in combination with atorvastatin in people with CKD.
		- **Gout flare prophylaxis**: Can low-dose colchicine be used in people with ESRD on dialysis? Is there an increased risk of adverse effects with low-dose, longer-term colchicine use in people with CKD?

	- **NSAIDs**:
		- **Treatment of gout flares**: Are short-term NSAIDs safe in the context of ESRD? Are longer-term NSAIDs safe in the context of ESRD?
		- **Gout flare prophylaxis**: Are some NSAIDs safer than others for longer-term prophylactic use?

- **Glucocorticoids**

	- This section is incomplete. Further information may be needed to complete the discussion on glucocorticoids for the treatment of gout flares.

### Gout flares after stopping anti-inflammatory prophylaxis: A rapid literature review and meta-analysis [^114D7JUb]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Low credibility.

The aim of this research was to determine how common gout flares are after ceasing anti-inflammatory prophylaxis. A rapid literature review and meta-analysis were undertaken. PubMed was searched from inception to February 2024. Eligibility criteria included any clinical trial of people with gout with at least one arm starting or intensifying urate-lowering therapy (ULT) with coprescription of anti-inflammatory prophylaxis and that had the percentage of participants experiencing one or more gout flares reported during and after the period of prophylaxis. Random effects meta-analyses were used to generate pooled estimates of the percentage of participants experiencing one or more flares in each period.

Six trials were included, together with aggregated, unpublished data from the VA STOP Gout trial (2,972 participants). Pooled random effects estimates of the percentage of participants having one or more gout flares were 14.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 11.3–18.5%) during prophylaxis, 29.7% (95% CI 22.9–37.0%) in the three-month period after ceasing prophylaxis, and 12.2% (95% CI 6.8–19.0%) during the last study period. The mean difference in the percentage of participants having one or more gout flare while taking prophylaxis and immediately after ceasing prophylaxis was -14.8% (95% CI -21.2% to -8.5%; P < 0.0001). The mean difference from the period immediately following prophylaxis discontinuation compared to the last study period was 16.0% (P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses indicated no material effects of prophylaxis duration or trial duration.

### Gout [^112mKYhA]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Low credibility.

Gout affects about 5% of men and 1% of women, with up to 80% of people experiencing a reattack within 3 years. We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute gout? What are the effects of treatments to prevent gout in people with prior acute episodes? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Methods and outcomes**: We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: colchicine, corticosteroids, corticotrophin (ACTH), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), sulfinpyrazone, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, advice to lose weight, advice to reduce alcohol intake, and advice to reduce dietary intake of purines.

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable [^115mVtZi]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The intersecting effects of therapeutics on gouty inflammation are significant. The mechanisms of action of the primary treatment options for the prophylaxis and treatment of acute gout clearly intersect with many of the novel inflammation-mediating pathways. Specifically, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and certain other NSAIDs activate PPAR-γ. Corticosteroids, which inhibit transcription of many inflammatory genes, also regulate annexin A1. However, corticosteroids paradoxically induce NLRP3, which may contribute to rebound flares of acute gout after steroid therapy is stopped. Low doses of colchicine suppress not only neutrophil and endothelial function, but also multiple inflammatory effects in macrophages, transduced in large part by colchicine-induced activation of AMPK.

With respect to investigational agents, randomized clinical trials of the IL-1β-specific monoclonal antibody canakinumab have demonstrated superiority compared to a single dose of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide in reducing pain in acute gout and delaying time to the next acute gout flare. Canakinumab is approved in Europe as an option for acute gout therapy. Multiple retrospective case series have reported on the efficacy of anakinra (recombinant IL-1ra) in acute gout in many but not all patients. Failure in acute gout (but not for anti-inflammatory flare prophylaxis) of the IL-1 blocker rilonacept may have been due to binding of rilonacept to IL-1ra. Finally, the partial PPAR-γ agonist arhalofenate, which is a uricosuric, has been reported to be associated with a decreased frequency of acute gout flares in comparison.

### Relationship between gout flare states and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^1111M1Ut]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Gout flares are the most important clinical feature of the disease. A hypothetical maximum flare occurrence in the preceding six months has been suggested: no flares for a patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS) and only one flare for low disease activity (LDA). The aim of this analysis was to determine the relationship between gout flare states (PASS, LDA, and not in LDA or PASS [non-LDA/PASS]) and patient-reported outcomes.

- **Methods**: Post hoc analyses of variance were undertaken using data from a 12-month randomized controlled trial involving 172 people with gout, which compared low-dose colchicine to placebo for the first 6 months while starting allopurinol, with a further 6-month follow-up. Self-reported gout flares were collected monthly. Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and EuroQol 5-domain (EQ-5D-3L) were completed at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and the gout-specific brief illness perception questionnaire (BIPQ) was collected at months 0, 6, and 12.

- **Results**: In the final six months of the study, 68 participants (38%) were classified as being in PASS, 34 (19%) as in LDA, and 77 (43%) as non-LDA/PASS. There was no association between gout flare states and EQ-5D-3L or HAQ. There was a statistically significant association between three of eight BIPQ items with increasing consequences, identity, and concern scores across the three states of PASS, LDA, and non-LDA/PASS.

- **Conclusion**: The majority of people were able to achieve gout flare PASS or LDA in the second six months after commencing allopurinol. As flare burden increases, so does the impact on the individual.

### Effects of febuxostat in early gout: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111UKkDv]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

According to previous studies, subjects with gout often experience an increased risk of flare in the initial phase of urate-lowering therapy, which may increase the between-arm difference in the rate of gout flares.

An RCT of longer duration (up to 52 weeks) used another urate-lowering drug, allopurinol, as an active comparator. In that study, a reduced incidence of flares was observed in both treatment arms over 1 year. Consequently, the between-arm difference was not as significant as that in our study. This reduction in the number of flares has particular significance, because the recent American College of Physicians guidelines cite a lack of RCT evidence showing the benefit of urate-lowering therapy for improving symptoms such as flares.

One limitation of our study is the high rate of subject discontinuation, although such a high rate of withdrawal is common in long-term gout trials. In our study, the overall discontinuation rates and the reasons for discontinuation were balanced between the febuxostat and placebo groups. The most common reasons for discontinuation in both groups were loss to follow-up and voluntary withdrawal. Although the rate of voluntary withdrawal was slightly higher in the placebo group, the most common reasons for voluntary withdrawal were work schedule conflicts and relocation, which were unrelated to the treatment that subjects received. For these reasons, it is unlikely that subject discontinuation would result in selection bias.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^113UohHc]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

The strengths of this study include the analysis of a randomized clinical trial with consistent measurement of adverse events and blood tests, alongside comprehensive concomitant medication data collection. However, there are several limitations. The study was not powered to detect rare adverse events due to colchicine, nor did the study design allow for analysis of the safety of higher doses of colchicine or longer durations. It is crucial to understand that there is a substantial variation in colchicine bioavailability in healthy individuals, with additional variation possible in people with gout due to polypharmacy and genetic variants in transporters, among other factors. Additionally, colchicine is widely distributed into cells and tissues, where its anti-inflammatory effects are exerted, compared to the much lower levels observed in plasma.

The inability to assess drug concentration in tissues where colchicine exerts its anti-inflammatory effects, such as leucocytes, and the inability to calculate the volume of distribution is a limitation. The samples collected did not allow for accurate calculation of the volume of distribution or area under the curve. There is wide variation in these parameters, as demonstrated in a small study in healthy volunteers, where total body colchicine clearance was approximately doubled and the area under the curve was approximately four times less for healthy individuals compared with older individuals. Finally, the sampling may have missed the true peak concentrations in some individuals.

### Gout: Will the "king of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured [^111dUatd]? BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout but one that has been brought to the center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient, based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL:

1. Associated benefits of reducing gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target.
2. The fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL.
3. The use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^111d2qs4]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome was the 'days to resolution' from enrollment to the resolution of an acute gout flare. Resolution was determined when the patient experienced an absence of joint pain, swelling, tenderness, and erythema. Flares were defined by one or more manifestations of these symptoms.

- **Secondary outcomes**: Clinical observers assessed joint pain using a 5-point Likert scale (0 = no pain, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe). Joint swelling was evaluated with a 4-point Likert scale (0 = no swelling, 1 = probable swelling, 2 = visible, 3 = bulging beyond the joint margins). Joint tenderness was measured using a 3-point Likert scale (0 = no tenderness, 1 = patient declares pain, 2 = patient declares pain and withdraws limbs). Lastly, joint erythema was assessed with a 3-point Likert scale (0 = normal, 1 = suspect, 2 = redness) at baseline.

	- Due to the rapid changes in inflammation associated with gout and the difficulty for subjects to visit the hospital every day during the first 7 days, joint inflammation was assessed in person on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Additionally, joint inflammation on days 2, 4, and 6 was assessed via video calls to ensure accuracy regarding the primary outcome (days to resolution). Other evaluated outcomes included serum uric acid (sUA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) at baseline and day 7, and adverse effects on day 28.

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^116xUkZR]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Comorbidities can affect the management of gout inflammation, often implying contraindications for drugs typically prescribed for acute gout flares. Colchicine and NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with renal failure; these patients are usually treated with intra-articular or systemic steroids. Furthermore, in cases of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, steroids can be poorly tolerated, particularly when repeated courses are necessary for patients experiencing frequent flares.

Research has highlighted the significant role of interleukin 1 (IL-1) in MSU crystal-triggered inflammation, leading to the proposal of IL-1 blockers for managing flares in patients with difficult-to-treat disease. Studies of the IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, suggest its off-label use is beneficial for patients who are resistant to or have contraindications to NSAIDs, colchicine, and steroids. Canakinumab, a long-lasting antibody to IL-1β, has been approved by the European Medical Agency, although not by the US Food and Drug Administration, following two RCTs comparing it with intra-muscular triamcinolone acetonide. The EULAR recommends considering IL-1 blockers for managing gout flares in patients with frequent flares and contraindications to NSAIDs, colchicine, and steroids (both oral and injectable). Infection remains a contraindication.

EULAR and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines suggest small doses of colchicine should be administered during the first six months of ULD therapy to mitigate ULD flare risk. Colchicine exposure has been observed to be up to two-fold higher in individuals with impaired renal function.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^116LFPLW]. Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

The response rate of patients with gout is about 80% within 7 days of using traditional non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with a maximum 'days to resolution' being 28 days. Hence, diclofenac was continued for 4 weeks in this study. We found that initiation of febuxostat administration during an acute gout flare did not prolong acute flares, and the rate of 'treat to target' was higher in the febuxostat group. This may increase patient compliance.

Two randomized clinical trials demonstrated that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. In one of the trials, allopurinol was initiated at 100 mg daily for the first 14 days and then increased to 200 mg daily for the next 14 days. The investigators observed that the days to resolution were 15.4 days for the allopurinol group and 13.4 days for the placebo group (P = 0.05). However, the sample cohort used in the study was small (17 in the placebo and 14 in the allopurinol group), and the type of anti-inflammatory drugs used in the study increased the experimental uncertainty. In addition, the days to resolution coincided with the time it takes for inflammation to spontaneously resolve during typical gout flares. In another published study, patients presenting within the first 7 days of onset of an acute gout flare were evaluated. The mean daily visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores did not differ significantly between the study groups at any point between days 1–10. However, allopurinol was initiated at 300 mg daily, which was not consistent with the…

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: A systematic review [^116ZEH7Y]. Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Gout is characterized by recurring flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/L (5–6 mg/dL), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the United States between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100,000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100,000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100,000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an aging population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics, and inpatient settings.

### Association between serum urate and flares in people with gout and evidence for surrogate status: A secondary analysis of two randomised controlled trials [^116EK3Q5]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Use of serum urate as a treatment target and outcome measure has become controversial in light of the 2017 American College of Physicians guidelines, which advocated a treat-to-symptom rather than a treat-to-target serum urate approach to gout management. The relevance of serum urate as a treatment target implies that achieving target serum urate is causally associated with improvements in patient-important outcomes, such as a reduction in the number of gout flares. The aim of this study was to assess the causal relationship between achieving target serum urate and the occurrence of gout flares.

- **Methods**: We analyzed individual patient-level data from two randomized trials on urate-lowering therapies in people with gout conducted in Nottingham, UK, and New Zealand. The study included participants randomly assigned to immediate dose escalation in the New Zealand study and all participants in the Nottingham study, consisting of a nurse-led gout care group and a general practitioner-led usual care group. Individuals who, on average, achieved a serum urate concentration of less than 6 mg/dL (0.36 mmol/L) based on data from 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline were defined as serum urate responders. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants having at least one gout flare, and the secondary outcome was the mean number of flares per participant per month, from 12 to 24 months after baseline, compared between serum urate responders and non-responders. In adjusted logistic regression models, serum urate at baseline and previous flare history (in the year preceding study entry) were considered.

### Colchicine for prophylaxis of acute flares when initiating allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis [^114EkSKA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Use of colchicine to prevent acute gout flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy is widely practiced despite a lack of proven benefit. We investigated whether colchicine administration during the initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and/or severity of acute gout flares.

- **Methods**: Patients starting allopurinol for crystal-proven chronic gouty arthritis were randomized to receive colchicine 0.6 mg orally twice daily or placebo in a randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects were followed for evidence of acute gout flares and remained on the study drug for 3 months beyond attaining a serum urate concentration of less than 6.5 mg/dl. Treatment arms were analyzed regarding the frequency of flares, likelihood of any flare or multiple flares, severity of flares on the visual analog scale (VAS), and length of flares in days.

- **Results**: Forty-three subjects were studied. Subjects treated with colchicine experienced fewer total flares (0.52 vs. 2.91, p = 0.008), fewer flares from 0 to 3 months (0.57 vs. 1.91, p = 0.022), fewer flares 3–6 months (0 vs. 1.05, p = 0.033), less severe flares as reported on VAS (3.64 vs. 5.08, p = 0.018), and fewer reoccurring flares (p = 0.001). Colchicine was well tolerated.

- **Conclusion**: Colchicine prophylaxis during the initiation of allopurinol for chronic gouty arthritis reduces the frequency and severity of acute flares and reduces the likelihood of reoccurring flares. Treating patients with colchicine during the initiation of allopurinol therapy for 6 months is supported by our data.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

- **Methods**: Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 3**: ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients following a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 4**: ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant use of other medications.

### Colchicine concentrations and relationship with colchicine efficacy and adverse events: Post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of colchicine for gout flare prophylaxis [^1142NHAX]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

The study design was a post hoc analysis of the 12-month "Is colchicine prophylaxis required with start-low go-slow allopurinol dose escalation in gout?" noninferiority randomized controlled trial (ACTRN 12618001179224). The methods and results of the full trial have been previously reported. Briefly, this was a one-year double-blind placebo-controlled noninferiority trial. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either colchicine at 0.5 mg daily or a placebo for the first six months. All participants commenced allopurinol, with doses adjusted monthly to achieve the target urate level of < 0.36 mmol/L.

The starting dose of allopurinol was 50 mg daily for those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and 100 mg daily for those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Allopurinol doses were increased monthly by 50 mg daily for participants with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and by 100 mg daily for those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² until maintaining the serum urate level < 0.36 mmol/L (6 mg/dL) for three consecutive visits. The study received ethical approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee, New Zealand (18/STH/156), and all participants provided written informed consent.

Participants had in-person evaluations every three months conducted by study coordinators, with monthly telephone assessments in between. Gout flares, defined as self-reported gout flares requiring treatment, were documented at each monthly assessment. Adverse events and serious adverse events were reported monthly and coded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0).

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^114DLNwn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, more specifically with respect to xanthine oxidase inhibitors, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend considering switching the first xanthine oxidase inhibitor to an alternate xanthine oxidase inhibitor agent. This is advised rather than adding a uricosuric agent in patients with gout who are taking their first xanthine oxidase inhibitor monotherapy at maximum-tolerated or FDA-indicated doses. This approach is suggested for those who are not achieving serum urate targets and/or have continuous frequent gout flares or nonresolving subcutaneous tophi.

### Relationship between gout flare states and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^1174qd5N]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Post hoc analyses of the 12-month "Is colchicine prophylaxis required with start-low go-slow allopurinol dose escalation in gout?" noninferiority randomized controlled trial were undertaken (ACTRN 12618001179224). Detailed methods and results of the full trial have been reported previously. In brief, this was a one-year double-masked, placebo-controlled, noninferiority trial with participants randomized 1:1 to colchicine 0.5 mg daily or placebo for the first six months. All participants were required to have had at least one gout flare in the preceding six months. All participants commenced allopurinol, increasing monthly to achieve a target urate level of < 0.36 mmol/L. The starting dose of allopurinol was 50 mg daily for those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and 100 mg daily for those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m². The allopurinol dose was increased monthly by 50 mg daily for those with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and 100 mg daily for those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m² until serum urate was < 0.36 mmol/L for three consecutive visits. Ethical approval was obtained from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee, New Zealand (18/STH/156), and all participants provided written informed consent.

Participants were seen every three months by study coordinators with intervening monthly telephone assessments.

- **Gout flares**: Defined as self-reported gout flares requiring treatment, were recorded at each assessment. Participants were categorized into three disease burden states at month 6 and month 12 as follows:

- **PASS**: No gout flares in the preceding six months; (ii)

### Interleukin-1 inhibitors for acute gout [^114gt9LN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Acute gout flares cause significant pain and disability, making it crucial to provide quick and effective pain relief. Traditional options for managing acute flares include colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and glucocorticoids.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of interleukin-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept) in acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE on 19 June 2013, applying no date or language restrictions. A hand search of abstracts from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (2009 to 2012) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (2009 to 2011) conferences and references of all included trials was performed. The Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization and the US National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry Platform were also screened.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized clinical trials (controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) assessing an interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra, canakinumab, or rilonacept) against placebo or another active treatment (colchicine, paracetamol, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, adrenocorticotropin hormone, a different interleukin-1 blocking agent, or a combination of any of the above) in adults with acute gout.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted the data. When appropriate, data were pooled in a meta-analysis.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^116eZv8m]. Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gout, specifically the management of acute flares, the BSR 2017 guidelines recommend considering joint aspiration and administering an intra-articular corticosteroid for patients with acute monoarticular gout.

For patients unable to tolerate NSAIDs or colchicine, or if an intra-articular injection is not feasible, consider administering a short course of oral corticosteroids or a single injection of an intramuscular corticosteroid as an alternative. This systemic therapy should also be considered for patients experiencing oligo- or polyarticular attacks of gout.

### Effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of acute and prevention of recurrent gout — a systematic review [^113sgmdg]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

To determine the evidence for the effectiveness of treatments for acute gout and the prevention of recurrent gout, seven electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of treatments for gout from their inception to the end of 2004. No language restrictions were applied. All randomized controlled trials of treatments routinely available for the treatment of gout were included. Trials of the prevention of recurrence were included only if patients who had had gout and had at least 6 months of follow-up were studied.

We found 13 randomized controlled trials of treatment for acute gout, two of which were placebo controlled. Colchicine was found to be effective in one study; however, the entire colchicine group developed toxicity. The only robust conclusion from studies of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is that pain relief from indometacin and etoricoxib are equivalent. We also found one randomized controlled trial, reported only as a conference abstract, concerning the prevention of recurrent gout.

The shortage of robust data to inform the management of a common problem such as gout is surprising. All of the drugs used to treat gout can have serious side effects. The incidence of gout is highest in the elderly population. It is in this group, who are at a high risk of serious adverse events, that we are using drugs of known toxicity. The balance of risks and benefits for the drug treatment of gout needs to be reassessed.

### Diagnosis of acute gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111NWXYW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis of gout. This guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several databases, from database inception to February 2016. Evaluated outcomes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate outcomes, such as results of laboratory and radiographic tests (serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis and radiographic or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision-making (additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management); short-term clinical, patient-centered outcomes, such as pain, joint swelling, and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with joint inflammation suspected to be gout. ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### Initiation of allopurinol at first medical contact for acute attacks of gout: a randomized clinical trial [^111kgTxe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Streamlining the initiation of allopurinol could result in a cost benefit for a common medical problem and obviate the perception that no treatment is required once acute attacks have resolved. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in patient daily pain or subsequent attacks with early versus delayed initiation of allopurinol for an acute gout attack.

- **Methods**: A total of 57 men with crystal-proven gout were randomized to receive allopurinol 300 mg daily or a matching placebo for 10 days. All subjects received indomethacin 50 mg three times per day for 10 days, a prophylactic dose of colchicine 0.6 mg twice per day for 90 days, and open-label allopurinol starting at day 11. Primary outcome measures were pain on the visual analogue scale (VAS) for the primary joint on days 1 to 10 and self-reported flares in any joint through day 30.

- **Results**: Based on 51 evaluable subjects (allopurinol in 26, placebo in 25), mean daily VAS pain scores did not differ significantly between study groups at any point between days 1 and 10. Initial VAS pain scores for allopurinol and placebo arms were 6.72 versus 6.28 (P = 0.37), declining to 0.18 versus 0.27 (P = 0.54) at day 10, with neither group consistently having more daily pain. Subsequent flares occurred in two subjects taking allopurinol and three subjects taking placebo (P = 0.60). Although urate levels decreased rapidly in the allopurinol group (from 7.8 mg/dL at baseline to 5.9 mg/dL at day 3), sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels did not differ between groups at any point.

- **Conclusions**: Allopurinol initiation showed no significant impact on pain levels or flare frequency in the acute setting compared to placebo.

### Effects of febuxostat in early gout: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^115m3D5f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease characterized by monosodium urate crystal deposition. Gout management guidelines recommend urate-lowering therapy for subjects with frequent flares, typically at least two flares in the preceding year. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as allopurinol or febuxostat, are recommended by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) as first-line urate-lowering therapy for subjects with gout. The benefits and risks of urate-lowering therapy for subjects with earlier disease are unknown. Recently, the conventional clinical treatment goal of achieving a significant reduction in the serum urate level has been brought into question by national guidelines that focused heavily on the improvement of gout symptoms. Thus, there is considerable need for clinical trial data showing clear associations between a reduction in urate levels and less frequent gout flares, which we examined in this study.

Acute self-limiting flares are the most common clinical presentation of gout, yet joint damage is a frequent complication. Both bone erosion and focal cartilage damage are closely associated with the presence of tophi within the joint. Although joint damage is typically a late feature of long-standing gout, longitudinal observational data have indicated that joint damage can occur in some subjects with early disease, and that development of bone erosion is associated with clinical evidence of increased urate crystal deposition.

In subjects with gout, the severity of joint damage can be evaluated by a number of different imaging techniques, including plain radiography and more advanced modalities. The integration of these techniques is crucial for assessing the extent of joint involvement and planning appropriate management strategies.

### What represents treatment efficacy in long-term studies of gout flare prevention? An interview study of people with gout [^113hNemE]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

The patient experience of gout flares is multidimensional, with several contributing factors including pain intensity, duration, and frequency. There is currently no consistent method for reporting gout flare burden in long-term studies. This study aimed to determine which factors contribute to patient perceptions of treatment efficacy in long-term studies of gout flare prevention.

- **Methods**: This study involved face-to-face interviews with people with gout using visual representations of gout flare patterns. Participants were shown different flare scenarios over a hypothetical 6-month treatment period that portrayed varying flare frequency, pain intensity, and flare duration. The participants were asked to indicate and discuss which scenario they believed was most indicative of successful treatment over time. Quantitative data relating to the proportion of participants selecting each scenario were reported using descriptive statistics. A qualitative descriptive approach was used to code and categorize the data from the interview transcripts.

- **Results**: Twenty-two people with gout participated in the semistructured interviews. All three factors — pain intensity, flare duration, and flare frequency — influenced participants' perceptions of treatment efficacy. However, a shorter flare duration was the most common indicator of successful treatment, with half of the participants (n = 11, 50%) selecting the scenario with a shorter flare duration over those with less painful flares.

- **Conclusion**: Flare duration, flare frequency, and pain severity are all taken into account by patients when assessing treatment efficacy in gout flare prevention studies.

### When underlying biology threatens the randomization principle - initial gout flares of urate-lowering therapy [^1117jaHD]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Flare is the dominant feature of gout and occurs because of the inflammatory response to monosodium urate crystals; prevention of gout flares should be the major goal of gout care. However, a paradoxical increase in the risk of flare following the initiation of urate-lowering therapy presents considerable challenges for proving the expected long-term benefits of flare prevention in clinical trials. Nevertheless, excluding from enumeration flares that occur in the initial post-randomization period (which can last several months to 1 year) can threaten the core benefits of randomization: the characteristics of the remaining participants can differ from those who were randomized, introducing potential bias from confounding (both measured and unmeasured); participants who drop out or die are excluded from the analysis, introducing potential selection bias; and, finally, ignoring initial flares underestimates participants' experience during the trial. This perspective discusses these issues and recommends measures that will allow for high-level evidence that preserves the randomization principle, to satisfy methodological scrutiny and generate robust evidence-based guidelines for gout care.

### Relationship between gout flare states and patient-reported outcomes after allopurinol initiation [^117GAi7G]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). High credibility.

Low disease activity (LDA) has been defined as "a useful target of treatment by both physician and patient, given treatment possibilities and limitations". Patient-acceptable symptom state (PASS) has been defined as the "value beyond which the patient feels well", indicating a tolerable level of symptoms for the individual. In 2021, Taylor et al. recruited 512 participants who answered questions about their gout flares, classifying them into one of three gout flare states:

- **Remission**: Defined as an affirmative response to the question, "Considering the number of attacks (flares) that you have had over the last [6 or 12] months, do you think your gout has gone away?"
- **LDA**: Defined as a negative response to the question, "Considering the number of attacks (flares) that you have had over the last [6 or 12] months, do you think you need more or stronger treatment?"
- **PASS**: Defined as an affirmative response to the question, "Considering the number of attacks (flares) that you have had over the last [6 or 12] months, would you say that your gout control is currently satisfactory?"

Participants also reported the hypothetical maximum number of flares they could experience over 6 and 12 months while still considering themselves to be in the associated disease activity state. Based on these data, participants in LDA reported a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 1 (0–2) flares, and those in PASS reported 0 (0–1) flares in a six-month period. Similar results were observed over a 12-month period, with participants in PASS reporting a median (IQR) of 0 (0–2) flares.

### Prophylaxis for acute gout flares after initiation of urate-lowering therapy [^113UXfU7]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This review summarizes evidence relating to prophylaxis for gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published in English from 1963 to 2013 using MeSH terms covering all aspects of prophylaxis for flares. Dispersion of monosodium urate crystals during the initial phase of deposit dissolution with ULT exposes the patient to an increased rate of acute flares that could contribute to poor treatment adherence. Slow titration of ULT might decrease the risk of flares. According to the most recent international recommendation, the two first-line options for prophylaxis are low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice a day) or low-dose NSAIDs such as naproxen 250 mg orally twice a day. They can be given for up to 6 months. If these drugs are contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) might be used.

Recently, reports for four trials described the efficacy of canakinumab and rilonacept, two IL-1 inhibitors, for preventing flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy. Prophylaxis for flares induced by ULT is an important consideration in gout management. Low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs are the recommended first-line therapies. Although no IL-1 blockers are approved as prophylactic treatment, this class of drug could become an interesting option for patients with gout with intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1135R2x9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. Additionally, we searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants' withdrawal due to adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardized form, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous.
