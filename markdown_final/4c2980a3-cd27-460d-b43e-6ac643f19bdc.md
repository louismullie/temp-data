## Question

Is bismuth quadruple therapy an appropriate treatment for sarcoidosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether bismuth-containing quadruple therapy is an appropriate treatment for sarcoidosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what bismuth quadruple therapy is actually indicated for. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology and standard-of-care treatments for sarcoidosis. Next, I will examine whether there is any mechanistic or evidentiary rationale for using bismuth quadruple therapy in sarcoidosis. After that, I should check guidelines and trials to see if any endorse this approach. Finally, I will consider exceptions such as investigational antimycobacterial regimens and weigh safety implications before synthesizing a conclusion [^114126Cx] [^111JQ3Hb].

> Let me first confirm what bismuth quadruple therapy actually is. Bismuth quadruple therapy combines a proton pump inhibitor with bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole, and it is recommended as a first-line eradication regimen for Helicobacter pylori, particularly where clarithromycin resistance is prevalent, with typical durations of 10–14 days and robust efficacy in randomized trials and contemporary guidelines [^11413aTx] [^115DrWWx] [^115ETLrT].

> Next, I should review what sarcoidosis is and how we treat it. Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammatory disease of unknown cause; when treatment is indicated, standard care is immunosuppression — first-line systemic corticosteroids, with second-line steroid-sparing agents (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate) and third-line biologics (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab), and many patients with mild disease need no therapy at all per guideline-based recommendations [^111JQ3Hb] [^112YsWHk] [^114sGSuR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the mechanistic rationale: bismuth quadruple therapy is antimicrobial and acid-suppressive, aimed at eradicating a specific gastric pathogen, whereas sarcoidosis is not established as a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics; its immunopathology is addressed by anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents rather than antibacterial regimens, which makes a mechanistic fit unlikely [^111JQ3Hb] [^113fFNCV].

> I will now examine whether authoritative guidelines or trials endorse bismuth quadruple therapy for sarcoidosis. Wait, let me verify across multiple sources: ERS 2021 sarcoidosis guidelines focus on corticosteroids and immunosuppressants/biologics; AAFP and BTS guidance similarly emphasize observation for mild disease and immunosuppression when needed; none list antimicrobial regimens, let alone bismuth quadruple therapy, for sarcoidosis management [^111JQ3Hb] [^112YsWHk] [^114sGSuR] [^111bKYAt].

> But wait, what if antibiotics have been studied in sarcoidosis? There is an investigational antimycobacterial regimen (CLEAR: levofloxacin, ethambutol, azithromycin, rifabutin) studied in a phase II randomized, placebo-controlled trial for chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis based on a mycobacterial-antigen hypothesis; however, that protocol is not bismuth quadruple therapy, remains experimental, and is not part of standard practice or guidelines for sarcoidosis [^117Fjmrj] [^111xhNhC] [^114LHJbH].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I briefly wondered if any antimicrobial approach might generalize to bismuth quadruple therapy, but I should double-check the distinction: CLEAR targets putative mycobacterial antigens with specific agents and immunologic endpoints, whereas bismuth quadruple therapy targets H. pylori with a completely different antibiotic combination and purpose; conflating these would be a mistake, and guidelines do not extrapolate CLEAR findings to endorse bismuth quadruple therapy in sarcoidosis [^117Fjmrj] [^114126Cx].

> I need to ensure we also weigh safety and appropriateness. Bismuth-containing regimens carry notable pill burden and adverse events in H. pylori trials, and bismuth products have specific toxicity cautions (e.g., neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity) when misused; using them off-target for sarcoidosis would expose patients to risk without evidence of benefit, which is not justifiable clinically [^112PHMda] [^112HoEYF].

> Let me synthesize the conclusion clearly. No, bismuth quadruple therapy is not an appropriate treatment for sarcoidosis, because sarcoidosis is managed with observation or immunosuppression depending on severity, there is no mechanistic or evidentiary basis for antibacterial bismuth quadruple therapy in this disease, and authoritative guidelines do not recommend it [^111JQ3Hb] [^112YsWHk] [^114sGSuR].

> For completeness, I should confirm the correct management pathway. In sarcoidosis, confirm organ involvement and activity, avoid treatment in asymptomatic low-risk pulmonary disease where spontaneous remission is common, initiate systemic corticosteroids for clinically significant or organ-threatening involvement, and add or transition to steroid-sparing agents or biologics in refractory or intolerant cases per ERS and primary-care guidance, reserving antimycobacterial regimens for research contexts rather than clinical practice [^111JQ3Hb] [^114sGSuR] [^112YsWHk].

Bismuth quadruple therapy is **not recommended for sarcoidosis** because it is **an antimicrobial regimen for H. pylori**, rather than an immunomodulatory treatment for granulomatous inflammation [^11413aTx]. Sarcoidosis management relies on **corticosteroids and steroid-sparing agents** (methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, and anti-TNF agents) [^111cZHky] [^111uT3Qu] [^111JQ3Hb]. There is **no evidence or guideline support** for bismuth quadruple therapy in sarcoidosis and therefore its use is inappropriate [^114sGSuR].

---

## Mechanism of action and clinical indications of bismuth quadruple therapy

Bismuth quadruple therapy is a **combination antimicrobial regimen** comprising:

- **Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)**: Reduces gastric acid secretion, enhancing antibiotic efficacy.

- **Bismuth compound**: Provides antimicrobial activity against H. pylori.

- **Tetracycline**: Broad-spectrum antibiotic effective against H. pylori.

- **Metronidazole**: Antibiotic effective against anaerobic bacteria and protozoa.

This regimen is primarily indicated for **H. pylori eradication**, particularly in cases of antibiotic resistance or prior treatment failure. It is not designed or indicated for **immunomodulatory or anti-inflammatory** use [^114126Cx] [^114npBT8].

---

## Pathophysiology of sarcoidosis and current treatment guidelines

Sarcoidosis is characterized by **non-caseating granulomas** driven by a dysregulated immune response involving T-helper 1 (Th1) cells and macrophages. The therapeutic goals are to suppress granulomatous inflammation, prevent organ damage, and improve quality of life [^113fFNCV].

Current treatment guidelines recommend a **stepwise approach** [^111JQ3Hb]:

- **First-line therapy**: Systemic corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) to suppress inflammation and granuloma formation [^111cZHky].

- **Second-line therapy**: Immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, and hydroxychloroquine, primarily used as steroid-sparing agents [^111uT3Qu].

- **Third-line therapy**: Biologic agents, particularly anti-TNF-alpha agents (e.g. infliximab, adalimumab), for refractory or severe cases [^111cZHky] [^112YsWHk].

---

## Evidence regarding bismuth quadruple therapy in sarcoidosis

A comprehensive literature review reveals **no clinical trials, case reports, or guidelines** supporting the use of bismuth quadruple therapy in sarcoidosis. The only remotely related study — the CLEAR trial — investigated a combination of antibiotics (levofloxacin, ethambutol, azithromycin, rifabutin) in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis and found no significant improvement in lung function or quality of life and reported significant adverse effects. Overall, **no evidence suggests** that bismuth quadruple therapy — targeting bacterial infections — would benefit sarcoidosis, a disease driven primarily by immune dysregulation rather than bacterial infection.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Bismuth quadruple therapy is associated with several **adverse effects**, including:

- **Gastrointestinal disturbances**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation [^112HoEYF].

- **Neurotoxicity**: Tremor, encephalopathy, particularly in patients with pre-existing neurological conditions or renal impairment [^112HoEYF].

- **Nephrotoxicity**: Risk of renal impairment, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction [^112HoEYF].

Given the lack of supporting evidence in sarcoidosis and the potential for significant adverse effects, the risks of bismuth quadruple therapy **outweigh any hypothetical benefits** in this context [^111iigXg].

---

## Comparison with standard sarcoidosis treatments

Standard sarcoidosis treatments, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, have well-established efficacy in controlling granulomatous inflammation and preventing organ damage [^111JQ3Hb]. By contrast, bismuth quadruple therapy has **no demonstrated efficacy** in sarcoidosis and carries a significant risk of adverse effects.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus statements **do not recommend** — or even mention — bismuth quadruple therapy as a treatment option for sarcoidosis. The absence of supporting evidence or clinical rationale underscores that this therapy is inappropriate for sarcoidosis management [^111JQ3Hb].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Bismuth quadruple therapy is **not recommended for sarcoidosis**. There is **no evidence of efficacy**, and it carries significant adverse-effect risks. Sarcoidosis management should continue to follow established guidelines, using corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologic therapies as appropriate [^11413aTx] [^111JQ3Hb].

### Nonsteroidal therapy of sarcoidosis [^111uT3Qu]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Understanding how to use disease-modifying antisarcoid drugs is essential for physicians treating patients with sarcoidosis. This review summarizes recent studies of medications used for sarcoidosis with a focus on nonsteroidal therapies. Studies from 2006 to 2013 were considered to update clinicians on the most relevant literature published over the last few years.

- **Recent findings**: Several recently published pieces of evidence have helped expand our ability to more appropriately sequence second-line and third-line therapies for sarcoidosis. For instance, methotrexate and azathioprine may be useful and well-tolerated medications as second-line treatments. Mycophenolate mofetil might have a role in neurosarcoidosis. TNF-α blockers and other biologics seem to be well-tolerated medications for the most severely affected patients.

- **Summary**: Corticosteroids remain the first-line therapy for sarcoidosis as many patients never require treatment or only necessitate a short treatment duration. Second-line and third-line therapies described in this article should be used in patients with progressive or refractory disease or when life-threatening complications are evident at the time of presentation.

### Current treatment of sarcoidosis [^111cZHky]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous systemic disease of unknown cause where the lung is the most frequently affected organ. Therapeutic management of the disease is challenging as clinical presentation and prognosis are very heterogeneous. In this review, we will summarize the main advances in sarcoidosis therapy.

- **Recent findings**: Sarcoidosis therapies are categorized into three lines: glucocorticoids (first line), immunosuppressants (second line), and biologics (third line). Recent glucocorticoid studies have reported similar efficacy with both high and low doses; however, side effects increase with higher doses. Regarding immunosuppressants, recent publications on mycophenolate and repository corticotropin injection (RCI) have provided more information on their use and efficacy. Additionally, new evidence has been published concerning the use of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNFα) agents in refractory cardiac sarcoidosis and neurosarcoidosis.

- **Summary**: Sarcoidosis therapy is constantly evolving, and new drugs have been added to the recommended treatments. However, extensive clinical trials are still necessary to optimize the recommendations.

### Phase II investigation of the efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis [^117Fjmrj]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled investigation compared a regimen of antimycobacterial therapy consisting of CLEAR versus a four-drug placebo regimen for 16 weeks. Each patient received 8 weeks of four drugs (induction phase), followed by 8 weeks of two drugs (consolidation phase). The primary endpoint was the absolute change in the percentage of predicted FVC, comparing baseline FVC versus FVC following the completion of 16 weeks of therapy. Secondary endpoints included changes in 6MWD, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, adverse events ranging from grades 1 to 5, and ESAT-6-specific immune responses.

The study protocol was approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board by Health Sciences Committee 1 (#121532) and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. This study was conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board reviewed the data throughout the study and performed the single planned interim analysis for safety and efficacy after 50 randomized patients had completed their 16-week regimen.

Patients were randomized to receive either an oral antibiotic regimen consisting of 8 weeks of daily levofloxacin (500 mg), ethambutol (1,200 mg for ≥ 50 kg; 800 mg for < 50 kg) once daily, azithromycin (250 mg), and rifabutin (300 mg) versus a daily identical-appearing four-drug placebo regimen.

### Vonoprazan-minocycline dual therapy as a first-line treatment of infection compared with empirical bismuth-containing quadruple therapy [^116dN1bM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Increasing antibiotic resistance compromises therapeutic options for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, especially in penicillin-allergic individuals.

- **Objectives**: This trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 14-day vonoprazan-minocycline (VM) dual therapy against bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (B-quadruple therapy) as initial treatment for H. pylori infection.

- **Design**: This study was a single-center, open-label, and non-inferiority randomized controlled trial.

- **Methods**: In this study, 240 individuals with H. pylori infection who had not received therapy were randomly assigned 1:1 to either the VM dual therapy group (vonoprazan 20 mg plus minocycline 100 mg, administered twice daily) or the B-quadruple therapy group (rabeprazole 10 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and bismuth potassium citrate 220 mg, all administered twice daily). The primary outcome was to evaluate the non-inferiority of eradication rates between the two groups. Secondary outcomes included assessments of adverse events (AEs) and compliance.

- **Results**: The eradication rates of the VM dual group and B-quadruple therapy group were 87.5% and 88.3%, respectively, by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; 92.1% and 94.6% by modified ITT (mITT) analysis; and 92.0% and 95.5% by per-protocol (PP) analysis. The eradication rates of the VM group were non-inferior to those of the B-quadruple therapy group in ITT, mITT, and PP analyses (one-sided p-values were 0.02, 0.01, and 0.02, respectively). The incidence of AEs was higher in the B-quadruple therapy group (28.3%) than in the VM group (16.7%, p = 0.03).

### 10-day versus 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^114p9yA9]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, our study found that the efficacy of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy was non-inferior to that of 14-day therapy, with both therapies achieving adequate efficacy of H. pylori eradication; however, the limitation of generalizability should be noted. Shortening the duration of bismuth quadruple therapy reduced the incidence of specific adverse effects and the cost of treatment. Accordingly, a 10-day duration is an appropriate choice for bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line H. pylori eradication in regions without high-level metronidazole-resistant strains.

### Hellenic consensus on infection [^116g9LRC]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

A concomitant non-bismuth quadruple regimen, for at least 10 days, is currently the preferred treatment option in Greece, providing acceptable eradication rates when used as first-line therapy.

- **Recommendation grade**: A
- **Evidence level**: 1b
- **Agreement level**: 100%

In recent years, non-bismuth quadruple regimens have shown higher efficacy in many trials and are currently a viable option, especially in countries like Greece where bismuth is not available. This finding was reproduced by two prospective randomized trials that compared concomitant and sequential regimens of the same duration (10 days). In both trials, a concomitant regimen reached an eradication rate of over 90% per protocol, which is significantly better compared to a sequential regimen, which had less than 85% efficacy. However, in another open-label controlled trial from Greece, even though the eradication rate for the concomitant regimen (over 90%) was higher compared to the sequential (88%), the difference did not reach statistical significance. A sub-analysis linking outcomes with antibiotic resistance showed that the concomitant regimen performed significantly better in metronidazole-resistant strains. This finding was also confirmed by a recent updated systematic review and meta-analysis comparing sequential vs. concomitant regimens. In addition, in one RCT, an optimized 14-day sequential regimen containing a high dose of a second-generation PPI (esomeprazole 40 mg bid) achieved high eradication rates in both per-protocol (93.9%) and intention-to-treat (91.3%) analyses in a population that included a broad spectrum of patients.

### Drug-induced comorbidities in patients with sarcoidosis [^113RKgBt]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

A pivotal aspect of sarcoidosis management is to regularly consider how to reduce the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of glucocorticoids (GCs). Besides reducing GC doses by combining them with immunosuppressive drugs, new strategies to optimize treatment need to be explored, including lifestyle changes, physical therapy, and dietary guidance. For instance, a flavonoid-rich diet in conjunction with GCs has been reported to increase the efficacy of the GC therapy, thereby reducing the dose required for an anti-inflammatory effect. The benefits of flavonoids and other antioxidant supplements may be related to the restoration of normal antioxidant levels in patients with sarcoidosis.

Pharmacogenomics (PGx) may lead to a more accurate drug management regime aimed at preventing unnecessary ADRs, as well as increasing the efficacy of the drug, and improving the quality of life (QoL). There is a need to develop trials investigating the role of genetic variations not only in disease susceptibility and predicting prognosis, but also in treatment response and in tailoring drug treatment to individual patients. Such investigations can help bridge the gap between 'personalized' and 'evidence-based' medicine. Improved recognition and a high index of suspicion are key to a proper diagnosis of ADRs and the prompt withdrawal of the offending drug. Awareness of these drug-induced (DI) disorders can play a vital role in preventing lengthy immunosuppressive therapies, as the main goal of management is drug cessation.

Polypharmacy is a growing iatrogenic condition precipitated by both medical necessity and external pressures. While the intention is to improve a patient's QoL and

### ERS clinical practice guidelines on treatment of sarcoidosis [^112YsWHk]. The European Respiratory Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of sarcoidosis, particularly in the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis, the ERS 2021 guidelines recommend considering the addition of infliximab to reduce skin lesions in patients. This recommendation applies to patients with cutaneous sarcoidosis who are treated with corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents and who continue to have cosmetically important active skin disease.

### 10-day versus 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: A randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^116b58uK]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

This was a randomised, open-label, and non-inferiority study conducted in two hospitals, namely National Cheng Kung University Hospital and Tainan Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Tainan, Taiwan. National Cheng Kung University Hospital is a medical centre that provides general and specific medical services and conducts a variety of education programs and research projects. Tainan Hospital is a regional teaching hospital, which provides general medical services and performs various tasks in public affairs. A schematic diagram of the study protocol is shown in the CONSORT flow chart of participants.

- **Participants**: Patients who were 18 years old or older and confirmed to be H. pylori-infected were enrolled in the study from August 3, 2020, to April 28, 2023. Both females and males, defined by biological attributes based on external body characteristics, were enrolled randomly. The presence of pre-treatment H. pylori infection was identified by one or more of the following tests: histological evidence of H. pylori infection from gastric biopsy, a positive rapid urease test, and a positive 13 C-urea breath test.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Patients were excluded if they had previously received H. pylori eradication therapy, had previous allergic reactions to any drugs in the bismuth quadruple therapy, had severe comorbidities, or were pregnant.

### Treatments for pulmonary sarcoidosis [^1123Jz3Y]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids, both oral and inhaled, are commonly used to treat pulmonary sarcoidosis. However, there is no consensus on when to start treatment, the appropriate dose of steroids, or the duration of treatment. Immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents, used in immunosuppressive doses, are employed alongside oral corticosteroids to manage multisystem and chronic sarcoidosis or as steroid-sparing agents.

We summarize findings from two Cochrane systematic reviews that have examined the efficacy of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive, and cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis. Studies of corticosteroids varied in outcome measures, dosage, and treatment duration. For many outcome measures, data could not be pooled for meta-analysis. Oral corticosteroids improved chest X-ray appearance over 3–24 months, with a notable improvement in the global score in one study. However, little evidence was found of improvement in lung function or any long-term disease-modifying effects. Follow-up data could not be analyzed. Inhaled corticosteroids improved symptoms in one small study but did not improve lung function or chest X-ray results. Steroid side effects were not well reported.

In the review of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents, no data could be combined for meta-analysis. Data on lung function, chest X-ray, and dyspnea were largely inconclusive. Methotrexate exhibited a steroid-sparing effect in one small study, while significant adverse events were associated with cyclosporine A, chloroquine, and pentoxifylline. Evidence from randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) supporting the use of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents is limited.

### Vonoprazan-minocycline dual therapy as a first-line treatment of infection compared with empirical bismuth-containing quadruple therapy [^116CgDoq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Patients enrolled and baseline characteristics**: As shown in Figure 1, 264 patients underwent eligibility screening from March 2024 to October 2024, with 240 participants subsequently randomized into either the VM dual group or the B-quadruple therapy group. Among these, six patients in the VM dual group and eight patients in the B-quadruple therapy group discontinued participation without completing C-UBT assessments. In addition, one patient in each of the two groups discontinued treatment (took less than 80% of tablets) but received C-UBT follow-up. Comparative analysis of demographic profiles and clinical parameters, as shown in Table 1, revealed no statistically significant variations among the baseline characteristics of both therapeutic groups.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori Working Group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^115DrWWx]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Statement 10: Bismuth quadruple therapy with a high-dose proton pump inhibitor, metronidazole, and tetracycline for 14 days is the recommended first-line treatment in the absence of clarithromycin susceptibility testing or where clarithromycin resistance has been confirmed. Although inferior eradication rates have been reported, doxycycline may be used if tetracycline is unavailable.

- **Recommendation**: Strong; quality of evidence: moderate.

If primary clarithromycin resistance is greater than 15% and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is not available before the prescription of first-line therapy, European guidelines recommend bismuth quadruple therapy [PPI, bismuth salt, metronidazole, and tetracycline] as the first-line treatment. Bismuth salts exhibit anti-Helicobacter pylori activity in vitro and no resistance to bismuth has yet been reported. Bismuth quadruple therapy containing metronidazole and tetracycline has been shown to consistently achieve first-line cure rates of over 90% in studies published by Hp-EuReg when prescribed independently or in the 3-in-1 capsule.

Irish Health Service Executive guidelines recommend doxycycline rather than tetracycline in bismuth quadruple therapy, as doxycycline is less costly and easier to access. It should be noted that lower eradication rates have been reported when doxycycline is given instead of tetracycline in bismuth quadruple therapy. The treatment duration of bismuth quadruple therapy should be 14 days unless locally validated and equally effective 10-day therapies are available.

The European guidelines suggest that non-bismuth quadruple concomitant therapy…

### Hybrid, high-dose dual and bismuth quadruple therapies for first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in Taiwan: A multicenter, open-label, randomized trial [^1138TVyW]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The study aimed to compare the efficacies and safety of 14-day hybrid therapy, 14-day high-dose dual therapy, and 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy in the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infections.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized trial, we recruited adult H. pylori-infected patients from 9 centers in Taiwan. Subjects were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 14-day hybrid therapy, 14-day high-dose dual therapy, or 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy. Eradication status was determined by the 13 C-urea breath test. The primary outcome was the eradication rate of H. pylori assessed in the intention-to-treat population.

- **Results**: Between August 1, 2018, and December 2021, 918 patients were randomly assigned in this study. The intention-to-treat eradication rates were 91.5% (280/306; 95% confidence interval [CI] 88.4%-94.6%) for 14-day hybrid therapy, 83.3% (255/306; 95% CI 77.9%-88.7%) for 14-day high-dose dual therapy, and 90.2% (276/306; 95% CI 87.8%-95.0%) for 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy. Both hybrid therapy (difference 8.2%; 95% CI 4.5%-11.9%; P = 0.002) and bismuth quadruple therapy (difference 6.9%; 95% CI 1.6%-12.2%; P = 0.012) were superior to high-dose dual therapy and were similar to one another. The frequency of adverse events was 27% (81/303) with 14-day hybrid therapy, 13% (40/305) with 14-day high-dose dual therapy, and 32% (96/303) with 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy. Patients receiving high-dose dual therapy had the fewest adverse events (both P < 0.001).

- **Discussion**: Fourteen-day hybrid therapy and 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy both demonstrated superior efficacy compared to high-dose dual therapy in first-line treatment, indicating their potential as effective options for eradication of H. pylori infections.

### Changes in chest roentgenogram of sarcoidosis patients during a clinical trial of infliximab therapy: comparison of different methods of evaluation [^115VPP2z]. Chest (2009). Low credibility.

The best method to interpret the chest roentgenogram and its sensitivity to detect the effect of treatment for sarcoidosis remains unclear. In a double-blind, randomized trial of infliximab for chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis, changes in serial chest roentgenograms were examined by radiologists who were blinded to the order or treatment.

- **Methods**: Chest roentgenograms were obtained at 0, 6, and 24 weeks of therapy with either placebo, 3 mg/kg infliximab, or 5 mg/kg infliximab. The films were reviewed in random order by two independent radiologists unaware of the treatment. The films were compared using two methods: the prespecified objective assessment, a scoring system previously proposed by Muers, and the post hoc assessment, a 5-point Likert scale global assessment between two films.

- **Results**: Of 138 patients enrolled in the study, chest roentgenograms for all studies were available on 130 patients. There was only fair agreement between the two radiologists in the original stage of the chest roentgenogram (weighted kappa = 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.54). For the Likert scale of global assessment of change, there was good agreement between the two readers (weighted kappa = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.71). There was good correlation between the two readers for the various components of the Muers score, especially the reticulonodular (R) score (R = 0.578; p < 0.05). The initial R score was positively correlated with improvement in FVC with infliximab therapy (R = 0.239; p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: Global assessment and the Muers scoring system were associated with good agreement.

### Hit-hard and early versus step-up treatment in severe sarcoidosis [^1149N8Pc]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids have been used for sarcoidosis for over 70 years and remain the most commonly used medication for systemic management. They are highly effective, inexpensive, easily titrated, work quickly, are perceived to require less monitoring than other agents, and are familiar to patients as well as prescribers. An added advantage of corticosteroids is that they can increase energy, enhance the sense of wellbeing, and ameliorate nonspecific symptoms such as arthralgias, at least when first prescribed. Additionally, corticosteroids have been studied in various sarcoidoses for the past six decades. As such, they are still deemed by expert opinion to be the first-line therapy for all forms of sarcoidosis that require systemic treatment. It should be noted that these opinions are based not on controlled data but rather on the absence of head-to-head comparisons between corticosteroids and other agents.

- **Early inclusion of steroid-sparing agents**: Sarcoidosis experts typically advocate for earlier inclusion of steroid-sparing agents in treatment algorithms. However, in practice, these agents are prescribed for much less than half of treatment-requiring patients. Long-term management often entails higher prednisone doses than the commonly referenced goal of less than 10 mg/day; for example, the mean daily dose in two randomized pulmonary sarcoidosis trials was approximately 13 mg/day. In an unselected cohort from our institution, the median treatment duration among all treated patients was 8 months.

### Corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy for cardiac sarcoidosis: A systematic review [^112ecE4n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Systematic review**: A total of 3,527 references were retrieved, of which 34 published studies fulfilled the criteria for this review. There were no randomized controlled trials.

- **Quality rating**: The quality rating was assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network 50 checklist for cohort studies. Only two studies were deemed to be good in quality, with 29 studies rated as fair, and three rated as poor. The average rating was 7.0, with the highest score being 11.

- **Patient demographics**: The included studies provided data on 1,297 patients (1,125 treated with corticosteroids, 235 treated with other immunosuppressant therapies, and 97 patients not treated with either). Pulmonary involvement was present in 57.9% of patients.

- **Corticosteroid and other immunosuppression therapies**: The number of patients receiving steroids, other immunosuppressant therapies, and no therapy is detailed in related tables.

- **Outcomes - Atrioventricular conduction recovery**: Thirteen studies reported outcomes regarding the recovery of high-grade atrioventricular block. In these studies, 178 patients received corticosteroids and/or other immunosuppressant therapies, whereas 21 did not.

### Eradication efficacy of modified dual therapy compared with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as a first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori [^111vyuPY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

This study assessed the effectiveness, adverse events, patient adherence, and costs of modified dual therapy compared with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for treating *Helicobacter pylori* infection in Chinese patients. We also sought to determine whether modified dual therapy could be used as an alternative first-line treatment for *H. pylori* infection.

A total of 232 *H. pylori*-infected, treatment-naive patients were enrolled in this open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups: the 14-day modified dual therapy group and the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy group. Eradication rates, drug-related adverse events, patient compliance, and drug costs were compared between the two groups.

The modified dual therapy group achieved eradication rates of 87.9%, 91.1%, and 91.1% as determined by the intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and modified intention-to-treat analyses, respectively. The eradication rates were similar compared with the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy group: 89.7%, 91.2%, and 90.4%. In addition, modified dual therapy ameliorated variations in the CYP2C19, IL-1B-511, and *H. pylori* VacA genotypes. There were no significant differences in the compliance rates between the two groups. The modified dual therapy group exhibited significantly fewer overall side effects compared with the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy group (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the cost of medications in the modified dual therapy was lower compared with that in the bismuth-containing quadruple therapy.

### Corticosteroid and immunosuppressant therapy for cardiac sarcoidosis: A systematic review [^111xSY5s]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The data has significant limitations. There were no randomized controlled trials, and all studies were rated as poor or fair quality. Most importantly, there were a limited number of nontreated patients. Treatment regimens varied, and outcomes were not stratified by therapy subtype. Additionally, some studies had a follow-up duration of less than one year, making it difficult to assess the durability of the corticosteroid response.

### Evolution of the use, effectiveness and safety of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for infection between 2013 and 2021: results from the European registry on management (Hp-EuReg) [^114DyNVw]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

Trends in the use of bismuth-based therapy in Europe

After the commercialization of ScBQT in Europe in 2013, there was a progressive increase in BQT prescription, primarily due to the use of the single-capsule scheme. The use of BQT peaked in 2018 when 50% of the reported treatments were bismuth therapies; thereafter, the rate of bismuth therapies slightly decreased compared to non-bismuth options and remained stable at around 40% from 2019 to 2021.

In 2018, 19% of the treatments were ScBQT, and 31% were NScBQT. By the end of the study period, the prescription rates of ScBQT and NScBQT were nearly the same, representing 17.8% and 21% of all treatments, respectively.

Regarding geographical distribution, the greatest increase in BQT prescriptions occurred in Southwestern Europe, accounting for 75% of all treatments in 2018. ScBQT was the main treatment in this region (60%), while NScBQT was more frequent in Eastern Europe (60% in 2018 and 40% in 2021).

Both the rate and type of BQT prescriptions varied widely across European countries.

### SPL drug information for bismuth subsalicylate [^112HoEYF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of bismuth subsalicylate PO:

- **Constipation, diarrhea**: Use caution with a history of gastrointestinal disorders or those prone to gastrointestinal disturbances. Monitor patients closely for gastrointestinal symptoms while on bismuth hydrochloride and provide dietary recommendations for managing constipation or diarrhea. If gastrointestinal side effects like constipation or diarrhea occur, adjust fluid intake, offer dietary changes, and consider symptomatic treatments as appropriate.

- **Nephrotoxicity**: Use extreme caution with impaired renal function. Use bismuth hydrochloride cautiously in patients with pre-existing kidney dysfunction and monitor renal function regularly during treatment. Discontinue the medication, provide appropriate renal support, and consult a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.

- **Tremor, encephalopathy**: Use extreme caution with a history of neurological disorders, as well as those who are at risk of neurotoxicity. Administer bismuth hydrochloride within recommended doses and duration, and closely monitor patients for signs of neurotoxicity. Promptly discontinue the medication, provide supportive care, and consult with a neurologist for further assessment and management.

### Drug-induced comorbidities in patients with sarcoidosis [^115maMXa]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The clinical impact of pharmacologic sarcoidosis treatment is significant. The major goals in treating sarcoidosis are lowering the morbidity and mortality risk and/or improving quality of life (QoL). The drugs currently used to treat various manifestations of sarcoidosis — often immunosuppressive — are liable to cause ADRs and sometimes substantial comorbidities. These comorbidities further increase the burden of this disease and affect the QoL. The ADR profile associated with the treatment of sarcoidosis varies greatly from one patient to the next, as does the efficacy of treatments, so a simple treatment algorithm that works for all patients is not feasible. In general, there are three lines of therapy for sarcoidosis.

### First-line therapies for eradication: A critical reappraisal of updated guidelines [^113t8Ww3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Bismuth-based quadruple therapies undeniably, the 14-day triple therapy with bismuth salts, tetracycline, and metronidazole was the first therapy to achieve consistently high H. pylori eradication rates. This therapy was introduced and largely used in the second part of the 1980s. The decline of such a regimen was mainly due to its intrinsic complexity (large number of tablets, q.i.d. administration, frequent side effects) and the rise of simpler and more tolerable triple therapies.

In order to improve compliance with the bismuth-based triple therapy, a PPI has been added, aiming to reduce side effects and shorten therapy length to only 4–7 days, thus configuring the bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Unfortunately, some delivery problems have arisen with bismuth salts in Europe and tetracycline in the US, which has greatly limited the use of quadruple therapy in several countries over the last decade.

The interest in such a regimen has recently been renewed by the marketing of a novel, three-in-one capsule (Pylera®), first proposed in 2001, with each pill containing bismuth subcitrate potassium (140 mg), metronidazole (125 mg), and tetracycline (125 mg). The bismuth-based quadruple therapy is included among the recommended first-line therapies in the European, US, Canadian, and Chinese guidelines. Surprisingly, such a therapy was also suggested as an alternative first-line therapy in the Italian guidelines published in 2015, which was before the marketing of these tablets (2016 in Italy) and without any data from Italian trials, the first studies only now being available.

### Efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil in sarcoidosis [^1178Byat]. Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Immunosuppressive (IS) therapy is indicated to treat progressive sarcoidosis, but randomized controlled trials to guide physicians in the use of steroid-sparing agents are lacking. The aim of this retrospective study was to examine the role of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as an alternative therapy in the treatment of sarcoidosis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review of all patients who had been prescribed MMF between January 2008 and October 2011 was conducted. Patients with insufficient data or who had another IS therapy initiated concomitantly with MMF, including prednisone, were excluded. Physiological data obtained at the time MMF therapy was initiated as well as six and twelve months before and after therapy was extracted. Longitudinal analyses of the effect of MMF on changes in pulmonary function at MMF start, 6 months, and 12 months pre and post MMF therapy were conducted.

- **Results**: 37 out of 76 patients met our inclusion/exclusion criteria. There were no statistically significant changes in PFT measurements pre and post MMF therapy. We found a trend (p = 0.07) towards improvement in DLCO 12 months pre and post MMF in patients who were started on MMF due to intolerance to previous IS therapy compared to those who were unresponsive to their previous IS therapy. We also noted a reduction in prednisone dose in those treated with MMF.

- **Conclusion**: MMF appears to offer no extra benefit to sarcoidosis patients unresponsive to previous steroid-sparing agents, but may be beneficial in patients intolerant to their previous steroid-sparing agent. Additional studies are necessary to further investigate these findings.

### The treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis [^113WpS5q]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

This manuscript offers an approach to the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis based on available information. The treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis is not mandatory, as the disease may be self-limiting and therapy is often associated with significant drug side effects. The decision to treat rests predominantly on the presence of significant symptoms or functional limitation. Corticosteroids are the drug of choice. Alternative agents to corticosteroids may be useful primarily as corticosteroid-sparing agents.

### Clinical trials in pulmonary sarcoidosis [^1124H6D5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Several new agents have been investigated in sarcoidosis. As the outcome measures in these trials have varied, it is often difficult to compare different treatment regimens or to combine clinical trials of the same regimen. This review assesses the various potential endpoints, including physiologic, chest imaging, and health-related quality of life.

- **Recent findings**: Individual endpoints in pulmonary sarcoidosis trials have been studied and compared to responses from several drugs. A panel of sarcoidosis experts was convened to enumerate the various potential endpoints and also voted on the relative importance of these endpoints as primary and secondary endpoints in sarcoidosis clinical trials.

There are several potential endpoints in clinical trials. These endpoints may also prove useful in clinical practice.

### 10-day versus 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^113VM62t]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

The European Registry on Helicobacter pylori management (Hp-EuReg), an international multicentre prospective non-interventionist registry, reported that prolonging treatment duration was observed in Europe from 2013 to 2018. Moreover, the eradication rates in 10-day and 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line empirical treatments were respectively 93% and 88%, as determined by both PP and modified ITT analyses. Our study is the first randomised trial to demonstrate that 10- and 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy with standard doses have similar eradication efficacy as a first-line anti-H. pylori treatment. Although 10-day therapy provided a smaller amount of medication than 14-day therapy did, the eradication efficacy was non-inferior. Both regimens achieved high efficacy of H. pylori eradication. Few studies have conducted head-to-head comparisons of the efficacy of 10- and 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy. Previous systematic review and meta-analyses found that there is no significant difference in eradication rate between the regimens with different treatment durations.

However, neither the antibiotics nor doses were consistent in these studies; moreover, most studies were not conducted on patients with treatment-naïve. Patients with treatment-naïve and those with a history of treatment failure have distinct characteristics. The observed trend in second-line treatment may not be applicable to first-line treatment. To our best knowledge, only one study compared the efficacy between 10- and 14-day therapy for first-line treatment; however, it used a twice-daily regime.

### Concomitant, bismuth quadruple, and 14-day triple therapy in the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori: a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial [^115ETLrT]. Lancet (2016). High credibility.

Whether concomitant therapy is superior to bismuth quadruple therapy or 14-day triple therapy for the first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection remains poorly understood. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of 10-day concomitant therapy, 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy, and 14-day triple therapy in the first-line treatment of H. pylori.

- **Methods**: In this multicentre, open-label, randomised trial, we recruited adult patients (aged > 20 years) with H. pylori infection from nine medical centres in Taiwan. Patients who had at least two positive tests from the rapid urease test, histology, culture, or serology or who had a single positive 13 C-urea breath test for gastric cancer screening were eligible for enrolment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either concomitant therapy (lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, clarithromycin 500 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg, all given twice daily) for 10 days; bismuth quadruple therapy (bismuth tripotassium dicitrate 300 mg four times a day, lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times a day, and metronidazole 500 mg three times a day) for 10 days; or triple therapy (lansoprazole 30 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, and clarithromycin 500 mg, all given twice daily) for 14 days. A computer-generated permuted block randomisation sequence with a block size of 6 was used for randomisation, and the sequence was concealed in an opaque envelope until the intervention was assigned. Investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the eradication frequency of H. pylori with first-line therapies.

### Update on the first-line treatment of infection in areas with high and low clarithromycin resistances [^111iigXg]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

The Maastricht V/Florence consensus report recommends bismuth-containing quadruple therapy with PPI, bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline as the choice treatment for H. pylori infection in areas of either low or high clarithromycin resistance. A recent network meta-analysis of H. pylori regimens demonstrated that 10–14 days of bismuth quadruple therapy is superior to 7-day clarithromycin triple therapy (85% versus 73%).

Currently, the optimal treatment duration of bismuth-containing quadruple therapy remains unclear. The efficacy of bismuth quadruple therapy for 1–3 days, 4 days, or 7 days was less effective than when given for 10–14 days. Ten to fourteen days of bismuth quadruple therapy achieves an eradication rate of 85% or more, even in areas with a high prevalence of metronidazole resistance. A large randomized trial by Malfertheiner and colleagues has demonstrated that 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy was superior to 7-day standard triple therapy in Europe. Another multicenter randomized trial from Taiwan also showed that 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy was preferable to 14-day triple therapy as the first-line treatment in the face of rising prevalence of clarithromycin resistance.

However, the frequency of adverse events with bismuth quadruple therapy lasting 10–14 days is extremely high, ranging from 48% to 67% in large randomized trials. Additionally, the complex administration of bismuth quadruple therapy might reduce patient adherence. A recent randomized controlled trial also documented that 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy had comparable efficacy in the initial treatment phase.

### ERS clinical practice guidelines on treatment of sarcoidosis [^111JQ3Hb]. The European Respiratory Journal (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of sarcoidosis, particularly the management of pulmonary sarcoidosis, the ERS 2021 guidelines recommend initiating systemic corticosteroids to improve and/or preserve forced vital capacity (FVC) and quality of life (QoL) in untreated patients with significant involvement from pulmonary sarcoidosis who are at a higher risk of future mortality or permanent disability.

### Hit-hard and early versus step-up treatment in severe sarcoidosis [^113xWrPq]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In the context of rheumatology and inflammatory bowel disease, the concept of hit-hard and early treatment has been explored with promising outcomes. For Crohn's disease, which is a granulomatous inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the use of top-down versus step-up treatment has been a focus of research over the last decade. Notably, combining immunomodulators and biologicals has shown promising results for severe cases. A large meta-analysis favored the combination of biologic and azathioprine therapy as an induction therapy over the use of immunosuppressants alone. Additionally, earlier introduction of TNFi (within 3 months of diagnosis) correlated with a slower progression of long-term bowel damage. The British Society of Gastroenterology consensus guidelines recommend escalating to an alternative agent in refractory patients after 8 weeks of therapy. They also suggest earlier use of biologic agents for patients with poor prognostic features. Importantly, the British Guideline strongly recommends against monotherapy with corticosteroids for maintenance of remission due to therapeutic toxicity.

In a similar vein, the management philosophy for rheumatoid arthritis emphasizes early disease control. The European League Against Rheumatism advocates for immediate initiation of methotrexate or another immunomodulator, with or without corticosteroids, to reduce the risk of permanent joint damage from the time of diagnosis. If improvement is not observed after 3 months, the introduction of a biologic is advised. If the established treatment target is still not reached after 6 months, a further step to introduce a TNFi biologic is recommended.

### Management of advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis [^112XgybY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The term "advanced sarcoidosis" is used for forms of sarcoidosis with a significant risk of loss of organ function or death. Advanced sarcoidosis often involves the lung and is described as "advanced pulmonary sarcoidosis" (APS), which includes advanced pulmonary fibrosis, associated complications such as bronchiectasis and infections, and pulmonary hypertension. Although APS affects a small proportion of patients with sarcoidosis, it is the leading cause of poor outcomes, including death. Here we review the major patterns of APS, with a focus on the management and potential approaches for improved outcomes for this most serious sarcoidosis phenotype.

### Phase II investigation of the efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis [^111xhNhC]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Adults aged ≥ 18 years with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, as defined by the 1999 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society/World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders statement on sarcoidosis, were eligible for enrollment. Participants were selected based on the demonstration of pulmonary disease progression according to at least one of the following criteria:

1. Decline of absolute percentage of predicted FVC or diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of at least 5% on serial measurements over 24 months.
2. Radiographic progression in chest imaging on side-by-side comparison.
3. Decline in dyspnea score, as measured by using the Transition Dyspnea Index.

Prior to randomization, participants were assessed for peripheral immune responses to ESAT-6 or evidence of peripheral anergy, as defined by the absence of responses to phytohemagglutinin. If either of these conditions were present, the subject was enrolled. Finally, participants were required to have evidence of parenchymal or nodal disease on chest radiograph. Site-specific pulmonologists who were unaffiliated with the CLEAR trial read all site-specific lung function tests.

### 10-day versus 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: A randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^112PHMda]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Female sex is a factor of eradication failure with concomitant therapy or sequential therapy, but not of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy. In this study, sex-based analyses confirmed that the efficacy of 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy was non-inferior to that of 14-day therapy in male sex. However, the issue of whether 10-day therapy is non-inferior in female sex is inconclusive because our study was not designed to test this hypothesis; the statistical power is insufficient in the subgroup analysis. Future studies focusing on the sex effect are needed.

Poor adherence to medications is another predictor for eradication failure with bismuth quadruple therapy. Bismuth quadruple therapy has a high pill burden and a complex treatment course; thus, medication tolerability and adherence should be considered. In this study, adverse events were assessed by a physician and a formal questionnaire after the end of treatment; however, the questionnaire could not accurately determine the timing of adverse effect occurrence. The incidence of adverse effects seems to be correlated with the treatment dose and duration of bismuth quadruple therapy. Fourteen-day bismuth quadruple therapy had a higher incidence of adverse effects compared with 7- or 10-day therapy. Nevertheless, medication adherence was not significantly affected by adverse effects. Our study also showed that both 10- and 14-day bismuth quadruple therapies have high medication adherence rates, which are consistent with previous studies. Moreover, both therapies achieved a good eradication rate (≥ 90% treatment success).

### Corticosteroid refractory sarcoidosis [^111Gigq8]. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A sarcoidosis patient may be refractory to corticosteroid therapy. This may be because corticosteroids are ineffective in relieving the sarcoidosis patient's symptoms or dysfunction, or because the clinician has determined that the risks of corticosteroids outweigh their benefits. Interestingly, when corticosteroids truly fail to improve a sarcoidosis patient's condition, it is very rarely because of failure of the drug as an anti-granulomatous agent; rather, it is usually because the patient's symptoms were unrelated to active sarcoid granulomas.

In this manuscript, we review the causes of corticosteroid refractory sarcoidosis. The clinician should consider these causes when confronted with a sarcoidosis patient who is either not responding to corticosteroids, developing corticosteroid side effects, or is at significant risk of developing such side effects. We believe that determining the cause of corticosteroid refractory sarcoidosis may aid clinicians in optimizing the care of sarcoidosis patients and assist clinical researchers in appropriately stratifying patients for clinical trials.

### Comparative study of allicin-containing quadruple therapy vs. bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection: a prospective randomized study [^112YEGDS]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Bismuth has antimicrobial activity and can improve the efficacy of triple Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) therapy. Allicin, when added to conventional therapy for H. pylori infection, also enhances H. pylori eradication rates. Thus, this study aims to evaluate and compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of allicin-containing quadruple therapy versus bismuth-containing quadruple therapy, and to investigate the factors affecting the eradication rates.

- **Methods**: Two hundred twenty H. pylori-infected patients were included and randomly (1:1) assigned to 14-day quadruple therapy: ilaprazole (5 mg bid), doxycycline (100 mg bid), and furazolidone (100 mg bid) with an allicin soft capsule (40 mg of DATS tid) (IDFA) or colloidal bismuth tartrate (220 mg of elemental bismuth bid) (IDFB). Eradication was confirmed by urea breath tests. Symptom improvement, adverse events, and adherence were assessed by a questionnaire.

- **Results**: In the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis, the eradication rates for IDFA and IDFB groups were 87.5% (70/80) vs. 86.3% (69/80, P = 0.815) and 91.9% (68/74) vs. 91.8% (67/73, P = 0.980) as first-line therapies; 83.3% (25/30) vs. 83.3% (25/30, P = 1) and 89.3% (25/28) vs. 88.9% (24/27, P = 1) as second-line therapies. Symptom improvement rates were 96.1% and 97.0% for IDFA and IDFB (P = 1). The adverse event rates were 10.9% in IDFA and 14.5% in IDFB groups (P = 0.418). Nausea occurred more frequently in IDFB than IDFA (1.8% vs. 8.2%, P = 0.030). Smoking and sharing utensils significantly affected the efficacy.

- **Conclusion**: Allicin-containing quadruple therapy demonstrates comparable efficacy to bismuth-containing therapy for H. pylori eradication.

### Cytotoxic agents in sarcoidosis: Which one should we choose [^111B1bdg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease that affects multiple organs. Its therapeutic management is very challenging due to the heterogeneity in disease manifestation and clinical course, as well as the potential side effects of the immunosuppressive therapy. An overview of presently available second-line and third-line systemic agents is provided.

Recent findings show that because curative treatment is currently not available for sarcoidosis, nonspecific immunosuppression with prednisone remains the first-choice therapy. However, since chronic use of corticosteroids is accompanied by severe adverse events, timely implementation of appropriate steroid-sparing cytotoxic agents is important. Commonly prescribed second-line agents in sarcoidosis are methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, and hydroxychloroquine. Nevertheless, the evidence supporting their use is limited. Third-line treatment options, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors infliximab and adalimumab and the experimental therapeutic rituximab, are currently reserved for patients refractory to standard therapy.

A better insight into the advantages and disadvantages of second-line and third-line treatments is important. The long-term effects of immunosuppressive agents, the optimal starting and maintenance dosages, and the best interval and discontinuation regimens should be elucidated. Identified associations of polymorphisms with treatment response suggest a step towards personalized medicine. Future research should focus on the role of pharmacogenetic and phenotypic predictors of treatment outcomes.

### Vonoprazan-minocycline dual therapy as a first-line treatment of infection compared with empirical bismuth-containing quadruple therapy [^116VaPxF]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

Increasing antibiotic resistance compromises therapeutic options for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, especially in penicillin-allergic individuals. This trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 14-day vonoprazan–minocycline (VM) dual therapy against bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (B-quadruple therapy) as the initial treatment for H. pylori infection.

This study was a single-center, open-label, and non-inferiority randomized controlled trial. In this study, 240 individuals with H. pylori infection who had not received therapy were randomly assigned 1:1 to either the VM dual therapy group (vonoprazan 20 mg plus minocycline 100 mg, administered twice daily) or the B-quadruple therapy group (rabeprazole 10 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and bismuth potassium citrate 220 mg, all administered twice daily). The primary outcome was to evaluate the non-inferiority of eradication rates between the two groups. Secondary outcomes included assessments of adverse events (AEs) and compliance.

The eradication rates of the VM dual group and B-quadruple therapy group were 87.5% and 88.3%, respectively, by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; 92.1% and 94.6% by modified ITT (mITT) analysis; and 92.0% and 95.5% by per-protocol (PP) analysis. The eradication rates of the VM group were non-inferior to those of the B-quadruple therapy group in ITT, mITT, and PP analyses (one-sided p-values were 0.02, 0.01, and 0.02). The incidence of AEs was higher in the B-quadruple therapy group (28.3%) than in the VM group (16.7%).

The study on VA dual therapy for H. pylori was published by Tian-Lian Yan and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Am J Gastroenterol. This study is related to the disease of Helicobacter pylori infection.

- **Trial question**: Is short-course vonoprazan/amoxicillin dual therapy noninferior to standard bismuth-based quadruple therapy in patients with H. pylori infection?

- **Study design**: Multicenter, open-label, RCT.

- **Population**: 314 patients (180 female, 134 male). The inclusion criteria were treatment-naïve patients with H. pylori infection.

- **Key exclusion criteria**: Included administration of antibiotics, bismuth, or acid inhibitor 4 weeks before inclusion; pregnancy or lactation; allergy to study drugs; history of gastrectomy; gastric malignancy; gastroduodenal ulcer with recent hemorrhage or signs of hemorrhage within 4 weeks.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 157 VA-dual therapy (vonoprazan/amoxicillin dual therapy for 10 days)
	- n = 157 B-quadruple therapy (bismuth-based quadruple therapy for 14 days).

- **Primary outcome**: Difference not exceeding the non-inferiority margin in H. pylori eradication rate in the intention-to-treat analysis (86% vs. 89.2%; ARD -3.2, 95% CI -10.5 to 4.1).

- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant difference in H. pylori eradication rate in the modified intention-to-treat analysis.

### Evolving management of sarcoidosis in the real world [^1154N8nZ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The management of sarcoidosis has relied mainly on glucocorticoids for over 80 years. Innumerable review articles, as well as all guidelines, position systemic steroids as first-line therapy for moderate and severe sarcoidosis. Despite accumulating evidence of short-term (mostly overt) and long-term (often unrecognized) toxicities of steroids, and the example of specialists treating diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, the treatment paradigm for sarcoidosis has remained stubbornly affixed to steroids.

In 2025, there is now compelling evidence to relegate steroids to a lesser role in the management of sarcoidosis. Nonsteroid agents, especially methotrexate, can be used as first-line therapy for many patients.

As steroid use diminishes, the development and implementation of additional steroid-sparing agents will assume increased importance.

### The management of sarcoidosis in the 2020s by the primary care physician [^113PhBj7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Sarcoidosis is an idiopathic granulomatous disease that occurs worldwide and can affect any organ. Because the presenting symptoms of sarcoidosis are not specific to the disease, the primary care physician is usually the first provider to assess these patients. In addition, patients who have previously been diagnosed with sarcoidosis are usually followed longitudinally by primary care physicians. Therefore, these physicians are often the first to address sarcoidosis patient symptoms related to exacerbations of the disease and first observe complications of sarcoidosis medications. This article outlines the approach to the evaluation, treatment, and monitoring of sarcoidosis patients by the primary care physician.

### 10-day versus 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: a randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^11413aTx]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) causes dyspeptic symptoms, peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. H. pylori eradication therapy reduces the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and peptic ulcer disease. The eradication rates of H. pylori have been falling in most regions of the world due to the rise in antimicrobial resistance rates.

Bismuth quadruple therapy, which consists of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole, is currently the recommended first-line therapy for H. pylori infection. However, the optimum duration is unknown, and the level of evidence for treatment duration is very low. Longer treatment durations of H. pylori eradication have been shown to achieve higher cure rates. Sequential therapy extending from 10 days to 14 days potentially has better eradication efficacy.

Nevertheless, previous studies found that 10-day standard bismuth quadruple therapy achieved high efficacy for first-line H. pylori eradication, as determined by intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses (≥ 90%) and per-protocol (PP) analyses (≥ 95%); thus, extending bismuth quadruple therapy from 10 days to 14 days might have a limited effect on the eradication rate. However, females have higher antibiotic resistance rates in H. pylori infection than males do. It is uncertain whether shorter antibiotic courses have differences by sex in eradication efficacy.

There are concerns that a longer duration would result in more adverse events, poorer medication adherence, and higher costs.

### New advances in the management of pulmonary sarcoidosis [^113fFNCV]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a highly variable granulomatous multisystem syndrome affecting individuals in the prime years of life, with greater frequency and severity in economically disadvantaged populations. The diagnosis, assessment, and management of pulmonary sarcoidosis have evolved with the adoption of new technologies and therapies. Transbronchial needle aspiration guided by endobronchial ultrasound has replaced mediastinoscopy in many centers.

Advanced imaging modalities, such as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scanning, along with the widespread availability of magnetic resonance imaging, have led to more sensitive assessment of organ involvement and disease activity. Although several new insights into the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis exist, no new therapies have been specifically developed for this disease. The proposed use of immunosuppressive medications for sarcoidosis has been extrapolated from other disease states; various novel pathways are currently under investigation as therapeutic targets.

Coupled with the growing recognition of corticosteroid toxicities for managing sarcoidosis, the use of corticosteroid-sparing anti-sarcoidosis medications is likely to increase. In addition to treating granulomatous inflammation, recognition and management of the non-granulomatous complications of pulmonary sarcoidosis are needed for optimal outcomes in patients with advanced disease.

### New therapeutic options in sarcoidosis [^115yAtNf]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of sarcoidosis treatment but are associated with significant toxicities and impaired quality of life. Second-line and third-line treatments include hydroxychloroquine or immunosuppressants, such as methotrexate, azathioprine, leflunomide, and mycophenolate mofetil, and anti-TNF-α agents like infliximab and adalimumab, respectively. Recent identification of key cellular pathways in sarcoidosis pathogenesis has led to the development of new therapeutic strategies described in this review.

- **Recent findings**: JAK inhibitors, mainly tofacitinib, exhibited encouraging results in case reports, small retrospective series, and two prospective open-label trials for skin and pulmonary sarcoidosis. mTOR inhibitors demonstrated efficacy in one cross-over study on skin involvement. Promising findings were obtained with efzofitimod, an inhibitor of the neuropilin-2 receptor, in a pilot study on pulmonary sarcoidosis; however, this needs to be confirmed. Other drugs with potentially relevant mechanisms of action have been used in case reports or small series, or are under investigation: CTLA-4 inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, GM-CSF inhibitors, PDE-4 inhibitors, and statins. There is very little data available on antifibrotic agents for fibrotic pulmonary sarcoidosis.

Despite many challenges, well-designed studies are warranted to investigate new therapeutic options in sarcoidosis, particularly in patients with refractory forms or those experiencing unacceptable side effects with third-line treatments.

### 10-day versus 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy for first-line eradication of infection: A randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^111YwrAK]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Bismuth quadruple therapy is currently a consensus recommendation for first-line Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) treatment. However, the optimal duration of treatment remains unknown. This study compared the efficacy of a 10-day bismuth quadruple therapy with that of a 14-day regimen for first-line eradication.

- **Methods**: In our multicentre, parallel, randomised, open-label, and non-inferiority study, we recruited H. pylori treatment-naïve patients from one medical centre and one teaching hospital in Taiwan. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 10-day (PBMT-10) or 14-day (PBMT-14) bismuth quadruple therapy. The primary outcome was the eradication rate, assessed by intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses. The eradication rates between the two groups were compared using a one-sided α value of 0.025 and a non-inferiority margin of 7%. Secondary outcomes included the rate of adverse effects.

- **Findings**: From August 3, 2020, to April 28, 2023, a total of 313 H. pylori treatment-naïve patients were enrolled, with 157 receiving PBMT-10 and 156 receiving PBMT-14. Thirty-five patients were excluded from PP analyses. The eradication rates (95% CI) for PBMT-10 and PBMT-14 were 92.4% (88.2%–96.5%) and 92.9% (88.9%–97.0%) by ITT analyses, respectively, and 97.9% (95.5%–100.0%) and 99.3% (97.8%–100.0%) by PP analyses. The eradication rates for PBMT-10 were non-inferior to those for PBMT-14, with an absolute difference [lower boundary of the one-sided 97.5% CI] of −0.6% [−6.7%], P NI = 0.020 in ITT analyses, and −1.4% [−5.8%], P NI = 0.007 in PP analyses.

### Can sarcoidosis be cured [^11431CC3]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause that almost invariably affects the lungs. The clinical course and outcomes of pulmonary sarcoidosis are highly variable, ranging from mild and self-limiting to organ-threatening or life-threatening disease. Often, sarcoidosis remits permanently, either spontaneously or following treatment. However, disease resolution rates vary depending on demographic factors, mode of presentation, organs involved, and disease duration.

Corticosteroids are the initial drugs of choice for the treatment of sarcoidosis. However, corticosteroid toxicity is common and causes significant morbidity and mortality; therefore, their use should be minimized. Certain phenotypes of sarcoidosis are more likely to undergo disease termination than others. Additionally, certain pharmacologic maneuvers may be useful in terminating the disease, but these remain exploratory at this time. Future clinical and basic research of such phenotypes may lead to the discovery of immunopathogenic mechanisms involved in sarcoidosis disease termination.

### Peptic ulcer disease and H. pylori infection: Common questions and answers [^111BpyUH]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of Helicobacter pylori infection, the AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend administering bismuth quadruple therapy (PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole or tinidazole) or concomitant therapy (non-bismuth quadruple therapy; PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole or tinidazole) as first-line therapy for patients with H. pylori infection.

### Phase II investigation of the efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy in chronic pulmonary sarcoidosis [^114LHJbH]. Chest (2021). Low credibility.

Patients were assigned to receive the CLEAR or placebo regimen using block randomization stratified according to the site and use of prednisone ≥ 10 mg. Randomization lists were generated and distributed to site pharmacies by a statistician at Vanderbilt University Medical Center not associated with the study.

- **Measurement of treatment completion**: Patients were requested to bring all remaining doses of every trial drug to each visit for pill counts. Treatment completion for the per-protocol analysis was defined as the administration of at least 90% of the doses within 16 weeks.

- **Measurement of safety during treatment**: At each follow-up visit, participants were questioned and examined for adverse events. Suspected adverse events were investigated, managed, and reported according to a standardized protocol. Information about suspected adverse events was reviewed and graded by the site-specific principal investigator and clinical coordinator. The severity of adverse events was judged according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. The events were categorized as follows: an adverse event that was not related to a trial drug; an adverse event of grade 1 or 2 that was related to a trial drug (not serious); an adverse event of grade 3 or 4 that was related to a trial drug (generally considered to lead to trial drug discontinuation if related to a trial drug); or a grade 5 event (death) that was related to a trial drug. Each adverse event resulting in organ impairment, hospitalization, or death was defined as a serious adverse event (SAE).

Regarding the medical management for sarcoidosis, specifically the management of pulmonary sarcoidosis, the BTS/ITS/TSANZ 2008 guidelines recommend considering other immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory treatments. Methotrexate should be considered when corticosteroids are not controlling the disease or when the side effects are intolerable.

### The role of PET in the management of sarcoidosis [^116XuXQm]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The role of PET (positron emission tomography) in managing sarcoidosis has been a subject of debate in the medical community. This opinion piece discusses the advantages and limitations of using PET scans in the diagnosis and treatment of sarcoidosis.

PET scans can be particularly useful in identifying active inflammatory lesions that may not be detected through other imaging techniques. However, there are significant limitations, including high costs and potential exposure to radiation, which need to be considered when opting for PET scans in routine practice.

Clinicians recommend combining PET with other diagnostic tools to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the disease's progression. Further research is necessary to fully establish its efficacy and cost-effectiveness in sarcoidosis management.

### Update on the second-line treatment of infection: a narrative review [^114npBT8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The regimen of standard bismuth quadruple therapy comprises a PPI twice daily, a bismuth four times daily, tetracycline 500 mg four times daily, and metronidazole 500 mg three times daily for 10–14 days. A meta-analysis including 12 comparative trials demonstrated that bismuth quadruple therapy achieved an 89% cure rate [95% confidence interval (CI): 86%−93%, I = 78%] in the second-line treatment for H. pylori infection. Hp-EuReg found that bismuth quadruple therapy could achieve an optimal eradication (≧90%) after failure of first-line clarithromycin-containing therapies; however, the cure rate of levofloxacin-based triple therapy was suboptimal. A recent 15-year prospective study from Korea showed that the overall per-protocol eradication rate of 14-day bismuth-containing quadruple therapy in second-line treatment was 89.5% (95% CI: 86.3–92.7%). Despite high rates of metronidazole resistance, no significant decline in annual eradication rates was observed during the study period. Therefore, bismuth-containing quadruple therapy is a pivotal second-line treatment for H. pylori infection, especially in areas with high quinolone resistance. Several recent studies revealed that treatment duration is an important factor related to the eradication efficacy of bismuth quadruple therapy. A recent randomized controlled trial study also showed a per-protocol eradication rate of 77.2% versus 93.6% between the 7-day and 14-day groups that received a bismuth-containing quadruple therapy as second-line treatment.

### Therapeutic options for sarcoidosis: New and old [^1111vzfD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with sarcoidosis remains an important aspect of management. The role of corticosteroids has been questioned by some, while others have reported its value even in asymptomatic patients with interstitial lung disease. Cytotoxic agents have become standard therapy for some forms of chronic disease. Newer agents that modulate the immune response have been studied. A key cytokine in chronic sarcoidosis appears to be tumor necrosis factor. Drugs that inhibit its release or block its effect have been reported as effective for sarcoidosis.

### Levofloxacin-based triple therapy versus bismuth-based quadruple therapy for persistent Helicobacter pylori infection: a meta-analysis [^116vpaUK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Levofloxacin-based triple therapy has been suggested as an alternative salvage therapy to bismuth-based quadruple therapy for persistent Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.

- **Methods**: A search of PUBMED, EMBASE, EBM Review databases, and abstracts from recent Digestive Disease Week, United European Gastroenterology Week, and European Helicobacter Study Group conferences was performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing levofloxacin-based triple salvage therapy (levofloxacin + amoxicillin + PPI) to bismuth-based quadruple salvage therapy (bismuth + tetracycline + metronidazole + PPI) were selected for meta-analysis. Additionally, all prospective trials evaluating this levofloxacin-based triple therapy as salvage therapy were pooled to analyze optimal levofloxacin treatment duration and dosing. All selected trials confirmed prior treatment failure and post-salvage treatment eradication.

- **Results**: Four RCTs compared a 10-day regimen of levofloxacin-based triple therapy to 7-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy (n = 391 patients). Levofloxacin-based triple therapy was superior to quadruple therapy (RR = 1.41 [95% CI: 1.25–1.59]). Levofloxacin-based triple therapy was better tolerated than quadruple therapy, with a lower incidence of side effects (RR = 0.51 [95% CI: 0.34–0.75]) and side effects prompting discontinuation of therapy (RR = 0.30 [95% CI: 0.10–0.89]). Eleven trials (n = 547 patients) evaluating levofloxacin-based triple therapy demonstrated higher eradication rates with a 10-day versus 7-day regimen (87% [95% CI: 82%-92%] vs. 68% [95% CI: 62%-74%]).

### Global eradication rates for Helicobacter pylori infection: Systematic review and meta-analysis of sequential therapy [^112qtatF]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Six studies compared sequential therapy with a non-bismuth containing quadruple therapy regimen, sometimes called concomitant therapy. The regimen included a proton pump inhibitor, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and metronidazole. In four trials, the non-bismuth quadruple therapy lasted 10 days, while in the remaining two, it lasted five days. One trial did not report full data on the proton pump inhibitor used. Only one trial was at low risk of bias.

The pooled relative risk was 0.99 (0.94 to 1.05), and the 95% prediction intervals ranged from 0.85 to 1.16. We found evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 52.3%; P = 0.021) and no evidence of funnel plot asymmetry (Egger's test coefficient 0.96, −0.72 to 2.65; P = 0.324).

In total, 1039 patients were treated with sequential therapy compared to 1031 patients treated with concomitant therapy. The eradication rate reported was 81.7% (76.1% to 86.7%) for sequential therapy and 81.3% (74.9% to 87%) for the non-bismuth containing quadruple therapy. The difference in eradication rates was 0.4% (−4% to 4%), with the 95% prediction intervals ranging from −14% to 13%. There was evidence of heterogeneity (I² = 55.3%; P = 0.014).

Due to the heterogeneity observed, subgroup analyses were conducted according to the country of origin, risk of bias, type of proton pump inhibitor used, duration of non-bismuth containing quadruple therapy, type of publication, and the use of tinidazole in the sequential therapy.

### The role of PET in the management of sarcoidosis [^111zR3TB]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022).

The hallmark of sarcoidosis is granulomatous inflammation due to a dysregulated response of the immune system. Once initiated, the resultant organ damage depends on the intensity and duration of the persistent granulomatous inflammation. Given that the lungs are affected in about 90% of individuals, the pulmonary system garners significant attention; however, sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease. With the potential to damage any organ system, identifying and localizing active inflammation in different systems can direct management. PET has emerged as a tool to detect inflammation in patients with sarcoidosis that may not be easily recognized by physical examination or methods currently used in clinical practice.

In this opinion, we present the role of PET in the diagnosis and treatment of sarcoidosis, discuss the advantages and drawbacks of PET, and outline areas for further research.

### Rifabutin-containing triple therapy versus bismuth quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori rescue treatment: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial [^111KDPkw]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We compared the efficacy and safety of rifabutin-containing triple therapy with bismuth quadruple therapy for rescue treatment of Helicobacter pylori.

- **Methods**: This was a noninferiority study trial of H. pylori treatment for subjects who had failed at least two prior treatments. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive rifabutin triple therapy with 14-day esomeprazole (20 mg), amoxicillin (1.0 g), and rifabutin (150 mg) twice a day; or bismuth quadruple therapy with esomeprazole (20 mg) and bismuth (220 mg) twice a day, plus metronidazole (400 mg) and tetracycline (500 mg) four times a day. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by agar dilution and E-test.

- **Results**: From May 2021 to October 2022, a total of 364 subjects were randomized. The eradication rates by intention-to-treat, per-protocol, and modified intention-to-treat were 89.0% (162/182; 95% confidence interval, 83.6%-92.8%), 94.0% (157/167; 95% CI, 89.3%-96.7%), and 93.6% (162/173; 95% CI, 89.0%-96.4%) for the rifabutin triple group. For the bismuth quadruple group, they were 89.6% (163/182; 95% CI, 84.3%-93.2%), 95.3% (143/150; 95% CI, 90.7%-97.7%), and 93.7% (163/174; 95% CI, 89.0%-96.4%).

- **Conclusions**: The rifabutin triple therapy is an alternative to classical bismuth quadruple therapy for the rescue treatment of H. pylori with fewer side effects and higher compliance.
