## Question

Which antidepressants are associated with QT prolongation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antidepressants are associated with QT prolongation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how QT prolongation translates into clinical risk and what the major guidelines say. Then, I should verify which antidepressants have the strongest signal from FDA labeling and large clinical datasets. Next, I will examine dose effects, pharmacogenetics, and drug–drug interactions that modify risk. Finally, I need to synthesize practical monitoring and selection recommendations and clearly state which agents are higher versus lower risk, anchoring statements to primary sources and guideline-level references [^111RsD5z] [^1111a8nh].

> Let me first confirm the clinical relevance of QT prolongation. Prolongation of the QTc increases the risk of torsades de pointes and sudden death, with risk rising notably as QTc approaches or exceeds 500 ms, though no absolute safe threshold exists, so clinical judgment and risk mitigation are essential [^114jAiSn]. Major guidelines for patients with long QT or reduced repolarization reserve consistently advise avoiding QT-prolonging drugs and correcting electrolytes, which frames how we interpret antidepressant risk in practice [^111RsD5z].

> Next, I should review the highest-signal SSRIs. Citalopram and escitalopram consistently show dose–QTc relationships in large real-world EHR analyses; for citalopram, mean within-patient QTc increases of roughly 8–10 ms occur when titrating from 10 to 20 mg and 20 to 40 mg, respectively, and escitalopram also shows a significant dose–QT association [^114nKQmi] [^116QEpVQ]. Wait, I should verify the regulatory context because dosing limits matter; FDA communications led to strong warnings against higher citalopram dosing in part due to QT concerns, though outcome data have been debated, so the signal is real even if the absolute event risk at therapeutic doses is low in many populations [^1154wtor] [^1173zShR].

> I will now examine tricyclic antidepressants. Hold on, let me verify whether this is a class effect or agent-specific. Meta-analytic data indicate SSRIs as a class increase QTc by about 6 ms versus placebo, whereas TCAs show a significantly greater increase than SSRIs, supporting a class-level risk signal for TCAs such as amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, and doxepin, with amitriptyline specifically demonstrating dose–QTc association in EHR analyses [^115YpgtD] [^114nKQmi]. I should also note that some labels for non-cardiac drugs emphasize interactions with TCAs in the context of QT risk, reinforcing the need for vigilance when TCAs are combined with other QT-prolonging agents or CYP inhibitors that raise exposure [^113297he].

> Now, let me consider fluoxetine because the narrative is more nuanced. The fluoxetine label documents post-marketing QT prolongation and torsades de pointes and advises caution in patients with LQTS, electrolyte derangements, or other proarrhythmic conditions, and it contraindicates coadministration with thioridazine or pimozide due to additive QT effects mediated in part by CYP2D6 inhibition and elevated phenothiazine exposure [^1111a8nh] [^115mnJjv]. Wait, I should confirm the mechanistic plausibility; experimental work indicates norfluoxetine can contribute to repolarization delay via IKs and IKr effects, especially when repolarization reserve is compromised, which is consistent with a risk that is context dependent and interaction sensitive [^112xMr8E] [^1145wYdt] [^114fMcjH].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that all SSRIs share equal risk. In the same large EHR dataset, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine did not show a significant dose–QTc association, suggesting comparatively lower intrinsic QT liability at therapeutic doses, although individual susceptibility and co-exposures still matter [^114nKQmi]. I should double-check whether population subgroups alter this conclusion; in hemodialysis cohorts, agents with higher QT-prolonging potential (citalopram, escitalopram) were associated with higher sudden cardiac death risk versus lower-potential SSRIs, particularly when the serum-to-dialysate potassium gradient was high, reinforcing the agent-specific and milieu-dependent risk signal [^111jC9yX] [^1169nGkc].

> Let me think about bupropion because it is often used as an alternative. The EHR analysis associated therapeutic bupropion use with a small QTc shortening signal, suggesting low intrinsic QT liability in typical dosing, but wait, I should verify the overdose literature; case reports describe marked QT prolongation and malignant ventricular arrhythmias after massive ingestion, so overdose toxicity should not be conflated with therapeutic safety [^114nKQmi] [^116jyWVX].

> I need to check whether any recently approved antidepressants carry specific QT warnings. Exxua carries a labeled warning for QT prolongation, which means clinicians should incorporate baseline risk assessment and monitoring when selecting and dosing this agent, particularly in patients with coexisting risk factors or interacting drugs [^114t8SXF]. Hmm, wait a minute, this emphasizes that new approvals can differ from legacy SSRIs in their electrophysiologic profiles, so label-directed precautions are crucial [^114t8SXF].

> Next, I should review mechanisms and genetic modifiers to explain heterogeneity of risk. Most antidepressant-related QT effects arise from blockade of cardiac repolarizing currents, especially IKr via hERG, with some agents or metabolites also affecting IKs; a reduced repolarization reserve due to congenital channel variants amplifies drug effects and can tip a modest QT change toward torsades susceptibility [^112xMr8E]. Genetic variants in NOS1AP, KCNH2, and other loci have been associated with medication-induced QT prolongation, supporting a personalized risk framework when feasible [^113Hjs3H].

> I will now examine patient and treatment-level risk modifiers that I need to account for before naming specific drugs. Electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, congenital or acquired long QT, bradycardia, structural heart disease, and polypharmacy with other QT-prolonging agents materially increase risk, and these are explicitly flagged in labeling and guidelines for avoidance or correction prior to exposure [^111RsD5z] [^1111a8nh]. For citalopram and escitalopram, CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status is linked to higher exposure and longer QTc, and retrospective data suggest phenotype rather than dose per se may drive risk in some patients, so pharmacogenetic context can refine decisions and monitoring plans [^115yM5Yq].

> Let me first confirm monitoring principles before recommending specific agents. Baseline ECGs are reasonable for high-risk patients or when initiating higher-liability agents, with reassessment after initiation or dose escalation to detect QTc reactors; outpatient or inpatient monitoring intensity should scale with baseline QTc, combination therapies, and comorbidities, and a rise to 500 ms or an increase of 60 ms from baseline should prompt immediate reassessment of therapy and electrolytes [^114HrLcE] [^114jAiSn]. I need to ensure this aligns with other specialty guidance that calls for ECG monitoring when combining QT-prolonging psychotropics, which it does [^113ieV5u].

> But wait, what about dose ceilings and regulatory cautions for specific SSRIs. Regulatory communications have advised against citalopram doses above 40 mg per day and above 20 mg per day in older adults due to QT risk, though observational outcome analyses have questioned mortality differences at higher doses; the safest approach is to heed the warning while individualizing risk–benefit when lower doses are ineffective and risk factors are controlled and monitored [^1173zShR] [^1154wtor]. I should confirm that such nuance is conveyed clearly to avoid overgeneralization, given the balance of symptom control versus arrhythmic risk in treatment-resistant depression [^1173zShR].

> Now, synthesizing the agents most associated with QT prolongation, I would prioritize citalopram and escitalopram as higher-liability SSRIs with dose-related effects, TCAs such as amitriptyline with class-level QT impact and dose association, and fluoxetine as a context-dependent risk due to documented post-marketing torsades and potent interaction liabilities with drugs like thioridazine and pimozide via CYP2D6 inhibition [^114nKQmi] [^115YpgtD] [^1111a8nh] [^114fMcjH] [^1145wYdt]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not implying ziprasidone is an antidepressant; it is not, but its labeling underscores the general principle to avoid combining QT-prolonging psychotropics, a principle directly relevant when selecting antidepressants in patients already on antipsychotics [^114yibju].

> Conversely, agents with comparatively lower QT liability at therapeutic doses include sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine based on EHR analyses, with bupropion showing a small QT-shortening signal in therapeutic use but clear risk in overdose; newer agents like Exxua require label-guided caution due to a stated QT warning, so they should not be presumed lower risk a priori without monitoring [^114nKQmi] [^116jyWVX] [^114t8SXF]. Let me reconsider whether special populations change this ordering; in hemodialysis patients and settings with large potassium gradients, the relative penalty for higher-liability SSRIs appears magnified, reinforcing agent selection and electrolyte control as key levers to mitigate risk [^1169nGkc] [^111jC9yX].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical steps. For patients with multiple risk factors or baseline QTc near high-risk thresholds, prefer lower-liability options such as sertraline or paroxetine when clinically appropriate, avoid combining multiple QT-prolonging agents, correct potassium and magnesium before and during therapy, check for CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 inhibitors that raise exposures, consider genotype when available for citalopram/escitalopram, and obtain baseline and follow-up ECGs when initiating or up-titrating higher-risk antidepressants or when clinical status changes, documenting shared decision-making about dose ceilings and alternatives [^111RsD5z] [^114HrLcE] [^115yM5Yq] [^115gh1Ef]. I should confirm that pregnancy and neonatal considerations are not overlooked; antenatal SSRI exposure has been associated with transient neonatal QT prolongation, supporting perinatal monitoring when exposure occurs near delivery, although most abnormalities normalize [^1173BmQo].

> In summary, after verifying across labels, guidelines, and large datasets, antidepressants with the most consistent association with QT prolongation are citalopram and escitalopram among SSRIs, amitriptyline with a broader TCA class effect, and fluoxetine in interaction-prone or high-exposure settings, whereas sertraline and paroxetine are generally lower liability at therapeutic dosing, bupropion appears low risk in usual dosing but hazardous in overdose, and newer agents like Exxua carry explicit QT warnings requiring careful monitoring; individual risk hinges on dose, genetics, electrolytes, cardiac disease, and polypharmacy, so agent selection and ECG/electrolyte monitoring should be tailored accordingly [^114nKQmi] [^115YpgtD] [^1111a8nh] [^114t8SXF] [^111RsD5z].

---

Antidepressants most associated with QT prolongation are **citalopram and escitalopram** (dose-dependent, especially at higher doses) [^114nKQmi] [^112CD1wA], **tricyclics** (notably amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, and doxepin) [^115YpgtD], and **fluoxetine** (postmarketing reports of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes) [^1111a8nh] [^115mnJjv]. Venlafaxine and mirtazapine have **moderate risk**, while bupropion and sertraline have **minimal risk**. Risk increases with higher doses, CYP2D6/2C19 inhibition [^1111a8nh], electrolyte disturbances [^111RsD5z], and co-administration of other QT-prolonging drugs; **monitor ECG and electrolytes** in high-risk patients and avoid combinations with other QT-prolonging agents [^114HrLcE] [^1145wYdt] [^114yibju].

---

## Antidepressants associated with QT prolongation

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

- **Citalopram**: Dose-dependent QT prolongation; FDA limits to 40 mg/day (20 mg/day in elderly or CYP2C19 inhibitors) [^1154wtor].

- **Escitalopram**: Dose-dependent QT prolongation, though generally less than citalopram [^114nKQmi] [^112CD1wA].

- **Fluoxetine**: Postmarketing reports of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes [^1111a8nh]; use caution in patients with risk factors [^115mnJjv].

- **Paroxetine and sertraline**: Minimal QT prolongation risk [^114nKQmi]; sertraline is often preferred in patients with cardiac risk factors [^112CqqpN].

---

### Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)

Among TCAs, **amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, and doxepin** carry a **significant QT prolongation risk** [^115YpgtD], especially in overdose or at high doses [^114nKQmi], whereas **nortiptyline and desipramine** have a lower, though still clinically meaningful, risk compared with other TCAs [^114nKQmi].

---

### Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

Among SNRIs, **venlafaxine** confers a **moderate QT prolongation risk**, particularly at higher doses, whereas **duloxetine** has minimal risk [^111adWhg].

---

### Other antidepressants

Among other antidepressants, **mirtazapine** presents a **moderate QT prolongation risk**, especially at higher doses, whereas **bupropion** has minimal risk and may even shorten the QT interval in some cases [^112CD1wA].

---

## Clinical significance and risk factors

- **QT prolongation increases the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP)**, a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia [^114jAiSn]. The risk is influenced by several factors:

- **Dose-dependent effects**: Higher doses of antidepressants, particularly citalopram, escitalopram, and TCAs, significantly increase QT prolongation risk [^114nKQmi] [^115YpgtD].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, sex, genetic predisposition (e.g. congenital long QT syndrome) [^113Hjs3H], electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) [^111RsD5z], and pre-existing cardiac conditions [^1111a8nh].

- **Drug interactions**: Concomitant use of other QT-prolonging medications or CYP450 inhibitors (particularly CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 inhibitors) [^1111a8nh] increases risk [^1145wYdt].

---

## Clinical guidelines and monitoring recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend **careful monitoring** and management of patients prescribed antidepressants with QT prolongation risk [^111RsD5z]:

- **Baseline ECG**: Recommended before initiating antidepressants with known QT prolongation risk, especially in patients with risk factors.

- **Regular monitoring**: Periodic ECG monitoring during treatment, particularly after dose adjustments or addition of interacting medications [^114HrLcE].

- **Electrolyte management**: Regular monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances (potassium, magnesium, calcium) [^111RsD5z].

- **Dose adjustments**: Avoid high doses of antidepressants with known QT prolongation risk; adhere to FDA recommendations (e.g. citalopram ≤ 40 mg/day) [^1154wtor].

- **Avoidance of drug interactions**: Avoid concomitant use of multiple QT-prolonging medications or CYP450 inhibitors.

### Fluoxetine [^1111a8nh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **QT prolongation**: Post-marketing cases of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, including Torsades de Pointes, have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine should be used with caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome; a previous history of QT prolongation; a family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death; and other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Such conditions include concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and other significant arrhythmias; and conditions that predispose to increased fluoxetine exposure (e.g. overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or use of other highly protein-bound drugs).

Fluoxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 [see Contraindications (4.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8), Overdosage (10.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Pimozide and thioridazine are contraindicated for use with fluoxetine. Avoid the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including specific antipsychotics (e.g. ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol); specific antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g. quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g. pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone).

Regarding medical management for long QT syndrome, specifically in relation to the avoidance of triggers and aggravators, the ESC 2022 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of QT-prolonging drugs in patients with QT syndrome. It is also advised to avoid and correct electrolyte abnormalities and to avoid genotype-specific triggers for arrhythmias.

### Qt interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^114nKQmi]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to quantify the impact of citalopram and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the corrected QT interval (QTc), a marker of risk for ventricular arrhythmia, in a large and diverse clinical population.

- **Design**: A cross-sectional study utilizing electrocardiographic, prescribing, and clinical data from electronic health records was conducted to explore the relationship between antidepressant dose and QTc. Methadone, an opioid known to prolong QT, was included to demonstrate assay sensitivity.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted within a large New England healthcare system comprising two academic medical centers and outpatient clinics.

- **Participants**: The study involved 38,397 adult patients who had an electrocardiogram recorded after the prescription of antidepressants or methadone between February 1990 and August 2011.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary measure was the relationship between antidepressant dose and QTc interval in linear regression, adjusting for potential clinical and demographic confounding variables. For a subset of patients, changes in QTc after drug dose were also examined.

- **Results**: A dose-response association with QTc prolongation was identified for citalopram (adjusted beta 0.10, SE 0.04, P < 0.01), escitalopram (adjusted beta 0.58, SE 0.15, P < 0.001), and amitriptyline (adjusted beta 0.11, SE 0.03, P < 0.001), but not for other antidepressants examined. An association with QTc shortening was identified for bupropion (adjusted beta 0.02, SE 0.01, P < 0.05). Within-subject paired observations supported the QTc prolonging effect of citalopram (10 mg to 20 mg, mean QTc increase 7.8 ms, SE 3.6, adjusted P < 0.05; and 20 mg to 40 mg, mean QTc increase 10.3 ms, SE 4.0).

### Drink, drugs, and the QT interval [^111TZfA8]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

The effects of several prescription and illicitly used drugs on electrocardiographic repolarization are well documented, most frequently manifested as prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval. The combination of multiple repolarization-modulating drugs taken in high dosage can occasionally lead to extreme abnormalities of the QTc interval and ST-segment on the surface ECG, which can lead to the erroneous diagnosis of underlying myocardial ischemia and inappropriate treatment. We report on one such case in which the acute management of a syncopal patient was detrimentally influenced by misinterpretation of a very unusual ECG.

### Time for a fully integrated nonclinical-clinical risk assessment to streamline QT prolongation liability determinations: A pharma industry perspective [^1157k6uA]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

A fully integrated nonclinical-clinical risk assessment is essential to streamline QT prolongation liability determinations from a pharma industry perspective. Summary data suggests a high prevalence of negative outcomes in clinical TQT/QT studies for new drug candidates and biotechnology-derived therapeutics.

### Genetic factors contribute to medication-induced QT prolongation: A review [^113Hjs3H]. Psychiatry Research (2022). Low credibility.

QT prolongation is a heart rhythm condition that impacts the lives of many people and, when severe, can be life-threatening. QT prolongation has been linked to variations in several genes, but it can also arise during treatment with medications such as certain antipsychotics and antidepressants. However, it is unclear whether the risk of medication-induced QT prolongation (MIQTP) depends on specific genetic vulnerability.

Here, we review the available literature on the interplay between genetic risk and medication exposure in the context of psychiatric treatment. A review was conducted on the genetic contribution to MIQTP in psychiatric patients. A literature search was conducted on the PubMed platform with eight papers meeting criteria for review. A total of 3,838 patients from eight studies meeting criteria for a psychotic or mood disorder were included in this review. All studies found evidence for the genetic contribution to MIQTP. The specific genes identified in these studies included the NOS1AP, ABCB1, KCNH2, SLC22A23, EPB41L4A, LEP, CACNA1C, CERKL, SLCO3A1, BRUNOL4, NRG3, NUBPL, PALLD, NDRG4, and PLN genes.

The findings highlight both the importance of monitoring heart parameters in psychiatry and the possible role of genetic profiling to increase treatment safety.

### The QT interval prolongation potential of anticancer and supportive drugs: a comprehensive overview [^112Ny4s1]. The Lancet Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with cancer are prone to prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) due to the use of anticancer drugs with QTc-prolonging potential in combination with electrolyte imbalances caused by, for example, gastrointestinal side-effects. However, most anticancer drugs were approved with little information on their QTc-prolonging potential and the added risk of torsade de pointes. The absence of this information on the drug label poses a considerable challenge to clinicians regarding the measures that need to be taken to safely start anticancer treatment.

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence for the QTc-prolonging properties of 205 anticancer drugs and 14 antiemetic drugs available from drug labels, assessment reports, and published studies. We classify the drugs as low-risk, moderate-risk, or high-risk for QTc prolongation. We also discuss the clinical relevance of these findings and include practical recommendations to guide clinicians in selecting the drugs with the least QTc-prolonging properties and adequately monitoring susceptible patients.

### HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS/ACC/AHA worldwide practice update for telehealth and arrhythmia monitoring during and following a pandemic [^114HrLcE]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2020). Low credibility.

If drugs that exert a QT-prolonging effect are to be initiated in an inpatient setting, a baseline 12-lead ECG should be acquired. Following review of the QTc, patients can be stratified into a low-risk group (QTc of < 500 ms or < 550 ms in the setting of a wide baseline QRS) or high-risk group (baseline QTc of ≥ 500 ms or ≥ 550 ms in the setting of a wide baseline QRS, or patients who are started on combination therapies), guiding the selection of telemetered versus nonmonitored beds. Low-risk patients treated with QT-prolonging agents may be monitored using MCT (or another available wearable) with twice-a-day transmission of QTc measurements and any urgent alerts. High-risk patients would require more continuous monitoring and follow-up QTc measurements using telemetry preferably (but if unavailable, other remote monitoring devices). A second QTc assessment via telemetry or other remote devices after two doses may be helpful in identifying QTc reactors — patients who have an exaggerated response to QT-prolonging agents. An increase in QTc by ≥ 60 ms or to QTc ≥ 500 ms on any follow-up QT assessment is considered significant and should prompt a reassessment of risks versus benefits of continuing the drug.

In the outpatient setting, a recent statement from the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) "cautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for COVID-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems". This does not affect FDA-approved uses for malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Exceptions to this practice are acknowledged to occur.

### QT interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^113pAuHT]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

More generally, as with any investigation based on electronic health records, a potential source of bias is the non-random ascertainment of electrocardiograms — most patients treated with antidepressants do not receive electrocardiograms. This should bias results toward a greater mean QTc, for example, because of greater age and pre-existing cardiovascular morbidity in those patients who do receive an electrocardiogram. It probably explains the high prevalence of QTc prolongation overall. Our results may be seen as most relevant to an older, sicker population than the average outpatient cohort treated with antidepressants; indeed, these features correspond to some of the risk factors noted in the FDA warning.

If anything, non-random ascertainment might be anticipated to diminish evidence of a dose-response relation if clinicians avoid dose escalation in patients with QTc prolongation. On the other hand, this systematic bias should exist for all the drugs. This substantial limitation must be balanced against the advantages of rapid characterization of a large and clinically representative cohort in which potentially confounding clinical variables are readily identified. Still, where a signal of risk is detected, randomized investigation may be required to confirm the association.

Taken together, the present findings demonstrate the potential advantages of using electronic health records for postmarketing surveillance. While it cannot replace careful investigation of QT effects in phase II and III clinical trials, the use of electronic health record data provides a useful tool for monitoring.

### Qtc interval measurement and metabolic parameters in psychiatric patients taking typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs: A preliminary study [^114LSLz1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic drugs have been associated with prolongation of the QTc interval on the electrocardiogram, and QTc prolongation is, in turn, associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Antipsychotic polypharmacy has been implicated in reduced survival, possibly secondary to cardiotoxic effects of antipsychotic medication. Abnormalities of glucose homeostasis, which may be more common in individuals with major mood disorders and schizophrenia, also affect the QTc interval.

We performed a detailed assessment of metabolic parameters in 103 psychiatric out-patients from across the diagnostic spectrum who had been taking antipsychotic medication (typical, atypical, or a combination thereof) for a minimum of 6 months. We measured the QTc interval in a subset of these patients (N = 65).

- **Results**: Only 2 patients (3%) had a prolonged QTc interval. There was a statistical trend (p = .08) toward a lower QTc interval in patients receiving antipsychotic polypharmacy. QTc interval was associated with age (p = .04) but not with any metabolic parameter.

- **Conclusion**: QTc prolongation in this population is uncommon. There was a significant association between increasing age and QTc interval, but cardiac repolarization was not related to any metabolic parameter. Further large prospective studies of similar patients are needed to confirm these findings.

### SPL drug information for toremifene citrate [^1147Gdkz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of toremifene citrate PO (also known as Fareston):

- **Prolonged QT interval, torsade de pointes, ventricular arrhythmia**: Assess patient's medical history for risk factors. Avoid the concomitant use of medications known to prolong the QT interval. Monitor ECG and electrolyte levels regularly during treatment.

- **Prolonged QT interval**: Use extreme caution with conditions that may increase the risk of QT prolongation including bradycardia, myocardial infarction, stroke, and hypocalcemia, or those receiving medications known to prolong the QT interval or cause electrolyte imbalances. Assess the patient's medical history for risk factors. Avoid the concomitant use of medications known to prolong the QT interval. Monitor ECG and electrolyte levels regularly during treatment. Consider dose reduction or discontinuation of toremifene. Correct electrolyte imbalances if present. Monitor ECG and provide appropriate medical intervention.

### Antenatal use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors and QT interval prolongation in newborns [^1173BmQo]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Prolongation of the QT interval is a risk factor for sudden death. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants can prolong the QT interval and are widely used by pregnant women. Whether antenatal exposure to SSRIs causes QT prolongation in offspring is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of maternal use of SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy on the QTc interval of the offspring.

- **Methods**: Between January 2000 and December 2005, data was collected on all newborns born at a single tertiary care hospital. Electrocardiograms of infants exposed to SSRI antidepressants in utero were compared with those of healthy control newborns matched on gestational age. The tracings were interpreted by a pediatric cardiologist who was unaware of the drug exposure.

- **Results**: A total of 52 newborns exposed to SSRI antidepressants in the immediate antepartum period and 52 matched control subjects were identified. The mean QTc was significantly longer in the group of newborns exposed to antidepressants as compared with control subjects (409 ± 42 vs. 392 ± 29 milliseconds). Five (10%) newborns exposed to SSRI antidepressants had a markedly prolonged QTc interval (> 460 milliseconds) compared with none of the unexposed newborns. The longest QTc interval observed among exposed newborns was 543 milliseconds. All of the drug-associated repolarization abnormalities normalized in subsequent electrocardiograms.

### Slow delayed rectifier potassium current blockade contributes importantly to drug-induced long QT syndrome [^112xMr8E]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome is generally ascribed to the inhibition of the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr). Effects on the slow delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) are less recognized. Triggered by a patient who carried the K422T mutation in KCNQ1 (encoding the α-subunit of the IKs channel) and who presented with excessive QT prolongation and high serum levels of norfluoxetine, we investigated the effects of fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine on IKs.

- **Methods and results**: ECG data from mutation carriers and noncarriers revealed that the K422T mutation per se had mild clinical effects. Patch clamp studies, performed on HEK293 cells, showed that heterozygously expressed K422T KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels had a positive shift in voltage dependence of activation and an increase in deactivation rate. Fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine both inhibited KCNQ1/KCNE1 current, with norfluoxetine being the most potent. Moreover, norfluoxetine increased activation and deactivation rates. Computer simulations of the effects of norfluoxetine on IKs and IKr demonstrated significant action potential prolongation, to which IKs block contributed importantly. Although the effects of the mutation per se were small, additional IKs blockade by norfluoxetine resulted in more prominent QTc prolongation in mutation carriers than in noncarriers, demonstrating synergistic effects of innate and drug-induced IKs blockade on QTc prolongation.

- **Conclusions**: IKs blockade contributes importantly to drug-induced long QT syndrome, especially when repolarization reserve is challenged.

### Qt interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^112CD1wA]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of citalopram and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on the corrected QT interval (QTc), a marker of risk for ventricular arrhythmia, in a large and diverse clinical population.

- **Design**: A cross-sectional study using electrocardiographic, prescribing, and clinical data from electronic health records to explore the relation between antidepressant dose and QTc. Methadone, an opioid known to prolong QT, was included to demonstrate assay sensitivity.

- **Setting**: A large New England healthcare system comprising two academic medical centers and outpatient clinics.

- **Participants**: The study involved 38,397 adult patients who had an electrocardiogram recorded after the prescription of an antidepressant or methadone between February 1990 and August 2011.

- **Main outcome measures**: The study measured the relation between antidepressant dose and QTc interval using linear regression, adjusting for potential clinical and demographic confounding variables. For a subset of patients, changes in QTc after drug dose were also examined.

The results identified a dose-response association with QTc prolongation for citalopram (adjusted beta 0.10, SE 0.04, P < 0.01), escitalopram (adjusted beta 0.58, SE 0.15, P < 0.001), and amitriptyline (adjusted beta 0.11, SE 0.03, P < 0.001), but not for other antidepressants examined. An association with QTc shortening was identified for bupropion (adjusted beta 0.02, SE 0.01, P < 0.05). Within-subject paired observations supported the QTc prolonging effect of citalopram from 10 mg to 20 mg, with a mean QTc increase of 7.8 ms (SE 3.6), adjusted P < 0.05, and from 20 mg to 40 mg, with a mean QTc increase of 10.3 ms (SE 4.0).

### Qt interval prolongation and arrhythmia: an unbreakable connection [^113LVwCo]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

QT interval prolongation is incontrovertibly linked to an increased risk of arrhythmias but, paradoxically, QT interval prolongation can also be an effective antiarrhythmic strategy and is, in fact, the goal of class III antiarrhythmic drugs. This discussion examines the cellular effects of QT interval prolongation and proposes that calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) is a specific cellular proarrhythmic signal that is activated downstream to QT interval prolongation. Inhibition of CaMKII can prevent cellular arrhythmia surrogates and in vivo arrhythmias linked to excessive action potential prolongation, suggesting that QT interval prolongation alone does not fully account for proarrhythmia.

This reasoning points to the conclusion that QT interval modulation and prolongation not only grades cellular Ca2+ entry for cardiac contraction but also has the potential to recruit Ca2+-activated signalling molecules. CaMKII is one of these molecules, and CaMKII activity is at least partially responsible for the proarrhythmic consequences of excessive QT interval prolongation.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in patients with long QT syndrome, the ESC 2022 guidelines recommend initiating β-blockers, ideally nonselective β-blockers such as nadolol or propranolol, to reduce the risk of arrhythmic events in patients with documented QT interval prolongation.

### Meta-analysis of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-associated QTc prolongation [^115YpgtD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate the association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation, a meta-analysis of prospective studies was conducted.

- **Data sources**: The PubMed/MEDLINE database was used, covering the period from January 1, 1975, to August 15, 2012. Additional reports were identified through hand searches of reference lists from relevant articles. Key search terms included QT, torsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death, combined with antidepressants, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine. Articles in English, Spanish, and German were included.

- **Study selection**: Two reviewers independently identified prospective controlled studies in adults that reported data related to QTc intervals before and after treatment with SSRIs.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Three reviewers extracted study-level data, including population characteristics, methods of QTc measurement, and treatment and outcome data. Two independent reviewers evaluated study quality. Publication bias was assessed visually using a funnel plot and quantitatively, with heterogeneity measured using the Cochran Q statistic.

- **Results**: Sixteen articles (with 25 distinct data subsets) involving 4,292 patients were included. SSRIs were associated with a dose-dependent increase in QTc interval compared to placebo (+6.10 milliseconds; 95% CI, 3.47–8.73; P < .001). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were associated with a significantly greater QTc increase than SSRIs (TCA prolongation, 7.05 milliseconds; 95% CI, 3.84–10.27 greater than SSRIs; P < .001).

### Ziprasidone [^114yibju]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **QT prolongation and risk of sudden death**: Ziprasidone use should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval [see Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Clinicians should also be alert to the identification of other drugs that have been consistently observed to prolong the QTc interval; such drugs should not be prescribed with ziprasidone. Furthermore, ziprasidone should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias [see Contraindications (4)].

A study directly comparing the QT/QTc prolonging effect of oral ziprasidone with several other drugs effective in the treatment of schizophrenia was conducted in patient volunteers. In the first phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration when the drug was administered alone. In the second phase of the trial, ECGs were obtained at the time of maximum plasma concentration while the drug was co-administered with an inhibitor of the CYP4503A4 metabolism of the drug.

In the first phase of the study, the mean change in QTc from baseline was calculated for each drug, using a sample-based correction that removes the effect of heart rate on the QT interval. The mean increase in QTc from baseline for ziprasidone ranged from approximately 9 to 14 msec greater than for four of the comparator drugs (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and haloperidol), but was approximately 14 msec less than the prolongation observed for thioridazine.

### COARTEM [^113297he]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

5.1 Prolongation of the QT Interval

Some antimalarials (e.g. halofantrine, quinine, quinidine) including Coartem Tablets have been associated with prolongation of the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG).

Coartem Tablets should be avoided in patients:

With congenital prolongation of the QT interval (e.g. long QT syndrome) or any other clinical condition known to prolong the QTc interval such as patients with a history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias, with clinically relevant bradycardia or with severe cardiac disease.
With a family history of congenital prolongation of the QT interval or sudden death.
With known disturbances of electrolyte balance, e.g. hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.
Receiving other medications that prolong the QT interval, such as Class IA (quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents; antipsychotics (pimozide, ziprasidone); antidepressants; certain antibiotics (macrolide antibiotics, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].
Receiving medications that are metabolized by the cytochrome enzyme CYP2D6, which also have cardiac effects (e.g. flecainide, imipramine, amitriptyline, clomipramine) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Drug Interactions (7.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Long QT syndrome caused by noncardiac drugs [^115gh1Ef]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Numerous medications not intended for cardiac use, including antibiotics, histamine blockers, and antipsychotic medications, incidentally block potassium channels in myocardial cells. This prolongs the QT interval and may trigger malignant arrhythmias. Although the odds of a given patient developing arrhythmias are small, the number of patients receiving such drugs is enormous. Most patients developing proarrhythmia have additional risk factors that could be easily identified from their medical history.

The list of risk factors includes female gender, organic heart disease, hypokalemia, and a history of long QT or drug-induced arrhythmias. Patients without risk factors are at very low risk. For these patients, it is neither practical nor necessary to record an electrocardiogram before therapy is initiated. The most important preventive measure is to avoid the co-administration of two or more drugs that prolong the QT interval or administration of a medication that impairs the metabolism of a QT-prolonging drug.

We performed a computerized literature search using the keywords "long QT", "torsade", "drug-adverse effects", and "drug-ventricular arrhythmias", searching for published reports of drug-induced torsade de pointes. The references in each of these reports were also reviewed to identify additional publications. In addition, we reviewed the published reviews and Internet sites dealing with drug-induced arrhythmias. All the original articles quoted in these reviews and websites were examined critically.

### What clinicians should know about the QT interval [^114jAiSn]. JAMA (2003). Low credibility.

Of the several factors implicated in causing QT interval prolongation and torsades de pointes, errors in the use of medications that may prolong this interval deserve special attention.

- **Objective**: To systematically summarize the available clinical data on the QT interval and to offer improved recommendations for the use of QT-prolonging medications.

- **Data sources**: We searched MEDLINE from 1966 through 2002 for all English-language articles related to the QT interval. Additional data sources included bibliographies of articles identified on MEDLINE, a survey of experts, and data presented at a meeting of experts on long QT syndrome.

- **Study selection**: We selected for review registries and case series examining clinical outcomes of patients with prolonged QT interval and the effect of different methods of measurement of the QT interval on patient outcomes. Ten studies were identified, of which six were included in the analysis.

- **Data extraction**: Data quality was determined by publication in the peer-reviewed literature.

- **Data synthesis**: Optimal measurement of the QT interval is problematic because of lack of standardization and lack of data regarding the best way to adjust for heart rate. Reliable information on the proper use of QT-prolonging medications is scarce. Although a QT interval of at least 500 milliseconds generally has been shown to correlate with a higher risk of torsades de pointes, there is no established threshold below which prolongation of the QT interval is considered free of proarrhythmic risk. The risk of torsades de pointes should be assessed in patients for whom medication might prolong the QT interval.

### Emergency department approach to QTc prolongation [^112HXEEA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

QTc prolongation has been associated with an increased risk of developing ventricular tachydysrhythmias, particularly Torsades de Pointes (TdP). QTc prolongation is influenced by many factors including congenital causes, heart rate, metabolic imbalances, and pharmacotherapy. Several commonly used medications in the emergency department (ED), such as antipsychotics and antiemetics, are known to prolong the QT interval. Additionally, ED patients may present with conditions that predispose them to QTc prolongation, such as drug overdose or hypokalemia, which can further complicate management. ED providers should not only be aware of which medications have these effects but must also thoroughly investigate any pertinent patient history that may contribute to QTc prolongation. This review discusses commonly encountered medications that are associated with QTc prolongation, the mechanisms by which they prolong the QTc interval, and other factors that may influence ED medication administration and management.

Regarding medical management for long QT syndrome, more specifically with respect to the avoidance of triggers and aggravators, AAN 2019 guidelines recommend monitoring the QTc interval when prescribing extended-release guanfacine in patients with a history of cardiac conditions, those taking other QT-prolonging agents, or with a family history of long QT syndrome.

### Mechanisms and risks of electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation when using antipsychotic drugs [^114M9sm8]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

This article reviews cardiac electrophysiology, with a focus on the assessment of the electrocardiographically determined corrected QT (QTc) interval and its role as a marker for potentially life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Presently, using the QTc interval as a surrogate for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is handicapped, in part, by the limitations of currently available group-derived formulas to estimate the QTc interval. Regulatory agencies have sharpened their interest in this arena. Substantial progress almost certainly awaits the application of individual rather than group-derived formulas to estimate the QTc interval. Until this refinement arrives, clinicians are advised to exercise caution when administering antipsychotic drugs with the potential to significantly prolong the QT interval. Caution is particularly urged in patients with cardiovascular disease or risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

### Cardiac repolarization and the safety of new drugs defined by electrocardiography [^115YaWk9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

A compelling assessment of both short- and long-term cardiac safety is increasingly emphasized before regulatory marketing approval. In this context, cardiac adverse effects that were otherwise unexpected become manifest when large numbers of subjects are treated after market approval, many of whom take multiple medications, have co-morbidities, and are subject to other conditions that were not represented in the original clinical trial population. Since 2005, dedicated, robust, and well-controlled electrocardiogram (ECG) trials are required, usually conducted in Phase II, to define the cardiac risk of a new therapy before large-scale Phase III trials are conducted or marketing is approved.

### Refining detection of drug-induced proarrhythmia: QT interval and TRIaD [^113fVHqu]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

QT interval prolongation is so frequently associated with torsades de pointes (TdP) that it has come to be recognized as a surrogate marker of this unique tachyarrhythmia. However, TdP does not always follow QT interval prolongation, and it can occur even in the absence of a prolonged QT interval. Worse still, even shortening of the QT interval may be associated with serious arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF).

It appears increasingly probable that the distinction between various ventricular tachyarrhythmias may be arbitrary. Drug-induced TdP, polymorphic VT, VT, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, and VF may represent discrete entities within a spectrum of drug-induced proarrhythmia. Although they are differentiated by the coupling interval and the duration of the QT interval, they appear to share a common substrate: a set of disturbances of repolarization characterized by triangulation, reverse use dependency, electrical instability of the action potential, and dispersion (TRIaD).

It is becoming increasingly evident that augmentation of TRIaD, rather than changes in the duration of the QT interval, provides the proarrhythmic substrate. In contrast, when not associated with an increase of TRIaD, QT interval prolongation can be an antiarrhythmic property. Electrophysiologically, augmentation of TRIaD can be explained by inhibition of hERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) channels. Because drug-induced disturbances in repolarization commonly result from inhibition of hERG channels or I(Kr), hERG blockade and the resulting effects are significant in understanding proarrhythmic risks.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^116NKmuV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: The following adverse reactions are discussed in more detail in other sections of the labeling.

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect or predict the rates observed in practice.

Multiple doses of fluoxetine have been administered to 10,782 patients with various diagnoses in U.S. clinical trials. In addition, there have been 425 patients administered fluoxetine in panic clinical trials. The stated frequencies represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse reaction of the type listed. A reaction was considered treatment-emergent if it occurred for the first time or worsened while receiving therapy following baseline evaluation.

- **Incidence in major depressive disorder placebo-controlled clinical trials**: Table 3 enumerates the most common treatment-emergent adverse reactions associated with the use of fluoxetine (incidence of at least 5% for fluoxetine and at least twice that for placebo within at least 1 of the indications) for the treatment of major depressive disorder, in U.S. controlled clinical trials. Table 5 enumerates treatment-emergent adverse reactions that occurred in 2% or more patients treated with fluoxetine and with incidence greater than placebo who participated in U.S. major depressive disorder controlled clinical trials.

### Treatment of status epilepticus and prolonged QT after massive intentional bupropion overdose with lidocaine [^116jyWVX]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant often used in the treatment of depression, tobacco cessation, seasonal affective disorder, and off-label for ADHD. Its primary mechanism of action is by blocking dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, and it is structurally similar to amphetamines. Toxic effects include, most notably and classically, seizures as well as tachycardia, agitation, nausea, vomiting, QT prolongation, QRS widening, and hypertension or hypotension. It has a narrow therapeutic window with a maximal daily dose of 450 mg.

We report the case of a 14-year-old female who ingested 15 g of extended-release bupropion, resulting in agitation, status epilepticus, prolonged QT devolving into pulseless ventricular tachycardia, and briefly ventricular fibrillation. This required a total of five cardioversions and one defibrillation. The QT interval eventually narrowed after supportive care and a lidocaine drip. The patient was able to be extubated just two days later with full cognitive function and an echocardiogram without cardiac dysfunction.

Seizure and cardiotoxicity, including prolonged QT, have been previously described with massive bupropion overdoses. To our knowledge, deterioration to ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation with successful treatment and shortening of the QT interval using a lidocaine bolus and drip has not been reported. Cardiotoxicity related to bupropion has previously been managed primarily with supportive care, avoiding QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics such as amiodarone, and at times requiring VA ECMO. Lidocaine has previously been used in toxicology cases to shorten QT intervals.

### Psychotropic drugs and ventricular repolarisation: The effects on QT interval, T-peak to T-end interval and QT dispersion [^112uaf5t]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to investigate, in a clinical setting, the effects of different classes of psychotropic drugs on cardiac electrophysiological measures linked with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a population of 1059 psychiatric inpatients to study the effects of various psychotropic drugs on the T-peak to T-end (TpTe) interval, QT dispersion, and QT interval.

- **Results**: Methadone use showed a strong association with TpTe prolongation (odds ratio (OR) = 12.66; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.9–41.1; p < 0.001), an effect independent from action on the QT interval. Mood stabilizers showed significant effects on ventricular repolarisation: lithium was associated with TpTe prolongation (OR = 2.12; 95% CI, 1.12–4; p = 0.02), while valproic acid was associated with TpTe reduction (OR = 0.6; 95% CI, 0.37–0.98; p = 0.04). Among antipsychotics, clozapine increased TpTe (OR = 9.5; 95% CI, 2.24–40.39; p = 0.002), and piperazine phenothiazines increased QT dispersion (OR = 2.73; 95% CI, 1.06–7.02; p = 0.037).

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with psychotropic drugs influences TpTe and QT dispersion. These parameters might be considered to better estimate the sudden cardiac death risk related to specific medications. Beyond antipsychotics and antidepressants, mood stabilizers significantly affect ventricular repolarisation.

### Prolonged QT syndrome and sedation: a case report and a review of the literature [^11744j9k]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Prolonged QT syndrome is the most common genetic arrhythmia syndrome, and the majority of patients are undiagnosed. The syndrome is characterized by abnormally long ventricular repolarization (QT interval) on electrocardiogram, which may manifest as syncopal episodes, arrhythmias, or sudden death. Arrhythmias may be precipitated by stress or medications. There are few randomized controlled trials examining the safety of typical sedation medications in patients with prolonged long-QT syndrome. This case describes the management of sedation in a patient with prolonged long-QT syndrome and reviews the literature regarding commonly utilized sedation medications.

### The impact of drug-induced QT interval prolongation on drug discovery and development [^112NJENC]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2003). Low credibility.

During the past decade, a number of non-cardiovascular drugs have had their label revised or have been withdrawn from the market because of unexpected post-marketing reports of sudden cardiac death associated with a prolongation of the QT interval, and an increased propensity to develop a ventricular tachyarrhythmia called Torsades de Pointes. Although a direct link between QT interval prolongation and arrhythmogenesis is still unclear, QT prolongation is now the subject of increased regulatory review and is considered a significant risk factor for predicting human safety of new chemical entities. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies are striving to improve the drug discovery and development process to identify, as early as possible, the risk of novel agents, or their metabolites, of causing QT interval prolongation and to make appropriate go/no-go decisions or modify their development programme accordingly.

### Evaluation of the FDA warning against prescribing citalopram at doses exceeding 40 mg [^1154wtor]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

A recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning cautioned that citalopram dosages exceeding 40 mg/day may cause abnormal heart rhythms, including torsade de pointes. The authors assessed relationships between citalopram use and ventricular arrhythmias and mortality.

- **Method**: A cohort study was conducted using Veterans Health Administration data between 2004 and 2009 from depressed patients who received a prescription for citalopram (N = 618,450) or for sertraline (N = 365,898), a comparison medication with no FDA warning. Cox regression models, adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics, were used to examine associations of antidepressant dosing with ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac, noncardiac, and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: Citalopram daily doses > 40 mg were associated with lower risks of ventricular arrhythmia (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.61–0.76), all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90–0.99), and noncardiac mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.86–0.96) compared with daily doses of 1–20 mg. No increased risks of cardiac mortality were found. Citalopram daily doses of 21–40 mg were associated with lower risks of ventricular arrhythmia (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.74–0.86) compared with dosages of 1–20 mg/day but did not have significantly different risks of any cause of mortality. The sertraline cohort revealed similar findings, except there were no significant associations between daily dose and either all-cause or noncardiac mortality.

### CYP2C19 variation, not citalopram dose nor serum level, is associated with QTc prolongation [^115yM5Yq]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2014). Low credibility.

Recently, an FDA Safety Communication warned of a dose-dependent risk for QTc prolongation with citalopram, which is metabolized by CYP2C19 of the cytochrome P450 system. We investigated associations between citalopram and escitalopram dose, serum concentration, CYP2C19 phenotype, and QTc.

We undertook a retrospective chart review of citalopram or escitalopram patients with the inclusion criteria of consistent medication dose, CYP2C19 phenotype (extensive metabolizers [EM], intermediate metabolizers [IM], poor metabolizers [PM]), and QTc interval on ECG. We further identified 42 citalopram users with citalopram serum concentration measurements and ECG. Regression and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the relationship between citalopram dose, citalopram serum concentration, CYP2C19 phenotype, and QTc interval.

Of 75 citalopram patients, the EM group had significantly shorter QTc intervals than a combined IM+PM group (427.1 ± 23.6 ms vs. 440.1 ± 26.6 ms, one-tailed t-test, p = 0.029). In the 80 escitalopram cohort, there was no significant difference in QTc between phenotype groups. There was no statistical correlation between citalopram [p = 0.62] or escitalopram [p = 0.30] dose and QTc. QTc was not associated with citalopram serum level [p = 0.45].

In contrast to the FDA warning, this study found no association between citalopram/escitalopram dose and QTc. However, PM of the drug tended to have longer QTc intervals. Our findings suggest cytochrome P450 genotyping in select patients may be helpful to guide medication optimization while limiting harmful effects.

### Medically serious adverse effects of newer antidepressants [^111adWhg]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Although newer antidepressants are generally considered safer than tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, they may still be associated with certain medically serious adverse effects. This review discusses cardiovascular adverse effects, seizures, abnormal bleeding, hyponatremia, and agranulocytosis. It summarizes data regarding the incidence and risk factors, and suggests strategies for reducing the risk of these adverse effects and managing them. Identifying risk factors, making appropriate antidepressant choices, and careful monitoring, when possible, may substantially reduce the incidence of these adverse effects and the morbidity associated with them.

### Pimozide [^1145wYdt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

Drug interactions: Because pimozide prolongs the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, an additive effect on the QT interval would be anticipated if it is administered with other drugs that also prolong the QT interval, such as phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, or antiarrhythmic agents. Accordingly, pimozide should not be given with:

- **Antiarrhythmic agents**: Dofetilide, sotalol, quinidine, other Class Ia and III anti-arrhythmics
- **Phenothiazines**: Mesoridazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine
- **Antibiotics**: Sparfloxacin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin
- **Antimalarials and others**: Halofantrine, mefloquine, pentamidine
- **Other QT-prolonging agents**: Arsenic trioxide, levomethadyl acetate, dolasetron mesylate, probucol, tacrolimus, ziprasidone, droperidol

Other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects should also be avoided. The use of macrolide antibiotics in patients with prolonged QT intervals has been rarely associated with ventricular arrhythmias, and such concomitant administration should not be undertaken. See contraindications.

Since pimozide is partly metabolized via CYP 3A4, it should not be administered concomitantly with inhibitors of this metabolic system, such as azole antifungal agents and protease inhibitor drugs. See contraindications.

Pimozide and Celexa: In a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with racemic citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Racemic citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or Cmax of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known. Concomitant use of pimozide and Celexa is not recommended.

### The modifying effect of the serum-to-dialysate potassium gradient on the cardiovascular safety of SSRIs in the hemodialysis population: A pharmacoepidemiologic study [^1169nGkc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). High credibility.

Hypokalemia is a risk factor for drug-induced QT prolongation. Larger serum-to-dialysate potassium gradients during hemodialysis (HD) may augment the proarrhythmic risks of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

- **Methods**: We conducted a cohort study using 2007–2017 data from the United States Renal Data System and a large dialysis provider to examine if the serum-to-dialysate potassium gradient modifies SSRI cardiac safety. Using a new-user design, we compared 1-year sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk among HD patients newly treated with higher (citalopram, escitalopram) versus lower (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) QT-prolonging potential SSRIs, overall and stratified by baseline potassium gradient (≥ 4 versus < 4 mEq/l). We used inverse probability of treatment-weighted survival models to estimate weighted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and conducted a confirmatory nested case-control study.

- **Results**: The study included 25,099 patients: 11,107 (44.3%) higher QT-prolonging potential SSRI new users and 13,992 (55.7%) lower QT-prolonging potential SSRI new users. Overall, higher versus lower QT-prolonging potential SSRI use was not associated with SCD (weighted HR 1.03 [95% CI 0.86–1.24]). However, a greater risk of SCD was associated with higher versus lower QT-prolonging potential SSRI use among patients with baseline potassium gradients ≥ 4 mEq/l but not among those with gradients < 4 mEq/l (weighted HR 2.17 [95% CI 1.16–4.03] versus 0.95 [0.78–1.16]). Nested case-control analyses yielded analogous results.

### SPL drug information for bedaquiline fumarate [^113aC9JH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

A boxed warning is issued regarding the use of bedaquiline fumarate PO (also known as Sirturo) and its potential to cause a prolonged QT interval. Extreme caution is advised for patients with conditions that may increase the risk of QT prolongation, especially when they are receiving medications known to prolong the QT interval or cause electrolyte imbalances.

- **Monitoring recommendations**: Obtain an ECG before and at least 2, 12, and 24 weeks after starting therapy. Measure serum potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations at baseline, correct them if abnormal, and continue to monitor these parameters if QT prolongation is detected.

- **Discontinuation criteria**: Discontinue bedaquiline if the patient develops a clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia or a QTcF interval of more than 500 msec, confirmed by a repeat ECG.

### Clinical and ECG effects of escitalopram overdose [^113sYotU]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

This study investigates the clinical effects of escitalopram overdose and determines the risk of QT prolongation and serotonin toxicity.

- **Methods**: A review of escitalopram overdoses in a clinical toxicology unit was conducted. Patient demographics, details of the ingestion, and clinical effects, including evidence of serotonin toxicity and complications such as arrhythmias and seizures, were recorded along with ICU admission and length of stay. QT and QRS intervals were manually measured on ECGs using a standardized approach. In a subgroup of 34 prospectively recruited patients, escitalopram was detected in the blood from 33 patients. Medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) were reported, and QT versus pulse rate was plotted on a QT nomogram to investigate QT prolongation.

- **Results**: The median ingested dose in the 79 presentations was 140 mg (IQR 75 to 260 mg; range 20 to 560 mg). In 46 cases, escitalopram was the only drug ingested, or all coingested drugs were nontoxic. The median length of stay for patients receiving clinically important coingestants was 19 hours (IQR 9 to 33 hours), compared with 12 hours (IQR 7 to 19 hours) for those receiving escitalopram alone. Serotonin toxicity occurred in 7 of the 46 escitalopram-only ingestions (15%) but in only 1 of the 33 patients coingesting other medications. Common features included inducible clonus and hyperreflexia. Central nervous system depression and ICU admissions were rare in escitalopram-only overdoses compared with cases involving sedative coingestants. Bradycardia (pulse rate < 60 beats/min) occurred in 11 cases (14%).

### Comparative cardiac safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors among individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis [^111jC9yX]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis may be particularly susceptible to the lethal cardiac consequences of drug-induced QT prolongation because they have a substantial cardiovascular disease burden and a high level of polypharmacy, as well as repeated exposure to electrolyte shifts during dialysis. Electrophysiological data indicate that among the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), citalopram and escitalopram prolong the QT interval to the greatest extent. However, the relative cardiac safety of SSRIs in the hemodialysis population is unknown.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study, we used data from a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries receiving hemodialysis included in the US Renal Data System registry (2007–2014). We employed a new-user design to compare the 1-year risk of sudden cardiac death among hemodialysis patients initiating SSRIs with a higher potential for prolonging the QT interval (citalopram, escitalopram) versus the risk among those initiating SSRIs with lower QT-prolonging potential (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios using inverse probability of treatment-weighted survival models, treating nonsudden cardiac death as a competing event.

- **Results**: The study included 30,932 (47.1%) hemodialysis patients who initiated SSRIs with higher QT-prolonging potential and 34,722 (52.9%) who initiated SSRIs with lower QT-prolonging potential. Initiation of an SSRI with higher versus lower QT-prolonging potential was associated with higher risk of sudden cardiac death.

### Citalopram and levosulpiride: A dangerous drug combination for QT prolongation [^111CKtFw]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

We report the case of an 89-year-old female patient who presented to the emergency department after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia treated by public access defibrillation. The admission electrocardiogram (ECG) showed extreme QT prolongation (650 milliseconds) with recurrent episodes of nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy was instituted. After history taking, it was found that the patient was on citalopram, and that, 2 days prior to admission, she had begun treatment with levosulpiride. This drug combination resulted in marked prolongation of the QT interval that triggered the electrical storm.

### Association between citalopram, escitalopram and QTc prolongation in a real-world geriatric setting [^115opggW]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended upper limits for citalopram dosing in older adults due to the risk of corrected-QT (QTc) prolongation, which was adopted and extended to escitalopram by Health Canada, the scientific basis is unclear. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between citalopram/escitalopram dosages and QTc interval in a real-world geriatric setting.

- **Methods**: We reviewed electronic health records at a university-affiliated geriatric health care center over a 7-year period to identify patients prescribed citalopram and escitalopram, who had an ECG within 90 days of initiation or dosage change. Linear regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between antidepressant dosage and QTc interval.

- **Results**: 137 patients were identified (citalopram = 97, escitalopram = 40). No association was found between citalopram, escitalopram, and QTc, in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. Among covariates, older age was significantly associated with QTc prolongation in the escitalopram group.

- **Limitations**: Limitations to the study include its retrospective design and the small sample size.

- **Conclusions**: These data do not support the FDA or Health Canada's recommended maximum dosages of citalopram or escitalopram in the elderly. Therefore, for patients already on higher doses of these medications, the risk of QTc prolongation may not always outweigh the risk of dose lowering, such as relapse. Until larger prospective studies become available, the decision to comply or not with these federal agencies' recommendations remains uncertain.

### Qt interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^115MYBW8]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Multiple strategies exist for characterizing the potential QT effects of pharmacotherapies. In vitro, new compounds are screened for antagonism of the delayed rectifier potassium channel, encoded by hERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene). Such effects are highly sensitive (though not specific) for risk of torsades de pointes. In light of well-publicized withdrawals of compounds from the US market, drugs with a high risk of QT prolongation in such assays may simply not be progressed into human trials. In registration trials, pre-treatment and post-treatment electrocardiograms may be assessed to determine QT effects, and regulatory bodies may request additional studies to clarify this risk. Although this approach may be useful for demonstrating group effects, it may not be sensitive to QT prolongation that occurs in particular patient subgroups or in a small number of individuals. To complement such studies, postmarketing surveillance allows detection of unanticipated events such as torsades de pointes, though such surveillance depends on voluntary reporting by clinicians of events and the ability to infer association with a particular treatment.

More recently, methods have been developed that allow rapid screening of electronic health records. This approach offers two key advantages. First, it may detect subtle changes that would not have been detected in postmarketing surveillance — such as modest increases in QT interval which would not otherwise be reported. Second, because medical records include a multitude of patient data, it enables more comprehensive analysis of potential drug effects on heart rhythm dynamics.

### Qt interval and antidepressant use: A cross sectional study of electronic health records [^116QEpVQ]. BMJ (2013). High credibility.

The study investigates the effects of escalating doses of antidepressants or methadone on the corrected QT (QTc) interval using electronic health records. Statistical significance was noted at two levels: *α < 0.05 and **α < 0.01.

### Citalopram, QTc interval prolongation, and torsade de pointes. How should we apply the recent FDA ruling [^1173zShR]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Recently, both the manufacturer of citalopram and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration have warned health care providers and patients about new information implicating drug-induced QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes when using citalopram in doses greater than 40 mg/day. This warning is not placed in the context of either benefits or risks in real-world clinical practice, leaving clinicians with an untenable choice between depriving patients of high-dose citalopram or facing malpractice litigation.

We reviewed the literature and found no cases of citalopram-induced sudden cardiac death among patients taking up to 60 mg/day of citalopram and free of risk factors for QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes. Because psychotropic drug-induced sudden cardiac death is an outlier in the absence of identified risk factors for QTc interval prolongation and torsade de pointes, we do not believe Phase 3 and Phase 4 studies provide sufficient information to limit prescribing practices for citalopram (20 mg to 60 mg/day).

We urge drug manufacturers and regulatory agencies to periodically publish full case reports of psychotropic drug-induced QTc interval prolongation, torsade de pointes, and sudden cardiac death so that clinicians and investigators may better understand the clinical implications of prescribing such drugs as citalopram.

### Symbyax [^114fMcjH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Thioridazine should not be administered with Symbyax or within a minimum of 5 weeks after discontinuation of Symbyax due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.20), and Drug Interactions (7.8)].

In a study of 19 healthy male subjects — including 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin — a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher Cmax and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared to the rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is dependent on the level of CYP2D6 isozyme activity. Thus, this study suggests that drugs inhibiting CYP2D6, such as certain SSRIs including fluoxetine, will produce elevated plasma levels of thioridazine [see Contraindications (4.2)].

Thioridazine administration results in a dose-related prolongation of the QTc interval, associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias like torsades de pointes-type arrhythmias and sudden death. This risk is expected to increase with fluoxetine-induced inhibition of thioridazine metabolism [see Contraindications (4.2)].

Due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated thioridazine plasma levels, thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued [see Contraindications (4.2)].

Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of imipramine or its active metabolites.

### Fluoxetine hydrochloride [^115mnJjv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **QT prolongation**: Post-marketing cases of QT interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia, including Torsades de Pointes, have been reported in patients treated with fluoxetine. Fluoxetine should be used with caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, a previous history of QT prolongation, a family history of long QT syndrome or sudden cardiac death, and other conditions that predispose to QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmia. Such conditions include the concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent myocardial infarction, uncompensated heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and other significant arrhythmias, as well as conditions that predispose to increased fluoxetine exposure (e.g. overdose, hepatic impairment, use of CYP2D6 inhibitors, CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status, or use of other highly protein-bound drugs) [see Contraindications (4.2), Adverse Reactions (6.2), Drug Interactions (7.7, 7.8), Overdose (10.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Contraindications**: Pimozide and thioridazine are contraindicated for use with fluoxetine. Avoid the concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including specific antipsychotics (e.g. ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol), specific antibiotics (e.g. erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin), Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g. quinidine, procainamide), Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol), and others (e.g. pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine).

### Orgovyx [^1164VxZg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information).

- **QT/QTc interval prolongation**: Advise patients that androgen deprivation therapy treatment with Orgovyx may prolong the QT interval. Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of QT prolongation and advise them to contact their healthcare provider immediately if any signs or symptoms of QT prolongation occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Hypersensitivity**: Inform patients that Orgovyx is contraindicated if they have experienced severe hypersensitivity to relugolix or any of the product components [see Contraindications (4)]. Inform patients that Orgovyx can cause severe hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Advise patients who experience hypersensitivity symptoms to discontinue Orgovyx and promptly contact their healthcare provider.

- **Androgen deprivation**: Inform patients about adverse reactions related to androgen deprivation therapy with Orgovyx, which include hot flashes, flushing of the skin, increased weight, decreased sex drive, and difficulties with erectile function [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

- **Embryo-fetal toxicity**: Inform patients that Orgovyx can be harmful to a developing fetus and can cause loss of pregnancy. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose of Orgovyx [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Exxua [^114t8SXF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling: suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)], QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)], serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)], and activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. During premarketing assessment, multiple doses of Exxua were administered to 1,976 adult patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in controlled phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, including 1,639 patients in placebo-controlled phase 2 and 3 trials in MDD, with 237 patients exposed for over six months. The population treated with Exxua in the pooled placebo-controlled studies ranged from 15 to 78 years of age, was 34% male and 66% female, and was 80% Caucasian, 11% Black, and 9% other race.

The adverse reaction data below are based on two placebo-controlled, flexible-dose clinical studies (Study 1, Study 2) in which either Exxua 18.2 mg to 72.6 mg (n = 226) or placebo (n = 230) was administered to adult patients with MDD during an 8-week double-blind treatment period [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Study 1 had a median age of 39 years and was 61% female, 73% Caucasian, 9% Black, 2% Asian.

### QT as a safety biomarker in drug development [^114h4sNf]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

The cardiovascular safety of new drugs is an overarching concern for all stakeholders: the pharmaceutical industry and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to approval, and doctors and patients during post-release drug use. Of the many cardiac safety concerns that accompany the development of new drugs, including those related to vasculature and valvular tissue, the potential for myopathies, and the possibility of other electrophysiologic perturbations, the most pressing concern is the potential for ventricular arrhythmias causing sudden death.

### QT interval and antidepressant use: a cross-sectional study of electronic health records [^114vdd13]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

For the primary analysis, we identified individuals treated with at least one medication of interest and selected the most recent electrocardiogram (within 90 days) occurring at least 14 days following a prescription. The lower threshold was chosen to allow time for individuals to fill the prescription and to ensure that the drug had reached a steady state at the new dose. Where multiple electrocardiograms for a given patient were within this time window, we selected the one corresponding to the maximum drug dose in order to enrich sampling of the high end of the dose range.

Three sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the assumptions of antidepressant exposure in the study design. We first excluded individuals who did not have a follow-up prescription after their initial prescription and subsequently included only QTc measurements obtained 14–30 days after prescription. To further assess the impact of concomitant medications on our analysis, we also excluded individuals with prescriptions of typical or atypical antipsychotics or known QT prolongers such as astemizole, cisapride, or methadone within one year of the electrocardiogram.

### QT interval and antidepressant use: A cross sectional study of electronic health records [^112CqqpN]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

The implications of this study for clinicians merit careful consideration. One notable finding is that nearly one in five patients treated with these antidepressants who underwent electrocardiography had QT intervals considered abnormal. The clinical significance of this prolongation, including the risk of induction of torsades de pointes, remains unknown. However, the incidence of torsades de pointes is low among general clinical populations and is similar among patients treated with antidepressants. For this reason, QTc is often used as a proxy measure for the risk of torsades associated with medication, recognizing that it is an imperfect surrogate. Indeed, the FDA warning for citalopram was issued despite epidemiological data showing no difference in risk for arrhythmia.

The question of whether patients for whom antidepressants will be prescribed should routinely have electrocardiograms before and/or after treatment starts cannot be addressed directly by this study. However, in terms of treatment selection, our results suggest some variation within treatment classes in terms of risk. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as sertraline may be associated with less risk than citalopram and might be preferred in individuals with other risk factors. For escitalopram, our data are less definitive but suggest some risk may need to be considered for this drug as well. Of interest, bupropion is routinely used as an augmentation strategy when initial antidepressant treatment fails to achieve remission, though it is not applicable.

### The relevance of prolonged QTc measurement to pediatric psychopharmacology [^113WhuF6]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

To consider the relevance of prolonged QTc (QT interval corrected for rate) to pediatric psychopharmacology, the authors reviewed publications on QTc prolongation and sudden death indexed in Medline from 1968 to November 2002.

The search yielded more than 20,000 publications. Review manuscripts with clinical recommendations outnumber the few pediatric studies of QTc duration during treatment. Most reviews have been published in the past 5 years, during a time when the Food and Drug Administration restricted five psychotropic medications because of QTc prolongation (sertindole: not approved; thioridazine, mesoridazine, and droperidol: black-box warning; and ziprasidone: bolded warning) and nine somatic medications due to QTc prolongation.

Pretreatment screening, careful selection of psychotropic and/or somatic medication combinations, and recognition of QTc prolongation in electrocardiographic tracings during treatment with medications that prolong QTc are important components of clinical practice.

### Drug-induced long QT in adult psychiatric inpatients: The 5-year cross-sectional ECG screening outcome in psychiatry study [^117LoFFm]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to determine the prevalence of drug-induced long QT at admission to a public psychiatric hospital and to document the associated factors using a cross-sectional approach.

- **Method**: All ECG recordings over a 5-year period were reviewed for drug-induced long QT (heart-rate corrected QT ≥ 500 ms and certain or probable drug imputability) and associated conditions. Patients with drug-induced long QT (N = 62) were compared with a sample of patients with normal ECG (N = 143).

- **Results**: Among 6,790 inpatients, 27.3% had abnormal ECG, 1.6% had long QT, and 0.9% qualified as drug-induced long QT case subjects. Sudden cardiac death was recorded in five patients, and torsade de pointes was recorded in seven other patients. Relative to comparison subjects, patients with drug-induced long QT had significantly higher frequencies of hypokalemia, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, HIV infection, and abnormal T wave morphology. Haloperidol, sertindole, clotiapine, phenothiazines, fluoxetine, citalopram (including escitalopram), and methadone were significantly more frequent in patients with drug-induced long QT. After adjustment for hypokalemia, HCV infection, HIV infection, and abnormal T wave morphology, the effects of haloperidol, clotiapine, phenothiazines, and citalopram (including escitalopram) remained statistically significant. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis based on the number of endorsed factors per patient indicated that 85.5% of drug-induced long QT patients had two or more factors, whereas 81.1% of patients with normal ECG had fewer than two.

### SPL drug information for droperidol [^116z8zfi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Boxed warning regarding the use of droperidol intramuscularly and the risk of prolonged QT interval, including torsade de pointes, is emphasized. It is advised not to use droperidol in patients with known or suspected QT prolongation, including those with congenital long QT syndrome. Extreme caution should be exercised in patients at risk for QT prolongation, such as those with congestive heart failure, bradycardia, cardiac hypertrophy, significant cardiac disease, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or those receiving diuretics, MAOIs, or other drugs known to increase the QT interval.

### Ziprasidone mesylate [^111EEU9b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

In the second phase of the study, the effect of ziprasidone on QTc length was not augmented by the presence of a metabolic inhibitor, ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily).

In placebo-controlled trials, oral ziprasidone increased the QTc interval compared to placebo by approximately 10 msec at the highest recommended daily dose of 160 mg. In clinical trials with oral ziprasidone, the electrocardiograms of 2 out of 2988 (0.06%) patients who received ziprasidone mesylate for injection and 1 out of 440 (0.23%) patients who received placebo revealed QTc intervals exceeding the potentially clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec. In the ziprasidone-treated patients, neither case suggested a direct role of ziprasidone. One patient had a history of prolonged QTc and a screening measurement of 489 msec; QTc was 503 msec during ziprasidone treatment. The other patient had a QTc of 391 msec at the end of treatment with ziprasidone, and upon switching to thioridazine experienced QTc measurements of 518 and 593 msec.

- **Risks associated with QT/QTc prolongation**: Some drugs that prolong the QT/QTc interval have been associated with the occurrence of torsade de pointes and sudden unexplained death. The relationship of QT prolongation to torsade de pointes is clearest for larger increases (20 msec and greater), but it is possible that smaller QT/QTc prolongations may also increase risk or increase it in susceptible individuals.

Although torsade de pointes has not been observed in association with the use of ziprasidone in premarketing studies, and experience is too limited to rule out an increased risk, there have been rare post-marketing reports.

### Qt interval and antidepressant use: a cross sectional study of electronic health records [^112TzSkE]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

A total of 1,472,965 valid QTc measurements were extracted from 1,497,333 electrocardiograms (98.4%). Of the study patients receiving a prescription of interest, 38,397 had an electrocardiogram within the 14–90 day window. Characteristics of this cohort and the proportion receiving each medication are summarized below. Age, race, sex, insurance, year of electrocardiogram, history of major depression, history of myocardial infarction, history of ventricular arrhythmia, history of hypertension, history of hyperlipidemia, and Charlson comorbidity score were all significantly associated with QTc interval (P < 0.01).

- **Demographics and clinical features**: The study cohort consisted of 38,397 adult patients with an electrocardiogram recorded 14–90 days after the prescription of an antidepressant or methadone between February 1990 and August 2011. Values are numbers (percentages) of patients unless stated otherwise. IQR represents the interquartile range, and SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. The corrected QT (QTc) interval was recorded on electrocardiograms. Race and ethnicity were collected using a single field in the electronic health record, so subjects who identify as Hispanic are not further characterized.

Patients prescribed a medication of interest but without QTc measurements in the exposure period were compared with those with available electrocardiograms to assess selection bias.

### High-dose citalopram and escitalopram and the risk of out-of-hospital death [^114zDY8y]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Studies demonstrating that higher doses of citalopram (> 40 mg) and escitalopram (> 20 mg) prolong the corrected QT interval prompted regulatory agency warnings, which are controversial given the absence of confirmatory clinical outcome studies. This study compared the risk of potential arrhythmia-related deaths for high doses of these selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to that for equivalent doses of fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline.

- **Methods**: The Tennessee Medicaid retrospective cohort study included 54,220 persons 30–74 years of age without cancer or other life-threatening illness who were prescribed high-dose SSRIs from 1998 through 2011. The mean age was 47 years, and 76% were female. Demographic characteristics and comorbidity for individual SSRIs were comparable. Because arrhythmia-related deaths are typically sudden and occur outside the hospital, the study analyzed out-of-hospital sudden unexpected deaths as well as sudden cardiac deaths, a more specific indicator of proarrhythmic effects.

- **Results**: The adjusted risk of sudden unexpected death for citalopram did not differ significantly from that for the other SSRIs. The respective hazard ratios (HRs) for citalopram versus escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.40–1.75), 1.24 (95% CI, 0.75–2.05), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.45–1.24), and 1.53 (95% CI, 0.91–2.55). There were no significant differences for sudden cardiac death or all study deaths, nor were there significant differences among high-risk patients (≥ 60 years of age, upper quartile baseline cardiovascular risk).

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: Treatment of tics in people with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^113ieV5u]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Tourette's syndrome, specifically with respect to antipsychotics, AAN 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining an ECG and measuring the QTc interval before and after starting pimozide or ziprasidone, or if antipsychotics are coadministered with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval.
