## Question

Can diabetic kidney disease be diagnosed without a renal biopsy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether diabetic kidney disease can be diagnosed without a renal biopsy, how reliable that diagnosis is, and under what circumstances a biopsy might be necessary. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition of diabetic kidney disease and how guidelines frame diagnosis. Then, I should verify the typical clinical phenotype that supports a presumptive diagnosis without biopsy. Next, I will examine the limitations and misclassification risk, especially the prevalence of non-diabetic kidney disease in people with diabetes. After that, I need to check which atypical features should trigger biopsy consideration. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach and state a clear bottom line answer with appropriate caveats.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't jump to conclusions. Diabetic kidney disease is generally defined as CKD in a person with diabetes attributable to diabetes itself, typically characterized by persistent albuminuria and/or a sustained reduction in eGFR, and in most cases this is a presumptive clinical diagnosis rather than a biopsy-proven entity; the term "diabetic glomerulopathy" is reserved for biopsy-proven diabetic kidney disease, underscoring that biopsy is not required for routine diagnosis [^112VFwDP] [^115Cxoto] [^114LsktC].

> I will now examine the clinical phenotype that supports a presumptive diagnosis without biopsy. The classic pattern includes long-standing diabetes, presence of diabetic retinopathy as a marker of microvascular disease, albuminuria without active urinary sediment, and a gradual decline in eGFR. Importantly, guidelines endorse annual screening with ACR and eGFR to detect DKD and do not require biopsy in typical presentations, which aligns with real-world practice where biopsy is reserved for selected cases [^114LsktC] [^112bBHEU] [^111RFXh2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about accuracy; I need to check how often presumptive DKD is wrong. Multiple biopsy series show that among patients with diabetes and kidney disease, roughly 40–60% may have non-diabetic kidney disease alone or mixed DKD plus NDKD, and prospective unselected cohorts demonstrate that traditional clinical predictors poorly discriminate DKD from NDKD at the individual level, meaning misclassification is common if we rely solely on clinical features [^116rJhrb] [^112VnMLT] [^113Qrn5Q].

> Wait, let me verify the specific limitations of commonly used clinical indicators. Longer diabetes duration and presence of retinopathy increase the likelihood of DKD, but absence of retinopathy does not reliably exclude DKD, and conversely, a substantial fraction of biopsy-proven DKD lacks retinopathy. Similarly, hematuria, rapid progression, or short diabetes duration raise suspicion for NDKD, yet no single parameter or combination has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to replace biopsy in atypical cases [^112VnMLT] [^114mpB4z] [^116XqMFu].

> Next, I should review when biopsy changes management, because that is the crux. NDKD includes potentially treatable glomerulonephritides such as IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and pauci-immune GN, where timely immunosuppression can alter renal outcomes; biopsy also clarifies mixed disease and can refine prognosis, so missing NDKD risks undertreatment with standard DKD care alone [^116ZNHnX] [^116iqaJR] [^115ZPaJv].

> I need to ensure I articulate the atypical features that should prompt biopsy consideration. These include rapidly declining kidney function, nephrotic-range proteinuria, active urinary sediment, absence of retinopathy with significant proteinuria, short duration of diabetes with advanced CKD, refractory hypertension suggesting renovascular disease, or a discordant course after appropriate RAAS blockade. Guidelines explicitly advise evaluating for non-DKD causes when such atypical features are present [^112atP7f] [^113mHrmt].

> Let me consider the safety and feasibility of biopsy so I don't overstate its use. Contemporary series indicate complication rates are acceptable when standard precautions are followed, but risks rise with lower eGFR, uncontrolled blood pressure, and anticoagulation; thus, decisions should weigh bleeding risk against the potential to uncover treatable NDKD, and procedural safety measures should be optimized if biopsy is pursued [^1157KwLd] [^1159ujxf].

> But wait, what if we could avoid biopsy with better noninvasive markers; I should double-check the status of emerging tools. Studies explore serum or urinary biomarkers, imaging, and composite indices, yet no validated noninvasive test reliably distinguishes DKD from NDKD at the individual level today, so biopsy remains the gold standard when the clinical picture is atypical or management would change with a different diagnosis [^114bnZ2V] [^111jKt9s] [^114AqWMr].

> I will now synthesize a practical approach. In patients with typical features, a clinical diagnosis of DKD is appropriate and guideline-concordant. In those with atypical features or when immunotherapy for NDKD is contemplated, pursue renal biopsy. In borderline cases, consider nephrology referral for risk stratification and shared decision-making, recognizing that over-reliance on clinical heuristics leads to frequent misclassification and missed opportunities for disease-modifying therapy in NDKD [^114LsktC] [^113dkv3M] [^115j1G8h].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the answer clearly. Yes, diabetic kidney disease can be diagnosed without a renal biopsy in most patients who present with the typical phenotype of diabetes, albuminuria, and/or declining eGFR, especially when accompanied by diabetic retinopathy and a compatible time course. However, because a substantial proportion of patients with diabetes and CKD harbor NDKD that may be treatable, biopsy should be considered whenever atypical features are present or when the diagnosis would alter management, acknowledging that current clinical predictors are insufficiently accurate for universal use [^112VFwDP] [^116rJhrb] [^112atP7f].

---

In most patients with diabetes, **DKD is diagnosed clinically** based on persistent albuminuria and/or a sustained eGFR decline, without requiring a kidney biopsy [^114LsktC] [^112z3HxX]. Biopsy is reserved for **atypical features** — such as rapid progression, active urinary sediment, or absence of retinopathy — where non-diabetic kidney disease is suspected [^112atP7f] [^113mHrmt]. Because clinical predictors have limited accuracy, biopsy remains the gold standard when the diagnosis is uncertain or management would change [^113Qrn5Q] [^115j1G8h].

---

## Clinical criteria for diagnosing DKD without biopsy

According to ADA 2025 and KDIGO, **DKD is diagnosed clinically** in patients with diabetes who have:

- **Persistent albuminuria**: Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 30 mg/g confirmed on at least two occasions over 3–6 months [^112bBHEU] [^114idCUp].

- **Sustained eGFR decline**: eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² on at least two occasions over 3 months, in the absence of other causes [^114LsktC] [^112z3HxX].

- **Typical clinical features**: Long-standing diabetes, presence of diabetic retinopathy, gradual progression of proteinuria, and hypertension [^114LsktC] [^1123ehBV].

These criteria are widely accepted and **do not require biopsy** for most patients with diabetes and CKD [^112VFwDP].

---

## Limitations of clinical diagnosis

While clinical diagnosis is sufficient in most cases, it has limitations:

- **Overlap with non-diabetic kidney disease (NDKD)**: Up to 40% of patients with diabetes and CKD may have NDKD or mixed DKD/NDKD, which can mimic DKD clinically [^116rJhrb].

- **Atypical presentations**: Rapid progression, active urinary sediment, or absence of retinopathy suggest NDKD and may require biopsy [^112atP7f] [^113mHrmt].

- **Limited accuracy of clinical predictors**: Duration of diabetes, retinopathy, and proteinuria have limited predictive value for differentiating DKD from NDKD [^113Qrn5Q] [^116XqMFu].

---

## Indications for renal biopsy in DKD

Renal biopsy is indicated when **atypical features** are present, including:

| **Clinical feature** | **Indication for biopsy** |
|-|-|
| Rapid progression of renal impairment | Suspected NDKD [^112atP7f] [^113mHrmt] |
| Active urinary sediment (hematuria, dysmorphic RBCs) | Suspected glomerulonephritis [^112atP7f] [^113mHrmt] |
| Absence of diabetic retinopathy | Suspected NDKD [^112atP7f] |
| Nephrotic syndrome | Suspected NDKD [^112atP7f] [^113mHrmt] |
| Refractory hypertension | Suspected renovascular disease [^112atP7f] [^113mHrmt] |
| Rapidly increasing proteinuria | Suspected NDKD [^112atP7f] [^113mHrmt] |

---

Biopsy is also considered when the diagnosis is uncertain or when **management would change** based on histology [^116ZNHnX] [^1151Jggz].

---

## Role of renal biopsy in differentiating DKD from NDKD

Renal biopsy is the **gold standard** for differentiating DKD from NDKD, providing definitive histopathological diagnosis [^115j1G8h]. It identifies:

- **DKD**: Typical lesions include mesangial expansion, glomerular basement membrane thickening, and nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions) [^112iotGk].

- **NDKD**: Common findings include IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and acute interstitial nephritis [^116iqaJR] [^1146mJfF].

- **Mixed DKD/NDKD**: Coexistence of diabetic and non-diabetic lesions, which is not uncommon [^116rJhrb] [^115j1G8h].

However, biopsy is invasive, carries risks (bleeding, infection), and is not feasible in all settings, limiting its routine use [^1157KwLd] [^115j1G8h].

---

## Emerging non-invasive biomarkers

Efforts are underway to identify **non-invasive biomarkers** to differentiate DKD from NDKD. Promising candidates include:

- **Urinary microRNAs**: Potential markers of DKD severity and progression [^111jKt9s].

- **Triglyceride/cystatin C ratio**: Suggested as a simple, non-invasive indicator of DKD [^116GnFq1].

- **Serum hemoglobin concentration**: Reflects tubulointerstitial impairment and may predict DKD progression [^114o6FiD].

These biomarkers are promising but **require further validation** before routine clinical use [^114bnZ2V].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize **clinical diagnosis** of DKD based on albuminuria and eGFR, with biopsy reserved for atypical cases [^114LsktC] [^113mHrmt]. They also recommend annual screening for DKD in patients with diabetes, using ACR and eGFR, and referral to nephrology for uncertainty about etiology or rapidly progressing disease [^112bBHEU] [^113dkv3M].

---

## Conclusion

In summary, **DKD can be diagnosed clinically** in most patients with diabetes using albuminuria and eGFR criteria, without biopsy [^114LsktC]. Biopsy is reserved for atypical presentations or when NDKD is suspected, as clinical predictors have limited accuracy [^116ZNHnX] [^113Qrn5Q]. Emerging non-invasive biomarkers may improve differentiation in the future, but biopsy remains the gold standard when the diagnosis is uncertain or management would change [^115j1G8h].

### Timing of kidney biopsy in type 2 diabetic patients: a stepwise approach [^113LcwDz]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most prevalent cause of renal disease in type 2 diabetic patients and is usually diagnosed clinically. A kidney biopsy is considered when non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD) is suspected, such as rapid progression in renal function impairment and severe proteinuria. Still, there is yet no consensus on the timing of kidney biopsy in type 2 diabetic patients. This study aims to identify markers that can help differentiate between DN and NDRD and guide the decision of kidney biopsy.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed patients with type 2 diabetes who received kidney biopsy from 2008 to 2017 at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Ophthalmologist consultation and outpatient records, diagnosis of kidney biopsy, laboratory data, and clinical characteristics were collected.

Results

This study enrolled 160 type 2 diabetic patients, among which 120 (75%) had isolated DN and 40 (25%) had NDRD ± DN (26 had isolated NDRD, and 14 had NDRD superimposed on DN). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, DM duration (odds ratio [OR]: 0.907; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.842–0.977; P = 0.01), diabetic retinopathy (OR: 0.196; 95% CI: 0.061–0.627; P = 0.006), and urinary RBC (OR: 1.068; 95% CI: 1.024–1.115; P = 0.002) were independent predictors of NDRD. In patients with diabetic retinopathy (n = 112, 70%), the presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, pan-retinal photocoagulation, and hematuria were factors predicting NDRD; and in patients without diabetic retinopathy (n = 48, 30%), short DM duration and hematuria were factors predicting NDRD.

Conclusions

Using diabetic retinopathy, DM duration, and hematuria, we developed a 3-step approach to stratify patients into three categories with the different likelihoods of having NDRD. Then different strategies could be taken accordingly. Our stepwise approach is easy to follow and may serve as an appropriate and useful tool to help clinicians in making decisions of kidney biopsy in type 2 DM patients presenting with kidney diseases.

### Urinary sediment microRNAs can be used as potential noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis, reflecting the severity and prognosis of diabetic nephropathy [^111jKt9s]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has gradually increased with the development of a social economy, and the number of patients with diabetes is expected to exceed 693 million by 2045. Approximately 40% of diabetic patients are prone to the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). DN is one of the most common microvascular complications of diabetes and is considered the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Many scholars have found that some patients with diabetes and kidney disease have different clinical manifestations and sensitivities to treatment than those with typical DN. Apart from DN, diabetic patients with kidney disease may also have non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD). According to reports, the incidence of NDRD is ~53%, which varies among countries, possibly due to race, region, and selection criteria for renal biopsy. IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and membranous nephropathy (MN) are the major types of NDRD. Li et al. conducted a 5-year longitudinal follow-up survival analysis and found that the prognosis of the NDRD group was better than that of the DN group, which indicates that patients with type 2 diabetes who were diagnosed with NDRD at the early stage can achieve an improved prognosis after appropriate and timely treatment measures are given. For diabetic patients with kidney disease, it is not feasible to estimate a diagnosis of DN based on experience. Instead, consideration should be given to diabetic patients with other kidney diseases, especially MN and IgAN, which are very common. Since DN and NDRD are not the same type of disease, their pathological characteristics, clinical manifestations, treatment responses, disease progression rates, and prognoses all differ, and thus, an accurate differential diagnosis is particularly important. The gold standard for distinguishing DN and NDRD is renal biopsy, but it cannot be performed routinely because of its invasiveness, high cost, and high technical requirements. Therefore, a simple, stable, and reliable identification method is an urgent clinical need. However, an ideal noninvasive diagnostic model for DN has not yet been established nationally or abroad.

### Characterization of diabetic kidney disease in 235 patients: clinical and pathological insights with or without concurrent non-diabetic kidney disease [^117F5pvh]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, this study identifies independent risk factors for DKD + NDKD, including BMI, blood creatinine, microscopic erythrocyte grade, urine IgG/urine creatinine ratio, and serum IgA levels. These clinical factors suggest a high likelihood of comorbid NDKD in these patients, highlighting the need for further renal biopsy. Clinicians should closely monitor these factors to inform a more individualized treatment plan. Based on pathological results, timely adjustments to the treatment regimen are essential, ensuring that therapeutic strategies are optimized to address both DKD and any coexisting NDKD, thereby improving patient outcomes.

### Insights into the role of renal biopsy in patients with T2DM: a literature review of global renal biopsy results [^115Mg1bY]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Renal biopsy performed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for atypical or suspected diabetic kidney disease (DKD) reveals one of three possibilities: diabetic nephropathy (DN, pathological diagnosis of DKD), nondiabetic kidney disease (NDKD) and DN plus NDKD (mixed form). NDKD (including the mixed form) is increasingly being recognized worldwide. With the emerging concept of DKD and the complexity of routine application of renal biopsy, the identification of "clinical indicators" to differentiate DKD from NDKD has been an area of active research.

Methods

The PubMed database was searched for relevant articles mainly according to the keyword search method. We reviewed prevalence of the three types of DKD and different pathological lesions of NDKD. We also reviewed the clinical indicators used to identify DKD and NDKD.

Results

The literature search identified 40 studies (5304 data) worldwide between 1977 and 2019 that looked at global renal biopsy and pathological NDKD lesions. The overall prevalence rate of DN, NDKD and DN plus NDKD is reported to be 41.3, 40.6 and 18.1%, respectively. In Asia, Africa (specifically Morocco and Tunisia) and Europe, the most common isolated NDKD pathological type is membranous nephropathy, representing 24.1, 15.1 and 22.6% of cases, respectively. In contrast, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is reported to be the primary pathological type in North America (specifically the USA) and Oceania (specifically New Zealand), representing 22% and 63.9% of cases, respectively. Tubulointerstitial disease accounts for a high rate in the mixed group (21.7%), with acute interstitial nephritis being the most prevalent (9.3%), followed by acute tubular necrosis (9.0%). Regarding clinical indicators to differentiate DKD from NDKD, a total of 14 indicators were identified included in 42 studies. Among these, the most commonly studied indicators included diabetic retinopathy, duration of diabetes, proteinuria and hematuria. Regrettably, indicators with high sensitivity and specificity have not yet been identified.

Conclusion

To date, renal biopsy is still the gold standard to diagnose diabetes complicated with renal disease, especially when T2DM patients present atypical DKD symptoms (e.g. absence of diabetic retinopathy, shorter duration of diabetes, microscopic hematuria, sub-nephrotic range proteinuria, lower glycated hemoglobin, lower fasting blood glucose). We conclude that renal biopsy as early as possible is of great significance to enable personalized treatment to T2DM patients.

### Potential value of three-dimensional ultrasonography in diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy in Chinese diabetic population with kidney injury [^111AJGJr]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common metabolic diseases in the world. It is estimated that the overall prevalence rate of adult diabetes has reached 10.9% in 2013 in China. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common and important complications of diabetes. The pathological process of renal changes is quite diverse, which can be observed from early hyperfiltration with an increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to late nephrosclerosis and fibrosis. An estimated 30–40% of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are afflicted by nephropathy. Nondiabetic renal disease (NDRD) refers to diabetes with other kidney diseases, such as IgA nephropathy (IgAN) or membranous nephropathy (MN).

The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment, and prognosis are different between DN and NDRD. In addition, NDRD has a relatively better prognosis since it is usually treatable and even curable, whereas the renal lesions in DN are believed to be more irreversible. Renal biopsy is considered as the canonical standard to discriminate DN from NDRD. However, renal biopsy is an invasive test that is associated with several risks. In practice, a large proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are not formally evaluated by renal biopsy. Instead of pathological diagnosis, DN patients are usually diagnosed based on their clinical symptoms. In that case, NDRD patients are likely misdiagnosed as DN and thus could not be properly treated. Therefore, it is very important to discover a new non-invasive diagnostic indicator for the clinical diagnoses of DN and NDRD.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111wk3BT]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic nephropathy, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor urinary albumin (such as spot urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio) and eGFR 1–4 times per year in patients with established diabetic kidney disease, depending on the stage of the disease.

### Diagnosis and management of type 2 diabetic kidney disease [^11462LXM]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of CKD and ESRD worldwide, and carries with it enormous human and societal costs. The goal of this review is to provide an update on the diagnosis and management of DKD based on a comprehensive review of the medical literature. Topics addressed include the evolving presentation of DKD, clinical differentiation of DKD from non-DKD, a state-of-the-art evaluation of current treatment strategies, and promising emerging treatments. It is expected that the review will help clinicians to diagnose and manage patients with DKD.

### Insights into the role of renal biopsy in patients with T2DM: a literature review of global renal biopsy results [^113pR4vV]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a literature review using the PubMed literature database covering the time period between 1977 and 2019. The following keywords (and their combination) were used: "type 2 diabetes", "diabetic kidney disease", "renal biopsy", "nondiabetic kidney disease", "pathological lesions" and "clinical indicators". Relevant published papers listed on the web page of the "similar articles" section of PubMed/automatically recommended were also included. Studies with a small number of cases and those failing to list the pathological NDKD lesions were excluded. All articles on renal biopsy results and pathological NDKD lesions in T2DM patients (40 articles in total) were included (summarized in Table 1, with studies describing pathological NDKD lesions listed as the top three). Additionally, articles on relevant clinical indicators to differentiate DKD from NDKD (42 articles in total) were included (summarized in Table 3).

This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.

### Insights into the role of renal biopsy in patients with T2DM: a literature review of global renal biopsy results [^114AqWMr]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Although the results from our review indicate the importance of kidney biopsy in T2DM complicated with renal disease, we admit that there are still some problems in applying this procedure. For example, kidney biopsy was considered to be safe in most studies, but patients with T2DM and kidney disease are usually older, and diabetes can cause damage to blood vessels and multiple systems, which might make renal biopsy more complicated. In addition, there is no consensus on the safety of kidney biopsy between kidney diseases complicating T2DM and kidney diseases without diabetes globally. Moreover, the decision-making process for kidney biopsy is mostly determined by the attending doctor, and research on the development of standardized criteria for performing renal biopsy in patients with diabetes is very limited.

In view of the above-mentioned issues, we suggest that future studies should focus on the identification of indicators of DKD and NDKD, not only those at the biochemical level but also at other levels, such as ultrasound and genomics. The availability of such indicators will increase the clinican's confidence in making a diagnosis and optimize the decision-making process regarding the implementation of kidney biopsy. In addition, future research can make full use of modern technological advances to achieve data sharing, conduct analyses of large datasets and apply innovative experimental designs. By carrying out dynamic monitoring of and long-term follow-ups on T2DM patients, future studies can gain a deeper understanding of the medical methods needed to identify DKD and NDKD and allow a more comprehensive interpretation and evaluation of renal biopsy's application value in T2DM complicated with renal diseases.

Our review has a number of limitations. First, we only used the PubMed database for our literature search, which may have resulted in omissions of some articles. In addition, we did not use additional statistical methods to quantify our conclusions, such as meta-analysis. In view of the deficiencies of our review, we will continue to pay attention to whether more research data appear, especially data from Africa, North America and Europe, and use a systematic approach to analyze the literature.

### Insights into the role of renal biopsy in patients with T2DM: a literature review of global renal biopsy results [^115DATbc]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The number of persons with diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing globally, especially type 2 DM (T2DM). In the USA, 23 million adults were diagnosed with diabetes in 2016, of whom 90.9% had T2DM and only 5.8% had type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Diabetes can lead to many microvascular complications. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a long-term and major complication of DM that occurs in approximately 30% of patients with T1DM and approximately 40% of those with T2DM. It is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide and is associated with the occurrence of and death due to cardiovascular diseases, especially in T2DM patients. In high-risk groups, such as middle-aged African Americans, native Americans and Hispanics, the incidence of ESRD caused by DKD continues to rise. The various complications and comorbidities associated with DKD and ESRD places a heavy economic burden on healthcare systems.

### Histological evidence of diabetic kidney disease precede clinical diagnosis [^115bppcY]. American Journal of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In the absence of a histological diagnosis, persistent albuminuria is globally accepted as the main diagnostic criteria for diabetic kidney disease (DKD).

Methods

In the present retrospective study, we evaluated data from an Italian cohort of 42 deceased diabetic donors (mainly with type 2 diabetes). Using the kidney biopsies obtained at the time of donation to evaluate single or double allocation based on Karpinski score, we determined the prevalence of histological lesions attributable to diabetes.

Results

All 42 donors presented with proteinuria in the normal range and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (chronic kidney disease [CKD]-EPI) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m². A kidney biopsy was available for 36 patients; of these, one was not interpretable and 32 showed histopathological lesions consistent with DKD and encompassing all histological classes. Thus, we found a relatively high proportion of histologically proven DKD that had been clinically undiagnosed, as none of the patient had significant proteinuria and eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

Conclusions

The data we present here support the need to implement routine kidney biopsies in normoalbuminuric diabetic subjects in the early stages of CKD. Such strategy may help to improve risk stratification in diabetic patients and guide therapeutic decisions during the early stages of the disease.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112bBHEU]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Guideline 1: Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) — patients with diabetes should be screened annually for DKD, with initial screening commencing 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or from diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; screening should include measurement of urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot urine sample and measurement of serum creatinine with estimation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In the absence of urinary tract infection, an elevated ACR should be confirmed with 2 additional first-void specimens collected over the next 3 to 6 months, and to confirm classification 2 of 3 samples should fall within the microalbuminuric or macroalbuminuric range. Microalbuminuria is defined as an ACR between 30–300 mg/g, and macroalbuminuria is defined as an ACR > 300 mg/g.

### Diabetic kidney disease: challenges, progress, and possibilities [^1154kLPu]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease develops in approximately 40% of patients who are diabetic and is the leading cause of CKD worldwide. Although ESRD may be the most recognizable consequence of diabetic kidney disease, the majority of patients actually die from cardiovascular diseases and infections before needing kidney replacement therapy. The natural history of diabetic kidney disease includes glomerular hyperfiltration, progressive albuminuria, declining GFR, and ultimately, ESRD. Metabolic changes associated with diabetes lead to glomerular hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Despite current therapies, there is large residual risk of diabetic kidney disease onset and progression. Therefore, widespread innovation is urgently needed to improve health outcomes for patients with diabetic kidney disease. Achieving this goal will require characterization of new biomarkers, designing clinical trials that evaluate clinically pertinent end points, and development of therapeutic agents targeting kidney-specific disease mechanisms (e.g., glomerular hyperfiltration, inflammation, and fibrosis). Additionally, greater attention to dissemination and implementation of best practices is needed in both clinical and community settings.

- **Definition**: DN is a chronic microvascular complication of diabetes characterized by glomerular hyperfiltration, progressive albuminuria, and reduced GFR.
- **Pathophysiology**: DN is caused due to hyperfiltration and reduction of GFR mainly due to hyperglycemia, systemic hypertension, and obesity.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of DN include microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, hyperglycemia, refractory hypertension, diabetic retinopathy, nephrotic or nephritic syndrome, anemia, bone and mineral metabolism complications. Disease progression may lead to CVD, infections, ESRD, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: 1-year mortality of patients on dialysis is around 21.5% in the US.

Discussion

The pathological changes of DKD are complex, many diseases are hidden, showing chronic progressive development, and eventually progress to End-stage renal disease (ESRD), which seriously affects the quality of life and life safety of patients. At present, DKD is the main cause of chronic kidney disease and ESRD in the world. timely prevention and diagnosis of DKD is an important part of the treatment of diabetic patients. Up to now, a large number of researchers have explored the early predictive markers of DKD, including proteomics and genomics. However, these new biomarkers are still lack of stability, and the detection cost is high, which is difficult to promote in clinical practice. Therefore, this study relies on the pathological diagnosis of renal biopsy as the gold standard, and explores the convenient and sensitive non-invasive indicators that can predict the diagnosis of DKD.

### Diabetic kidney disease: a clinical update from kidney disease: improving global outcomes [^114EQpPq]. Kidney International (2015). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) continue to grow markedly throughout the world, due primarily to the increase in type 2 DM (T2DM). Although improvements in DM and hypertension management have reduced the proportion of diabetic individuals who develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) and progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the sheer increase in people developing DM will have a major impact on dialysis and transplant needs. This KDIGO conference addressed a number of controversial areas in the management of DM patients with CKD, including aspects of screening for CKD with measurements of albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); defining treatment outcomes; glycemic management in both those developing CKD and those with ESRD; hypertension goals and management, including blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; and lipid management.

Globally, diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it is predicted to increase in the following years. Despite its high prevalence, CKD remains under diagnosed. In this BMC Medicine collection of articles on diabetic kidney disease (DKD), we place in context the importance of screening and early detection of DKD and the most accurate tools to monitor for optimal glycemic control in this his risk population. Further, we address this population's risk for severe complications such as stroke and all-cause mortality. We close this editorial by summarizing recent advances in management of this vulnerable population of patients with DKD, including guideline-directed medical therapy, novel treatments, and predictors of treatment failure.

Prevalence and Pathological Types

Analysis of the results of the 40 studies on renal biopsy results and pathological NDKD lesions in T2DM patients (Table 1) showed that the prevalence rate of DN alone ranges from 8.2 to 62.7%, with an average of 41.3%, which is similar to the T2DM rate of about 40% reported by Alicic et al. The overall prevalence of NDKD (including the mixed form) is 58.7%, which is consistent with the reported prevalence of NDKD in T2DM patients ranging from 8 to 93.5%. The prevalence of isolated NDKD ranges from 0 to 68.6%, with an average of 40.6%, and the prevalence of DN plus NDKD ranges from 0 to 45.5%, with an average of 18.1%. As shown in Table 1, the prevalence and pathological types of isolated NDKD or DN plus NDKD are quite variable, which can be explained by the following:
Kidney biopsy criteria. Kidney biopsy is essential for identifying renal damage caused by DN, NDKD or DN plus NDKD. Dong et al. suggested that patients with type 2 diabetes complicated with renal damage should actively undergo renal biopsy for five reasons: high significance of the correct DKD diagnosis; limitations in diagnosing DKD diagnosis; necessity of biopsy-proven pathological diagnosis; indications of renal biopsy; safety of renal biopsy. However, there is no uniform standard for performing kidney biopsy worldwide, which may result in a selection bias. The criteria for renal biopsy in each region, in each country even in each nephrologist's practice are not identical, which is one of the main reasons for the great variability in the reported prevalence of the pathological types. Furthermore, even if renal biopsy is strongly recommended based on clinical factors, patient compliance is also a factor, leading again to great variability.
Geographical regions and heterogeneity of populations worldwide. The prevalence of DN, NDKD or DN plus NDKD differ according to geographical regions and populations, as indicated by two different studies carried out in India. Prakash et al. reported the prevalence of NDKD in North India to be 12.3%, while John et al. reported a higher prevalence of NDKD in South India, especially the proliferative glomerulonephritis type, which was as high as 21.5% among the patients studied. Data from studies conducted in the USA show a high prevalence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in isolated NDKD (22%), which may be associated with the increased incidence of FSGS in Americans, especially in black individuals. Distribution of the pathological type DN plus NDKD appears to be relatively average, but glomerulonephritis is dominant overall. However, in a multi-center study in China, membranous nephropathy (MN) was found to be the primary pathological type in NDKD (including mixed form) (40.8%), followed by immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) (19.8%)

### Prevalence of non-diabetic kidney disease and inability of clinical predictors to differentiate it from diabetic kidney disease: results from a prospectively performed renal biopsy study [^112VnMLT]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Previously published studies on renal biopsies in subjects with type 2 diabetes are mostly retrospective in nature and include data of biopsies which have been performed selectively, in a targeted manner in those in whom the clinician felt that there was greater likelihood of diagnosis of NDKD. Data from prospectively performed renal biopsies in an untargeted (without preselection bias) manner have not been offered to consecutive patients attending a diabetes clinic in any previous study (to the best of our knowledge). In day-to-day clinical practice, it is often difficult to perform renal biopsies. This could be because of several reasons as biopsies are fraught with possible complications, and logistically, it is not possible to perform biopsies in all clinical set-ups. It is true that biopsy is truly needed in subjects with NDKD as it may alter patient outcomes. Previously published studies based on retrospective data of renal biopsies have great differences in prevalence of DKD, NDKD and mixed kidney disease. In our study, we found that the prevalence of DKD was 66.4%, and that of NDKD was 18.2%. The prevalence of mixed kidney disease was 15.4%. This highlights the huge burden of NDKD either in isolation or in combination with DKD (ie, mixed kidney disease group) among subjects with T2DM and kidney involvement who might benefit from renal biopsy.

Binary logistic regression analysis of our data suggests that duration of disease and presence of retinopathy were statistically significant in predicting DKD. However, duration of T2DM is often unreliable for subjects with T2DM, as the disease may have been pre-existing long before the diagnosis of the disease. Diabetic retinopathy and DKD are generally believed to develop together as common microvascular complication of diabetes. Previous studies showed different results regarding the renoretinal association. In our study, absence of retinopathy was found in 95% of subjects with NDKD, which suggests that absence of DR could be a possible predictor for NDKD; however, it may be noted that 30% of subjects with DKD had no retinopathy. Interestingly, the ORs of these parameters were either not strong or had very wide CI. Thus, both statistically significant parameters have limited value in making clinical decisions at individual patient level.

### Heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria for chronic kidney disease of undetermined etiology (CKDu): a systematic review of the literature [^112i3Fcr]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We reviewed 60 studies for the definition of CKDu. 38.3% studies diagnosed CKDu based on a single measurement of kidney function. This can cause misclassification of acute kidney injury (AKI) as CKD. There was significant variability in the cut-off level used to exclude "proteinuria" and the methods used for proteinuria/albuminuria estimation. Definitions which permit higher levels of proteinuria are more likely to overestimate the CKDu burden due to misclassification especially in the absence of kidney biopsy. Substantial variability was also observed in criteria used for excluding diabetes, hypertension and other causes of kidney disease. Use of self-reported history to rule out diabetes and hypertension may cause information bias. There may be reverse causality since hypertension can be secondary to long standing undiagnosed CKD. A single recording of blood pressure to define hypertension may overestimate its prevalence. Using the number of anti-hypertensive drugs prescribed to estimate severity can cause recall bias. Use of kidney biopsy was also inconsistent across studies. The heterogeneity in diagnostic criteria for CKDu was evident even in studies within a single region which makes comparisons of reported disease burden challenging.

The variability in diagnostic criteria have made it difficult to compare findings in CKDu research, highlighting the need for more standardized definitions to better understand the disease and its global impact. Diagnostic criteria have been developed by regional and global scientific organizations including the International Society of Nephrology (ISN), Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). Though CKDu is now recognized as a tubulointerstitial disease with no/low grade proteinuria, there is a debate on whether it is a specific entity or phenotypic manifestation of diverse exposures in different populations. Consequently, establishing a single uniform definition of CKDu may not be feasible, given the varying research objectives (e.g. population-based surveillance versus hospital-based cohort or case-control studies) and logistic constraints. To address these issues, definitions have classified CKDu cases as "suspected" (for initial disease surveillance) and probable/confirmed (with more stringent requirements for verification). However, there is some discordance, with older definitions allowing inclusion of patients with higher level of proteinuria (130 − 32) while newer definitions require absent or minimal proteinuria/albuminuria.

### Presentation, pathology and prognosis of renal disease in type 2 diabetes [^115ZPaJv]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is three times higher than in the non-diabetic population, and in many parts of the world, the majority of people developing end-stage renal failure (ESRD) have T2D.

The natural history of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in patients with type 1 diabetes is well described, but renal disease in T2D appears to be more complex and heterogeneous. This suggests that pathologies other than, or coexisting with DN, are important. A pooled meta-analysis of renal biopsy findings in studies predominantly consisting of patients with T2D has described a high prevalence of non-diabetic pathologies (estimates range 3%–83%) with a wide variety of renal pathologies. However, these are not true prevalence estimates as renal biopsy is not routinely undertaken in patients with T2D and renal disease.

Patients with T2D selected for renal biopsy are typically those with a presentation that is out of keeping with 'classical' DN. These indications can be grouped broadly into either acute presentations, with a rapid loss of renal function over a short period (acute kidney injury (AKI)) or non-acute presentations in which there are atypical clinical features.

Proteinuric renal disease and diabetes are both associated with heightened risk of AKI and the occurrence of AKI increases the risk for progressive CKD and ESRD. Thus, it is surprising that a number of small studies have suggested that patients with NDRD might have a better prognosis than those with classical DN. These studies have not, however, distinguished the types of presentation and pathologies that are associated with a better prognosis. To better understand the nature and significance of NDRD, and its interaction with DN, we have reviewed the renal biopsy findings in a large group of patients with T2D, explored pathologies associated with particular renal presentations, and examined their relationship to renal and survival outcomes.

### Serum hemoglobin concentration and risk of renal function decline in early stages of diabetic kidney disease: a nationwide, biopsy-based cohort study [^114o6FiD]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prognosticating disease progression in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is challenging, especially in the early stages of kidney disease. Anemia can occur in the early stages of kidney disease in diabetes. We therefore postulated that serum hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, as a reflection of incipient renal tubulointerstitial impairment, can be used as a marker to predict DKD progression.

Methods

Drawing on nationally representative data of patients with biopsy-proven DKD, 246 patients who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60mL/min/1.73 m² at renal biopsy were identified: age 56 (45–63) years; 62.6% men; Hb 13.3 (12.0–14.5) g/dL; eGFR 76.2 (66.6–88.6) mL/min/1.73 m²; urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 534 (100–1480) mg/g Crea. Serum Hb concentration was divided into quartiles: ≤ 12, 12.1–13.3, 13.4–14.5 and ≥ 14.6g/dL. The association between serum Hb concentration and the severity of renal pathological lesions was explored. A multivariable Cox regression model was used to estimate the risk of DKD progression (new onset of end-stage kidney disease, 50% reduction of eGFR or doubling of serum creatinine). The incremental prognostic value of DKD progression by adding serum Hb concentration to the known risk factors of DKD was assessed.

Results

Serum Hb levels negatively correlated with all renal pathological features, especially with the severity of interstitial fibrosis (ρ = -0.52; P < 0.001). During a median follow-up of 4.1years, 95 developed DKD progression. Adjusting for known risk factors of DKD progression, the hazard ratio in the first, second and third quartile (the fourth quartile was reference) were 2.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26–5.97], 2.33 (95% CI 1.07–5.75) and 1.46 (95% CI 0.71–3.64), respectively. Addition of the serum Hb concentration to the known risk factors of DKD progression improved the prognostic value of DKD progression (the global Chi-statistics increased from 55.1 to 60.8; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Serum Hb concentration, which reflects incipient renal fibrosis, can be useful for predicting DKD progression in the early stages of kidney disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for diabetic nephropathy, more specifically with respect to laboratory testing, DC 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain annual screening in patients with diabetes and no history of kidney disease using both eGFR and random urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio to identify CKD. Initiate CKD screening in patients with T1DM 5 years after onset or after puberty if onset occurs at an early age. Initiate CKD screening in patients with T2DM at diagnosis and continue annually thereafter.

### Diabetic nephropathy: where are we on the journey from pathophysiology to treatment? [^115fMCb4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy affects 30–40% of people with diabetes, and is the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. The current treatment paradigm relies on early detection, glycaemic control and tight blood pressure management with preferential use of renin-angiotensin system blockade. This strategy has transformed outcomes in diabetic kidney disease over the last 20years. Over the last two decades we have also witnessed significant advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy; however, despite this new knowledge, we have yet to develop new treatments of proven efficacy. Whilst a continued emphasis on preclinical and clinical research is clearly needed, clinicians treating people with diabetes should not forget that, in the short term, the greatest gains are likely to be realised by more consistent deployment of existing therapies.

Table 1
Baseline clinical and biochemical parameters according to histopathological classification (N = 110)

Hence, when we choose parameters for testing in a logistic regression model, we additionally chose presence of neuropathy (in addition to the conventionally used clinical/laboratory discriminators) but did not include hemoglobin levels and HbA1c in the model as we felt that decline in renal function itself may be associated with alteration in hemoglobin levels, and the degree of glycemic control might be highly variable across the study population and might not necessarily reflect the etiology of renal dysfunction.

To determine predictors for histopathological diagnosis of DKD, we ran a logistic regression model. The covariates used in this model were the duration of diabetes, presence of retinopathy, presence of neuropathy, absence of hematuria, absence of markers of possible collagen vascular/connective tissue disorders and autoimmune disorders, 24-hour urinary protein excretion and absence of unequal kidneys. Among them, duration of diabetes (in months) (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.05; p = 0.03) and presence of retinopathy (OR 18.85, 95% CI 1.2–2.77; p = 0.03) were found to be statistically significant. It may also be noted that 30% of subjects with DKD had no retinopathy

(table 2).

Table 2
Binary logistic regression analysis of factors related to diagnosis of DKD

Our data revealed the presence of at least one traditional clinical/laboratory parameters (indicating possibility of NDKD or mixed kidney disease) and warranting biopsy in 96 (87.2%) out of 110 patients. It was found that 62 (64.5%) of those 96 subjects in whom biopsy would have been indicated had a histological diagnosis of DKD and would not ultimately benefit from biopsy.

The results indicate that the clinical/laboratory parameters are suboptimal in helping us preselect individuals who would benefit from renal biopsy.

### Prevalence of non-diabetic kidney disease and inability of clinical predictors to differentiate it from diabetic kidney disease: results from a prospectively performed renal biopsy study [^114RVQFk]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Results

We screened 6247 subjects with T2DM, and of these, 869 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for biopsy. Of the 869 subjects, biopsy was feasible in 818 subjects. Out of 818, we recruited first 110 subjects who agreed to undergo renal biopsy (figure 1). The clinical and biochemical parameters of subjects who declined biopsy and those who underwent biopsy were compared (online supplemental table 1), which indicates that the subjects who underwent biopsy were similar/representative of the total eligible population.

Among the 110 subjects who underwent biopsy, 75 (68.2%) were male and 35 (31.8%) were female. The mean (± SD) age of the subjects was 50.17 ± 8.58 years. The age of subjects ranged from 24 years to 74 years. The mean duration of known diabetes was 103.3 ± 74.1 months, and the mean eGFR was 57.1 ± 21.9 mL/min/1.73 m².

Histopathological diagnosis of DKD was made in 73 (66.4%) subjects, and 20 subjects (18.2%) had NDKD, that is, kidney disease not related to diabetes. Seventeen subjects (15.4%) had features of both DKD and NDKD (mixed kidney disease).

The most common diagnosis in the NDKD was IgA nephropathy (n = 5). The other subtypes in the pure NDKD group were as follows: glomerular disease, for example, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (n = 4), minimal change disease (n = 3) amyloidosis (n = 1), membranous nephropathy (n = 4), membranous-proliferative glomerulonephritis (n = 1), tubule-interstitial disease, for example, acute tubular necrosis (n = 1) and vascular disease, and hypertensive arteriosclerosis (n = 1). In the mixed group, the most common subtype of NDKD is focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (n = 5).

### Diabetic kidney disease: update on clinical management and non-glycaemic effects of newer medications for type 2 diabetes [^116xcyEZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Those with type 2 diabetes have a higher morbidity and mortality, predominantly as a result of associated macrovascular and microvascular complications, and it is the leading global cause of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) ahead of hypertension and glomerulonephritis. A recent large observational study has shown that 42.3% of patients with diabetes will have evidence of renal disease, and it highlighted the increased 10-year cumulative all-cause mortality among those with diabetes. Much of this increased risk is attributable to cardiovascular events, with the non-cardiovascular mortality rate being similar to those without diabetes. The combination of diabetes and kidney disease, manifest by albuminuria, reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or both, confers the greatest risk.

The characteristic description of DKD involves progression of glomerular hyperfiltration to microalbuminuria and then overt proteinuria with reducing GFR, and ultimately leading to ESKD necessitating dialysis. However, more recent studies have shown a more complex and non-linear relationship with the possibility of albuminuria regressing and a progressive decline in GFR in the absence of albuminuria. A biopsy is now rarely necessary to make a diagnosis as a clinical diagnosis suffices in those with typical features (albuminuria and/or loss of GFR and evidence of non-renal microvascular disease such as neuropathy and retinopathy) and diabetes ⩾10 years. This approach is supported by the largest study of renal biopsies performed in those with type 2 diabetes. Among 620 patients based in the US with a median time from diagnosis of 10 years, 37% of the biopsies were consistent with DKD, 27% had evidence of both DKD and non-DKD, whereas 36% did not have findings consistent with DKD on their biopsy. The most common pathological findings in those without DKD were glomerulopathies such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, as well as hypertensive nephrosclerosis and acute tubular necrosis. The best predictor of DKD was the presence of diabetes for ⩾12 years supporting the contention that a clinical diagnosis is sufficient unless atypical features are present.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112cYWvN]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in diabetes — Most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes, and screening should begin after 5 years of type 1 diabetes and at the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes because of the inability to establish the onset of type 2 diabetes with certainty. Because urinary albumin excretion has an intraindividual coefficient of variation (CV) of approximately 40%, multiple positive test results are required for classification. Evidence for the usefulness of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) alone as a screening test for CKD in patients with diabetes is less secure; many patients may have elevated or high-normal GFRs early after diagnosis, so markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages of CKD, and eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse.

### Timing of kidney biopsy in type 2 diabetic patients: a stepwise approach [^113kMAxp]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of NDRD in DM patients varied widely between previous biopsy-based studies, ranging from 3 to 82.9%. Several factors may explain such high histological variability, including selection criteria, indications, and availability of kidney biopsy, as well as on the population investigated. In particular, the criteria used to select patients with diabetes who would benefit from kidney biopsy were different among the studies. Only a small number of studies evaluated research-indicated biopsies, while the vast majority analyzed clinically indicated biopsies. High variability in the prevalence of NDRD also indicated that there were patients who took unnecessary risks to receive a kidney biopsy with their pathology diagnosis turning out to be DN. Besides, there is no formal practice guideline on when to arrange a kidney biopsy for patients with DM.

In clinical practice, the value of kidney biopsy in DM patients is to identify NDRD, so proper treatment could be initiated in time. This study aims to explore factors that could help identify the presence of NDRD. We also attempt to propose a practical approach to guide the decision of kidney biopsy in patients with type 2 DM.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^113mHrmt]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Atypical clinical features in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — atypical clinical features should prompt evaluation for non-DKD and people with diabetes and CKD may have increased risks of testing and treatments (Moderate). Evaluation of a person with atypical features should include additional diagnostic testing in selected cases, depending on the clinical presentation; for example, refractory hypertension and/or a significant decrease in kidney function after RAS blockade should prompt consideration of renal artery stenosis. Rapidly decreasing kidney function and/or increasing proteinuria (particularly if nephrotic), active urinary sediment, or evidence of other systemic disease should raise concerns about nondiabetic glomerular disease. Diagnosis of these diseases may require invasive testing or interventional procedures, administration of radiographic contrast, with or without angiography, may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in other people, and in the absence of another identifiable and treatable cause of kidney disease, patients with diabetes and CKD should be treated as if they have DKD.

### Transcriptome analysis of human diabetic kidney disease [^112iotGk]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes accounts for ~44% of patients starting treatment for kidney failure each year, including dialysis and renal transplantation. There are multiple representative changes on the renal biopsy that characterize diabetic nephropathy of humans. The earliest lesions are distinguished only by the thickening of the glomerular basement membrane without clear light-microscopical findings. In more advanced cases, mild and then moderate mesangial expansion can be observed. In general, diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is considered a nonimmune-mediated degenerative disease of the glomerulus; however, it has long been noted that complement and immunoglobulins sometimes can be detected in diseased glomeruli, although their role and significance is not clear.

The understanding of DKD has been challenged by multiple issues. First, the diagnosis of DKD is usually made using clinical criteria, and kidney biopsy often is not performed. According to current clinical practice, the development of albuminuria in patients with diabetes is sufficient to make the diagnosis of DKD. We do not understand the correlation between histological changes and the clinical phenotype. In addition, disease progression is variable; some patients progress relatively fast, whereas others do not, which could indicate a potentially heterogeneous disease. Twin studies highlighted the role of familiar associations in DKD; however, despite a large-scale and intense search, a causal mutation with a significant effect has not been identified. Another issue is the lack of mouse models that would faithfully recapitulate changes of human DKD. Most animal models show changes of early diabetic glomerulopathy, but they usually do not develop advanced changes, including diabetic glomerulosclerosis, advanced tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and renal function decline.

Genome-wide transcriptome analysis using expression arrays recently has gained popularity as a means to acquire insight into disease pathogenesis, molecular classification, and identification of biomarkers for progression or treatment response. The technology has been applied in the field of DKD as well; however, most gene-array studies have been performed on rodent diabetic models. Such murine-based experiments are limited because of the inherent differences between murine and human DKD. Few studies from the European Renal cDNA Bank have been published on microdissected human DKD kidney samples. To date, they only have focused on transcriptome analysis of the tubulointerstitial tissue from subjects with homogenous (Caucasian) backgrounds. These studies indicated the regulation of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), nuclear factor (NF) κB, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways.

Background

Nondiabetic kidney disease (NDKD), which is prevalent among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), is considerably different from diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in terms of the pathological features, treatment strategy and prognosis. Although renal biopsy is the current gold-standard diagnostic method, it cannot be routinely performed due to a range of risks. The aim of this study was to explore the predictors for differentiating NDKD from DKD to meet the urgent medical needs of patients who cannot afford kidney biopsy.

Methods

This is a retrospective study conducted by reviewing the medical records of patients with type 2 DM who underwent percutaneous renal biopsy at the Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University between January 2017 and May 2021. The demographic data, clinical data, blood test results, and pathological examination results of the patients were obtained from their medical records. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive factors for NDKD.

Results

A total of 244 patients were analyzed. The median age at biopsy was 55 (46, 62) years. Patients diagnosed with true DKD, those diagnosed with NDKD and those diagnosed with NDKD superimposed DKD represented 48.36% (118/244), 45.9% (112/244) and 5.74% (14/244), respectively, of the patient population. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy was the most common type of lesion in those with NDKD (59, 52.68%) and NDKD superimposed DKD (10, 71.43%). Independent predictive indicators for diagnosing NDKD included a DM duration of less than 5 years (odds ratio [OR] = 4.476; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.257–8.877; P < 0.001), an absence of diabetic retinopathy (OR = 4.174; 95% CI: 2.049–8.502; P < 0.001), a high RBC count (OR = 1.901; 95% CI: 1.251–2.889; P = 0.003), and a negative of urinary glucose excretion test result (OR = 2.985; 95% CI: 1.474–6.044; P = 0.002).

Conclusions

A DM duration less than 5 years, an absence of retinopathy, a high RBC count and an absence of urinary glucose excretion were independent indicators for the diagnosis of NDKD, suggesting that patients with NDKD may require a different treatment regimen than those with DKD.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — loss of GFR within CKD stage 1 in people with elevated urinary albumin excretion may already represent DKD, and formulae estimating GFR from serum creatinine values are problematic in their application to patients with diabetes. Measures of albuminuria in combination with estimates of GFR will serve as useful guides in assessing and managing patients with diabetes and CKD, and the Work Group developed a novel grid (Table 6) to combine staging by albuminuria classification and GFR, although evidence to define DKD probabilities within each box is lacking. The diagnosis and staging of DKD in an individual patient should include an evaluation of other related factors, and apart from albuminuria and GFR, patients should be evaluated for the presence of hypertension, poor glycemic control, dyslipidemia, and smoking. A family history of DKD or hypertension and/or CVD and stroke in persons without diabetes also is relevant, and because DKD typically does not occur in isolation, patients with DKD should have regular surveillance for other microvascular and macrovascular complications.

Kidney biopsy in diabetes and CKD — indications and safety are summarized as follows: A kidney biopsy may be required in some patients with diabetes and CKD to determine the underlying cause of the kidney disease (Moderate). The risk of complications associated with percutaneous native kidney biopsy in patients with DKD is no greater than the risk faced by patients with most other causes of CKD, and the majority of complications are from bleeding and include microscopic hematuria, decrease in hemoglobin level, gross hematuria, perinephric hematomas, and arteriovenous fistulae. Women are more likely to bleed than men, other commonly identified risk factors for bleeding include younger age, decreased GFR, elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and prolonged bleeding and partial thromboplastin times, and the number of needle passes during kidney biopsy also increases the risk of bleeding.

### Utility of renal biopsy in the clinical management of renal disease [^1151Jggz]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Characterizing chronic kidney disease (CKD) at all stages is an essential part of rational management and the renal biopsy plays a key role in defining the processes involved. There remain no global guidelines available to the renal community on indications for this important diagnostic, prognostic, and relatively safe test. Although most nephrologists recognize several clear indications for a renal biopsy, it is still underutilized. It not only helps the clinician to manage the patient with CKD, but it can also help clarify the epidemiology of CKD, and aid research into the pathobiology of disease with the aim of discovering new therapies. It may be useful for instance in elderly patients with CKD, those with diabetes and presumed 'hypertensive nephropathy', and in some patients with advanced CKD as part of the pretransplant work-up. In some populations (for example, immunoglobulin A nephropathy and ANCA vasculitis), renal biopsy allows disease classification that may predict CKD progression and response to therapy. For the individual, interval renal biopsy may be of use in providing ongoing therapeutic and prognostic information. Molecular advances will change the landscape of renal pathology and add a new dimension to the diagnostic precision of kidney biopsy. Organizing the multiplicity of information available in a renal biopsy to maximize benefits to the patient, as well as to the epidemiologist and researcher, is one of the challenges that face the nephrology community.

### Trajectories of kidney function in diabetes: a clinicopathological update [^116Mi8FZ]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy has been traditionally diagnosed based on persistently high albuminuria and a subsequent decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is widely recognized as the classical phenotype of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Several studies have emphasized that trajectories of kidney function in patients with diabetes (specifically, changes in GFR and albuminuria over time) can differ from this classical DKD phenotype. Three alternative DKD phenotypes have been reported to date and are characterized by albuminuria regression, a rapid decline in GFR, or non-proteinuric or non-albuminuric DKD. Although kidney biopsies are not typically required for the diagnosis of DKD, a few studies of biopsy samples from patients with DKD have demonstrated that changes in kidney function associate with specific histopathological findings in diabetes. In addition, various clinical and biochemical parameters are related to trajectories of GFR and albuminuria. Collectively, pathological and clinical characteristics can be used to predict trajectories of GFR and albuminuria in diabetes. Furthermore, cohort studies have suggested that the risks of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes might vary among different phenotypes of DKD. A broader understanding of the clinical course of DKD is therefore crucial to improve risk stratification and enable early interventions that prevent adverse outcomes.

### Clinical challenges in diagnosis and management of diabetic kidney disease [^111ZZsWG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major and increasing worldwide public health issue. There is a great need for implementing treatments that either prevent or significantly slow the progression of DKD. Although there have been significant improvements in management, the increasing numbers of patients with DKD illustrate that current management is not wholly adequate. The reasons for suboptimal management include the lack of early diagnosis, lack of aggressive interventions, and lack of understanding about which interventions are most successful. There are a number of challenges and controversies regarding the current management of patients with DKD. Understanding of these issues is needed in order to provide the best care to patients with DKD. This article describes some of the clinically important challenges associated with DKD: the current epidemiology and cost burden and the role of biopsy in the diagnosis of DKD. Treatment controversies regarding current pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches are reviewed and recommendations based on the published literature are made.

### Recent advances in diabetic kidney disease [^112z3HxX]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is diabetic kidney disease and what do we know so far about its clinical presentation?

Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the USA and worldwide. An estimated 422 million adults are living with diabetes globally, and up to 40% of them may develop CKD during their lifetime. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) does not reflect a specific pathological phenotype. In fact, it can be diagnosed clinically based on the presence of persistent albuminuria, sustained reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), or both in patients with diabetes. DKD is usually identified after five years of the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, while it can be recognized at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The presence of proliferative diabetic retinopathy typically correlates with ongoing DKD in patients with albuminuria. Even though a kidney biopsy can confirm the diagnosis of DKD, this procedure is usually considered when an alternative diagnosis suspected.

Albuminuria has more recently been classified into moderate (30 to 300 mg/g) or severe (> 300 mg/g). Nonetheless, any degree of albuminuria has been associated with an increased risk for CKD progression, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), adverse cardiovascular disease outcomes, and mortality in patients with diabetes. A reduced eGFR in diabetic patients has been observed in the absence of albuminuria; however, the progression of DKD appears to be slower in these individuals. Furthermore, the combined presence of albuminuria and lower eGFR independently increases the risks for cardiovascular events and mortality in individuals with diabetes. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend that all diabetic patients undergo annual screening by checking serum creatinine-based eGFR and urine tests to evaluate for albuminuria.

### Prevalence of non-diabetic kidney disease and inability of clinical predictors to differentiate it from diabetic kidney disease: results from a prospectively performed renal biopsy study [^115j1G8h]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Worldwide 537 million adults are estimated to be living with diabetes. Of subjects with diabetes, 20%–40% may have some form of renal involvement, highlighting a huge global burden of kidney disease in subjects with diabetes. Renal involvement in individuals with type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) includes causes due to diabetes per se, that is, diabetic kidney disease (DKD), or may be due to causes other than diabetes commonly referred to as non-diabetic kidney disease (NDKD). In addition, some patients may have renal involvement due to diabetes, as well as causes other than diabetes (mixed kidney disease group, having features of both DKD and NDKD).

The treatment of DKD entails tight blood pressure and glycemic control, often with preference of certain class of drugs over others. However, in a significant proportion of NDKD, there are certain specific treatment options (including steroids and other immunosuppressant) which could significantly improve patient outcomes. In addition, appropriate diagnosis could help in prognostication.

Histopathology is currently accepted as gold standard to differentiate DKD from NDKD. Published literature suggest that subjects with diabetes have varying proportion of DKD and NDKD. It may be noted that this difference in prevalence could be because of differences in clinical practice, namely, differences in criteria followed by clinicians to subject a patient to renal biopsy. Most of the published studies are retrospective in nature, with preselection biases of targeted biopsies performed in those with a high index of suspicion of NDKD.

Considering the invasiveness, limited availability of expertise, infrastructure and cost of the procedure, widespread use of renal biopsy is not practical to perform in all subjects with T2DM with renal involvement.

Traditionally, several clinical parameters have been used to help identify individuals at greater risk of NDKD. These parameters have often been used by clinicians to preselect subjects for renal biopsy. Unfortunately, data are sparse to support the use of the same. Results from meta-analysis of several studies (retrospective analysis of targeted biopsies) have suggested roles of certain clinical pointers to help identify subjects with higher possibility of NDKD. Yet there is very little consensus even among nephrologists on indications of renal biopsy. The study reported that decision to perform kidney biopsy is usually based on physicians' personal opinion and protocol/policy of the institute.

### Renal biopsy in patients with diabetes: a pooled meta-analysis of 48 studies [^116rJhrb]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The utility of renal biopsy in patients with diabetes is highly debated. Diabetics with rapidly worsening renal disease are often 'clinically' labelled as having diabetic nephropathy (DN), whereas, in many cases, they are rather developing a non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD) or mixed forms (DN + NDRD).

Methods

We performed a systematic search for studies on patients with diabetes with data on the frequency of DN, NDRD and mixed forms, and assessed the positive predictive values (PPVs) and odds ratios (ORs) for such diagnoses by meta-analysing single-study prevalence. Possible factors explaining heterogeneity among the different diagnoses were explored by meta-regression.

Results

In the 48 included studies (n = 4876), the prevalence of DN, NDRD and mixed forms ranged from 6.5 to 94%, 3 to 82.9% and 4 to 45.5% of the overall diagnoses, respectively. IgA nephropathy was the most common NDRD (3–59%). PPVs for DN, NDRD and mixed forms were 50.1% [95% confidence interval (CI): 44.7–55.2], 36.9% (95% CI: 32.3–41.8) and 19.7% (95% CI: 16.3–23.6), respectively. The PPV when combining NDRD and mixed forms was 49.2% (95% CI: 43.8–54.5). Meta-regression identified systolic pressure, HbA1c, diabetes duration and retinopathy as factors explaining heterogeneity for NDRD, creatinine and glomerular filtration rate for mixed forms and only serum creatinine for DN. ORs of DN versus NDRD and mixed forms were 1.71 (95% CI: 1.54–1.91) and 4.1 (95% CI: 3.43–4.80), respectively.

Conclusions

NDRD are highly prevalent in patients with diabetes. Clinical judgment alone can lead to wrong diagnoses and delay the establishment of adequate therapies. Risk stratification according to individual factors is needed for selecting patients who might benefit from biopsy.

### Diabetic nephropathy: a national dialogue [^112xJKzt]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases-supported Kidney Research National Dialogue (KRND) asked the scientific community to formulate and prioritize research objectives that would improve our understanding of kidney function and disease. Several high-priority objectives for diabetic nephropathy were identified in data and sample collection, hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing, and translation promotion. The lack of readily available human samples linked to comprehensive phenotypic, clinical, and demographic data remains a significant obstacle. With data and biological samples in place, several possibilities exist for using new technologies to develop hypotheses. Testing novel disease mechanisms with state-of-the-art tools should continue to be the foundation of the investigative community. Research must be translated to improve diagnosis and treatment of people. The objectives identified by the KRND provide the research community with future opportunities for improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diabetic nephropathy.

Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — ACR should be measured in first-void urine samples, but if a random urine specimen is abnormal, the second test could be done in a first-voided morning sample obtained within the subsequent 3 to 6 months. Screening for microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes, if leading to multifactorial interventions, can result in reduced risks of cardiovascular events, progression of albuminuria, and development or progression of retinopathy and neuropathy, whereas similar studies in patients with type 1 diabetes are lacking. International control between laboratories should be established, and there should also be standardized reporting of ACRs with internationally agreed-upon categorical definitions.

As for other parameters, there is controversy of the clinical value of UPE between patients with DKD and NDKD. The results of the present study showed that the UPE level was higher in the DKD group versus the NDKD group, but it is not associated with the diagnosis of NDKD. These differences may be related to the criterion of renal biopsy and region, et. We also found that the eGFR in the NDKD group was higher than that in the DKD group, but it is not associated with the diagnosis of NDKD. As a chronic complication of DM, DKD has a slowly onset, the lack of obvious symptoms usually bring a long duration of disease and significant damage to kidney function. However, most patients with NDKD such as IgA N and MN with an acute onset are more likely to show obvious symptoms such as proteinuria and edema, thus can seek hospital visit early.

Although many studies have explored the differential diagnosis of DKD and NDKD, the results from these studies varied, thus differentiating NDKD from DKD effectively and based on scientific evidence remains under further exploration. A strength of this study is that we recommended to all of the patients to undergo renal biopsy unless there were contraindications for it, which minimizes the selection bias as much as possible. In addition, we included as many relevant parameters as possible. However, there are also some limitations to this study. This study is retrospective and was performed at a single center, so applying the results to populations in other countries and regions will produce results that need to be interpreted cautiously due to the restrictive patient population in this study; Moreover, it cannot be entirely ruled out that there were no unmeasured confounding factors that could have possibly influenced the observed association in this study.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112VFwDP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — diabetic kidney disease (DKD) terminology and clinical characterization — For consistency with chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification, the term DKD is proposed for a presumptive diagnosis of kidney disease caused by diabetes, and the term "diabetic nephropathy" should be replaced by DKD; the term diabetic glomerulopathy should be reserved for biopsy-proven kidney disease caused by diabetes. DKD is now defined, in part, by increased urinary albumin excretion and is divided into microalbuminuria, a modest elevation associated with stable kidney function but a greater risk of macroalbuminuria and kidney failure, and macroalbuminuria, a higher elevation associated with progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), increased systemic blood pressure, and a high risk of kidney failure. These generalizations do not apply in all cases because people with normal urinary albumin excretion may have advanced DKD, whereas those with microalbuminuria may have either substantial or no pathological evidence of kidney damage; because diabetes is highly prevalent, some individuals with diabetes may have other types of CKD, although in most cases, clinical measures may be used to diagnose DKD.

### Diagnosis and treatment of early renal disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: what are the clinical needs? [^113EWmme]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2015). Low credibility.

Renal disease is prevalent in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. Aggressive metabolic control and lowering of systemic and/or intraglomerular blood pressure are effective interventions but not without side effects. Thus a better, early identification of patients at risk for incidence or progression to end-stage renal failure by the use of new, validated biomarkers is highly desirable. In the majority of patients, hypertension and hyperglycaemia are pathogenetically important pathways for the progression of renal disease. Nonetheless even aggressive therapy targeting these factors does not eliminate the risk of end-stage renal failure and experimental evidence suggests that many other pathways (e.g. tubulointerstitial hypoxia or inflammation etc.) also contribute. As their individual importance might vary from patient to patient, interventions which interfere are likely not to be therapeutically effective in all subjects. In this situation, an option to preserve the statistical power of clinical trials is to rely on biomarkers that reflect individual pathophysiology. In current clinical practice, albuminuria is the biomarker that has been best evaluated to guide stratified/personalized therapy but there is a clear need to expand our diagnostic abilities.

### Insights into the role of renal biopsy in patients with T2DM: a literature review of global renal biopsy results [^1118cqju]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Over the past decades, renal biopsy in T2DM patients suspected of having DKD has shown that many patients actually suffer from nondiabetic kidney disease (NDKD) or diabetic nephropathy (DN) plus NDKD, with both conditions mistakenly identified as DKD. This translates into a difference in approach to treatment and overall prognosis: to date, controlling the incidence of DKD and improving prognosis of DKD are mainly attributed to the improvement of diabetes care. Innovative strategies to prevent, treat and reverse DKD are still unmet and need to be further explored. Unlike DKD, most of the glomerular and tubulointerstitial diseases caused by NDKD usually benefit from personalized treatments, such as immunosuppressive therapy, and can be alleviated or even cured if identified in a timely manner. That is to say, early identification and treatment of NDKD is of great significance to reduce global ESRD prevalence and its various complications, such as cardiovascular complications. However, due to the limitation of renal biopsy applications, a confirmed diagnosis of DKD that at the same time excludes NDKD with certainty in clinical practice is challenging. The introduction of the DKD concept in 2007 encouraged many researchers to search for indicators that can be used to distinguish NDKD from DKD on clinical grounds. However, to date, there has been lack of large published studies that can be considered to be representative, including those with a large amount of data. In addition, it is generally believed that the incidence of NDKD in patients with T1DM is comparatively rare; consequently, data in this area are particularly scarce. Compared with T1DM, T2DM often occurs in middle-aged and elderly people on a background of kidney degenerative lesions. Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, high uric acid level and other metabolic syndromes together may also cause damage to the kidney. In terms of pathology, structural changes in patients with T2DM are more heterogeneous than those in T1DM patients and they correlate less with clinical manifestations, which are also highly heterogeneous. Given this context, studying T2DM patients may have more clinical significance.

Based on the above, the aim of this article is to review the pathological findings of renal biopsy in T2DM patients worldwide and review the clinical indicators used to distinguish DKD from NDKD, in order to help clinicians evaluate patients with T2DM and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and possibly deliver more effective medical management to patients.

### Renal biopsy in 2015 – from epidemiology to evidence-based indications [^112X6S2f]. American Journal of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although the number of patients reaching end-stage kidney disease without a biopsy-proven diagnosis is increasing, the utility of renal biopsy is still an object of debate. We analyzed epidemiological data and the main indications for renal biopsy with a systematic, evidence-based review at current literature.

Summary

There is a high discrepancy observed in biopsy rates and in the epidemiology of glomerular diseases worldwide, related to the different time frame of the analyzed reports, lack of data collection, the different reference source population and the heterogeneity of indications. The evidence-based analysis of indications showed that renal biopsy should be crucial in adults with nephrotic syndrome or urinary abnormalities as coexistent hematuria and proteinuria and in corticosteroid resistant-children with severe proteinuria. The knowledge of renal histology can change the clinical management in patients with acute kidney injury significantly, after the exclusion of pre-renal or obstructive causes of kidney damage. Scarce evidence indicates that renal biopsy can be useful in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and its use should always be considered after weighing the benefits and potential risks. Renal biopsy should be crucial in patients with renal involvement due to systemic disease. In patients with diabetes with atypical features, renal biopsy may be fundamental to diagnose an unexpected parenchymal disease mislabeled as diabetic nephropathy. Finally, in elderly patients, the indications and the risks are not different from those in the general population.

Key Message

Renal biopsy still remains a concrete approach for managing a substantial percentage of renal diseases.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in chronic kidney disease [^1139g4rs]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally.DKD is characterized by albuminuria and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which are independent risk factors for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), cardiovascular events, and death. However, some patients with diabetes develop reduced eGFR with minimal or no albuminuria and retain the risks of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Moreover, kidney biopsy data among patients with DKD indicate variability in histopathological findings and overlap with non-diabetic disease processes. With advancements in diabetes care and therapeutics, the prevalence of kidney disease among patients with diabetes has stabilized around 35%, and the incidence of acute cardiovascular events among patients with diabetes has decreased by over 50%. Nevertheless, the absolute number of patients with diabetes is rising, with an anticipated global prevalence of 7.7% by 2030. The impending burden of diabetes, in the context of the obesity epidemic, will likely affect younger patients with more time at risk to develop kidney disease and its complications. In this review, we describe the management of type 2 diabetes in CKD, highlight important aspects of clinical practice guidelines, and discuss the evidence that supports modern practice.

### Clinical predictors for nondiabetic kidney diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a retrospective study from 2017 to 2021 [^1173zmsG]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

With the widespread implementation of renal biopsy, NDKD is prevalent in the population of patients with DM. It has been realized that not all patients with DM diagnosed with CKD develop renal dysfunction as a consequence of DM. Importantly, DKD and NDKD have considerably different treatment strategies and prognoses. Renal biopsy remains the only reliable way to distinguish the type of kidney disease in patients with DM. However, as an invasive procedure, renal biopsy has a range of limitations. Therefore, there is an urgent need for clinicians to identify reliable predictors to be able to accurately distinguish diabetic patients with NDKD from DKD to meet the urgent medical needs of patients who cannot afford renal biopsy. In our study, 244 patients diagnosed with T2DM at the time of biopsy were analyzed to screen for the predictive factors of NDKD in patients with T2DM.

1 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DIABETES AND DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE

Diabetes mellitus represents one of the major epidemic concerns and hazard to global human health, since its incidence and prevalence have continued to increase in the past decades. The International Diabetic Federation (IDF) recently published that in 2017 there were 425 million people worldwide with diabetes, with a projected rise to 629 million by 2045. 1 In the United States, it is estimated that 30.3 million people of all ages suffered from diabetes in 2015, representing 9.4% of the US population according to the 2017 National Diabetes Statistics Report. 2 Among different macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes, diabetic nephropathy or more broadly diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is defined by the presence of albuminuria (urinary albumin to creatinine ratio more than 30 mg/g) in two separate occasions three‐month apart and/or sustained reduction in eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and/or histological evidence of DKD on a kidney biopsy. DKD is the most common cause of ESRD and represents a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. 3, 4 Despite this, early diagnosis and management of DKD has remained inefficient, resulting in a rise to up to 94% in the number of deaths from the year 1990 to 2012 attributed to DKD, showing that prevention of DKD development and progression remains vastly unsuccessful. 5

It further notes that for interpretation at high levels, "Whether values of GFR greater than 90 mL/min reflect progressive CKD may be determined best by the slope of sequential GFR estimates", and that the MDRD equation "has been validated in only small numbers of patients with diabetes and CKD".

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetes mellitus, and especially type 2 diabetes, will be the seventh leading cause of mortality by 2030. 1 Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), a complication of diabetes, is the most common cause of end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) both in the developed and the developing world and accounts for 20% to 40% of patients starting renal replacement therapy. 2 Often diabetes and DKD are coupled with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Conventional treatment paradigms target risk factors separately whereas comorbidities are not necessarily independent of each other.

Over the last decades, there has been clear progress in assessing risk factors and controlling diabetes. Subsequently, the prognosis of patients with diabetes has gradually improved. 1 Nonetheless, mortality, when compared to the general population, is higher, and the risk is especially high in patients with impaired renal function. Many reasons for the morbidity and mortality in DKD have been identified, including suboptimal application of evidence‐based therapies (eg, due to lack of medication intensification by physicians or insufficient lifestyle changes or medication adherence by patients), and variability in response to medication (eg, inadequate efficacy of therapy even when optimally applied, or genetic differences, leading to differential treatment response). Additionally, a general lack of understanding of the true pathobiology of DKD results in the treatment of symptoms and diagnostic labels instead of a focus on causes and mechanisms. This inefficiency results in many patients not being properly treated or not receiving the maximum benefit possible for the multitude of treatment modalities available. In order to improve the situation, a shift towards care of the individual patient is needed, rather than for the particular manifestation of the disease.

### The modern spectrum of renal biopsy findings in patients with diabetes [^116iqaJR]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Renal biopsies performed in diabetic patients are increasing in number and complexity. This study sought to determine the usefulness of renal biopsy in patients with diabetes and the predictability of diagnosing diabetic nephropathy (DN) versus nondiabetic renal disease (NDRD) from clinical and laboratory data.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

To assess modern trends, a retrospective study was performed of clinical-pathologic findings in all patients with diabetes who had a biopsy in 2011. Among 2642 native kidney biopsies, 620 (23.5%) were from patients with diabetes.

Results

The cohort included 371 men (60.7%) aged a median (interquartile range) 62 years (52–69) with 10-year (5–15) duration of diabetes mellitus (DM). Median serum creatinine was 2.5 mg/dl (1.6–4.4), and 52% of patients had stage 4–5 CKD. On biopsy, 37% of patients had DN alone, 36% had NDRD alone, and 27% had DN plus NDRD. In NDRD alone, FSGS (22%), hypertensive nephrosclerosis (18%), acute tubular necrosis (ATN) (17%), IgA nephropathy (11%), membranous GN (8%), and pauci-immune GN (7%) comprised 80% of diagnoses, compared with ATN (43%), hypertensive nephrosclerosis (19%), FSGS (13%), and IgA nephropathy (7%) for DN plus NDRD. In multivariate analyses, longer duration of DM was associated with a greater likelihood of DN and a lower likelihood of NDRD: each added year of DM reduced the odds of NDRD by 5% (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 0.98; P = 0.004). DM duration ≥ 12 years was the best predictor (58% sensitivity, 73% specificity) of DN alone.

Conclusions

Approximately one-quarter of all renal biopsies are performed in patients with DM. Judicious use of renal biopsy has uncovered NDRD alone or superimposed on DN in the majority of such biopsies. ATN is emerging as an important category of NDRD, which has not been reported previously.

KDOQI — epidemiology of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in the United States highlights substantial albuminuria burden and kidney failure impact. In the United States, microalbuminuria is found in 43% and macroalbuminuria in 8% of those with a history of diabetes, and diabetes accounts for 45% of prevalent kidney failure, up from 18% in 1980; substantial underdiagnosis of both diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) leads to lost opportunities for prevention and may contribute to disease progression.

Introduction

Diabetic kidney involvement primarily manifests as diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, some diabetic patients may solely present with diabetes mellitus or non-diabetic kidney disease (NDKD), or DKD combined with NDRD. This study statistically analyzed patients with DKD and DKD + NDKD, investigating their pathological and clinical characteristics, and identifying the independent factors associated with DKD + NDKD to aid clinical differentiation.

### Kidney disease in the elderly: biopsy based data from 14 renal centers in Poland [^111BzJHU]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Several authors reported the proportion of diabetic kidney disease ranging between 2.2% up to 10% in renal biopsy registries. The results of ours implicate that in people aged ≥ 65 DKD constitutes 4.6% of all renal-biopsy diagnoses. In our cohort the peak frequency and the highest relative frequency of this disease occurred at the age of 55–64 years (Fig. 1). The usual indications for renal biopsy in diabetic patients include: an abrupt onset or rapid progression of kidney disease, the presence of active urinary sediment, and the progression of proteinuria in the absence of diabetic retinopathy or neuropathy. Since the group of diabetic patients in our cohort is not representative for the whole population of diabetics, it should be noted that 75% of our elderly diabetic patients had non-diabetic kidney disease upon kidney biopsy, which is in line with the observation made by Sharma et al. These results may be partially explained by the relatively short duration of diabetes at the time of kidney biopsy in our patients (median 7.16 years for diabetic patients studied, range 0–24 years), as well as by the fact that in 40% of biopsies from diabetic individuals electron microscopy was not performed, which does not allow for the exclusion of early phase of DKD.

One of the leading histological diagnoses in general, and the most common renal disease manifested by non-nephrotic range proteinuria with hematuria in our elderly patients was pauci-immune GN. Notably, 23.8% of elderly and 24.8% of younger patients with pauci-immune GN suffered from nephrotic-range proteinuria. Pauci-immune GN being one of the leading diagnoses made upon kidney biopsy among elderly individuals was reported by others. The peak frequency and the highest relative frequency of this disease in our patients studied occurred at the age of 55–64 years (Fig. 1). In a vast majority of cases pauci immune GN is associated with the presence of ANCA vasculitis, with peak incidence of 52.9 per million being observed among people aged 65–74. It is worth mentioning that in contrast to younger individuals, in the elderly vasculitis more commonly manifests with renal disease, and less frequently involves upper respiratory tract. Vasculitis-related symptoms such as myalgia and headache may be easily misdiagnosed as common afflictions of the elderly, e.g. polymyalgia rheumatica.

### Clinical predictors for nondiabetic kidney diseases in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a retrospective study from 2017 to 2021 [^111LvdFz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of DKD relies predominantly on clinical presentations, including persistent proteinuria, hypertension, and a progressive decline in renal function. Diagnostic kidney biopsy is rarely performed in patients with DM. Naturally, in the absence of a diagnostic biopsy, clinicians often diagnose patients with both DM and CKD as DKD, which inflates the true prevalence of DKD. However, there is considerable heterogeneity in the pathological features and prognoses between DKD and NDKD. It is generally believed that some cases of NDKD are readily treatable or even alleviable, while cases of DKD are not. Therefore, establishing a correct diagnosis in patients with DM superimposed with CKD has decisive influence on the selection of treatment strategies, thus eventually affecting the renal prognosis.

Given that the diabetic environment can alter the progression of NDKD, the form of kidney disease in patients with DM can only be reliably distinguished by performing renal biopsy. However, renal biopsy is an invasive procedure, and it has a range of limitations. First, most clinicians perform renal biopsy in only the patients with DM with indications of NDKD due to the trauma caused by renal biopsy. Second, some patients with DM are unable to tolerate renal biopsy due to them having a poor physical condition. Third, it is difficult to perform renal biopsy at some non-specialist hospitals. Therefore, studies need to be performed to identify the diagnostic predictors for NDKD to meet medical needs for patients with DM who cannot afford kidney biopsy.

Materials and methods

This was a single-centre, cross-sectional study with subjects recruited from the outpatient clinic of the department of endocrinology of the institute.

Consecutive subjects aged more than 18 years with type 2 diabetes with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m² by Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation and/or morning-spot urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) more than 300 mg/gm (on two occasions, 3 months apart after adequate glycemic control and blood pressure control) were included. We excluded subjects with eGFR of < 30 mL/min/m² as they are likely to have advanced disease and histopathology was likely to be of burnt-out disease and also excluded subjects with eGFR of > 60 mL/min/m² as it was ethically difficult to justify performing renal biopsies in them.

Subjects were excluded from the study if they had recent or recurrent urinary tract infection, calculus renal disease, obstructive uropathy, renal tumors, bleeding diathesis, bilateral contracted kidneys or single kidney, hydronephrosis, on antiplatelet therapy, unexplained coagulopathy or those who had stages of renal disease, other than those specified in the inclusion criteria. Additionally, those who qualified for the inclusion and exclusion criteria but declined to give consent for the biopsy were also excluded. The protocol for inclusion of the study subjects is described in figure 1.

Conclusions

The high prevalence and various types of NDKD, as well as the complexity of DKD clinical manifestations, make it more difficult for clinicians to diagnose the three types of renal disease (DN, NDKD and DN plus NDKD [mixed form]). Although the application of renal biopsy in T2DM patients is controversial, our review suggests that, to date, renal biopsy is still an important strategy to identify T2DM complicated with renal disease, especially for patients with atypical DKD symptoms.

Guideline 1. Screening and diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease — Microalbuminuria is the best available test for screening of DKD, but it is imprecise, and markers under study include urinary immunoreactive intact albumin and shed podocytes, genetic risk indicators, blood and/or urine changes in growth factors, cytokines, inflammatory markers, or markers of oxidative stress, and innovative kidney imaging or tissue studies. Appropriately weighted risk algorithms should be derived using predictive variables, including AER within the normalalbuminuric or microalbuminuric range, retinopathy status, clinical and ambulatory blood pressure measurements, glycemic control, lipid levels, age, sex, race, and family history. Improved measures of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be developed and may include more reliable creatinine measurement methods, modifications of existing formulas, application of new GFR markers, such as cystatin C, and development of simplified direct GFR measurements. Additional studies on urinary albumin measurements, including predictive values of gender-specific ACR cutoffs, urine collection methods, and processing of urine samples, are warranted, and research questions include the rate of progression of DKD in people with reduced GFR but normal urinary albumin excretion compared with those with elevated urinary albumin excretion, whether regression of albuminuria modifies long-term progression, the effect of promising agents to prevent RCN in CKD across both types of diabetes, and the best common definition of RCN.

### Identification of diabetic nephropathy biomarkers through… [^1158hBun]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

It has been estimated that more than 40% of people with diabetes will develop chronic kidney disease, accounting for about 40% of all patients beginning renal replacement therapy. In the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, nephropathy is among the five leading causes of medical care in general hospitals in the area and in high-specialty hospitals. Early diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is another essential component in the management of diabetes and its complications such as nephropathy. The American Diabetes Association recommends the routine screening to diabetic subjects with progressive diabetic nephropathy and CKD. The most widely accepted guidelines of National Kidney Foundation were implicating in measuring glomerular filtration rate and stages of CKD using serum creatinine in patients.

However, due to creatinine undergo tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration and its extrarenal elimination via the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in advanced renal failure, the GFR could be overestimated. In case of GFR, the techniques are overwhelming due to invasive methods and some markers are difficult to handle. Another marker used in the clinic is microalbuminuria, in most patients, the first sign of diabetic nephropathy is the moderate increase of urinary albumin excretion, i.e. 30–300 mg/g creatinine in a urine sample. A recent study by O´Conell et al. identified a set of 13 genes that was predictive for the development of renal fibrosis at 1 year of renal transplant, through microarray expression analysis of renal allograft recipients' biopsies. Thus, the authors suggest that the set of 13 genes could be used to identify kidney transplant recipients at risk of allograft loss before the development of irreversible damage.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112FeZxZ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

KDOQI — screening and diagnostic approach to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) emphasizes albuminuria-based detection and limitations of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). DKD refers to kidney disease that is specific to diabetes, and diagnosis is based in part on elevated urinary albumin excretion divided into microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria; most professional societies concerned with diabetes and kidney disease now advocate screening for microalbuminuria in patients with diabetes. Screening should begin 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at the time of diagnosis of type 2 diabetes; evidence for the usefulness of eGFR alone as a screening test is less secure, and markers of kidney damage are required to detect early stages because eGFR alone can only detect CKD stage 3 or worse. Because coincidence with other nondiabetic CKD is relatively frequent, evaluation of a person with atypical features should, in selected cases, include additional diagnostic testing, and care should be used in determining tests because radiographic contrast may pose greater risks in people with diabetes and CKD than in others.

### Renal histology in diabetic nephropathy predicts progression to end-stage kidney disease but not the rate of renal function decline [^116U27Eu]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

With nearly one in every ten Americans diagnosed with diabetes, diabetic nephropathy (DN) has become the most common cause of kidney failure in the United States. Despite this alarming statistic, most patients with diabetes do not develop kidney failure, and in fact many develop only mild renal dysfunction.

eGFR is a key marker of kidney function, and in steady state reflects the degree of established chronic kidney disease. The rate of eGFR change, on the other hand, is a powerful clinical measure of DN progression. Recent evidence suggests that eGFR declines linearly in the majority of patients with diabetic nephropathy, although the rate may vary significantly between patients. While a number of high risk clinical features such as hypertension, high-grade albuminuria, and poor glycemic control are well established, our ability to measure the rate of kidney function loss in DN and identify "rapid progressors" remains limited. Understanding the factors that influence rate of eGFR decline could help predict the clinical course for individual patients and also help identify rapid progressors for studies of novel renoprotective agents.

Renal biopsy, although rarely performed for the evaluation of pure DN, could provide important structural information that might correlate with the rate of eGFR loss. In 2010, the Renal Pathological Society (RPS) devised a classification system for DN to standardize inter-biopsy comparisons, with separate categories for glomerular, interstitial, and vascular lesions. Early validation studies suggested that higher-grade lesions, as assessed by the RPS classification, are associated with a greater risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and need for dialysis. However, whether renal histology simply reflects established disease, which can be assessed non-invasively, or also can predict future rate of eGFR decline, remains unknown. Our aim was to determine whether the 2010 RPS histologic classification system outperformed clinical parameters in predicting the rate of post-biopsy eGFR loss and progression to ESKD in diabetic nephropathy.

### Diagnostic value of triglyceride and cystatin C ratio in diabetic kidney disease: a retrospective and prospective cohort study based on renal biopsy [^116GnFq1]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is one of the main microvascular complications of diabetes. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) and/or elevated Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) are characterized. In the past, the diagnosis of DKD was almost always based on clinical manifestations; however, not all patients with proteinuria or decreased renal function were diagnosed with DKD. It has been reported that the detection rate of non-diabetic kidney disease (NDKD) in type 2 diabetic patients undergoing kidney biopsy is increasing. Kidney biopsy is the gold standard for differentiating DKD from NDKD, but it is invasive and not suitable for routine clinical practice. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to actively seek more sensitive and non-invasive markers for differential diagnosis of DKD and NDKD. Previous studies have suggested that abnormal lipid metabolism and lipid deposition are closely related to the occurrence and development of DKD. It has also been pointed out that cystatin C can be used as a biomarker for early detection of DKD patients and can better reflect renal function changes in DKD patients. Based on the renal pathology of diabetic patients, this study intends to explore the clinical significance of TG/Cys-C ratio in the differential diagnosis of DKD and NDKD, and to verify the value of TG/Cys-C ratio in the differential diagnosis of DKD and NDKD.

### Timing of kidney biopsy in type 2 diabetic patients: a stepwise approach [^116ZNHnX]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), with its increasing prevalence, is one of the most crucial health problems, and diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of kidney failure with replacement therapy worldwide.

DN is usually diagnosed clinically based on its typical presentations (i.e. a long-standing duration of diabetes, presence of diabetic retinopathy, albuminuria without hematuria, and gradually progressive loss of eGFR), and absence of clinical or laboratory evidence of other kidney diseases. A kidney biopsy is not mandatory for diagnosing DN; otherwise, a biopsy should be considered when patients present with atypical features for DN and a non-diabetic renal disease (NDRD) is suspected.

Diabetes-independent factors can cause kidney injury even in patients with DM, resulting in different types of NDRD such as hypertensive nephrosclerosis, atheroembolic disease, genetic kidney disorders, glomerulonephritis, and all kinds of acute kidney injury. Treatment approaches for DN and NDRD may diverge. For instance, IgA nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous glomerulonephritis, and other primary and secondary glomerular diseases usually benefit from personalized treatment with immunosuppressants, other than conservative treatment, such as glycemic control, blood pressure control, and lipid-lowering therapy. Therefore, a kidney biopsy is crucial for NDRD in making an accurate diagnosis and planning appropriate treatment. Compared with DN, patients with NDRD were reported to have a better prognosis in both overall survival and renal survival. NDRD may have better outcomes when these conditions are identified early, and specific treatment are predisposed. If clinicians do not suspect the presence of NDRD, a kidney biopsy will not be performed, and etiologies of NDRD will never be identified. As a consequence, patients with NDRD will be treated as DN, and their outcomes will be jeopardized without proper therapy.

### Prevalence of non-diabetic kidney disease and inability of clinical predictors to differentiate it from diabetic kidney disease: results from a prospectively performed renal biopsy study [^116XqMFu]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

In most of the previous studies, the investigators have found difference in certain parameters between DKD and NDKD, but they have mostly not tested the same in the logistic regression model.

In few studies (retrospective studies of targeted renal biopsies), regression analysis was performed, and some even came up with equationsto predict probability of either DKD or NDKD. However, it is important to appreciate that these equations were of little use for decision making at individual patient level in day-to-day clinical practice.

Of patients with type 2 diabetes and renal involvement, 87.2% had presence of at least one traditional indicator for biopsy, even though ultimately 64.5% of them had a histopathological diagnosis of DKD. This highlights the limitations and impracticalities of the currently used parameters.

As clinicians, we need better clinical/laboratory markers, including newer biomarkers which could help discriminate DKD from NDKD and help exclude the need of biopsy in those with pure DKD and better help preselect individuals for biopsy with greater likelihood of NDKD who could benefit from other forms of therapy which could possibly change their clinical outcomes.

Limitations

The study results may have been different had we conducted the study at community level and included all subjects of type 2 diabetes with renal involvement irrespective of stage of kidney disease. Additionally, we could conduct biopsies only in those who gave consent, which meant many eligible subjects did not undergo biopsy. However, this was not possible because of ethical concerns and difficulty in interpretation of histopathology at the extremes of stages of renal involvement. We compared baseline data of those who consented to undergo biopsy and those who declined to undergo biopsy (in spite of fulfilling study criteria) and reassuringly found that there was no differences between the groups. The results of the study may additionally be cross-validated in a future study in a multicenter multinational and multiethnic population.

### Prevalence of non-diabetic kidney disease and inability of clinical predictors to differentiate it from diabetic kidney disease: results from a prospectively performed renal biopsy study [^1171THhh]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Renal involvement in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may be due to diabetes (diabetic kidney disease (DKD)), causes other than diabetes (non-diabetic kidney disease (NDKD)) or overlap of DKD and NDKD (mixed kidney disease group). Prevalence of NDKD and predictive value of clinical or biochemical indicators have been explored in retrospective cohorts with preselection biases warranting the need for prospectively conducted unbiased renal biopsy study.

Research design and methods

Consecutive subjects aged > 18 years with T2DM and renal involvement with estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30–60 mL/min/m² and/or albumin:creatinine ratio of > 300 mg/g were offered renal biopsy. Prevalence of DKD, NDKD and mixed kidney disease was documented. Clinical/laboratory parameters of subjects were recorded and compared between groups and were tested for ability to predict histopathological diagnosis.

Results

We screened 6247 subjects with T2DM of which 869 fulfilled inclusion criteria for biopsy. Of the 869 subjects, biopsy was feasible in 818 subjects. Out of 818, we recruited first 110 subjects who agreed to undergo renal biopsy. Among those 110 subjects, 73 (66.4%) had DKD; 20 (18.2%) had NDKD; and 17 (15.4%) had mixed kidney disease. Subjects with NDKD as compared with DKD had shorter duration of diabetes (p < 0.001), absence of retinopathy (p < 0.001) and absence of neuropathy (p < 0.001). Logistic regression revealed that only presence of retinopathy and duration of diabetes were statistically significant to predict histopathological diagnosis of DKD. 30% of DKD did not have retinopathy, thereby limiting the utility of the same as a discriminator. Use of traditional indicators of biopsy would have indicated a need for renal biopsy in 87.2% of subjects, though 64.5% of the subjects had DKD, who would not have benefitted from biopsy.

Conclusion

NDKD and mixed kidney disease in T2DM with renal involvement are very common and traditionally used parameters to select biopsies are of limited value in clinical decision making.

### An updated overview of diabetic nephropathy: diagnosis, prognosis, treatment goals and latest guidelines [^113qeDiz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major healthcare challenge. It occurs in up to 50% of those living with diabetes, is a major cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) that requires treatment with dialysis or renal transplantation, and is associated with significantly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. DN is a clinical syndrome characterized by persistent albuminuria and a progressive decline in renal function, but it is increasingly recognized that the presentation and clinical course of kidney disease in diabetes is heterogeneous. The term diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is now commonly used to encompass the spectrum of people with diabetes who have either albuminuria or reductions in renal function. In this article, the clinical presentation and approach to diagnosis of DKD will be discussed, as will its prognosis. The general principles of management of DKD will also be reviewed with reference to current international guidelines.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^114LsktC]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease in people with diabetes — clinical features: CKD in people with diabetes is usually a clinical diagnosis made based on the presence of albuminuria and/or reduced eGFR in the absence of signs or symptoms of other primary causes of kidney damage, with typical presentation including long-standing diabetes, retinopathy, albuminuria without gross hematuria, and gradually progressive loss of eGFR. Reduced eGFR without albuminuria has been frequently reported in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is becoming more common over time.
