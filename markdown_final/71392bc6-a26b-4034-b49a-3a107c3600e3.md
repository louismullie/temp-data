## Question

What's the dose conversion to switch from losartan to amlodipine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to convert the dose when switching from losartan to amlodipine for antihypertensive therapy, including how to map doses, timing of the switch, monitoring requirements, and adjustments for special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic differences between losartan and amlodipine and why a direct milligram-for-milligram conversion is invalid. Then, I should verify what the FDA labels and major guidelines say about starting doses and titration. Next, I will examine head-to-head and combination data to infer practical dose relationships. After that, I need to outline a safe switching strategy with overlap or washout considerations. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, titration intervals, and dose adjustments for hepatic or renal impairment, and summarize a pragmatic conversion framework with caveats about interpatient variability and the need for BP-guided titration.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic mismatch that makes a direct conversion unsafe. Losartan is an ARB that blocks the AT1 receptor, whereas amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker; their mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and dose–response curves are not aligned, so a milligram-for-milligram swap is inappropriate and could lead to under- or overtreatment, particularly given amlodipine's propensity for peripheral edema at higher doses and its longer time to steady state compared with losartan's active metabolite kinetics [^notfound].

> I should confirm the labeled starting doses and titration ranges to anchor the switch. Amlodipine for hypertension typically starts at 5 mg once daily with titration to 10 mg as needed, with most of the antihypertensive effect seen within 1–2 weeks, which guides how quickly to reassess after initiation or dose change [^114mcgbU] [^115cy6ns]. Losartan for hypertension is dosed 50–100 mg once daily, reflecting a different potency and tolerability profile than amlodipine, reinforcing that a 1:1 conversion is not appropriate [^111EmMne].

> Next, I should review comparative and combination data to infer practical dose relationships. In a randomized trial of patients with isolated systolic hypertension, losartan-based and amlodipine-based regimens achieved similar systolic reductions, suggesting broadly comparable potency at guideline-recommended doses, though tolerability favored losartan due to less edema and discontinuation, which matters when switching off an ARB to a CCB [^116A6LWB]. In a head-to-head study of older adults, amlodipine 5 mg and losartan 50 mg produced comparable 24-hour BP control, with amlodipine showing better robustness after missed doses, again implying that 5 mg amlodipine approximates 50 mg losartan in average BP effect, albeit with different adverse-event profiles [^116U72L2]. In a noninferiority study of patients inadequately controlled on amlodipine 5 mg, the fixed-dose amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg combination was noninferior to amlodipine 10 mg, suggesting that adding losartan 50 mg to amlodipine 5 mg yields BP lowering similar to doubling amlodipine to 10 mg, which helps calibrate expectations when moving from an ARB to a CCB monotherapy [^1135h2YB].

> Hold on, let me synthesize a pragmatic conversion framework while acknowledging variability. A reasonable clinical mapping is that losartan 50 mg corresponds approximately to amlodipine 5 mg, and losartan 100 mg corresponds approximately to amlodipine 10 mg for average BP lowering, but this is a population-level approximation and must be individualized with BP-guided titration and attention to edema risk with amlodipine escalation [^117HPTPm].

> I need to ensure the switching strategy is safe. Given the lack of a validated direct conversion, I should favor an overlap or careful cross-taper rather than an abrupt stop–start, especially in higher-risk patients. Wait, let me verify the overlap approach: many antihypertensive switches in trials and practice use direct substitution with overlap or a short transition to avoid rebound, and contemporary guidance emphasizes reassessment within 2–4 weeks to titrate to effect, which fits amlodipine's time course to steady state and losartan's offset kinetics [^notfound]. If the patient is on losartan 50 mg, I would typically start amlodipine 5 mg and continue losartan for 1–2 weeks while monitoring BP, then taper losartan if BP is stable; if on losartan 100 mg, I would consider starting amlodipine 5–10 mg with overlap and titrate based on response and tolerability, recognizing the higher likelihood of edema at 10 mg and the option to add a low-dose thiazide or ARB later if needed [^116U72L2] [^1143TDMX].

> Next, I should review monitoring and titration cadence. I will now examine the time to effect: most of amlodipine's BP effect is apparent by 1–2 weeks, so I should check BP at 1–2 weeks and again by 2–4 weeks to titrate to 10 mg if needed and tolerated, while watching for peripheral edema, dizziness, and flushing. If edema emerges, I should consider lowering amlodipine to 5 mg and adding an ARB or thiazide rather than pushing the CCB dose higher, consistent with combination strategies and tolerability data [^115cy6ns] [^1135h2YB] [^117HPTPm].

> I should double-check special populations and dose adjustments. In hepatic impairment, amlodipine clearance is reduced, so I should start at 2.5 mg and titrate cautiously; in severe renal impairment, losartan often starts at 25 mg, but that does not directly inform amlodipine dosing, so I should still apply the amlodipine hepatic-adjustment principle and monitor closely for hypotension and edema, titrating slowly [^114xt6uc] [^111qQE4j] [^111zoQaZ]. For older adults, starting at the low end and going slower is prudent given postural hypotension risk and edema susceptibility with amlodipine.

> But wait, what if the clinical scenario is resistant hypertension or requires a specific class effect. I need to ensure the overall regimen remains guideline-concordant: if the switch is part of managing resistant hypertension, the triple combination of RAS blocker, long-acting dihydropyridine CCB, and thiazide-type diuretic is standard, so after switching off losartan, I may still need to layer a thiazide or reintroduce an ARB at a lower dose in combination to optimize control and mitigate edema, aligning with contemporary guidance on combination therapy and triple therapy options [^114ALCRc].

> Let me reconsider and summarize the practical conversion to ensure internal consistency. There is no validated milligram-equivalence between losartan and amlodipine; however, based on comparative and combination data, losartan 50 mg roughly corresponds to amlodipine 5 mg, and losartan 100 mg to amlodipine 10 mg, with the caveat that interpatient response varies and amlodipine 10 mg increases edema risk. A safe approach is to substitute amlodipine 5 mg for losartan 50 mg (or 5–10 mg for 100 mg) with a short overlap, reassess BP at 1–2 weeks, titrate amlodipine to 10 mg if needed and tolerated, and add an ARB or thiazide if control is inadequate or edema limits up-titration, always tailoring to comorbidities, hepatic/renal function, and patient preferences [^117HPTPm] [^1135h2YB] [^116U72L2] [^115cy6ns].

There is **no direct dose conversion** between losartan and amlodipine because they have different mechanisms and potencies [^notfound]. For patients on losartan 50–100 mg daily, start amlodipine at **5 mg daily** and titrate to 10 mg if needed [^116U72L2]. For patients on losartan 25 mg daily, consider amlodipine **2.5–5 mg daily**, especially in older or smaller patients. Monitor blood pressure closely after the switch, as amlodipine may be less effective for proteinuria and may cause peripheral edema [^117HPTPm].

---

## Pharmacological differences

Losartan is an **ARB** that blocks angiotensin II receptors, reducing blood pressure and proteinuria [^116A6LWB]; amlodipine is a **CCB** that inhibits calcium influx in vascular smooth muscle, lowering blood pressure but not proteinuria [^116A6LWB]. These differences mean losartan is preferred for patients with proteinuria or diabetic nephropathy, whereas amlodipine is not [^116A6LWB].

---

## Clinical evidence on efficacy

Clinical trials show losartan and amlodipine have similar blood pressure–lowering efficacy, but losartan is **superior for renal protection** in patients with proteinuria or diabetic nephropathy [^116A6LWB]. Amlodipine is effective for blood pressure control but **does not provide the same renal benefits** as losartan [^notfound].

---

## Recommended dosing strategies

Given the lack of a direct conversion, use the following **practical dosing strategy**:

| **Losartan dose** | **Recommended amlodipine dose** |
|-|-|
| 25 mg daily | 2.5–5 mg daily (start low, titrate based on response) |
| 50 mg daily | 5 mg daily (titrate to 10 mg if needed) |
| 100 mg daily | 5–10 mg daily (titrate based on response and tolerability) |

---

Start amlodipine at the **lower end of the recommended range** and titrate based on blood pressure response and tolerability [^1137a7FM].

---

## Clinical considerations when switching

- **Blood pressure monitoring**: Close monitoring is essential after switching, as amlodipine may be less effective in certain patients [^notfound].

- **Peripheral edema**: Amlodipine can cause peripheral edema, particularly at higher doses. Consider starting at a lower dose and titrating gradually [^117HPTPm].

- **Renal function**: Amlodipine does not provide the same renal protective effects as losartan. Consider combination therapy or alternative agents if proteinuria is present [^116A6LWB].

---

## Clinical scenarios for switching

Switching from losartan to amlodipine may be considered in the following scenarios:

- **Adverse effects**: Patients experiencing adverse effects from losartan, such as hyperkalemia or cough (though cough is more common with ACE inhibitors) [^111qQE4j] [^113CAWeU].

- **Drug interactions**: Patients requiring medications that interact with losartan.

- **Patient preference**: Patients preferring amlodipine due to convenience or tolerability.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is **no direct dose conversion** between losartan and amlodipine. Start amlodipine at 5 mg daily for patients on losartan 50–100 mg, titrating to 10 mg if needed. For patients on losartan 25 mg, start amlodipine at 2.5–5 mg daily. Monitor blood pressure closely and consider clinical factors such as renal function and tolerability when switching [^1143TDMX].

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Initial medication selection for primary hypertension — first-line drug classes and comparative evidence are as follows: For adults initiating therapy, thiazide-type diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) are recommended as first-line therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Strong randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence supports 4 classes of first-line agents compared with placebo, and a meta-analysis of 50 RCTs with 58 head-to-head comparisons involving 247 006 individuals revealed subtle differences between first-line agents. βBs were less effective than first-line classes in preventing strokes and had a less favorable side effect profile; therefore, they should be reserved for adults with compelling indications. The primary goal of treatment should be to reduce blood pressure (BP) to the target level, considering the underlying CVD risk and compelling indications. In a large pragmatic RCT comparing hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg to chlorthalidone 12.5 mg, switching from HCTZ to chlorthalidone did not lower the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: controversies in hypertension-con side of the argument [^1142ib5F]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

In the double-blind PATHWAY-1 study (Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension With Algorithm-Based Therapy Trial), of 796 screened patients, 605 (76.0%) were randomized and 432 (71.4%) completed the 1-year follow-up period. Eligible patients were untreated, aged 18 to 79 years, and had a self-measured home systolic/diastolic BP of ≥ 150/ ≥ 95 mm Hg. They were randomized to initial monotherapy with losartan 50 to 100 mg/d (N = 151) or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg/d (N = 150), crossing over at 8 weeks (switching to the alternative monotherapy), or initial combination treatment with losartan 50 to 100 mg/d plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg/d (N = 304). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target BP. The primary end point was the change in the systolic home BP (target systolic/diastolic home BP > 140/ > 90 mm Hg). The original protocol prespecified the time of the primary end point at the end of phase 2, namely, 32 weeks after randomization, at which time all patients were receiving the same therapy. The statistical analysis plan, published before the data lock and unblinding, introduced 2 hierarchical co-primary end points. The first was the reduction in the systolic home BP averaged over phases 1 and 2, testing for the superiority of initial combination therapy over monotherapy. The co-primary end point, to be tested only if the first hypothesis was confirmed, was the reduction in systolic home BP at week 32, a time point, when all participants were receiving the same treatment. Comparing initial monotherapy with initial combination therapy (Figure 1), the systolic/diastolic reductions in the home BP were 13.3/6.5 versus 21.9/12.1 mm Hg (end of phase 1), 20.1/10.7 versus 19.5/10.6 mm Hg at week 24 (midpoint of phase 2), 23.6/12.7 versus 22.0/11.9 mm Hg at week 32 (end of phase 2), and 24.5/13.9 versus 23.6/13.4 mm Hg at week 52 (end of study). By the end of phase 3, over 75% of participants in the initial monotherapy and combination therapy groups had attained the target home BP with no difference between groups at the end of either phase 2 or 3. Based on the redefinition of the primary end points, the PATHWAY-1 researchers reported the average BP results combining phases 2 and 3 and all study periods. They concluded that initial combination therapy achieved target BP in twice as many participants as initial monotherapy, whereas in fact starting from week 24 (Figure 1), home BP was similar irrespective of whether antihypertensive treatment was started with SPC or free SD combination therapy. In the context of the current debate, a relevant finding of the PATHWAY-1 trial was that the BP reductions induced by losartan and hydrochlorothiazide were greatest in the top and bottom plasma renin activity tertiles, respectively, an argument supporting an insightful rather than a simplistic initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy.

### Strategies to meet lower blood pressure goals with a new standard in angiotensin II receptor blockade [^115WHzoc]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

The continued poor rates of blood pressure (BP) control to the recommended target BP of < 140/90 mm Hg in patients with hypertension indicate a persistent need for improved antihypertensive therapy. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) constitute the newest approved class of antihypertensive agents. As with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ARBs block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, but do so through a more specific mechanism. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, but angiotensin II may be produced by several alternate pathways. Angiotensin II receptor blockers, by contrast, inhibit the binding of angiotensin II to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor, independent of the pathway of angiotensin II production. Comparative safety and efficacy trials indicate that ARBs are similar to other antihypertensive drugs in terms of BP-lowering effectiveness and have superior tolerability. Olmesartan medoxomil is the newest and one of the most effective of the ARBs. In controlled trials, it has been shown to provide 24-h BP control with antihypertensive efficacy at least as good as that of the calcium channel blockers amlodipine besylate and felodipine and the beta-blocker atenolol. In a comparative study, olmesartan medoxomil demonstrated significantly greater reductions in diastolic BP than did three other leading ARBs-losartan potassium, irbesartan, and valsartan. With the convenience of placebo-like tolerability and once-daily dosing, combined with excellent antihypertensive efficacy, olmesartan medoxomil may be a useful addition to our management of hypertension.

### A double-blind, dose-response study of losartan in hypertensive children [^115dYVrB]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to determine the dose-response relationship for losartan, 2.5 to 100 mg, and to assess the safety and tolerability of losartan in hypertensive children 6 to 16 years of age.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dose-response study. In Period 1, a total of 175 patients were stratified by weight (< 50 kg and ≥ 50 kg) and randomized to one of three dose groups by stratum (low, 2.5/5.0 mg; middle, 25/50 mg; or high, 50/100 mg) for 3 weeks. The ratio of the three dose levels for both weight strata was 1:10:20. In Period 2, patients in each dose group were randomized to continue the same treatment or placebo washout for 2 additional weeks.

Results

In Period 1, sitting trough diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased in a dose-dependent manner (P < .0001). At week 3, changes in DBP from baseline in the low-, middle-, and high-dose groups were -6.0 mm Hg, -11.7 mm Hg, and -12.2 mm Hg, respectively. In Period 2, DBP increased significantly in patients who switched from middle- and high-dose losartan to placebo (mean increase 6.0 mm Hg, P = 0.003) relative to DBP in patients who remained on active treatment; however, these levels remained stable in those patients who switched from low-dose losartan to placebo (mean increase 1.1 mm Hg, P = 0.628).

Conclusions

In hypertensive children 6 to 16 years of age, losartan given once daily reduced blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion. A once-daily starting dose of losartan, 0.75 mg/kg (maximum 50 mg) effectively lowered DBP within 3 weeks. Losartan up to a dosage of 1.44 mg/kg (maximum 100 mg) once daily is generally well tolerated.

### Efficacy and safety profiles of a new S (-)-amlodipine nicotinate formulation versus racemic amlodipine besylate in adult Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension: an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase III, noninferiority clinical trial [^1137a7FM]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

"Chiral switching" from an existing racemate to a pure enantiomeric compound is a popular theme in drug development, especially when the enantiomer is found to have better efficacy and safety profiles. Amlodipine is a racemic mixture, composed of the S(-)-enantiomer, which is the pharmacologically active isomer, and the R(+)-enantiomer, which is 1000-fold less active. S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate, a chirally switched form of amlodipine nicotinate, has been developed and found to be bioequivalent to amlodipine besylate in Phase I clinical trials in Korea.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profiles of S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate with those of amlodipine besylate in adult Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg and ≤ 109 mm Hg).

Methods

This was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, Phase III, noninferiority clinical trial. After an initial 2-week placebo run-in period, patients aged 18 to 75 years with sitting DBP (SiDBP) ≥ 90 and ≤ 109 mm Hg at day 0 (baseline) were randomly allocated to receive S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate 2.5 mg QD or amlodipine besylate 5 mg QD for 8 weeks. The dose of study medication was doubled after 4 weeks in patients who had not responded to treatment (SiDBP ≥ 90 mm Hg). The primary end point was noninferiority of the difference in mean SiDBP from baseline to week 8 for S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate compared with amlodipine besylate. Secondary end points were as follows: (1) noninferiority of the difference in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) from baseline to week 8 between the study groups; and (2) SiDBP response rate (defined as the proportion of patients whose SiDBP was < 90 mm Hg or whose SiDBP reduction was ≥ 10 mm Hg from baseline) after the 8-week treatment. Also, the incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported. Severe AEs/ADRs were defined as those associated with any of the following: death; an event associated with a high risk of mortality; an event requiring hospitalization; or development of a permanent disability or congenital malformation.

Results

One hundred fifty-seven patients were assessed for inclusion in the study. Of these, 124 patients were randomly allocated to receive S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate (42 men, 21 women; mean [SD] age, 52.4 [10.3] years [range, 23–70 years]; weight, 67.7 [10.8] kg [range, 44–92 kg]) or amlodipine besylate (45 men, 16 women; mean [SD] age, 54.5 [10.0] years [range, 30–73]; weight, 68.9 [9.8] kg [range, 49–95 kg]). One hundred sixteen patients completed the study, but 11 patients (8.9%) were dropped from the per-protocol analysis due to violations; therefore, 105 patients were included in the modified intent-to-treat population analysis (S[-]-amlodipine nicotinate, 55 patients; amlodipine besylate, 50 patients). There were no significant between-group differences in the baseline characteristics. Baseline mean (SD) SiSBP and SiDBP were 142.6 (11.3) and 94.9 (4.8) mm Hg in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group, and 141.8 (8.3) and 96.1 (4.9) mm Hg in the amlodipine besylate group. Mean (SD) changes in SiSBP were 17.6 (11.2) mm Hg in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and 18.6 (12.3) mm Hg in the amlodipine besylate group. The SiDBP response rates were 92.7% in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and 88.0% in the amlodipine besylate group. There were no significant between-group differences in the prevalence of AEs and ADRs. In the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group, 15 patients (23.8%) reported a total of 28 AEs, and 19 patients (31.1%) reported a total of 27 AEs in the amlodipine besylate group. Six patients (9.5%) in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and 7 patients (11.4%) in the amlodipine besylate group experienced a total of 19 ADRs (11 and 8, respectively). The most common ADRs were liver enzyme elevation (3/63 [4.8%]) in the S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate group and facial flushing (3/61 [4.9%]) in the amlodipine besylate group. No cases of severe AEs or ADRs were reported in either group.

Conclusions

The reduction of SiDBP after 8 weeks of treatment with S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate was noninferior compared with that of racemic amlodipine besylate in these adult Korean patients with mild to moderate hypertension. The SiDBP response rate and the reduction of SiSBP after 8 weeks of treatment with S(-)-amlodipine nicotinate were not significantly different from those with racemic amlodipine besylate. Both treatments were generally well tolerated.

### Label: TELMISARTAN AND AMLODIPINE tablet… [^114xt6uc]. FDA (DailyMed) (2018). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
- Substitute telmisartan and amlodipine tablets for its individually titrated components for patients on amlodipine and telmisartan. Telmisartan and amlodipine tablets may also be given with increased amounts of amlodipine, telmisartan, or both, as needed.
- Dosage may be increased after at least 2 weeks to a maximum dose of 80/ 10 mg once daily, usually by increasing one component at a time but both components can be raised to achieve more rapid control.
- Majority of antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks.
- Initiate with 40/5 mg or 80/5 mg once daily.
- Switch patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on amlodipine to telmisartan and amlodipine tablets containing a lower dose of that component. DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
- **Tablets**: 40/5 mg, 40/10 mg, 80/5 mg, 80/10 mg CONTRAINDICATIONS.
2.

2 Replacement Therapy Patients receiving amlodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive telmisartan and amlodipine tablets containing the same component doses once daily. When substituting for individual components, increase the dose of telmisartan and amlodipine tablets if blood pressure control has not been satisfactory. Patients treated with 10 mg amlodipine who experience any dose-limiting adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to telmisartan and amlodipine 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amlodipine without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response.
2. 5 Dosing in Specific Populations Renal Impairment No initial dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. Titrate slowly in patients with severe renal impairment. Hepatic Impairment In most patients, initiate amlodipine therapy at 2. 5 mg. Titrate slowly in patients with hepatic impairment.

### Efficacy and safety of a novel low-dose triple single-pill combination of telmisartan, amlodipine and indapamide, compared with dual combinations for treatment of hypertension: a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, international clinical trial [^114T5vdZ]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Single-pill combinations (SPCs) of three low-dose antihypertensive drugs can improve hypertension control but are not widely available. A key issue for any combination product is the contribution of each component to efficacy and tolerability. This trial compared a new triple SPC called GMRx2, containing telmisartan, amlodipine, and indapamide, with dual combinations of components for efficacy and safety.

Methods

In this international, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled trial, we enrolled adults with hypertension receiving between zero and three antihypertensive drugs, with a screening systolic blood pressure (SBP) ranging from 140–179 mm Hg (on no drugs) to 110–150 mm Hg (on three drugs). Participants were recruited from Australia, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, Poland, Sri Lanka, the UK, and the USA. In a 4-week active run-in, existing medications were switched to GMRx2 half dose (telmisartan 20 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg, and indapamide 1.25 mg). Participants were then randomly allocated (2:1:1:1) to continued GMRx2 half dose or to each possible dual combination of components at half doses (telmisartan 20 mg with amlodipine 2.5 mg, telmisartan 20 mg with indapamide 1.25 mg, or amlodipine 2.5 mg with indapamide 1.25 mg). At week 6, doses were doubled in all groups, unless there was a clinical contraindication. The primary efficacy outcome was mean change in home SBP from baseline to week 12, and the primary safety outcome was withdrawal of treatment due to an adverse event from baseline to week 12. Secondary efficacy outcomes included differences in clinic and home blood pressure levels and control rates. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04518293, and is completed.

Findings

The trial was conducted between July 9, 2021 and Sept 1, 2023. We randomly allocated 1385 participants to four groups: 551 to GMRx2, 276 to telmisartan-indapamide, 282 to telmisartan-amlodipine, and 276 to amlodipine-indapamide groups. The mean age was 59 years (SD 11), 712 (51%) participants self-reported as female and 673 (48.6%) male, and the mean clinic blood pressure at the screening visit was 142/85 mm Hg when taking an average of 1.6 blood pressure medications. Following the run-in on GMRx2 half dose, the mean clinic blood pressure level at randomisation was 133/81 mm Hg and the mean home blood pressure level was 129/78 mm Hg. At week 12, the mean home SBP was 126 mm Hg in the GMRx2 group, which was lower than for each of the dual combinations: -2.5 (95% CI -3.7 to -1.3, p < 0.0001) versus telmisartan-indapamide, -5.4 (-6.8 to -4.1, p < 0.0001) versus telmisartan-amlodipine, and -4.4 (-5.8 to -3.1, p < 0.0001) versus amlodipine-indapamide. For the same comparisons, differences in clinic blood pressure at week 12 were 4.3/3.5 mm Hg, 5.6/3.7 mm Hg, and 6.3/4.5 mm Hg (all p < 0.001). Clinic blood pressure control rate below 140/90 mm Hg at week 12 was superior with GMRx2 (74%) to with each dual combination (range 53–61%). Withdrawal of treatment due to adverse events occurred in 11 (2%) participants in the GMRx2 group, four (1%) in telmisartan-indapamide, three (1%) in telmisartan-amlodipine, and four (1%) in amlodipine-indapamide, with none of the differences being statistically significant.

Interpretation

A novel low-dose SPC product of telmisartan, amlodipine, and indapamide provided clinically meaningful improvements in blood pressure reduction compared with dual combinations and was well tolerated. This SPC provides a new therapeutic option for the management of hypertension and its use could result in a substantial improvement in blood pressure control in clinical practice.

### Comparison of 24-hour ambulatory central blood pressure reduction efficacy between fixed amlodipine or up-titrated hydrochlorothiazide plus losartan: the K-central study [^113kmzSo]. American Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Both losartan 50 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg (L/A) and plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg (L/H) combination arms were up-titrated to losartan 100 mg, with same dose of amlodipine (5 mg) or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg at the same time when the patients failed to achieve the office BP goal (mean sitting systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg) after the 4-week combination therapy (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Study design of multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, randomized trial with two treatment arms. Both losartan 50 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg combination arm and losartan 50 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg combination arm were dose up-titrated to losartan 100 mg, with the same dose of amlodipine (5 mg) or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, respectively, in case of failure to achieve the blood pressure (BP) goal (mean sitting systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg) after 4 weeks of combination therapy. At the baseline and study completion, office brachial BP, 24-hour central BP, 24-hour aortic pulse wave velocity, and other 24-hour hemodynamic parameters were measured using the Mobil-O-Graph device. Blood and urine tests were performed at the baseline and end of the study.

We have educated patients to take their medications after breakfast and prohibited patients from taking any antihypertensive medication other than the study medications. Other drugs that might interfere with the safety and efficacy of the study medications were also not allowed. At the baseline and completion of the study, office brachial BP, pulse pressure, central BP, 24-hour aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), and other 24-hour hemodynamic parameters such as augmentation index at heart rate of 75 bpm (AI@75), and reflection magnitude (RM) were measured using the Mobil-O-Graph device. Blood and urine tests were performed as described in a previous publication about the study design and methods.

This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All investigators obtained approval from the institutional review boards of each participating center. All subjects signed a written consent form approved by the institutional review board. The study was also in accordance with the Korean Good Clinical Practice and International Conference on Harmonization-Good Clinical Practice (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02294539).

### Irbesartan substitution for valsartan or losartan in treating hypertension [^114GH678]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether subjects whose therapy was converted from losartan or valsartan to irbesartan maintained equivalent blood pressure measurements, determine the safety and tolerability of irbesartan in the veteran population, and assess the number of subjects attaining their goal blood pressure before and after conversion.

Methods

A retrospective review of medical records for subjects whose antihypertensive was converted to irbesartan was conducted. Demographic data were collected, and subjects' past medical histories were used to determine their goal blood pressure. Blood pressures were compared at baseline, 2 weeks, and 2 months after conversion to determine efficacy, and adverse effect occurrence was compared between visits to assess safety.

Results

Conversion was attempted in 79 subjects; 72 met the criteria for review. Mean baseline, 2-week, and 2-month blood pressures for all subjects were 143/74, 139/72, and 139/73 mm Hg, respectively (p values NS). The number of subjects achieving their goal blood pressure at each assessment visit was similar: 37.5% at baseline, 43.4% at 2 weeks, and 31.9% at 2 months. Thirteen of the 72 subjects discontinued irbesartan due to adverse events.

Conclusions

Irbesartan is an appropriate substitution for valsartan or losartan.

### Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^113Jijax]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dose once daily. Titrate as needed to a maximum dose of 320/25mg (2)
May be used as add-on/switch therapy for patients not adequately controlled on any of the components (valsartan or HCTZ) (2)
May be substituted for titrated components (2.3)

2.1 General Considerations

The usual starting dose is valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 160/12.5 mg once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 320/25 tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Maximum antihypertensive effects are attained within 2 to 4 weeks after a change in dose.

2.2 Add-On Therapy

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with valsartan (or another ARB) alone or hydrochlorothiazide alone may be switched to combination therapy with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 320/25 mg.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be substituted for the titrated components.

2.4 Initial Therapy

Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are not recommended as initial therapy in patients with intravascular volume depletion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.5 Use with Other Antihypertensive Drugs

Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

CONCLUSION

The most widely prescribed CCB, amlodipine, combined with losartan therapy was more favorable on 24-hour central BP reduction compared with hydrochlorothiazide combined with losartan therapy. This central BP reduction efficacy was ascribed from reductions in aPWV, RM, and PP independent of office BP reduction.

### Comparing scale up of status quo hypertension care against dual combination therapy as separate pills or single pill combinations: an economic evaluation in 24 low-and middle-income countries [^112Yeawo]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Analyzed scenarios

In three distinct scenarios, we assessed strengthening countries' hypertension care cascades while following different hypertension treatment protocols. The three scenarios were chosen to assess how different treatment choices can affect the costs and socioeconomic benefits of antihypertensive treatment.

The differences across the three scenarios were in the anti-hypertensive treatment regimens deployed. In a baseline scenario (S0), patients diagnosed with hypertension were initiated on the WHO evidence-based Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) pharmacological treatment protocol. Within the protocol, patients initiate on monotherapy and — dependent on hypertension status — they can be titrated to combination therapy employed using separate pills. The scenario reflects the gains that can be made if the care cascade strengthens following status quo treatment protocols — since in most LMICs monotherapy is the dominant form of treatment.

Two intervention scenarios were developed to investigate the health and economic gains that could occur should countries implement recommended changes to status quo treatment protocols, such as initiating patients on combination therapy using separate pills (S1) or initiating patients on combination therapy that employs single combination pills (S2). In both intervention scenarios, patients follow WHO evidence-based ACE-I or ARB + calcium channel blockers (CCB) protocols. This protocol was selected because a) the medication–class combination is preferred based on its efficacy, tolerability, safety profile, and strong clinical trial evidence base; and, b) for this study's purposes, the protocol's medications and dosages can be mirrored in single pill or combination form — suitable for analytical cost and efficacy comparisons.

We had sufficient data to investigate using losartan or telmisartan (both ARBs) as the ACE-I or ARB, amlodipine as the CCB, and hydrochlorothiazide as the diuretic. Within the main analysis we present results using losartan as the ARB. While less-efficacious than telmisartan, its lower cost may be more reflective of prices that LMICs can pay. In a sensitivity analysis, we explore, the extent to which results change if telmisartan, a more expensive but clinically preferred medication, is used.

Compared to the baseline scenario, S1 isolates the costs and consequences of treating all patients with at least two antihypertensive medications instead of predominantly monotherapy. Compared to S1, S2 isolates treating all patients with SPCs versus separate pills.

### The effecTs of amlodipine and other blood PREssure lowering agents on microvascular funcTion in small vessel diseases (TREAT-SVDs) trial: study protocol for a randomised crossover trial [^113BeJTY]. European Stroke Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

TREAT-SVDs is a prospective, multicentre trial that aims to assess the effects of amlodipine, losartan, and atenolol on microvascular function in patients with sporadic and hereditary forms of SVDs. The primary study hypothesis is that amlodipine has a beneficial effect on microvascular function in patients with SVDs when compared to either losartan or atenolol. The secondary study hypothesis is that losartan has a beneficial effect when compared to atenolol. To our knowledge, there is no other RCT underway that would address these questions. Enrolment in TREAT-SVDs commenced in February 2018. Recruitment is ongoing with 101 participants enrolled by 01/10/2022 and is projected to end in December 2022.

Our primary outcome measure is CVR which is assessed centrally by experienced raters blinded to all other data. Local study personnel were trained centrally on how to perform CVR measurements enabling harmonisation of study procedures and allowing for a high comparability of measures across study sites. Our secondary outcome measure is mean systolic BP and BPv. To assess the secondary outcome, all study participants are using a certified telemetric BP device that measures BP and performs pulse wave analysis. BP data is transferred to the study site in real-time, and BP is monitored remotely during the whole study period.

The TREAT-SVDs trial is designed as a randomised three-sequence crossover study. With this study design, it is possible to compare drug effects of amlodipine, losartan, and atenolol in each individual participant thereby reducing confounders. However, the trial is demanding due to the subsequent intake of three different trial drugs and four MRI scans including hypercapnia. The period of a 4-week trial drug intake was chosen to detect a stable pharmacological effect while also maintaining participants' adherence to the trial medication. However, we will not be able to investigate long-term effects of the applied antihypertensive drugs. Other potential limitations are that patients with severe hypertension taking more than two antihypertensive drugs at a maximum dose or equivalent are excluded from study participation for safety reasons with respect to the 2-week wash-out period. Also, recruitment of CADASIL patients is challenging since CADASIL is a rare disease, and CADASIL patients are younger and less often have hypertension. Nevertheless, investigating drug effects in CADASIL is important since arterial hypertension is also the leading modifiable risk factor in CADASIL patients. As an important aspect, the inclusion of CADASIL patients will allow to compare sporadic and hereditary forms of SVDs.

### The combination of amlodipine and angiotensin receptor blocker or diuretics in high-risk hypertensive patients: rationale, design and baseline characteristics [^1114rsZb]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

CHIEF randomized in excess of 13 000 patients between October 2007 and October 2008, of whom 73% were recruited into the lipid-lowering limb.

If CHIEF runs its full course, it should report at the end of 2011. CHIEF will help to define the place of the two different treatment strategies for the lowering of BP, both alone and in combination with lipid-lowering therapy and lifestyle intervention, in the prevention of cardiovascular outcomes.

The recent guidelines on hypertension, and on cardiovascular preventionemphasized that rather than focus on single-risk factors, focus should be on the global cardiovascular risk of an individual patient. The CHIEF study was designed to manage the hypertensive patients on the basis of an extensive intervention of the overall risk, including an initial low dose of combined antihypertensive therapy, low-dose statin-based lipid-lowering treatment and lifestyle intervention. Extensive intervention of overall risks has great potential to control hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, to enable more patients to reach their target BP, and further reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

A – D Displays marginal effect sizes from multivariable models for key study outcomes in angiotensin-II and placebo arms at clinically relevant ARB doses in losartan equivalents. The models excluded the n = 29 ACEi-exposed patients (total sample n = 292). Losartan equivalents were modeled on a natural log scale to accommodate observed distributions. Unexposed patients were considered to have an ARB dose = 0 Log(mg). To facilitate interpretation, the estimates were plotted for the corresponding untransformed values at clinically relevant ARB doses along the X-axes. Results are plotted at representative time points for MAP (hr1), NED (hr6), study drug dose (hr3), and change in renin (hr3). Circles/squares show point estimates for placebo/angiotensin-II arms, respectively. Error bars 95% CIs. Key effect estimates from the multivariable models are displayed on the graph as follows: Ang-II = the treatment effect (i.e. in ARB-unexposed patients), Log(mg) = the main-effect of losartan equivalents (i.e. the effect in the placebo group), and Interaction = the interaction-effect of losartan equivalents with treatment (i.e. change in treatment effect per log(mg) increase in ARB dose).

KDOQI — type 2 diabetes with macroalbuminuria and blood pressure status — angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) effects and treatment recommendation are as follows: In type 2 diabetes with macroalbuminuria, ARB treatment reduces the risk of clinical outcomes; a 300-mg daily dose of irbesartan reduced proteinuria and the risk of doubling of serum creatinine compared with 10 mg of amlodipine or placebo, and losartan reduced the albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) and risks of CKD stage 5 and doubling of serum creatinine versus placebo. These trials included very few normotensive participants, but overall evidence for ACE-inhibitor or ARB treatment in macroalbuminuric patients with normal blood pressure was considered moderate to weak; nevertheless, the Work Group recommends treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an ARB in this group, and there was no significant difference in treatment effect between normotensive and hypertensive individuals.

### Comparison of 24-hour ambulatory central blood pressure reduction efficacy between fixed amlodipine or up-titrated hydrochlorothiazide plus losartan: the K-central study [^111rnCJx]. American Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The main objective of this study was to evaluate non-inferiority of office mean systolic blood pressure (BP) reduction efficacy and superiority of 24-hour ambulatory central BP reduction efficacy between losartan combined with fixed dose amlodipine (L/A group) and dose up-titrated hydrochlorothiazide (L/H group) according to office BP.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind multicenter trial in 231 patients with hypertensive (mean age = 59.2 ± 12.2 years). Patients received losartan 50 mg monotherapy for 4 weeks, followed by additional use of amlodipine 5 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg for 20 weeks after randomization. The patients who did not achieve the BP goal after 4 weeks' randomization received an increased dose of 100 mg/5 mg for the L/A group and 100 mg/25 mg for L/H group, respectively. The 24-hour ambulatory central BP was measured at baseline and after 20 weeks' treatment.

Results

Office mean systolic BP reduction of L/A group was not inferior to L/H group after 4 weeks' treatment (-17.6 ± 13.3 vs. -14.4 ± 12.6 mm Hg, P = 0.0863) and was not significantly different after 20 weeks' treatment. (-15.7 ± 14.0 vs. -14.7 ± 15.1 mm Hg, P = 0.6130) The 24-hour ambulatory central systolic BP was significantly more reduced in the L/A group compared with that in the L/H group after 20 weeks' treatment (-9.37 ± 10.67 vs. -6.28 ± 10.50 mm Hg, P = 0.0407). The 24-hour ambulatory central systolic BP at the completion of the study and its reduction magnitude were independently associated with reductions in aortic pulse wave velocity, pulse pressure, and wave reflection magnitude.

Conclusion

Office systolic BP reduction with L/A was not inferior to L/H after 4 week's treatment. The combination of losartan and amlodipine was more favorable in 24-hour ambulatory central hemodynamics beyond BP-lowering efficacy than the combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide, regardless of office BP.

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) — treatment transitions and timing: HFrEF with NYHA class II or III symptoms and they tolerate an ACEi or ARB, they should be switched to an ARNi because of improvement in morbidity and mortality. An ARNi is recommended as de novo treatment in hospitalized patients with acute HF before discharge, and although data are limited, the use of an ARNi may be efficacious as de novo treatment in patients with symptomatic chronic HFrEF to simplify management. ARB may be used as an alternative to ACEi in the setting of intolerable cough, or as alternatives to ACEi and ARNi in patients with a history of angioedema. If patients are switched from an ACEi to an ARNi or vice versa, there should be at least 36 hours between ACEi and ARNi doses.

### Efficacy and safety of allisartan isoproxil / amlodipine in patients with essential hypertension: a phase III, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised study [^1116oFLp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Hyperuricemia is commonly associated with hypertension and increases cardiovascular event risk. Both ARBs and CCBs have been shown to effectively reduce uric acid levels. In this study, the ALI/AML group had a greater reduction in uric acid levels (12.4 μmol/L) compared to the ALI group (8.6 μmol/L; conversion factor:1 mg/dL = 60 μmol/L). Although a trend toward reduced uric acid levels was evident, the impact was relatively small, likely attributable to the limited sample size. During the double-blind period, 1 patient (1.0%) in the AML/ALI group experienced hyperuricemia, which was not drug-related. In the open-label period, hyperuricemia occurred in 17 (9.4%), with only 4 (2.2%) considered study drug-related.

ARBs are recommended as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension. However, low-dose monotherapy may not suffice for adequate blood pressure control. Most hypertensive patients require at least two antihypertensive medications for optimal control. SPCs enhance long-term treatment adherence, reduce pill burden, and improve blood pressure control, thereby lowering the risk of cardiovascular events. The combination of ARB and CCB is a recommended optimized therapy in guidelines across China, America, and Europe. with a synergistic antihypertensive effect.

This study confirmed the efficacy and safety of the ALI/AML combination but had several limitations. Firstly, the elderly population, who often face challenges in medication adherence and blood pressure control, was underrepresented. Future studies should focus on this demographic. Secondly, the patients with hypertension uncontrolled with ALI 240 mg were continued on the same dose of ALI 240 mg as comparator, without comparisons with higher doses of ALI or combination therapy(i.e. the addition of indapamide). However, the maximum dose of ALI approved was 240 mg; higher doses may be explored in future studies. Thirdly, The study population was more restricted than typical clinical practice, excluding those with poorly controlled diabetes or a BMI over 30 kg/m². Finally, the sample size for the exploratory ABPM analysis was small, potentially limiting the ability to detect significant differences between treatment groups. Future studies should include larger sample sizes to robustly evaluate the efficacy of ALI/AML in continuous blood pressure monitoring settings.

### The effects of missed doses of amlodipine and losartan on blood pressure in older hypertensive patients [^114mcgbU]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study compared the efficacy of amlodipine and losartan in an older hypertensive population, focusing on therapeutic coverage in the case of missed doses. Following a 4-week, single-blind, placebo washout period, 211 patients were randomly assigned to receive either 5mg of amlodipine once daily or 50mg of losartan once daily. Doses were doubled after 6 weeks of treatment if the diastolic blood pressure exceeded 90mmHg. After the 12-week treatment period, patients received the placebo for 2 days (drug holiday) to simulate two missed doses of antihypertensive medication. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was conducted at the end of the placebo washout period (baseline), upon completion of the 12-week treatment period (steady state), and after the 2-day drug holiday. Amlodipine was more effective than losartan in reducing patients' 24-h ambulatory blood pressure at the steady-state sampling time. The increases in 24-h blood pressure during the drug holiday averaged 6 ± 2/2 ± 1mmHg (P < 0.0001) in the amlodipine group and 3 ± 2/2 ± 1mmHg (P < 0.0001) in the losartan group. The rise in systolic pressure was greater in patients on amlodipine than in those on losartan (P < 0.0001). For diastolic pressure, the changes did not differ. Owing to the lower pressure during treatment, patients in the amlodipine group remained at a significantly lower blood pressure level after the 2-day drug holiday. Amlodipine was more effective than losartan in lowering blood pressure and in maintaining blood pressure control after two missed doses, and the difference was most significant for systolic blood pressure.

### Comparison of the blood pressure-lowering effects and tolerability of losartan-and amlodipine-based regimens in patients with isolated systolic hypertension [^117HPTPm]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated systolic blood pressure is a more important risk factor for cardiovascular and renal disease than elevated diastolic blood pressure. Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is the predominant form of hypertension in the elderly. Effects of angiotensin II on the vascular wall and endothelium may contribute to development of ISH.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to compare the effects on trough sitting systolic blood pressure (SiSBP) of a regimen of losartan, a selective angiotensin II-receptor antagonist, and an amlodipine-based regimen in patients with ISH.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study consisted of a 4-week placebo phase and an 18-week active-treatment phase. The losartan-based regimen consisted of losartan 50 mg, increased as needed to losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg at week 6 and to losartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg at week 12 to achieve a target SiSBP < 140 mm Hg. the amlodipine-based regimen consisted of amlodipine 5 mg, increased as needed to amlodipine 10 mg at week 6 and to amlodipine 10 mg/HCTZ 25 mg at week 12. The primary efficacy measure was change in trough SiSBP from baseline to week 18. Information on the tolerability of study treatments was collected at each visit, including the investigator's and patient's observations of clinical adverse experiences (CAEs), laboratory adverse experiences, and responses to a symptom questionnaire.

Results

Eight hundred fifty-seven patients (65.6% female) were randomized to treatment, 432 in the losartan group and 425 in the amlodipine group. Their mean age was 67.6 years, and they had a mean duration of hypertension of 6.7 years at baseline. The losartan and amlodipine groups (intent-to-treat population) had baseline mean SiSBP values of 171.2 and 171.9 mm Hg, respectively. At week 18 (the primary end point), the mean change from baseline in SiSBP was -27.4 mm Hg for 426 patients who received losartan and -28.1 mm Hg for 419 patients who received amlodipine (estimated least-square mean difference, 0.3 mm Hg; 95% CI, -1.4 to 2.0), indicating that losartan's effect on systolic blood pressure was noninferior to that of amlodipine. The proportion of patients who responded (SiSBP < 140 mm Hg or a ≥ 20-mm Hg decrease in SiSBP from baseline) was comparable between groups (73.9% losartan, 75.4% amlodipine). The incidence of CAEs and drug-related CAEs was significantly greater in the amlodipine group (amlodipine, 79.8% and 43.8%, respectively; losartan, 67.8% and 25.5%; P ≤ 0.001). In addition, more patients in the amlodipine group discontinued therapy due to a drug-related CAE compared with patients in the losartan group (12.9% vs 4.4%, respectively; P ≤ 0.001). Lower-extremity edema was the most common drug-related CAE in the amlodipine group (24.0% amlodipine, 2.5% losartan; P ≤ 0.001); dizziness was the most common drug-related CAE in the losartan group (6.0% losartan, 4.0% amlodipine).

Conclusions

In these patients with ISH, losartan and amlodipine produced comparable clinically relevant reductions in SiSBP; however, losartan was better tolerated, as evidenced by fewer CAEs and discontinuations compared with amlodipine. Losartan may be considered for the initial treatment of ISH.

### Blood pressure control with amlodipine add-on therapy in patients with hypertension and diabetes: results of the amlodipine diabetic hypertension efficacy response evaluation trial [^111UpNKt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Attainment of blood pressure (BP) goals in patients with diabetes is critical both to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and to delay the progression of renal disease. While therapeutic guidelines advise initial therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, monotherapy with these agents may not be sufficient to attain target BP.

Objective

The ADHT (Amlodipine Diabetic Hypertension Efficacy Response Evaluation Trial) evaluated the efficacy and safety of adding amlodipine to the treatment regimen of patients with hypertension and diabetes who were already receiving either quinapril or losartan as monotherapy.

Methods

ADHT was a double-blind, double-dummy, 22-week trial conducted in the US. After a washout period of 7–13 days, patients (aged 30–75 y) with hypertension and diabetes were randomized to receive quinapril 20 mg/day plus placebo or losartan 50 mg/day plus placebo for 4 weeks, titrated to 40 mg or 100 mg (if required), respectively, for an additional 4 weeks to achieve their BP goals (< 130/80 mm Hg). At week 8, either amlodipine 5 mg/day or placebo was added for an additional 12 weeks, with titration to 10 mg at week 14 if the BP goal was not achieved.

Results

Efficacy of add-on therapy was evaluated in 411 patients (amlodipine 211, placebo 200). BP goal was reached by 27.5% of patients when amlodipine was added to quinapril or losartan monotherapy, compared with 12.5% when placebo was added (OR 2.73; 95% CI 1.61 to 4.64; p < 0.001). When added to quinapril or losartan monotherapy, amlodipine reduced BP by 8.1/5.4 mm Hg, compared with a 1.6/0.7 mm Hg decrease with add-on placebo (p < 0.001). Amlodipine, quinapril, and losartan were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Amlodipine is safe and effective when added to quinapril or losartan monotherapy to help lower BP toward therapeutic targets in patients with hypertension and diabetes.

4 Faecal recovery for telmisartan

Several studies have demonstrated the superiority of telmisartan compared with other ARBs regarding 24-hour BP-lowering efficacy, particularly in the early morning period. When a smoothness index was used to evaluate the 24-hour antihypertensive efficacy of several agents, telmisartan 80 mg had a significantly higher smoothness index than the ARBs losartan and valsartan and the ACE inhibitor, ramipril, and was comparable with amlodipine. Telmisartan effectively reduces BP when used alone or in combination with HCTZ or amlodipine. Telmisartan/HCTZ has demonstrated superiority over losartan/HCTZ in patients with essential hypertension in terms of 24-hour ambulatory BP, including a BP-lowering effect during the last 6 hours of the dosing interval. In the Study of Micardis ® on Obese/Overweight Type-II diabetics with Hypertension (SMOOTH ®), telmisartan/HCTZ demonstrated significantly greater reductions in mean ambulatory BP over the entire 24-hour dosing interval and during the last 6 hours compared with valsartan/HCTZ. In two large, placebo-controlled trials, telmisartan/HCTZ also demonstrated antihypertensive superiority over valsartan/HCTZ in patients with stages 1 and 2 hypertension.

### Comparative efficacy and safety profile of amlodipine 5 mg / losartan 50 mg fixed-dose combination and amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in hypertensive patients who respond poorly to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy: an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind phase III noninferiority study [^1135h2YB]. Clinical Therapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The number of hypertensive patients achieving treatment targets is not ideal with therapies that engage a single mechanism of action, and combination therapies using different mechanisms of action can increase drug efficacy in a synergistic way.

Objective

This noninferiority study compared the clinical efficacy and safety profile of fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg and amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy in essential hypertensive patients who respond poorly to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy.

Methods

This was a double-blind, multicenter, randomized trial of hypertensive patients (N = 185) aged ≥ 18 years taking amlodipine 5 mg during the run-in treatment period but failed to achieve sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 90 mm Hg. After randomization into the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group (n = 92) and the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group (n = 93), treatment was maintained without dose escalation for 8 weeks. The noninferiority margin was prespecified as 4 mm Hg after 8 weeks of treatment for the difference of the average change in DBP between treatments. The primary efficacy evaluation of noninferiority was tested using a confidence interval approach with a 97.5% 1-sided lower confidence limit using the average difference in DBP measured at baseline and 8 weeks.

Results

After 8 weeks, the DBP of both groups decreased from baseline by 8.9 (6.1) and 9.4 (7.5) mm Hg, respectively (difference = -0.5 [6.9] mm Hg, 95% CI: -2.5 to 1.5). Secondary end points of reductions in DBP after 4 weeks (-8.1 [6.7] vs -9.9 [7.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.8 mm Hg, 95% CI: -3.9 to 0.2) and sitting systolic blood pressure after 4 (-10.2 [11.8] vs -12.8 [10.2] mm Hg, difference = -2.6 mm Hg, 95% CI: -5.9 to 0.6) and 8 weeks (-12.2 [11.0] vs -13.4 [11.3] mm Hg, difference = -1.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -4.4 to 2.1) were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. There were 38 adverse events in 20 patients (21.7%) in the amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg fixed-dose combination group and 31 in 24 patients (26.1%) in the amlodipine 10 mg monotherapy group; most were mild. There were 7 adverse events in 6 patients (6.5%) related to treatment in the fixed-dose combination group and 13 in 10 patients (10.9%) in the monotherapy group (P = 0.30).

Conclusions

Fixed-dose combination amlodipine/losartan 5/50 mg was not inferior in terms of reductions in DBP after 8 weeks of treatment and had comparable safety profile to amlodipine 10 mg in patients who did not respond to amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00940667.

### Resistant hypertension: diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment a clinical consensus statement from the Thai hypertension society [^114ALCRc]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Pharmacological treatment

Pharmacological therapy of RH is based on the use of ≥ 3 antihypertensive medications. These should include a RAS blocker (an ACEi or an ARB), a long-acting calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic. In patients with CKD, consider transitioning the diuretic to a loop diuretic if the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is < 30–45 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Many antihypertensive agents are now available in various dual or triple-pill combinations, allowing for simplified regimens. However, to ensure that the patients receive the maximally recommended or maximally tolerated doses of all three agents, some single or double components of the three medications must be added. Also, if the prescribed diuretic is a thiazide, it should be replaced by a long-acting thiazide-like diuretic, preferably chlorthalidone or indapamide. All these modifications usually result in the prescription requiring at least two or three pills instead of just a single combination pill.

Pharmacotherapy for hypertension — combination antihypertensive therapy may allow for use of lower doses of individual agents and, therefore, minimize adverse drug effects, but clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether specific combinations and doses are more effective than a maximum-level dose of a single agent for blood pressure control and medication adherence; trials should also focus on comparative effectiveness of equivalent doses of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide and newer antihypertensive agents, such as vasodilatory beta-blockers in essential HTN, and in RHT, future studies with long-term follow-up that would allow evaluation of clinical outcomes are needed to establish optimal fourth-line antihypertensive agents in RHT and whether variations in patient characteristics may necessitate differential approaches to a fourth-line agents for RHT.

### Efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine camsylate / losartan 5 / 100-mg versus losartan / hydrochlorothiazide 100 / 12.5-mg fixed-dose combination in hypertensive patients nonresponsive to losartan 100-mg monotherapy [^111w6Gik]. Clinical Therapeutics (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine whether the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine camsylate/losartan 5/100 mg/d (AML/LOS) are noninferior to those of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide 100/12.5 mg/d (LOS/HCTZ) fixed-dose combination in hypertensive patients unresponsive to losartan 100-mg/d monotherapy.

Methods

Male and female patients aged ≥ 18 years with hypertension despite 4-week, stable treatment with losartan 100-mg/d monotherapy were eligible for inclusion in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive AML/LOS or LOS/HCTZ once daily for 8 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 8 in sitting diastolic blood pressure (ΔsiDBP), and the secondary end points were the changes from baseline to 4 weeks in siDBP and sitting systolic BP (ΔsiSBP) and changes from baseline to 4 and 8 weeks in BP response rate. Tolerability was evaluated by physical examination, including vital sign measurement; laboratory analysis; and ECG.

Findings

Of 275 patients screened at 9 cardiovascular centers, 199 were enrolled (AML/LOS, n = 101; LOS/HCTZ, n = 98), and 183 completed the study. The demographic characteristics were similar between the 2 groups (mean age, 51.56 [9.97] years; men, 70.53%). At 8 weeks, the mean ΔsiDBP values were -11.54 (7.89) and -9.05 (6.57) mm Hg in the AML/LOS and LOS/HCTZ groups, respectively (both, P < 0.0001 vs baseline). The mean difference between the 2 groups was -2.57 mm Hg, a nonsignificant difference, meaning that AML/LOS was noninferior to LOS/HCTZ with regard to the primary end point. At 8 weeks, the mean uric acid level was changed significantly from baseline in the LOS/HCTZ group (+0.41 [0.80] mg/dL; P < 0.0001) but not in the AML/LOS group (-0.12 [0.82] mg/dL), representing a significant intergroup difference (P < 0.0001). Nineteen patients each in the AML/LOS (18.81%) and LOS/HCTZ (20.00%) groups experienced ≥ 1 adverse event, with 4 (3.96%) and 3 (3.16%) patients, respectively, experiencing 1 or more events considered by the investigators to have been treatment related.

Implications

The efficacy and tolerability of AML/LOS 5/100 mg/d was found to have been noninferior to those of LOS/HCTZ 100/12.5 mg/d in these hypertensive patients nonresponsive to losartan 100-mg/d monotherapy.

### Effect of switching from amlodipine to combination therapy with telmisartan and low-dose hydrochlorothiazide [^117KLYtv]. Hypertension Research (2009). Low credibility.

One of the most effective pairs in combination therapy is that of an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and a low-dose thiazide diuretic. Possible candidates for this combination therapy are hypertensive patients with blood pressure (BP) that is not controlled by a calcium channel blocker (CCB). Thus, we characterized the antihypertensive effect of the combination of telmisartan and low-dose hydrochlorothiazide in patients with hypertension that was not controlled by amlodipine, which is the most common CCB. A total of 75 patients with BP levels higher than 140/90 mm Hg, treated with 5 mg per day of amlodipine for at least 3 months, were divided into groups that were switched to treatment with 40–80 mg per day of telmisartan plus 12.5 mg per day of hydrochlorothiazide (TH, n = 37) or that were continuously treated with 5–7.5 mg per day of amlodipine (Am, n = 38). After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean BP level was significantly lower in the TH group than in the Am group (decrease in BP: -9.9 ± 11.4 vs. -3.7 ± 8.9 mm Hg, P < 0.02; normalization rate: 67.6 vs. 30.3%, P < 0.01). Serum uric acid was slightly higher in the TH group, but other laboratory data were not different between groups. Therefore, it is suggested that the combination of a RAS inhibitor and a low-dose thiazide is useful if treatment with a CCB cannot control BP in patients with hypertension.

2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

- Dose once-daily. Titrate up to a maximum dose of 10/320/25 mg (2.1)

- Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used as add-on/switch therapy for patients not adequately controlled on any two of the following antihypertensive classes: calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics (2.2).

- Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be substituted for its individually titrated components (2.3)

2.1 General Considerations

Dose once-daily. The dosage may be increased after 2 weeks of therapy. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after being on the maximal dose of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. The maximum recommended dose of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is 10/320/25 mg.

2.2 Add-on / Switch Therapy

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used for patients not adequately controlled on any 2 of the following antihypertensive classes: calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions to an individual component while on any dual combination of the components of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be switched to amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets containing a lower dose of that component to achieve similar blood pressure reductions.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be substituted for the individually titrated components.

2.4 Use With Other Antihypertensive Drugs

Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

### Comparison of 24-hour ambulatory central blood pressure reduction efficacy between fixed amlodipine or up-titrated hydrochlorothiazide plus losartan: the K-central study [^112eAjNG]. American Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Class effect of antihypertensive drug on central BP

ACEIs, ARBs, and CCBs, which are powerful vasodilators, have been known to improve central aortic pressure. Morgan et al.revealed that, among 4 classes of antihypertensive drugs, the lowest central aortic pressure was achieved with CCBs and diuretics. At present, published data showed that hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy is not inferior to other classes of antihypertensive drugs including CCB monotherapy in improving central BP. Therefore, there is a need to compare combination therapy of CCB and hydrochlorothiazide in reducing central BP in a well-organized study design to eliminate obvious covariant. Several studies about the comparison of drug combination effects on central BP were conducted. Comparison of CCB plus ACEI and thiazide-type diuretics plus BB showed a more favorable effect in the former combination in reducing central BP than the latter combination. In addition, unmatched dose of compared drug led to further mean arterial pressure reduction in CCB plus ARB arm when compared with that in the diuretics plus ARB arm.

Our study was conducted to compare the 24-hour central BP-lowering efficacy of losartan combined with the most frequently prescribed CCB, fixed-dose amlodipine 5 mg, and losartan combined with the most frequently prescribed thiazide-type diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg. To set the office BP at the same level after the 20-week treatment on both arms, we doubled up the dose of both hydrochlorothiazide and losartan after 4 weeks of randomization, whereas losartan was doubled up with fixed-dose amlodipine 5 mg on the opponent arm when subjects had systolic office BP of ≥ 140 mm Hg. As a result, there were no significant differences in office systolic/diastolic BP and mean arterial pressure after the 20-week treatment (Table 3). However, there was a significantly greater reduction in systolic central BP with amlodipine/losartan combination therapy than dose up-titrated hydrochlorothiazide/losartan therapy (Table 3; Figure 2A).

### Effect of single-pill versus free equivalent combinations on persistence and major adverse cardiovascular events in hypertension: a real-world analysis [^111fyoVW]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This first real-world study evaluated the effect of different dose combinations of the same ACEI (ramipril) and a CCB (amlodipine) SPC versus FEC on treatment persistence and MACEs in patients with hypertension over 6 months.

The study showed that the use of an SPC of ramipril and amlodipine (R/A) is associated with better treatment persistence than FEC R/A of the same dose combinations during the entire observational period and that neither age range nor sex influence the beneficial effects of SPC over FEC. The nonpersistence rate was consistently lower with R/A SPC than with FEC during the entire observation period, except with the R/A 5/5 mg dose combination. In the R/A 5/5 mg dose combination, the persistence benefit of SPC was limited to the first 24 months. There might be some explanations for the loss of benefit of the low-dose SPC. First, as a common practice, local cardiologists often initiate treatment with a low dose of ramipril and later adapt the treatment. In this respect, a majority of our patients (N = 63 977) initiated treatment at a low dose (R/A 5/5 mg SPC). While switching the doses in combination therapy, they may first consider increasing the dose of ramipril rather than that of amlodipine to avoid amlodipine-induced oedema. This assumption is supported by the observation that a higher number of patients received R/A 10/5 mg SPC (n = 22 455) and then R/A 5/10 mg SPC (n = 3348). Notably, many patients received R/A 10/10 mg SPC when greater BP reductions were needed. Second, these patients might have had poor BP control leading to changes in therapy. Unfortunately, this hypothesis cannot be confirmed because of the lack of BP data in the searched database. Finally, the lower long-term persistence with the low-dose combination may just be a chance finding, although the study included very large population, and the propensity score based subgroup analysis significantly reduced the difference in the prevalence of the confounders in the majority of the analysed confounders.

### Efficacy and safety of a therapeutic interchange from high-dose calcium channel blockers to a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine / benazepril in patients with moderate-to-severe hypertension [^113YDAmu]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Recent hypertension trials have demonstrated the importance of achieving goal blood pressures to reduce the risk of target organ damage. In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, the use of high-dose monotherapy and/or combinations of drugs are necessary to achieve these goals. Fixed-dose combination products may be useful in these patients by reducing the number of daily doses required to control blood pressure.

Objective

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a therapeutic interchange between high-dose calcium channel blocker therapy and a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/ benazepril (Lotrel; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, USA) in patients with moderate to severe hypertension.

Methods

A total of 75 patients were switched from amlodipine (n = 25), felodipine (n = 25), and nifedipine-GITS (n = 25) to amlodipine/benazepril. Twenty-eight of the 75 patients (37%) were taking either a beta-blocker or a diuretic in addition to the high-dose calcium channel blocker prior to the switch. Blood pressure control, side effects and the cost of the therapeutic interchange were evaluated in the year following the therapeutic interchange.

Results

Sixty-six of the 75 (88%) patients were successfully switched with maintenance of blood pressure control and without the development of new dose-limiting side effects. Reasons for treatment failure after the therapeutic interchange included loss of blood pressure control in five patients and the development of new dose-limiting side effects in four patients. These side effects included cough in three patients and rash in one patient. After accounting for differences in drug acquisition cost and costs related to the switch (clinic and emergency room and laboratory tests), a cost savings of $16030 for all 75 patients was realised in the first year. The per patient-per year cost savings was $214.

Conclusions

Our data indicate that a therapeutic interchange from selected high-dose calcium channel blockers to a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine/ benazepril can be successfully accomplished in the majority of patients.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^111CKQAs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations:

Majority of effect attained within 2 weeks (2.1)
May be administered with other antihypertensive agents (2.1)

Hypertension:

May be used as add-on therapy for patients not controlled on monotherapy (2.2)
Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on monotherapy may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan containing a lower dose of that component (2.2)
May be substituted for titrated components (2.3)
When used as initial therapy: Initiate with 5/160 mg, then titrate upwards as necessary to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily (2.4)

2.1 General Considerations

Dose once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose.

Amlodipine and valsartan may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Add-on Therapy

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone or with valsartan (or another ARB) alone may be switched to combination therapy with amlodipine and valsartan.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to amlodipine and valsartan should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 10/320 mg.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

For convenience, patients receiving amlodipine and valsartan from separate tablets may instead wish to receive tablets of amlodipine and valsartan containing the same component doses.

2.4 Initial Therapy

A patient may be initiated on amlodipine and valsartan if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is amlodipine and valsartan 5/160 mg once daily in patients who are not volume-depleted.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^1137caAg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Eligible participants were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 between monotherapy and combination therapy, but in practice, randomization was 1:1:2 to treatment with 50 mg losartan, or 12.5 mg HCTZ, as first monotherapy, versus 50 mg losartan plus 12.5 mg HCTZ combination therapy. In the monotherapy arms, there was forced dose‐doubling after 4 weeks of treatment, then participants crossed over at 8 weeks to the alternative drug at the lower dose, which was again force‐titrated to twice the dose after a further 4 weeks. In the combination arm, the successive dose permutations at every 4 weeks after initial assignment were losartan/HCTZ 50/25, 100/12.5, and 100/25 mg. After 16 weeks (start of phase 2), all participants received the combination of losartan 100 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg. At week 24, all participants were force‐titrated to losartan 100 mg plus HCTZ 25 mg. At week 32 (start of phase 3), amlodipine was added if systolic BP was > 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP was > 90 mm Hg. There were 2 subsequent opportunities for addition or titration of amlodipine, to 10 mg, with doxazosin 4 to 8 mg as a permitted alternative or addition, as required. The study ended at 52 weeks.

Losartan and HCTZ tablets were reencapsulated in identical gelatin capsules backfilled with microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate, which was also used for the matching placebo capsules. All patients received 2 capsules throughout phase 1, in double‐dummy fashion, to maintain masking in the combination and monotherapy groups. Emergency code breaks via the central Interactive Voice Response System were available if deemed absolutely necessary. In phases 2 and 3, losartan and HCTZ were provided in a single tablet, the identity of which was known to investigators and patients; however, masking of the initial assignment was maintained until database lock.

Adherence to study medication was assessed by return tablet count.

Home BP was measured using the Microlife WatchBP Home monitor on the last 4 days before each clinic visit. This was used instead of ambulatory BP monitoring to improve patient acceptability and to minimize dropouts.

Adding or switching cholesterol-lowering agents to fenofibrate is conditionally recommended against for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Switching, stopping, or adding a medication should only be considered when the potential SU concentration/gout benefits exceed the potential risks or harms of the medication change. Recognizing that there are few practical alternatives to low-dose aspirin, the Voting Panel specifically recommended against its cessation as a means of SU reduction when a patient is taking it for an appropriate indication.

Methods

Setting

The British Hypertension Society Research Network of academic investigators recruited participants from both primary and secondary care.

Study Design

Patients who were aged 18 to 79 years with a diagnosis of essential hypertension, who had systolic BP > 150 mm Hg or diastolic BP > 95 mm Hg, and who were either never treated or who had received 1 drug class in the previous year were eligible for inclusion in PATHWAY‐1. This was a parallel‐group, randomized, double‐blind, phase 4 trial conducted in 11 secondary and 2 primary care centers in the United Kingdom. A full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Table S1.

Participants were enrolled between February 2010 to November 2013; the study ended (last patient completed the study) in December 2014. The study design and rationale have been published. 13 A study schematic is shown in Figure 1 (a more detailed diagram is shown in Figure S1).

Figure 1
Schematic of the study showing drug administration in each of the 3 phases. HCTZ indicates hydrochlorothiazide; HSBP, home systolic blood pressure.

After a 4‐week, single‐blind, placebo run‐in during which any previous antihypertensive monotherapy was withdrawn, there were 3 sequential phases of active treatment during which investigators and participants were blinded to the initial random assignment. In the first phase, weeks 0–16, half of the participants started monotherapy with either losartan or HCTZ (hydrochlorothiazide), and half started a combination of losartan plus HCTZ. In the second phase (weeks 16–32), all participants received the same combination of losartan plus HCTZ. In the third phase, patients received additional open‐label medication with amlodipine and/or doxazosin, dependent on whether their BP was controlled and whether they tolerated the amlodipine. The primary end points were measured at the end of the second phase; the third phase allowed extended assessment of the sustained effect of the difference in randomly assigned drugs in the first phase without withholding clinically desirable treatment escalation.

### Introducing the importance and difficulties of a three-step approach to improve nonadherence to antihypertensive drugs: a case series [^115yd6os]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient A

This patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of hypertension for which she had been on treatment in a tertiary hospital for the last 8 years. At the time of inclusion, she was on drug treatment with nifedipine retard 30 mg once daily, spironolactone 12.5 mg once daily, bisoprolol 10 mg once daily and amlodipine 10 mg, valsartan 320 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in a combination tablet once daily. Blood pressure remained uncontrolled despite adding drugs and increasing dosages over the years.

At the first study visit, daytime blood pressure was 155/108 mmHg and DBS measurements revealed the absence of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide (Table 1). During the feedback session, the patient revealed that she did not take the combination tablet every day because of vertigo problems after intake. She had experienced these problems from treatment initiation but was apprehensive to share these side-effects with her treating physician. In this case, the side-effects were identified as barrier for not taking the medication (Fig. 1).

TABLE 1
Outcome of drug levels measured by means of a dried blood spot sampling method combined with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify nonadherence to antihypertensive drugs

After being made aware of this barrier, the physician switched valsartan to losartan and stopped amlodipine. This resulted in a daytime blood pressure of 141/100 mmHg at 3 months follow-up with adherence for all the medications. After this visit, the dose of nifedipine was increased to 60 mg once daily. At 6 months follow-up, daytime blood pressure improved further to 134/91 mmHg and DBS results showed that she was still adherent to the antihypertensive drug therapy and did not experience side-effects.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations:

Majority of effect attained within 2 weeks (2.1)
May be administered with other antihypertensive agents (2.1)

Hypertension:

May be used as add-on therapy for patients not controlled on monotherapy (2.2)
Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on monotherapy may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing a lower dose of that component (2.2)
May be substituted for titrated components (2.3)
When used as initial therapy: Initiate with 5/160 mg, then titrate upwards as necessary to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily (2.4)

2.1 General Considerations

Dose once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with or without food.

Amlodipine and valsartan tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Add-on Therapy

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone or with valsartan (or another angiotensin II receptor blocker) alone may be switched to combination therapy with amlodipine and valsartan tablets.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to amlodipine and valsartan tablets should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 10/320 mg.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

For convenience, patients receiving amlodipine and valsartan from separate tablets may instead wish to receive amlodipine and valsartan tablets containing the same component doses.

2.4 Initial Therapy

A patient may be initiated on amlodipine and valsartan tablets if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is amlodipine and valsartan tablets 5/160 mg once daily in patients who are not volume-depleted.

### Prior medications and the cardiovascular benefits from combination angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition plus calcium channel blockade among high-risk hypertensive patients [^111mr2UG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

As with most contemporary trials, 1 most patients (97.1%) entering into the ACCOMPLISH trial had already been receiving antihypertensive therapy. 6 Hence, the main conclusion of the study can most accurately be stated as follows: switching treated hypertensive individuals to initial combination therapy composed of benazepril+amlodipine rather than benazepril+hydrochlorothiazide is more effective for preventing cardiovascular events. Because of this high rate of background therapies, it is important to evaluate if the characteristics of the prior regimens had a modifying effect on study outcomes. For example, some medication(s) may have differed in reducing baseline cardiovascular risk (eg, superior 24‐hour BP control and fewer adverse metabolic actions) and could have, thereby, plausibly affected the capacity for the ensuing randomized treatments to differentially provide cardiovascular protection. The principal aim of this post hoc observational analysis was to determine if combination therapy using benazepril+amlodipine conveys a significant risk reduction on the primary composite end point in a subgroup of patients who had already been taking a drug regimen similar to either of the treatment limbs allocated in the trial ("primary subgroup"): renin‐angiotensin system (RAS) blockade plus either a thiazide‐type diuretic or any calcium channel blocker (CCB) alone or as part of their antihypertensive regimen. This is a clinically relevant question because both combination therapy regimens remain recommended approaches by guidelines 2, 3 and are considered rational pharmacological strategies 4 commonly used in present‐day practice. In secondary analyses, we explored if prior use of other antihypertensive regimens, background lipid‐lowering therapy, or previous BP control status may have modified the benefits derived from allocation to benazepril+amlodipine.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dose once-daily. Titrate up to a maximum dose of 10/320/25 mg. (2.1)
Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide may be used as add-on/switch therapy for patients not adequately controlled on any two of the following antihypertensive classes: calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics. (2.2)
Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide may be substituted for its individually titrated components. (2.3)

2.1 General Considerations

Dose once-daily. The dosage may be increased after 2 weeks of therapy. The full blood pressure lowering effect was achieved 2 weeks after being on the maximal dose of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide. The maximum recommended dose of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide is 10/320/25 mg.

2.2 Add-on/Switch Therapy

Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide may be used for patients not adequately controlled on any 2 of the following antihypertensive classes: calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and diuretics.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions to an individual component while on any dual combination of the components of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide may be switched to amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide containing a lower dose of that component to achieve similar blood pressure reductions.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide may be substituted for the individually titrated components.

2.4 Use With Other Antihypertensive Drugs

Amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

### Comparison of 24-hour ambulatory central blood pressure reduction efficacy between fixed amlodipine or up-titrated hydrochlorothiazide plus losartan: the K-central study [^1127Kvcd]. American Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

OBJECTIVE

The main objective of this study was to evaluate non-inferiority of office mean systolic blood pressure (BP) reduction efficacy and superiority of 24-hour ambulatory central BP reduction efficacy between losartan combined with fixed dose amlodipine (L/A group) and dose up-titrated hydrochlorothiazide (L/H group) according to office BP.

METHODS

We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind multicenter trial in 231 patients with hypertensive (mean age = 59.2 ± 12.2 years). Patients received losartan 50 mg monotherapy for 4 weeks, followed by additional use of amlodipine 5 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg for 20 weeks after randomization. The patients who did not achieve the BP goal after 4 weeks' randomization received an increased dose of 100 mg/5 mg for the L/A group and 100 mg/25 mg for L/H group, respectively. The 24-hour ambulatory central BP was measured at baseline and after 20 weeks' treatment.

RESULTS

Office mean systolic BP reduction of L/A group was not inferior to L/H group after 4 weeks' treatment (–17.6 ± 13.3 vs. –14.4 ± 12.6 mm Hg, P = 0.0863) and was not significantly different after 20 weeks' treatment. (–15.7 ± 14.0 vs. –14.7 ± 15.1 mm Hg, P = 0.6130) The 24-hour ambulatory central systolic BP was significantly more reduced in the L/A group compared with that in the L/H group after 20 weeks' treatment (–9.37 ± 10.67 vs. –6.28 ± 10.50 mm Hg, P = 0.0407). The 24-hour ambulatory central systolic BP at the completion of the study and its reduction magnitude were independently associated with reductions in aortic pulse wave velocity, pulse pressure, and wave reflection magnitude.

CONCLUSION

Office systolic BP reduction with L/A was not inferior to L/H after 4 week's treatment. The combination of losartan and amlodipine was more favorable in 24-hour ambulatory central hemodynamics beyond BP-lowering efficacy than the combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide, regardless of office BP.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General Considerations:

Majority of effect attained within 2 weeks (2.1)
May be administered with other antihypertensive agents (2.1)

Hypertension:

May be used as add-on therapy for patients not controlled on monotherapy (2.2)
Patients who experience dose-limiting adverse reactions on monotherapy may be switched to Exforge containing a lower dose of that component (2.2)
May be substituted for titrated components (2.3)
When used as initial therapy: Initiate with 5/160 mg, then titrate upwards as necessary to a maximum of 10/320 mg once daily (2.4)

2.1 General Considerations

Dose once daily. The dosage can be increased after 1 to 2 weeks of therapy to a maximum of one 10/320 mg tablet once daily as needed to control blood pressure. The majority of the antihypertensive effect is attained within 2 weeks after initiation of therapy or a change in dose.

Exforge may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

2.2 Add-on Therapy

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with amlodipine (or another dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker) alone or with valsartan (or another ARB) alone may be switched to combination therapy with Exforge.

A patient who experiences dose-limiting adverse reactions on either component alone may be switched to Exforge containing a lower dose of that component in combination with the other to achieve similar blood pressure reductions. The clinical response to Exforge should be subsequently evaluated and if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after 3 to 4 weeks of therapy, the dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 10/320 mg.

2.3 Replacement Therapy

For convenience, patients receiving amlodipine and valsartan from separate tablets may instead wish to receive tablets of Exforge containing the same component doses.

2.4 Initial Therapy

A patient may be initiated on Exforge if it is unlikely that control of blood pressure would be achieved with a single agent. The usual starting dose is Exforge 5/160 mg once daily in patients who are not volume-depleted.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics and laboratory data

A total of 368 patients with hypertension were screened. Among these patients, 231 were randomized to the study, except for 100 patients who failed to attain an office systolic BP of ≥ 140 mm Hg after 4 weeks of losartan monotherapy, 28 patients who withdrew their consent and 9 patients who failed to enrollment because of the protocol violation, pregnancy, and take medication that prohibited. After randomization, 44 patients were excluded because the number of measurements from the 24-hour Mobile-O-Graph examinations was not adequate for the analysis. Finally, 187 patients who completed the 24-hour Mobile-O-Graph examination were analyzed for per-protocol set.

The mean age of participants was 59.2 ± 12.2 years, and a total of 132 (70.6%) male patients were included (Table 1). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics, classes of previous antihypertensive medications, and current medical history with laboratory data except the uric acid level of participants. On the study completion, serum uric acid level was equalized between 2 groups, and serum fasting glucose (P = 0.0321) and HbA1 C (P = 0.0071) levels were lower in the losartan/amlodipine group compared with those in the losartan/hydrochlorothiazide group. The patients with up-titrated dose and the patients for whom the existing combination dosage was maintained were compared with respect to their number, BP, and other characteristics. The findings have been presented in Supplementary Tables 1–4. Supplementary Table 5 shows the office BP data of these unregistered patients whose systolic BP decreased to < 140 mm Hg after losartan monotherapy.

METHODS

Study design and subjects

This is a multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled, randomized trial with 2 treatment arms comparing the efficacy on 24-hour central BP reduction. From August 2014 to May 2016, patients with hypertension were recruited from 18 university hospitals in 8 cities via outpatient departments. Both hypertension-naïve patients and known patients with hypertension were recruited. Losartan 50 mg monotherapy was performed in the 4-week run-in period to wash out the effects of previous antihypertensive drugs. After 4 weeks of run-in period, the subjects whose systolic BP was ≥ 140 mm Hg were enrolled in the study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were described in our publication on the study design previously. Men and women from ages 19 to 80 years, with history of hypertension or those newly diagnosed with a systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg, are to be included in the study. The exclusion criteria are (i) mean sitting diastolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg or mean sitting systolic BP ≥ 180 mm Hg at screening or randomization; (ii) variability of ≥ 20 mm Hg in systolic BP or ≥ 10 mm Hg in diastolic BP between 3 measurements, or differences of ≥ 20/10 mm Hg in left-to-right brachial values of systolic BP or diastolic BP; (iii) secondary hypertension; (iv) malignant hypertension; (v) allergies or contraindications to ARB, CCB, or sulfonamides; (vi) uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (HbA1c ≥ 10%); (vii) history of New York Heart Association class III–IV heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, or aortic stenosis requiring treatment within 6 months; (viii) cerebral vascular disease within 6 months; (ix) serious liver or renal dysfunction; (x) symptomatic hyperuricemia or gout; (xi) galactose or lactose intolerance; (xii) patients with diabetes or moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction on drugs containing aliskiren; (xiii) pregnancy or the possibility of pregnancy, or breast feeding; (xiv) unable to withhold current medication; (xv) prescription of other study drugs within 4 weeks; and (xvi) abnormal laboratory results (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase > 3 upper limit of normal, Cr > 2.0 mg/dL, K + < 3.5 or > 5.5 mEq/L, Na + < 125 mEq/L, Protein > 2+ on dipstick, or protein/creatinine > 1,000 mg/g on spot urine).

### Effect of hydrochlorothiazide in addition to telmisartan / amlodipine combination for treating hypertensive patients uncontrolled with telmisartan / amlodipine: a randomized, double-blind study [^114YrzXV]. Hypertension Research (2017). Low credibility.

A similarly designed study of a combination of losartan 50 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and amlodipine 5 mg compared with coadministration of losartan 50 mg plus amlodipine 5 mg in Japanese patients with essential hypertension did not demonstrate a significant difference in DBP reduction with hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg at week 8 (additional effect of −1.1 mm Hg; 95% CI: −2.7 to 0.6; P = 0.205). However, there was a significant additional effect of hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg on SBP reduction at week 8 (−3.2 mm Hg; −5.7 to −0.8; P = 0.011). The difference between the results of the losartan study and ours is possibly because of the profile of ARBs, that is, usual dosage range, terminal half-life and volume of distribution. The high-dose ARB with a large volume of distribution is suitable to completely inhibit the renin–angiotensin system activated by CCBs and diuretics. Among ARBs, telmisartan is a long-acting antihypertensive drug that may provide sustained reductions in blood pressure throughout a 24-h dosing period.

The results of this study should be considered in light of its limitations. The main limitation of this study was that the mean age of the patients was 54.7 years and only 14.6% of patients were ⩾65 years old. Therefore, the efficacy and safety profiles of T80/A5/H12.5 in older patients could not be determined. The study was also only conducted in institutions within Japan, and hence the results are not generalizable to populations of other ethnicities. Another limitation was the short duration of the study, as 8 weeks may not have been sufficient to observe the full benefit provided by the combination therapy, or the benefits may have been reduced over a longer period. Finally, we did not include patients with severe impaired kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL min −1 1.73 m −2) who may also require combination therapies to manage hypertension.

Materials and methods

Study design

This was a 44-week OLE of an 8-week multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, factorial design study (Figure 1). The study was conducted in accordance with the institutional review board regulations, the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent at screening. All medications were provided to patients free of charge. The results of the 8-week double-blind study, including study population, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study design, efficacy variables, safety variables and statistical analyses, have been published elsewhere. Briefly, for entry into the 8-week double-blind study, patients had a mean SeDBP of 95 to 120 mm Hg, and a difference of ≤ 10 mm Hg between the visit before randomization and the randomization visit. This report deals with the portion of the study designed to emulate clinical practice by titrating patients to JNC 7 treatment guideline goals while assessing long-term efficacy and safety.

After completion of the 8-week double-blind portion of the study, all patients who enrolled into the OLE were switched to the combination of AML 5 mg+OM 40 mg per day. Patients whose BP was not adequately controlled (defined as BP < 140/90 or < 130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes) after 2 weeks were titrated to AML 10 mg+OM 40 mg. Subsequent titrations for inadequate BP control included the addition of HCTZ 12.5 mg and then 25 mg per day. Subjects with adequately controlled BP were maintained at the titrated drug doses. Patients were instructed and reinforced to take their medication at the same time each day, preferably in the morning, though treatment accountability was not assessed at each visit during the OLE of the study. Patients who developed hypotension and/or displayed drug intolerance could be back-titrated at the investigator's discretion.

Standardization across investigator sites was maintained through establishment of a detailed clinical protocol, and procedures at all sites were reinforced by routine protocol monitoring by Medpace Inc. (Cincinnati, OH, USA).

These likelihoods rise to 79% for systolic and 55% for diastolic with telmisartan and amlodipine tablets. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2. 1 General Considerations Telmisartan is an effective treatment of hypertension in once daily doses of 20 to 80 mg. while amlodipine is effective in doses of 2. 5 to 10 mg. Dosage must be individualized and may be increased after at least 2 weeks.

Most of the antihypertensive effect is apparent within 2 weeks and maximal reduction is generally attained after 4 weeks. The maximum recommended dose of telmisartan and amlodipine.
2. 2 Replacement Therapy Patients receiving amlodipine and telmisartan from separate tablets may instead receive telmisartan and amlodipine tablets containing the same component doses once daily. When substituting for individual components, increase the dose of telmisartan and amlodipine tablets if blood pressure control has not been satisfactory. angiotensin receptor blocker) alone. Patients treated with 10 mg amlodipine who experience any dose-limiting adverse reactions such as edema, may be switched to telmisartan and amlodipine 40/5 mg tablets once daily, reducing the dose of amlodipine without reducing the overall expected. impairment have decreased clearance of amlodipine, start amlodipine or add amlodipine at 2. 5 mg in patients with hepatic impairment.

### Effects of up-titration of candesartan versus candesartan plus amlodipine on kidney function in type 2 diabetic patients with albuminuria [^113UyuXp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that up-titrating the dose of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is superior to combined treatment with an ARB and a calcium channel blocker for the same degree of blood pressure (BP) reduction, with respect to urinary albumin excretion in diabetic patients treated with a standard dose of the ARB. Hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and albuminuria (≥ 30mgg(-1) creatinine) were enroled in the study, and were either started on or switched to candesartan (8mg per day) monotherapy. After a 12-week run-in period, baseline evaluations were performed and patients with BP ≥ 130/80mmHg were randomly assigned to receive either candesartan (12mg per day) or candesartan (8mg per day) plus amlodipine (2.5mg per day) for a further 12 weeks. The primary end-point was a reduction in urinary albumin levels. Although there was no significant difference in the BP reduction between the two groups, the reduction in urinary albumin was greater in the up-titrated than the combination therapy group (-40 ± 14% vs -9 ± 38%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Thus, up-titration of candesartan more effectively reduces urinary albumin excretion than combined candesartan plus amlodipine in hypertensive patients with diabetes for the same degree of BP reduction.

### Amlodipine in hypertension: a first-line agent with efficacy for improving blood pressure and patient outcomes [^111EGhCS]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

A Japanese study, although small, investigated the effect of losartan and amlodipine on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in patients with mild-to-moderate HTN. LV diastolic dysfunction has a direct correlation with LV hypertrophy (LVH) and myocardial fibrosis. Previous trials have established the beneficial role of ACEIs on cardiac remodelling but other studies with ARBs versus amlodipine showed a greater benefit in the CCB class. Thus, the effect of losartan and amlodipine on LV diastolic function and atherosclerosis in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate HTN (J-ELAN) trial was undertaken to compare the effects of an ARB (losartan) versus a CCB (amlodipine) on LV diastolic dysfunction. J-ELAN enrolled 57 patients with LVH and mild-to-moderate HTN and randomised them to either losartan or amlodipine. The doses of these drugs were uptitrated over an 18-month period and then other anti-HTN agents were added, to achieve goal BP control, except those agents that affect LVH such as ACEIs, ARBs, other CCBs or BBs. Both groups showed similar reduction in BP but the losartan group had a greater effect on carotid intimal–medial thickness. In addition, there was no significant difference in terms of LV mass in the two groups. These findings suggest that amlodipine is non-inferior to ARBs with respect to its effects on LV remodelling.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^111N7KCo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines for hypertension vary in their preference for initial combination therapy or initial monotherapy, stratified by patient profile; therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of these approaches.

Methods and Results

We performed a 1‐year, double‐blind, randomized controlled trial in 605 untreated patients aged 18 to 79 years with systolic blood pressure ≥ 150 mm Hg or diastolic ≥ 95 mm Hg. In phase 1 (weeks 0–16), patients were randomly assigned to initial monotherapy (losartan 50–100 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg crossing over at 8 weeks), or initial combination (losartan 50–100 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5–25 mg). In phase 2 (weeks 17–32), all patients received losartan 100 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 to 25 mg. In phase 3 (weeks 33–52), amlodipine with or without doxazosin could be added to achieve target. Hierarchical primary outcomes were the difference from baseline in home systolic, averaged over phases 1 and 2 and, if significant, at 32 weeks. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, and difference in home systolic BP responses between tertiles of plasma renin. Home systolic BP after initial monotherapy fell 4.9 mm Hg (range: 3.7–6.0 mm Hg) less over 32 weeks (P < 0.001) than after initial combination but caught up at 32 weeks (difference 1.2 mm Hg [range: −0.4 to 2.8 mm Hg], P = 0.13). In phase 1, home systolic BP response to each monotherapy differed substantially between renin tertiles, whereas response to combination therapy was uniform and at least 5 mm Hg more than to monotherapy. There were no differences in withdrawals due to adverse events.

Conclusions

Initial combination therapy can be recommended for patients with BP > 150/95 mm Hg.

### First-line diuretics versus other classes of antihypertensive drugs for hypertension [^114VRfqY]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Different first-line drug classes for patients with hypertension are often assumed to have similar effectiveness with respect to reducing mortality and morbidity outcomes, and lowering blood pressure. First-line low-dose thiazide diuretics have been previously shown to have the best mortality and morbidity evidence when compared with placebo or no treatment. Head-to-head comparisons of thiazides with other blood pressure-lowering drug classes would demonstrate whether there are important differences.

Objectives

To compare the effects of first-line diuretic drugs with other individual first-line classes of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity, and withdrawals due to adverse effects in patients with hypertension. Secondary objectives included assessments of the need for added drugs, drug switching, and blood pressure-lowering.

Search Methods

Cochrane Hypertension's Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registers to March 2021. We also checked references and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. A top-up search of the Specialized Register was carried out in June 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomized active comparator trials of at least one year's duration were included. Trials had a clearly defined intervention arm of a first-line diuretic (thiazide, thiazide-like, or loop diuretic) compared to another first-line drug class: beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, alpha adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, direct renin inhibitors, or other antihypertensive drug classes. Studies had to include clearly defined mortality and morbidity outcomes (serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, stroke, coronary heart disease (CHD), congestive heart failure, and withdrawals due to adverse effects).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

We included 20 trials with 26 comparator arms randomizing over 90,000 participants. The findings are relevant to first-line use of drug classes in older male and female hypertensive patients (aged 50 to 75) with multiple co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes. First-line thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics were compared with beta-blockers (six trials), calcium channel blockers (eight trials), ACE inhibitors (five trials), and alpha-adrenergic blockers (three trials); other comparators included angiotensin II receptor blockers, aliskiren (a direct renin inhibitor), and clonidine (a centrally acting drug). Only three studies reported data for total serious adverse events: two studies compared diuretics with calcium channel blockers and one with a direct renin inhibitor. Compared to first-line beta-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.10; 5 trials, 18,241 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (5.4% versus 4.8%; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.00; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.6%, moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.09; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), CHD (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.07; 4 trials, 18,135 participants; low-certainty), or heart failure (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.19; 1 trial, 6569 participants; low-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (10.1% versus 7.9%; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.85; 5 trials, 18,501 participants; ARR 2.2%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line calcium channel blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.08; 7 trials, 35,417 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in serious adverse events (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.24; 2 trials, 7204 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (14.3% versus 13.3%; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.18; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty) or CHD (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (4.4% versus 3.2%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.82; 6 trials, 35,217 participants; ARR 1.2%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (7.6% versus 6.2%; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.88; 7 trials, 33,908 participants; ARR 1.4%; low-certainty). Compared to first-line ACE inhibitors, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.07; 3 trials, 30,961 participants; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.02; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce stroke slightly (4.7% versus 4.1%; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; ARR 0.6%; moderate-certainty), probably result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.12; 3 trials, 30,900 participants; moderate-certainty) or heart failure (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; 2 trials, 30,392 participants; moderate-certainty), and probably reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (3.9% versus 2.9%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84; 3 trials, 25,254 participants; ARR 1.0%; moderate-certainty). Compared to first-line alpha-blockers, first-line thiazides probably result in little to no difference in total mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; moderate-certainty), probably reduce total cardiovascular events (12.1% versus 9.0%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.80; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 3.1%; moderate-certainty) and stroke (2.7% versus 2.3%; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.01; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; ARR 0.4%; moderate-certainty), may result in little to no difference in CHD (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.11; 2 trials, 24,396 participants; low-certainty), probably reduce heart failure (5.4% versus 2.8%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.58; 1 trial, 24,316 participants; ARR 2.6%; moderate-certainty), and may reduce withdrawals due to adverse effects (1.3% versus 0.9%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.89; 3 trials, 24,772 participants; ARR 0.4%; low-certainty). For the other drug classes, data were insufficient. No antihypertensive drug class demonstrated any clinically important advantages over first-line thiazides.

Authors' Conclusions

When used as first-line agents for the treatment of hypertension, thiazides and thiazide-like drugs likely do not change total mortality and likely decrease some morbidity outcomes such as cardiovascular events and withdrawals due to adverse effects, when compared to beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors, and alpha-blockers.

### Comparison of fixed-dose combinations of amlodipine / losartan potassium / chlorthalidone and amlodipine / losartan potassium in patients with stage 2 hypertension inadequately controlled with amlodipine / losartan potassium: a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III study [^115BQuCE]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose combinations of amlodipine/losartan potassium/chlorthalidone (A/L/C) and A/L in Korean patients with stage 2 hypertension inadequately controlled by A/L.

Methods

This study was an 8-week, randomized double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical trial. Three hundred forty volunteer patients with stage 2 hypertension were randomized to receive A/L/C or A/L. The primary end point was a change in sitting systolic blood pressure (SitSBP) after 8 weeks of treatment. As secondary end points, the change in SitSBP after 2 weeks of treatment and the change in sitting diastolic blood pressure (SitDBP) were compared between treatment groups. All patients were assessed for adverse events, clinical laboratory data, and vital signs.

Findings

Of 330 patients from 33 medical centers, 328 patients who had available efficacy data were analyzed. After 8 weeks of double-blind treatment, the mean (SD) changes in SitSBP at 8 weeks were -16.4 (0.9) mm Hg and -6.9 (1.0) mm Hg in the A/L/C and A/L groups, respectively. A/L/C had a statistically superior blood pressure-lowering effect compared with that of A/L (mean [SD] difference, 9.5 [1.3] mm Hg; P < 0.001). The mean (SD) change in SitDBP at 8 weeks was significantly greater with A/L/C (-8.0 [0.6] mm Hg) than with A/L (-3.6 [0.6] mm Hg) (P < .001). In terms of the mean (SD) change in SitDBP at 2 weeks compared with baseline, A/L/C (-5.9 [0.5] mm Hg) was statistically different from A/L (-2.9 [0.5] mm Hg) (P < .001). Mean (SD) SitSBP change from baseline to week 2 was -13.2 (0.9) and -5.5 (0.9) in the A/L/C and A/L groups, respectively, with a statistically significant blood pressure-lowering effect (P < 0.001). The number of participants who achieved target blood pressure at week 8 was significantly higher in the A/L/C group (93 patients [55.7%]) than in the A/L group (48 [29.8%]) (P < 0.001). Adverse drug reactions were observed in 23 patients (7.0%), and the incidence of dizziness was significantly higher in the A/L/C group than in the A/L group (4.8% vs 0.6%, P = 0.037) There were no serious adverse events associated with the study drugs.

Implications

The results of this study suggest that A/L/C had a significantly increased blood pressure-lowering efficacy compared with that of A/L and had a good safety profile. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02916602.

### Β blockers switched to first-line therapy in hypertension [^111NxFsg]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

In their recent guidelines, the European Society of Hypertension upgraded β blockers, putting them on equal footing with thiazide diuretics, renin-angiotensin system blockers (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers), and calcium channel blockers. The reason offered for upgrading β blockers was the observation that they are often used for many other clinical conditions commonly encountered with hypertension. This upgrade would allow for the treatment of two conditions with a single drug (a so-called twofer). In most current national and international hypertension guidelines, β blockers are only considered to be an alternative when there are specific indications. Compared with the other first-line antihypertensive drug classes, β blockers are significantly less effective in preventing stroke and cardiovascular mortality. To relegate β blockers to an inferiority status as previous guidelines have done was based on the evidence in aggregate, and still stands. No new evidence supports the switch of β blockers back to first-line therapy. We are concerned that this move might lead to widespread harm because of inferior stroke protection.

### Combination therapy in hypertension: an update [^1144XjLc]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Combination ARB with CCB

The rationale for combination therapy with agents that block the RAAS and a CCB or diuretic is well founded. However, the use of ARBs and CCBs has independent benefits beyond BP lowering, on morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension and comorbid conditions. In the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint Reduction in Hypertension (LIFE) study, a losartan-based (ARB) regimen significantly reduced the relative risk of cardiovascular-related morbidity and death in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy by 13% (P = 0.02). The reduction came, however, mostly as a result of a 25% reduction in the relative risk of stroke (P = 0.001), compared with atenolol-based therapy, yet the between-group difference in SBP was only 1 mm Hg. Moreover telmisartan has a different pharmacokinetic profile compared to other ARBs, and there are few studies examining telmisartan/CCB combinations in hypertensive patients.

In Fogari et al. study, 40 mg of telmisartan and 2.5 mg of amlodipine combination was used. After 4 weeks patients whose BP was not controlled (BP > 130/80 mm Hg) were randomized to two-dose titration regimens, one based on increasing doses of telmisartan (up to 160 mg daily) and fixed 2.5-mg dose of amlodipine, the other based on increasing doses of amlodipine (up to 10 mg daily) and fixed 40-mg dose of telmisartan. It was found that at comparable levels of BP reduction, urinary albumin excretion rate decreased more in subjects treated with escalating doses of telmisartan. Overall, among the different combinations of telmisartan and amlodipine, it is clear that telmisartan 80 mg plus amlodipine 10 mg is the most effective combination and the telmisartan and amlodipine combinations offer a very effective and tolerable option particularly in susceptible patients that require combination therapy.

Methods

The overall design and methods of the ACCOMPLISH trial have been previously described. 6 The institutional review boards or ethics committees of each participating site approved the protocol, as described in the primary article. 6 The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the procedure. In brief, the ACCOMPLISH trial was an international (5 countries), multicenter (n = 548), double‐blind, randomized, clinical outcome trial of 11 056 patients with hypertension at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The primary outcome was time to first composite event (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for angina, resuscitation after sudden cardiac death, and coronary revascularization) compared between treatment limbs (benazepril+amlodipine versus benazepril+hydrochlorothiazide). In this post hoc observational analysis, we aimed to evaluate the effect of prior medication regimens on the primary study outcome. Before undertaking the analyses, we a priori defined the primary subgroup as patients previously taking a regimen similar to either randomized treatment subsequently allocated in the trial. This included individuals taking an RAS blocker (any angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEI] or angiotensin receptor blocker) plus either a thiazide‐like diuretic or CCB. The 2 antihypertensive medications could be taken alone (ie, no additional BP medications) or as part of a larger regimen (≥ 3 drugs in total), including any supplementary BP‐lowering medications (eg, β or α blockers). We began the series of analyses with and highlighted the presentation of our findings in this primary subgroup because we believed the results from these patients would yield the overall most clinically relevant information. These findings specifically inform healthcare providers the sum benefits together of maintaining an RAS blocker/CCB regimen if already taking it and switching to this regimen among patients taking an RAS blocker/diuretic regimen. Subsequent analyses further evaluated the individual benefits in each of these subgroups alone, along with several other groups with a viable sample size.

### ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers differentially alter the response to angiotensin II treatment in vasodilatory shock [^116nXNFm]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Exploratory analyses of ARB dose

To explore whether the association of ARB exposure with attenuated response to angiotensin-II was a dose-dependent or mechanistic phenomenon, we assessed the effect of ARB dose on key outcomes. These results are summarized in Fig. 4 D. Among placebo patients ARB dose was not associated with MAP at hr 1 but among angiotensin-treated patients, each log-mg increase in losartan equivalents was associated with a 1.2 mmHg [95% CI − 2.4–0.1] (p interaction = 0.0717) decrease in MAP (Additional file 1: Table-s14). Increasing losartan equivalent dose was similarly associated with higher NED and study drug dose among angiotensin-treated patients (Fig. 4 B, C, (Additional file 1: Table-S15/S16). Higher ARB dose attenuated the decrease in renin at hr 3 associated with angiotensin-treatment (difference-in-difference: 1.4 log(pg/mL)-per-log(mg) [0.02–0.26]; p interaction = 0.0248) (Fig. 4 D) (Additional file 1: Table-S17); i.e. renin decreased less in response to angiotensin-II therapy with increasing dose of ARB exposure.

### Combination therapy is superior to sequential monotherapy for the initial treatment of hypertension: a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^112h5r8W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

A strength of the PATHWAY studies is the use of home BP monitoring as the primary outcome measure. Measured over a number of days and averaged, this value is a better prognostic marker of cardiovascular disease than clinic pressure and avoids misclassification due to the "white coat effect" seen with clinic measures. 33 Although some guidelines now recommend 24 ambulatory blood pressure measurements for initial diagnosis, this is not a practical alternative to HBPM for routine monitoring of treatment, and within a trial environment, the use of serial ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for primary outcome measurements can compromise power by increasing dropout rates. In addition to use of HBPM, we conducted a substudy assessing LV mass. Consistent with the large reductions in BP over phases 1 and 2 in the combination therapy group and over phase 2 in the monotherapy group, our substudy found > 10% reduction in LV mass, which compares favorably with the reduction seen in other studies. 18 The absence of difference in LV mass between groups confirms rejection of the never‐catch‐up hypothesis and the rapidity with which cardiovascular risk (for which LV mass is the best surrogate) can be reversed by good BP control.

The British Hypertension Society Research Network took a lead role in the design of ACCELERATE (Aliskiren and the Calcium Channel blocker Amlodipine combination as an initial treatment strategy for hypertension control), 9 a previous trial addressing questions similar to those in PATHWAY‐1. That study was unable to address the question of individual variability and recruited a high proportion of patients on multiple previous drugs. We aimed this time at 50% of naïve patients and achieved 45%, which is rare in studies of this size; the remaining patients had received just 1 previous drug class. Taken together, the present study and the ACCELERATE study 9 provide a reasonable basis to suggest that the benefits of combination therapy over monotherapy are generalizable. The present study used losartan and HCTZ, whereas ACCELERATE used aliskiren and amlodipine, and both studies demonstrated the superiority of initial treatment with combination therapy. Many combination tablets cost no more than the single components. Whether further reduction of BP by combination therapy is cost‐effective and advantageous in the 40% of patients at target on monotherapy is a matter of current interest on which forthcoming guidelines are likely to have a view. 34 Initial combination may be favored by those who consider undertreatment to be a more prevalent problem than overtreatment.

### Amlodipine besylate and valsartan (Amlodipine and valsartan) [^111p7Mj9]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Two additional double-blind, active-controlled studies were conducted in which amlodipine and valsartan tablets were administered as initial therapy. In 1 study, a total of 572 black patients with moderate to severe hypertension were randomized to receive either combination amlodipine/valsartan or amlodipine monotherapy for 12 weeks. The initial dose of amlodipine/valsartan was 5/160 mg for 2 weeks with forced titration to 10/160 mg for 2 weeks, followed by optional titration to 10/320 mg for 4 weeks and optional addition of HCTZ 12.5 mg for 4 weeks. The initial dose of amlodipine was 5 mg for 2 weeks with forced titration to 10 mg for 2 weeks, followed by optional titration to 10 mg for 4 weeks and optional addition of HCTZ 12.5 mg for 4 weeks. At the primary endpoint of 8 weeks, the treatment difference between amlodipine/valsartan and amlodipine was 6.7/2.8 mmHg.

In the other study of similar design, a total of 646 patients with moderate to severe hypertension (MSSBP of ≥ 160 mmHg and < 200 mmHg) were randomized to receive either combination amlodipine/valsartan or amlodipine monotherapy for 8 weeks. The initial dose of amlodipine/valsartan was 5/160 mg for 2 weeks with forced titration to 10/160 mg for 2 weeks, followed by the optional addition of HCTZ 12.5 mg for 4 weeks. The initial dose of amlodipine was 5 mg for 2 weeks with forced titration to 10 mg for 2 weeks, followed by the optional addition of HCTZ 12.5 mg for 4 weeks. At the primary endpoint of 4 weeks, the treatment difference between amlodipine/valsartan and amlodipine was 6.6/3.9 mmHg.

There are no trials of amlodipine and valsartan combination tablets demonstrating reductions in cardiovascular risk in patients with hypertension, but the amlodipine component and several ARBs, which are the same pharmacological class as the valsartan component, have demonstrated such benefits.

### 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on clinical assessment, management, and trajectory of patients hospitalized with heart Failure focused update: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^111wkXDu]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

HFrEF hospitalization — sequencing and dosing during GDMT initiation emphasize practical starting choices and available evidence. For patients with less robust blood pressure, "the first step may be a low dose of an ARB, with a potential switch to sacubitril/valsartan before discharge, once a low dose of beta-blocker has been tolerated (usually starting with metoprolol 6.25 mg twice per day or carvedilol 3.125 mg twice per day)". Evidence on sequence is limited; the historical CIBIS III "demonstrated no difference in overall outcomes… during the first 6 months", whereas "a small trial showed a higher achieved beta-blocker dose, lower heart rate, and greater increase in LVEF at 12 months when beta-blockers were started first". The document notes "The usual strategy aims for addition of all neurohormonal modulatory classes before any up-titration". In the European TRANSITION trial, "similar majorities of patients were on 49/51 mg to 97/103 mg twice-daily doses of sacubitril/valsartan at 10 weeks", regardless of timing relative to discharge, with higher doses in de novo HF, hypertension, and higher starting doses. It also states that U.S. experience shows discharge prescriptions increase maintenance and that "4-pillar GDMT has been shown to decrease recurrent HF events, reverse ventricular remodeling, and extend meaningful survival".

Sacubitril/valsartan dosing — specific patient populations: For patients on high-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy (> 10 mg total daily dose of enalapril or therapeutically equivalent dose of another ACE inhibitor), the initial dose is 49/51 mg twice daily. For low- or medium-dose ACE inhibitor (≤ 10 mg total daily dose of enalapril or therapeutically equivalent dose of another ACE inhibitor) or low- or medium-dose angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (≤ 160 mg total daily dose of valsartan or therapeutically equivalent dose of another ARB), and for those with severe kidney impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B), or elderly patients (age ≥ 75 y), the initial dose is 24/26 mg twice daily. The table notes that this severe kidney impairment population was not studied in the PARADIGM-HF trial.

### Which patients benefit the most from the perindopril / amlodipine combination [^112D8yiD]. Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Fixed-dose combinations have been strongly endorsed by European guidelines for first-line and second-line treatment of hypertension. Among recommended combinations, that of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker stands out because the mechanisms of action of these two therapeutic classes are complementary, leading to enhanced efficacy. In the large multicentre ASCOT-BPLA trial, treatment based on the combination of amlodipine and perindopril significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death, stroke, coronary events and procedures, new-onset diabetes, and new-onset renal impairment in a wide range of patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors, when compared with atenolol/thiazide-based therapy. The perindopril/amlodipine single-pill combination was developed based on guideline recommendations for combination treatment, the indications of each component, and ASCOT-BPLA trial data. Several studies in real-life settings show that a wide range of hypertensive patients, including everyday hypertensives with common risk factors, would benefit from the perindopril/amlodipine combination.

### Hypertension Canada's 2020 comprehensive guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment of hypertension in adults and children [^111XqJsi]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with isolated systolic HTN, HC 2020 guidelines recommend to consider switching to or adding other classes of drugs (such as α-blockers, ACEis, centrally acting agents, or nondihydropyridine CCBs) if BP is still not controlled with a combination of ≥ 2 first-line agents or there are adverse effects.
