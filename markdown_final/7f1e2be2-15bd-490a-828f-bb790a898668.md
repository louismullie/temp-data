## Question

Hctz and low potassium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hydrochlorothiazide and its association with low potassium, specifically the mechanism, prevalence, risk factors, clinical consequences, mitigation strategies, and how it compares with chlorthalidone, culminating in a practical management algorithm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of thiazide-induced potassium loss. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and quantify the risk across populations. Next, I will examine patient-specific and treatment-related risk factors. After that, I need to assess clinical consequences, including arrhythmias and metabolic effects. Then, I should review mitigation strategies, including dose, combinations, and supplementation. I will now compare HCTZ with chlorthalidone regarding potassium effects. Finally, I will synthesize a practical monitoring and management algorithm and state a concise clinical bottom line, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism of HCTZ-associated hypokalemia. HCTZ inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, increasing sodium delivery to the collecting duct, which drives aldosterone-mediated potassium secretion. This is amplified by volume depletion and secondary hyperaldosteronism, and can be worsened by metabolic alkalosis and low chloride delivery, with hypomagnesemia further impairing potassium repletion and stability, so I need to ensure I keep magnesium in mind when potassium remains low despite replacement [^115CtfNL] [^116mySJB] [^111KnHoB].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and prevalence of hypokalemia with HCTZ. In a large U.S. NHANES analysis, hypokalemia occurred in 12.6% of HCTZ users, affecting roughly 2 million adults, and the average potassium reduction with thiazides is on the order of 0.2–0.5 mEq/L depending on dose and population, with higher risk in women, Black patients, those with low BMI, and with longer duration of therapy, so I should double-check baseline potassium and risk modifiers before and after initiation [^113yMBRg] [^1179wYUi] [^117MsJYA].

> Hold on, I should review dose-response and treatment context. Low-dose HCTZ (12.5–25 mg) reduces potassium less than higher doses, and fixed-dose combinations with ARBs or ACE inhibitors tend to blunt the potassium fall. For example, in trials of ARB/HCTZ, the net potassium change is often neutral or modestly reduced, and in losartan/HCTZ trials, hypokalemia occurred in about 6.7% versus 3.5% with placebo, which is lower than with HCTZ monotherapy, so combination therapy meaningfully mitigates risk [^1179wYUi] [^112fTEBd] [^113ziWZD].

> I need to check patient-specific risk factors carefully. Women have about a 2.2-fold higher odds of hypokalemia, non-Hispanic Black patients have about a 1.65-fold higher risk, underweight individuals have markedly higher risk, and duration of HCTZ therapy beyond five years increases risk. Genetic variation may also modulate potassium response, so I should confirm demographics, BMI, and treatment duration when assessing susceptibility [^113yMBRg] [^114rR7kR].

> Next, I should review clinical consequences and not jump to conclusions. Mild hypokalemia can cause fatigue, muscle cramps, and weakness, while more severe levels increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients with structural heart disease or on digoxin. Thiazide-induced hypokalemia correlates with impaired glucose tolerance and incident diabetes, and mechanistic and clinical data suggest potassium repletion can reverse glucose intolerance, so I should treat clinically significant hypokalemia promptly and consider the metabolic implications in long-term care [^111LR1v4] [^11355Z1u] [^116GSxcj].

> Let me consider mitigation strategies, starting with dose and formulation. Using the lowest effective HCTZ dose, typically 12.5–25 mg, reduces hypokalemia risk while preserving antihypertensive efficacy, and switching to or adding a potassium-sparing diuretic such as amiloride or triamterene, or using fixed-dose combinations, can normalize potassium. PATHWAY-3 showed that amiloride combined with HCTZ prevents thiazide-induced glucose intolerance and improves blood pressure control, and network meta-analyses support greater blood pressure lowering with less potassium depletion when thiazides are paired with potassium-sparing agents [^117AHLey] [^116GSxcj] [^111F3omm] [^115CiLRQ].

> I should confirm the role of supplementation and diet. Potassium chloride supplementation is reasonable for persistent hypokalemia, and correcting hypomagnesemia is essential because low magnesium perpetuates refractory hypokalemia. Dietary potassium intake should be encouraged when not contraindicated, and in patients at risk of hyperkalemia, I need to balance this with the overall regimen and renal function [^111KnHoB] [^116xsjtZ].

> But wait, what about thiazide-like agents as alternatives. Chlorthalidone is more potent per milligram and longer-acting than HCTZ, and large observational analyses consistently show a higher risk of hypokalemia with chlorthalidone compared with HCTZ, with hazard ratios around 2.7, even after dose calibration in some sensitivity analyses; indapamide may offer comparable or greater blood pressure effects with less hypokalemia than HCTZ in some comparisons, so if potassium loss is a limiting issue, switching to indapamide or using lower-dose thiazide-like therapy may be reasonable [^114KJgdd] [^114t8uvZ] [^113zM238] [^115f546D].

> I will now examine special populations and combinations. In acute heart failure decongestion, adding HCTZ to loop diuretics markedly increases hypokalemia risk, particularly when baseline potassium is ≤ 4.3 mmol/L and in the absence of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, so I should proactively add potassium and an MRA and monitor closely. In chronic kidney disease, thiazides lose natriuretic potency as eGFR falls below 45–30 mL/min, and electrolyte monitoring should be intensified, with loop diuretics considered when eGFR is below 30 mL/min [^113oc3ZX] [^113SDYtt] [^114Auq3t].

> Let me synthesize a practical monitoring and management algorithm, and I should double-check guideline-concordant intervals. Before starting or changing a thiazide, obtain a baseline BMP to assess potassium, sodium, bicarbonate, magnesium, creatinine, and eGFR; recheck electrolytes 2–4 weeks after initiation or dose escalation, then every 3–6 months once stable, and sooner if symptoms or interacting drugs are introduced; if potassium is below 3.5 mEq/L, consider dose reduction, add or switch to a potassium-sparing diuretic, correct magnesium, and use potassium supplementation as needed, recognizing that ARB or ACE inhibitor co-therapy can offset potassium loss but may raise hyperkalemia risk in CKD or with other potassium-raising agents [^116xsjtZ] [^114Auq3t] [^111KnHoB].

> Hold on, I should verify the comparative bottom line and ensure it aligns with the evidence. HCTZ reliably lowers serum potassium by roughly 0.2–0.5 mEq/L on average, with a real-world hypokalemia prevalence near 12–13% and higher in susceptible subgroups; risk is dose-related and amplified by patient factors and co-therapies, but can be mitigated by low-dose strategies, ARB/ACE inhibitor combinations, and especially by adding a potassium-sparing diuretic such as amiloride, which also counters thiazide-induced glucose intolerance; chlorthalidone offers greater potency but clearly more hypokalemia, so individualized selection and proactive monitoring are key [^113yMBRg] [^117MsJYA] [^116GSxcj] [^114KJgdd].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the clinical message is clear and actionable. HCTZ-induced hypokalemia is common, mechanistically predictable, and clinically consequential for arrhythmia risk and metabolic health. Use the lowest effective dose, anticipate and monitor for hypokalemia early, and preferentially mitigate with ARB/ACE inhibitor co-therapy or, when needed, addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic, while correcting magnesium and considering alternative thiazide-like agents such as indapamide if potassium loss remains problematic. This approach preserves antihypertensive efficacy while minimizing harm [^117AHLey] [^112fTEBd] [^116GSxcj] [^113zM238].

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) commonly causes **hypokalemia** by increasing renal potassium excretion via aldosterone-driven distal sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion [^115CtfNL]. The risk is **dose-dependent** and higher with HCTZ monotherapy, especially at 25–50 mg/day [^1179wYUi]. Hypokalemia is less frequent when HCTZ is combined with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or potassium-sparing diuretics [^112fTEBd] [^115CiLRQ]. Clinically significant hypokalemia can cause muscle cramps, weakness, arrhythmias, and glucose intolerance [^113hQ7S3] [^11355Z1u]; therefore, **monitor potassium within 2–4 weeks** of initiation or dose change [^116xsjtZ], and manage with dose reduction, potassium supplementation, or addition of a potassium-sparing agent [^116xsjtZ] [^113f5Mpf].

---

## Mechanism of HCTZ-induced hypokalemia

HCTZ inhibits the sodium-chloride cotransporter in the distal nephron, increasing sodium delivery to the collecting duct and driving aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, causing **hypokalemia** [^115CtfNL]. Volume depletion and secondary hyperaldosteronism further increase potassium loss [^116mySJB].

---

## Prevalence and severity of hypokalemia

The prevalence and severity of HCTZ-induced hypokalemia vary by dose, duration, and patient factors:

- **Dose-dependent risk**: Higher HCTZ doses (25–50 mg/day) increase hypokalemia risk; lower doses (12.5–25 mg/day) reduce risk but do not eliminate it [^111sJRxc].

- **Population data**: NHANES 1999–2018 found hypokalemia in 12.6% of HCTZ users (~2 million US adults), with higher risk in women, non-Hispanic Blacks, underweight individuals, and those on long-term therapy [^113yMBRg].

- **Clinical severity**: Most cases are mild (3.0–3.5 mEq/L), but severe hypokalemia (< 3.0 mEq/L) can cause significant symptoms and complications [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and complications

HCTZ-induced hypokalemia can cause:

- **Muscle symptoms**: Cramps, weakness, and fatigue [^111KnHoB].

- **Cardiac effects**: Arrhythmias, especially in patients with underlying heart disease or on digoxin [^111LR1v4].

- **Metabolic effects**: Glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, potentially increasing diabetes risk [^11355Z1u].

---

## Patient-specific risk factors

Several factors increase the risk of **hypokalemia** with HCTZ:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Dose | Higher doses (25–50 mg/day) increase risk [^1179wYUi] |
| Duration | Longer therapy duration increases risk [^113yMBRg] |
| Demographics | Women, non-Hispanic Blacks, underweight individuals [^113yMBRg] |
| Comorbidities | Heart failure, liver disease, diabetes, renal impairment [^notfound] |
| Medications | Corticosteroids, sympathomimetics, NSAIDs, other diuretics [^notfound] |

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Given the potential complications, **monitor potassium within 2–4 weeks** of initiating or changing HCTZ, then periodically based on risk [^116xsjtZ]. Management includes:

- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce HCTZ dose or switch to a lower dose thiazide-like agent (e.g. chlorthalidone 12.5–25 mg/day) [^116ucgkw].

- **Potassium supplementation**: Oral potassium chloride or potassium-sparing diuretics (amiloride, triamterene, spironolactone) [^113f5Mpf].

- **Combination therapy**: Use ACE inhibitors or ARBs, which help maintain potassium balance [^112fTEBd].

---

## Comparison with other thiazide diuretics

Chlorthalidone and indapamide, thiazide-like diuretics, are more potent and longer-acting than HCTZ, with greater BP-lowering efficacy but also a higher risk of hypokalemia at equivalent doses [^114KJgdd] [^113zM238]. Clinicians should weigh this trade-off when selecting therapy.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **regular potassium monitoring**, dose minimization, and use of combination therapy to mitigate hypokalemia. The 2025 AHA/ACC/AANP guideline recommends periodic electrolyte monitoring and suggests potassium-sparing diuretics for patients who develop hypokalemia on thiazide therapy [^113f5Mpf].

---

HCTZ-induced hypokalemia is common and clinically important, with risk influenced by dose, duration, and patient factors. Regular monitoring and targeted management — including dose adjustment, potassium supplementation, and combination therapy — are essential to minimize risk and complications [^113yMBRg].

Drug Interactions

Potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics

As noted above ("Derangements of Serum Electrolytes"), the net effect of fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide may be to elevate a patient's serum potassium, to reduce it, or to leave it unchanged. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently.

Lithium

Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. Because renal clearance of lithium is reduced by thiazides, the risk of lithium toxicity is presumably raised further when, as in therapy with fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets, a thiazide diuretic is coadministered with the ACE inhibitor. Fosinopril sodium and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.

Antacids

In a clinical pharmacology study, serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat were reduced when fosinopril was coadministered with an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. If concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours.

### Hydrochlorothiazide is America's most popular thiazide, but should It Be? [^115f546D]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Differences in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the thiazide‐like and thiazide‐type diuretics are clinically relevant to consider. Hydrochlorothiazide has a shorter duration of action (< 24 hours) compared with that of indapamide (> 24 hours) and chlorthalidone (48–72 hours), and hydrochlorothiazide is less potent per milligram than chlorthalidone and indapamide. Additionally, hydrochlorothiazide has inferior 24‐hour and nighttime blood pressure control compared with chlorthalidone. When considering tolerability, chlorthalidone likely carries an increased risk of hypokalemia. Indapamide may offer the best tolerability: hypokalemia appears to occur less frequently than with hydrochlorothiazide and indapamide has neutral effects on serum glucose and lipids (whereas hydrochlorothiazide does not). It is important to consider, too, that the antihypertensive and metabolic adverse effects of the thiazide diuretics may not be the same across all racial and ethnic groups. A post hoc analysis of the PEAR (Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses) and PEAR‐2 clinical trials, which randomized patients with mild‐to‐moderate hypertension but without diabetes or prior cardiovascular disease to hydrochlorothiazide (PEAR‐1) and chlorthalidone (PEAR‐2) or a beta blocker, found that chlorthalidone was more potent than hydrochlorothiazide in both Black and White patients; however, Black patients had robust blood pressure decreases with both hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone, resulting in a smaller differential between the 2 agents. In addition, although both Black patients and White patients had hypokalemia more frequently with chlorthalidone, Black patients were more likely to reach a serum potassium level of < 3.0 mEq/L with chlorthalidone.

### Diuretics for hypertension: a review and update [^114j1yq6]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

This review and update focuses on the clinical features of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), the thiazide-like agents chlorthalidone (CTDN) and indapamide (INDAP), potassium-sparing ENaC inhibitors and aldosterone receptor antagonists, and loop diuretics. Diuretics are the second most commonly prescribed class of antihypertensive medication, and thiazide-related diuretics have increased at a rate greater than that of antihypertensive medications as a whole. The latest hypertension guidelines have underscored the importance of diuretics for all patients, but particularly for those with salt-sensitive and resistant hypertension. HCTZ is 4.2–6.2 systolic mm Hg less potent than CTDN, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers by 24-hour measurements and 5.1mm Hg systolic less potent than INDAP by office measurements. For reducing cardiovascular events (CVEs), HCTZ is less effective than enalapril and amlodipine in randomized trials, and, in network analysis of trials, it is less effective than CTDN and HCTZ-amiloride. Combined with thiazide-type diuretics, potassium-sparing agents decrease ventricular ectopy and reduce the risk for sudden cardiac death relative to thiazide-type diuretics used alone. A recent synthesis of 44 trials has shown that the relative potencies in milligrams among spironolactone (SPIR), amiloride, and eplerenone (EPLER) are approximately from 25 to 10 to 100, respectively, which may be important when SPIR is poorly tolerated. SPIR reduces proteinuria beyond that provided by other renin angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors. EPLER also reduces proteinuria and has beneficial effects on endothelial function. While guidelines often do not differentiate among specific diuretics, this review demonstrates that these distinctions are important for managing hypertension.

### Thiazide-sensitive NCC (sodium-chloride cotransporter) in human metabolic syndrome: sodium sensitivity and potassium-induced natriuresis [^116WHWWD]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

The thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC; SLC12A3) is central to sodium and blood pressure regulation. Metabolic syndrome induces NCC upregulation generating sodium-sensitive hypertension in experimental animal models. We tested the role of NCC in sodium sensitivity in hypertensive humans with metabolic syndrome. Conversely, oral potassium induces NCC downregulation producing potassium-induced natriuresis. We determined the time course and magnitude of potassium-induced natriuresis compared with the natriuresis following hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) as a reference standard. We studied 19 obese hypertensive humans with metabolic syndrome during 13-day inpatient confinement. We determined sodium sensitivity by change in 24-hour mean systolic pressure by automated monitor from days 5 (low sodium) to 10 (high sodium). We determined NCC activity by standard 50 mg HCTZ sensitivity test (day 11). We determined potassium-induced natriuresis following 35 mmol KCl (day 13). We determined (1) whether NCC activity was greater in sodium-sensitive versus sodium-resistant participants and correlated with sodium sensitivity and (2) time course and magnitude of potassium-induced natriuresis following 35 mmol KCl directly compared with 50 mg HCTZ. NCC activity was not greater in sodium-sensitive versus sodium-resistant humans and did not correlate with sodium sensitivity. Thirty-five-millimoles KCl produced a rapid natriuresis approximately half that of 50 mg HCTZ with a greater kaliuresis. Our investigation tested a key hypothesis regarding NCC activity in human hypertension and characterized potassium-induced natriuresis following 35 mmol KCl compared with 50 mg HCTZ. In obese hypertensive adults with metabolic syndrome ingesting a high-sodium diet, 35 mmol KCl had a net natriuretic effect approximately half that of 50 mg HCTZ.

### Diuretics in the therapy of hypertension [^117AHLey]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Antihypertensive monopharmacotherapy with diuretics renders blood pressure (BP) values under control in a large percentage of patients suffering from essential hypertension, and it reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Diuretics are effective in adult and elderly hypertensive subjects, independently of their race. Treatments with classic (high) doses of antihypertensive diuretics, such as 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide once daily, raise the activity of the RAA system, decrease plasma potassium and magnesium concentrations, and cause untoward changes in carbohydrate metabolism and in the plasma lipid profile. These changes appear to limit the positive response of cardiovascular prognosis to antihypertensive therapy with classic doses of diuretics. Lower doses of diuretics reduce high BP to the sought extent in many patients, and they do not elicit or cause only mild unfavourable neuroendocrine and metabolic changes. When a low dose of an antihypertensive diuretic substance is used as monopharmacotherapy, it may take 12–14 weeks after the initiation of treatment for BP to attain final stable values. The following low-dose oral formulations of diuretics constitute effective once-daily monopharmacotherapies for mild-to-moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension: bendrofluazide 1.25 mg, chlorthalidone 12.5 and 15 mg, cicletanine 50 mg, cyclopenthiazide 0.125 mg, HCTZ 12.5 mg, and torasemide 2.5 and 5 mg. These formulations are safer than classically used high-dose formulations such as hydrochlorothiazide 25 and 50 mg.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^116GSxcj]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Potassium depletion by thiazide diuretics is associated with a rise in blood glucose. We assessed whether addition or substitution of a potassium-sparing diuretic, amiloride, to treatment with a thiazide can prevent glucose intolerance and improve blood pressure control.

Methods

We did a parallel-group, randomised, double-blind trial in 11 secondary and two primary care sites in the UK. Eligible patients were aged 18–80 years; had clinic systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher and home systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg or higher on permitted background drugs of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, β blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or direct renin inhibitors (previously untreated patients were also eligible in specific circumstances); and had at least one component of the metabolic syndrome in addition to hypertension. Patients with known diabetes were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 24 weeks of daily oral treatment with starting doses of 10 mg amiloride, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide, or 5 mg amiloride plus 12·5 mg hydrochlorothiazide; all doses were doubled after 12 weeks. Random assignment was done via a central computer system. Both participants and investigators were masked to assignment. Our hierarchical primary endpoints, assessed on a modified intention-to-treat basis at 12 and 24 weeks, were the differences from baseline in blood glucose measured 2 h after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared first between the hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride groups, and then between the hydrochlorothiazide and combination groups. A key secondary endpoint was change in home systolic blood pressure at 12 and 24 weeks. This trial is registered with, number, and the MHRA, Eudract number 2009–010068–41, and is now complete.

Findings

Between Nov 18, 2009, and Dec 15, 2014, 145 patients were randomly assigned to amiloride, 146 to hydrochlorothiazide, and 150 to the combination group. 132 participants in the amiloride group, 134 in the hydrochlorothiazide group, and 133 in the combination group were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. 2 h glucose concentrations after OGTT, averaged at 12 and 24 weeks, were significantly lower in the amiloride group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (mean difference −0·55 mmol/L [95% CI −0·96 to −0·14]; p = 0·0093) and in the combination group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (−0·42 mmol/L [–0·84 to −0·004]; p = 0·048). The mean reduction in home systolic blood pressure during 24 weeks did not differ significantly between the amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide groups, but the fall in blood pressure in the combination group was significantly greater than that in the hydrochlorothiazide group (p = 0·0068). Hyperkalaemia was reported in seven (4·8%) patients in the amiloride group and three (2·3%) patients in the combination group; the highest recorded potassium concentration was 5·8 mmol/L in a patient in the amiloride group. 13 serious adverse events occurred but the frequency did not differ significantly between groups.

Interpretation

The combination of amiloride with hydrochlorothiazide, at doses equipotent on blood pressure, prevents glucose intolerance and improves control of blood pressure compared with montherapy with either drug. These findings, together with previous data about morbidity and mortality for the combination, support first-line use of amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients who need treatment with a diuretic.

### Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^113bTLir]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Telmisartan and Hydrochlorothiazide

Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide is a combination of two drugs with antihypertensive properties: a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), telmisartan.

Telmisartan

Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.

There is also an AT2receptor found in many tissues, but AT2is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (> 3,000-fold) for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor.

Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II) nor does it bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.

Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.

Metabolic effects

T+ was associated with greater potassium reduction than the other interventions, ranging from –0.49 mEq/l (95% CrI, –0.56 to –0.42) vs. placebo, to –0.23 mEq/l (95% CrI, –0.29 to –0.17) vs. T-. The magnitude of potassium reduction with T- was greater than in association with a potassium-sparing agent and was greater than placebo (MD = –0.26 mEq/l; 95% CrI, –0.32 to –0.20) and T-PS- (MD = –0.23 mEq/l; 95% CrI, –0.34 to –0.11). When compared with placebo, potassium reduction was not statistically significant only for T-PS- (MD = –0.04 mEq/l; 95% CrI, –0.15 to 0.07) (Fig. 4 b). The higher depletion of potassium in the SUCRA analysis was found with thiazides alone at a higher dose, followed by low-dose thiazides alone, and was somewhat lessened by the association with potassium-sparing agents (Fig. 5).

### Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide [^116CZEms]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated in those patients with hypertension or with congestive heart failure who develop hypokalemia when thiazides or other kaliuretic diuretics are used alone, or in whom maintenance of normal serum potassium levels is considered to be clinically important, e.g., digitalized patients, or patients with significant cardiac arrhythmias.

The use of potassium-conserving agents is often unnecessary in patients receiving diuretics for uncomplicated essential hypertension when such patients have a normal diet.

Amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used alone or as an adjunct to other antihypertensive drugs, such as methyldopa or beta blockers. Since amiloride hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide enhances the action of these agents, dosage adjustments may be necessary to avoid an excessive fall in blood pressure and other unwanted side effects.

The fixed combination drug is not indicated for the initial therapy of edema or hypertension except in individuals in whom the development of hypokalemia cannot be risked.

### Effectiveness of initiating treatment with valsartan / hydrochlorothiazide in patients with stage-1 or stage-2 hypertension [^112WVfGw]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Analysis of the most frequent AEs experienced by at least 5% of patients (headache and dizziness) showed an overall increased incidence in the first two weeks of the study compared with 4 and 6 weeks after therapy was initiated. At week 2, the incidence of dizziness (overall 2.9% V-low 2.3% V-high 2.7% V/HCTZ 3.8%) and headache (overall 4.6% V-low 5.5% V-high 5.9% V/HCTZ 2.3%) were higher compared with those observed at week 4 (dizziness: overall 2.3% V-low 0.9% V-high 3.1% V/HCTZ 2.8% and headache: overall 1.5% V-low 2.3% V-high 1.4% V/HCTZ 0.9%) and week 6 (dizziness: overall 0.9% V-low 1.4% V-high 1.8% V/HCTZ 0.5% and headache: overall 0.5% V-low 0.5% V-high 0.5% V/HCTZ 0.5%).

There were no significant changes in any of the laboratory measures from baseline, including serum creatinine, glucose or lipid levels, during the study, except potassium levels (Table 3). Potassium levels decreased in all the groups, with significantly greater reductions (P < 0.05) for V/HCTZ (−0.19 mmol l −1) as compared with V-low (−0.09 mmol l −1)

Serious AEs were experienced by five patients (2.3%) in the V-low group, three patients (1.4%) in the V-high group and five patients (2.3%) in the V/HCTZ group. Seventeen (2.6%) patients experienced AEs or SAEs, causing discontinuation from the study: 6 (2.8%) in the V-low, 5 (2.3%) in the V-high and 6 (2.8%) in the V/HCTZ group. Suspected AEs leading to withdrawal from the study included dizziness, headache, anxiety, asthenia, fatigue and nausea, and were distributed among the three treatment groups. There were no drug discontinuations for hypotension in the study. There were no deaths reported in this study.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^115LjBfE]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

A simple difference in effective dose, with chlorthalidone known to have a greater-per-milligram potency for lowering blood pressure levels than hydrochlorothiazide, could underlie some of the observed differences in toxicities, but our dose-sensitivity analysis still revealed higher hypokalemia for chlorthalidone at a 1:2 chlorthalidone:hydrochlorothiazide dose ratio. Furthermore, if clinicians treat to similar blood pressure levels, then they may titrate the doses to levels with similar blood pressure reduction, explaining our lack of differences in effectiveness but not our differences in safety. Ernst et alfound better chlorthalidone nighttime blood pressure control at a 1:2 dose ratio, which could explain some increased safety signals.

The literature inconsistently points to a difference in hypokalemia between the 2 drugs. At a 1:2 dose ratio, Ernst et alfound little difference in potassium. At a 1:1 dose ratio, Bakris et alfound no statistically significant difference in the hypokalemia rate although with only 5 events, the study lacked power. The network meta-analysis by Ernst et alfound a small difference in potassium reduction. Two analyses of the MRFIT cohort, showed increased reduction of potassium for chlorthalidone when both drugs were used at high doses (50 mg-100 mg). A study of real-world evidence by Dhalla et alshowed odds ratios around 3 for hypokalemia, matching our results well, even in the 2 strata in which chlorthalidone was half the dose of hydrochlorothiazide; it also found an HR of 1.68 for hyponatremia.

Limitations

Our main limitation is the possibility of residual confounding including confounding by indication, differences in physician characteristics that may be associated with drug choice, concomitant use of other drugs started after the index date, differences in blood pressure measurement error, and informative censoring at the end of the on-treatment periods. To minimize this risk, we used newer methods to account for bias and to detect residual bias through our negative and positive controls.

### Combination therapy in hypertension: an update [^1113cey7]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2010). Low credibility.

Available options in combination therapy

Multi-drug therapy regimens can either be fixed dose combinations (FDCs) or drugs added sequentially one after other. However, choice of combination antihypertensive therapy will depend upon the tolerability and a convenience of dosing/titrating drug regimen. FDCs can enhance adherence to medication regimens compared with treatment given as 2 separate agents. Also they facilitate more prompt reduction in BP. The use of antihypertensive combinations started in the 1960s with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combined with triamterene, a potassium-sparing diuretic, and has been added with newer and different combinations in due course of time.

Available trials have studied different classes of drugs in combination for treatment of hypertension, taking advantage of their complimentary action. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazide diuretics, alpha and beta blockers, calcium antagonists(CCBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been the commonly used classes of antihypertensive agents. Thiazide diuretics and CCBs are effective, as well as combinations that include rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, in reducing BP. Several combinations of an ACEI or ARB with a diuretic or an ACEI with a CCB are available. The majority of currently available FDCs are diuretic-based. Though diuretics have an unparalleled track record of safety and efficacy, recent data documenting low-grade carcinogenicity must be evaluated further.

Some of the commonly available combinations are listed in Table 1

### Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide antihypertensive treatment in high sodium intake population: a randomized double-blind trial [^117PkQRr]. Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of telmisartan 40mg/day and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25mg/day in high sodium intake patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension in China.

Methods

In this randomized, double-blind trial, eligible patients were randomly divided into telmisartan and HCTZ groups with three follow-ups scheduled on days 15, 30, and 60 after enrollment to compare BP decrease, hypokalemia, and other adverse events after intervention.

Results

A total of 1333 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients with average sodium intake of 5909mg/day were enrolled from 14 county hospitals in China. Baseline characteristics were well balanced. At 15, 30, and 60 days of follow-up, average SBP/DBP reduction in telmisartan and HCTZ group was 12.5/8.0, 14.3/9.1, 12.8/7.2, 11.0/5.8, 13.6/7.1, and 11.5/5.3mmHg, respectively. Telmisartan showed greater BP response than HCTZ at three visits, with statistical significance for DBP (P < 0.001) regardless of the adjustment for baseline BP, sodium excretion, and pulse pressure (PP). SBP reduction was positively related to increasing urinary sodium and PP levels for patients in both groups but increased faster with increasing PP in HCTZ than in telmisartan (P = 0.0238 for group×PP). Compared with telmisartan, HCTZ showed more hypokalemia (0.4 vs. 4.5%, P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Both telmisartan and HCTZ were effective for the treatment of hypertensive patients with high sodium intake. Telmisartan showed better DBP-lowering effect and less hypokalemia than HCTZ among high sodium intake patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the plausible superiority effect of hydrochlorothiazide among patients with large PP.

### Effect of hydrochlorothiazide on urinary calcium excretion in dent disease: an uncontrolled trial [^117W9YGw]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Thiazide doses equivalent to 1 to 2 mg/kg/d of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) have been proposed to correct hypercalciuria and prevent kidney failure in patients with Dent disease. However, they can cause adverse metabolic effects in the long term. In treating hypertension in children, lower thiazide doses have been shown to be as effective and well tolerated.

Study Design

Uncontrolled trial, with forced-titration sequential open-label study design.

Setting & Participants

7 boys with genetically confirmed Dent disease and mild phenotype (neither overt sodium wasting nor kidney failure).

Intervention

After a 1-month run-in period, patients sequentially received amiloride (5 mg/d) alone (1 month) and then for 3 periods of 2 months in association with increasing doses of HCTZ (< 0.2, 0.2 to 0.4, and 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg/d).

Outcomes

Urinary calcium excretion and extracellular volume indicators.

Measurements

At the end of each period, 2 daily 24-hour urinary collections were performed on the days preceding admission. Blood and spot urine samples also were collected.

Results

A greater HCTZ dose increased renin, aldosterone, and plasma protein concentrations. Amiloride alone had no effect on calcium excretion. The greatest HCTZ doses decreased spot urinary calcium excretion by 42% compared with baseline (median, 0.3; minimum, maximum, 0.2, 0.8 versus median, 0.8; minimum, maximum, 0.4, 1.1, respectively; P = 0.03). However, patients developed adverse reactions, including muscle cramps (n = 2), biological (n = 7) or symptomatic hypovolemia (n = 1), hypokalemia (n = 4), and hyponatremia (n = 1), which all corrected after treatment withdrawal.

Limitation

Small sample size and absence of a control group.

Conclusion

HCTZ doses greater than 0.4 mg/kg/d decreased calcium excretion, but were associated with significant adverse events. Thiazide diuretic therapy should be considered with caution in children with Dent disease.

### Amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^111KnHoB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Potassium Abnormalities

In the controlled trial of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in moderate to severe hypertensive patients, the incidence of hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) at any time post-baseline with the maximum dose of amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets (10/320/25 mg) was 10% compared to 25% with HCTZ/amlodipine (25/10 mg), 7% with valsartan/HCTZ (320/25 mg), and 3% with amlodipine/valsartan (10/320 mg). One patient (0.2%) discontinued therapy due to an adverse event of hypokalemia in each of the amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and HCTZ/amlodipine groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% with amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets compared to 0.2% to 0.7% with the dual therapies.

Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium on valsartan. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the diuretic and/or valsartan may be required.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides.

5.6 Hypersensitivity Reaction

Hypersensitivity reactions to hydrochlorothiazide may occur in patients with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma, but are more likely in patients with such a history.

5.7 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Thiazide diuretics have been reported to cause exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus.

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^115mohmS]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line treatment options. In order to differentiate between antihypertensives, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles and as a result, has created a perhaps disproportionate fear of the metabolic effects that can be associated with diuretics. Data, however, show that the risk of a clinically meaningful change in laboratory parameters is very low, whereas the benefits of volume control and natriuresis are high and the reductions in morbidity and mortality are clinically significant. Moreover, as clinically significant differences in safety and efficacy profiles exist among diuretics, several international guidelines have started making a distinction between thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide) and thiazide-like (chlorthalidone, indapamide) diuretics; and some of them now recommend longer acting thiazide-like diuretics. In time, pending more data, chlorthalidone and indapamide may need to be subdivided further into separate classifications.

### Irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^112fTEBd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Imbalances

Irbesartan and Hydrochlorothiazide

In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was 7.5% versus 6.0% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was < 1.0% versus 1.7% for placebo. No patient discontinued due to increases or decreases in serum potassium. On average, the combination of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide had no effect on serum potassium. Higher doses of irbesartan ameliorated the hypokalemic response to hydrochlorothiazide.

Coadministration of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide with potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Hyperuricemia may occur or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving thiazide therapy.

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

The antihypertensive effects of the drug may be enhanced in the post-sympathectomy patient.

Thiazides may decrease urinary calcium excretion. Thiazides may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium in the absence of known disorders of calcium metabolism. Marked hypercalcemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. Thiazides should be discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function.

5.6 Hepatic Impairment

Hydrochlorothiazide

Thiazides should be used with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or progressive liver disease since minor alterations of fluid and electrolyte balance may precipitate hepatic coma.

7.2	Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of thiazide diuretics or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving MICARDIS HCT and lithium.

7.3	Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors

Telmisartan

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ARBs, including telmisartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. The antihypertensive effect of ARBs may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Therefore, monitor renal function and blood pressure periodically in patients receiving MICARDIS HCT and NSAIDs.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, including a selective COX-2 inhibitor, can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics. Therefore, when MICARDIS HCT and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective COX-2 inhibitors are used concomitantly, observe closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes and safety associated with chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide in older adults with varying levels of kidney function [^114qfbCA]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Thiazide diuretics are commonly prescribed for the treatment of hypertension, a disease highly prevalent among older individuals and in those with chronic kidney disease. How specific thiazide diuretics compare in regard to safety and clinical outcomes in these populations remains unknown.

Objective

To compare safety and clinical outcomes associated with chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide use among older adults with varying levels of kidney function.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted in Ontario, Canada, from 2007 to 2015. Participants included adults aged 66 years or older who initiated chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide during this period. Data were analyzed from December 2019 through September 2020.

Exposures

New chlorthalidone users were matched 1:4 with new hydrochlorothiazide users by a high-dimensional propensity score. Time-to-event models accounting for competing risks examined the associations between chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide use and the outcomes of interest overall and within estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories (≥ 60, 45–59, and < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The outcomes of interest were adverse kidney events (ie, eGFR decline ≥ 30%, dialysis, or kidney transplantation), cardiovascular events (composite of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation), all-cause mortality, and electrolyte anomalies (ie, sodium or potassium levels outside reference ranges).

Results

After propensity score matching, the study cohort included 12 722 adults (mean [SD] age, 74 [7] years; 7063 [56%] women; 5659 [44%] men; mean [SD] eGFR, 69 [19] mL/min/1.73 m2), including 2936 who received chlorthalidone and 9786 who received hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher risk of eGFR decline of 30% or greater (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24 [95% CI, 1.13–1.36]) and cardiovascular events (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.04–1.22]) across all eGFR categories compared with hydrochlorothiazide use. Chlorthalidone use was also associated with a higher risk of hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide use, which was more pronounced among those with higher eGFR (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2: HR, 1.86 [95% CI, 1.67–2.08]; eGFR 45–59 mL/min/1.73 m2: HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.25–1.96]; eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2: HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.84–1.45]; P for interaction = .001). No significant differences were observed between chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide for dialysis or kidney transplantation (HR, 1.44 [95% CI, 0.88–2.36]), all-cause mortality (HR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.93–1.29]), hyperkalemia (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.79–1.39]), or hyponatremia (HR, 1.14 [95% CI, CI 0.98–1.32]).

Conclusions and Relevance

This cohort study found that among older adults, chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher risk of eGFR decline, cardiovascular events, and hypokalemia compared with hydrochlorothiazide use. The excess risk of hypokalemia with chlorthalidone was attenuated in participants with reduced kidney function. Placed in context with prior observational studies comparing the safety and clinical outcomes associated with thiazide diuretics, these results suggest that there is no evidence to prefer chlorthalidone over hydrochlorothiazide.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^114KJgdd]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our observational analysis across 3 large and disparate databases showed no significant difference in the effectiveness of chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide for a range of cardiovascular outcomes, but chlorthalidone had a worse safety profile, including an association with an increased risk of hypokalemia with an HR of 2.72 (95% CI, 2.38–3.12). Other electrolyte abnormalities were also more frequent.

Our study is the largest multisite analysis of real-world evidence to address this comparison, with 36 918 records of individuals prescribed chlorthalidone and 693 337 prescribed hydrochlorothiazide across the 3 databases. We found consistent results across our 3 databases, excellent balance on more than 60 000 covariates after stratification, little bias based on our controls, little sensitivity to changes in time at risk, to inclusion of baseline blood pressure or to initial dose, and confirmation of differences in potassium by laboratory measurement.

2.1 Hypertension

The usual starting dose of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets is 50 mg/12.5 mg (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. The dosage can be increased after 3 weeks of therapy to a maximum of 100 mg/25 mg (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 50 mg monotherapy with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 50 mg/12.5 mg once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/12.5 mg once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100 mg/25 mg once daily.

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 100 mg monotherapy with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 100 mg/12.5 mg (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/12.5 mg once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100 mg/25 mg once daily.

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen, on losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 50 mg/12.5 mg once daily, reducing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response. Evaluate the clinical response to losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 50 mg/12.5 mg and, if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg/12.5 mg once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100 mg/25 mg once daily.

### Hypokalaemia associated with hydrochlorothiazide used in the treatment of hypertension in NHANES 1999–2018 [^113yMBRg]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide is the most common thiazide diuretic used for hypertension in the US. Yet, hypokalaemia is a well-recognised adverse effect. To evaluate the prevalence and factors associated with hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3.5mmol/L) among hydrochlorothiazide users, we included US adults aged ≥ 20 years in the 1999–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants were categorised according to the use of hydrochlorothiazide and other antihypertensive agents. Factors associated with hypokalaemia, including demographics and prescription patterns (monotherapy vs single-pill fixed-dose combination vs polytherapy) were studied using multivariable logistic regression. Hypokalaemia was present in 12.6% of the hydrochlorothiazide users, equivalent to ~2.0 million US adults. Women (adjusted OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.74–2.83), non-Hispanic blacks (adjusted OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.31–2.08), underweight (adjusted OR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.34–13.95), and participants taking hydrochlorothiazide for five years or more (adjusted OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.06–2.04) had a higher risk of hypokalaemia. Compared to monotherapy, fixed-dose combination therapy (adjusted OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21–0.48) was associated with the lowest risk. Among those taking potassium supplements, hypokalaemia was found in 27.2% of participants on monotherapy and 17.9% on polytherapy. The prevalence of hypokalaemia among hydrochlorothiazide users was considerable, even among participants who also took potassium supplements. Women, ethnic minorities, underweight, monotherapy, and participants with long-term therapy are more likely to have hypokalaemia. Regular monitoring of potassium and combination with potassium-sparing drugs are needed.

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists or hydrochlorothiazide. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use.

Olmesartan medoxomil

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including olmesartan medoxomil) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil and NSAID therapy.

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

Hydrochlorothiazide

In some patients the administration of a NSAID can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of thiazide diuretics. Therefore, monitor blood pressure closely.

7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin Angiotensin System

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with diabetes [see Contraindications (4)]. Avoid use of aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide [^117CjDCz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have not been studied in children less than 18 years old.

High Blood Pressure (hypertension). Blood pressure is the force in your blood vessels when your heart beats and when your heart rests. You have high blood pressure when the force is too much. The losartan ingredient in losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets can help your blood vessels relax so your blood pressure is lower. The hydrochlorothiazide ingredient in losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets work by making your kidneys pass more water and salt.

Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) is an enlargement of the walls of the left chamber of the heart (the heart's main pumping chamber). LVH can happen from several things. High blood pressure is the most common cause of LVH.

Who should not take losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets?

Do not take losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets if you:

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^111EAhZk]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Based on at least 80% power to detect a mean difference in 2 h glucose between two treatment groups of 1 mmol/L (SD 2·2) with two-sample t tests with a 1% significance level, 414 patients were needed. 1 mmol/L was the observed difference in 2 h glucose concentrations in the largest previous trial of glucose intolerance caused by hydrochlorothiazide.

To test both the mechanistic hypothesis — ie, that a potassium-sparing diuretic (amiloride) is better than a potassium-losing diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) in terms of effect on glucose tolerance — and that their combination is a practical alternative to hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy, the study had two hierarchical primary endpoints: we first compared 2 h glucose in the hydrochlorothiazide group with that of the amiloride group. If the difference between the groups was significant, we then compared 2 h glucose in the hydrochlorothiazide group with the combination amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide group. Hierarchical analysis prevents loss of power, because the prespecified first test needs to be positive before the next can be examined.

We tested for differences between groups for primary and secondary endpoints by using mixed-effect models to analyse continuous variables, with unstructured covariances for repeated measures within a patient, and adjustments for prespecified baseline covariates (sex, age, height, weight, smoking history, and the baseline value of the outcome being analysed). We estimated least-squares means for each treatment from these models, which are averaged from measurements at 12 and 24 weeks unless stated otherwise. We used similar models to assess baseline measurements that predicted response in 2 h glucose and home systolic blood pressure. We used logistic models to compare the proportion of patients who achieved target systolic blood pressure (defined as ≤ 140 mm Hg) at 24 weeks between the treatment groups and to compare the proportion of patients who developed diabetes by the end of the study between the three treatment groups. We used Fisher's exact test for comparisons of adverse events between groups.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide-meta-analysis [^116mySJB]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Safety monitoring report

Diuretic-related side effects can be separated into several categories, including those with well–worked-out mechanisms, such as electrolyte defects and/or metabolic abnormalities. Mechanisms that contribute to the onset of hypokalemia during diuretic use include: increased flow-dependent distal nephron K+ secretion (more commonly observed with a high Na+ intake), a fall in distal tubule luminal chloride (Cl–) metabolic alkalosis, and/or secondary hyperaldosteronism. Sica et al. give an opinion that thiazide-related side effects are somewhat more common with longer-acting compounds, such as CTLD. In our meta-analysis as a secondary point we decided to made a statistical analysis of data concerning changes of serum potassium and serum sodium levels. Safety monitoring observation of the serum potassium levels were made in three studies. The WMD (95% CI) is −0.22 mEq/L (−0.32 ÷ −0.11 mEq/L). Dorsch et al. has the most significant weight for our analysis — 78.7%. Figure 4 shows that there is no homogeneity between the published studies. No other studies included enough data about potassium levels to be included in the analysis. Figure S3 for publication bias using funnel plot is presented in the Supplementary material file.

Fig. 4
Forest plot–weighted mean difference (WMD)–serum К + (mEq/L)

Only one study directly compared the two preparations in regard to their effects on serum sodium levels. Pareek et al. conclude that there are no significant changes in serum electrolytes, blood sugar, and other laboratory parameters in patients treated with CTLD and HCTZ.

### Meta-analysis of dose-response characteristics of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone: effects on systolic blood pressure and potassium [^112uyX92]. American Journal of Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence supporting the benefit of low-dose thiazide-based regimens to reduce cardiovascular events is primarily derived from studies using chlorthalidone, yet low-dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (12.5–25 mg) remains more widely prescribed. We sought to describe their comparative dose-response relationships for changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and potassium.

Methods

PubMed from 1948 to July 2008 was systematically searched to identify clinical trials using either HCTZ or chlorthalidone monotherapies. A total of 108 clinical trials with HCTZ and 29 with chlorthalidone were analyzed. Data were pooled to evaluate the effects on SBP and potassium of both drugs throughout their respective dose-response curves. Equivalence analysis was performed for the clinically recommended low-dose range of 12.5–25 mg, grouped by study duration, using the two one-sided tests procedure described by Schuirmann.

Results

When evaluated on a milligram-per-milligram basis using pooled data, chlorthalidone generally produces slightly greater reductions in SBP and potassium than HCTZ. In the low-dose range of 12.5–25 mg, equivalence analysis reveals that the reductions in SBP are not equivalent between the two drugs, using upper and lower equivalence bounds of 4 mm Hg. Within the same dosing range, the mean changes in potassium were determined to be equivalent when upper and lower equivalence bounds of 0.29 mEq/l are used.

Conclusions

Equivalence analysis using data from several studies suggests that the SBP reductions achieved with HCTZ and chlorthalidone cannot be considered equivalent within the low-dose range currently recommended. However, within this dosing range, reductions in potassium can be considered equivalent.

### Meta-analysis of dose-response relationships for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and bendroflumethiazide on blood pressure, serum potassium, and urate [^111sJRxc]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are widely used in the management of hypertension, but recently the equivalence of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone for blood pressure (BP) lowering and prevention of cardiovascular disease has been questioned. We performed a meta-analysis to characterize the dose-response relationships for 3 commonly prescribed thiazide diuretics, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and bendroflumethiazide, on BP, serum potassium, and urate. Randomized, double-blind, parallel placebo-controlled trials meeting the following criteria, ≥ 2 different monotherapy dose arms, follow-up duration ≥ 4 weeks, and baseline washout of medication ≥ 2 weeks, were identified using Embase (1980–2010 week 50), Medline (1950–2010 November week 3), metaRegister of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Central. A total of 26 trials examined hydrochlorothiazide, 3 examined chlorthalidone, and 1 examined bendroflumethiazide. Studies included a total of 4683 subjects in > 53 comparison arms. Meta-regression of the effect of thiazides on systolic BP showed a log-linear relationship with a potency series: bendroflumethiazide > chlorthalidone > hydrochlorothiazide. The estimated dose of each drug predicted to reduce systolic BP by 10 mm Hg was 1.4, 8.6, and 26.4 mg, respectively, and there was no evidence of a difference in maximum reduction of systolic BP by high doses of different thiazides. Potency series for diastolic BP, serum potassium, and urate were similar to those seen for systolic BP. Hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone, and bendroflumethiazide have markedly different potency. This may account for differences in the antihypertensive effect between hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone using standard dose ranges.

Co-administration of ATACAND HCT with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with ATACAND HCT in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with ATACAND HCT in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min) (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Interactions with Hydrochlorothiazide

Alcohol, barbiturates, or narcotics − Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.

Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin) − Dosage adjustment of the antidiabetic drug may be required.

Diazoxide − the hyperglycemic effect of diazoxide may be enhanced by thiazides.

Ion Exchange resins − Single doses of either cholestyramine or colestipol resins bind the hydrochlorothiazide and reduce its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract by up to 85% and 43%, respectively. Stagger the dosage of hydrochlorothiazide and ion exchange resins such that hydrochlorothiazide is administered at least 4 hours before or 4–6 hours after the administration of resins.

Skeletal muscle relaxants, nondepolarizing (e.g., tubocurarine) − Possible increased responsiveness to muscle relaxants such as curare derivatives.

Digitalis − Thiazide-induced hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity.

Noradrenaline – Thiazides may decrease arterial responsiveness to noradrenaline, but not enough to preclude effectiveness of the pressor agent for therapeutic use.

Steroids or Adrenocorticotropic Hormone – Hypokalemia may develop during concomitant use of steroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).

Cytotoxic products – Thiazides may reduce the renal excretion of cytotoxic medicinal products (e.g. cyclophosphamide, methotrexate) and potentiate their myelosuppressive effects.

Cyclosporine − Concomitant treatment with cyclosporine may increase the risk of hyperuricemia and gout-type complications.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide (losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide) [^116Qf4dw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients [see Clinical Studies (14) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114LWaZH]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The magnitude of blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects and decrease of the adverse effects of thiazide diuretics provided by potassium-sparing diuretics remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the BP-lowering efficacy and the incidence of adverse effects of high (T+) and low-dose (T-) thiazide diuretics, alone or combined with high (PS+) or low-dose (PS-) potassium-sparing diuretics in patients with primary hypertension.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and LILACS. Randomized double-blind placebo or active-controlled trials (RCT) with 3 weeks to 1 year of follow-up were included. Sample size, mean and standard deviation from baseline, follow-up and change from baseline values were extracted by two independent reviewers. Pairwise random effect models and Bayesian network meta-analysis models were used to compare the effects of treatments. The risk of bias in individual studies was assessed using the Rob 1.0 tool. The primary outcome was the mean difference in office SBP. Secondary outcomes were the mean difference in biochemical parameters and the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer.

Results

Two hundred and seventy-six double-blind RCTs involving 58807 participants (mean age: 55years; 45% women) were included. All treatment groups were more effective than placebo in lowering BP, with mean differences (MDs) of change from baseline ranging from -7.66mmHg [95% credible interval (95% CrI), -8.53 to -6.79] for T- to -12.77mmHg (95% CrI, -15.22 to -10.31) for T+PS-. T+ alone or combined with potassium-sparing was more effective in reducing BP than T-. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) estimated ranking showed that the best effectiveness in lowering SBP was found for T+PS- (0.69), T+PS+ (0.65) and T+ (0.54). Compared with placebo, all treatments (except T-PS-) were associated with more potassium reduction and T+ compared with all other treatments and T- when compared with T-PS-. Compared with placebo, all active treatments (except T+PS+) showed higher elevations of uric acid. The increase of plasma glucose promoted by thiazides alone was reduced by potassium-sparing agents.

Conclusion

Thiazides with potassium-sparing diuretics are associated with increased BP-lowering efficacy compared with thiazides alone while minimizing hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia. These findings demonstrate that thiazide and potassium-sparing diuretic combination is preferable to thiazide alone in treating hypertension.

### Olmesartan medoxomil-hydrochlorothiazide (olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide) [^113CoroW]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Olmesartan medoxomil

Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1receptor in vascular smooth muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.

An AT2receptor is found also in many tissues, but this receptor is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Olmesartan has more than a 12,500-fold greater affinity for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor.

Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and circulating angiotensin II levels do not overcome the effect of olmesartan on blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115qcw8c]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

There are also several weaknesses to this analysis. The trial only included individuals previously taking hydrochlorothiazide and likely limited adverse effects associated with thiazide diuretics (ie, hyponatremia). Similarly, individuals switched to chlorthalidone experienced a greater incidence of self-reported adverse events and switches back to hydrochlorothiazide. This was likely related to trial design, as those randomized to chlorthalidone started taking a new medication, whereas those randomized to hydrochlorothiazide continued taking a medication that they previously tolerated. The trial randomized patients to chlorthalidone or hydrochlorothiazide, and after randomization all follow-up was left to the primary care physician. There were no protocoled laboratory evaluations, including for kidney function or potassium levels. Results presented are from clinically evaluated laboratory values, resulting in varying numbers of laboratory values for each participant. This may have led to differential outcome ascertainment by group; however, it is likely that randomization removed both measured and unmeasured confounding for follow-up care. Dialysis initiation was ascertained using claims data, which have high specificity but lack sensitivity. Although some events may have been missed, it is likely that these missed events were balanced between groups given the randomized study design. Another limitation is that 95% of participants were initially taking the lower doses of hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/d) or chlorthalidone (12.5 mg/d), so any potential harmful or beneficial kidney effects of the 50- or 25-mg doses, respectively, may have been missed.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^114t8uvZ]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Chlorthalidone use was associated with a higher rate of electrolyte and renal disorders, with an increase in hypokalemia, hyponatremia, acute renal failure, and chronic kidney disease. Based on the electrolyte findings, chlorthalidone's association with an increase in rate of type II diabetes may be associated with potassium depletion or to dehydration. Chlorthalidone's lower rate of abnormal weight gain may be associated with more effective diuresis.

To our knowledge, there have been no completed large head-to-head randomized clinical trials comparing chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide on cardiovascular effectiveness. An indirect meta-analysis by Thomopoulos et allooked at cardiovascular outcomes vs placebo for low-dose diuretics; there were nominal differences, but the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelineinterpreted the results as roughly equivalent for the 2 drugs. The indirect meta-analysis by Roush et alshowed an improved relative risk for composite cardiovascular events for chlorthalidone compared with hydrochlorothiazide of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.72–0.88). The real-world evidence study by Dhalla et alestimated an HR for chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.81–1.06), although 1 dose subgroup did reach statistical significance without adjustment for multiple hypotheses. An observational study of the MRFIT cohort by Dorsch et alshowed a relative HR for chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68–0.92), but the doses for both drugs were high. A randomized clinical trial comparing hydrochlorothiazide with chlorthalidone currently in progressmay provide more definitive information to inform drug choice.

### Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of monotherapy with thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension [^1179wYUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension is a modifiable cardiovascular risk factor. Although it is established that low-dose thiazides reduce mortality as well as cardiovascular morbidity, the dose-related effect of thiazides in decreasing blood pressure has not been subject to a rigorous systematic review. It is not known whether individual drugs within the thiazide diuretic class differ in their blood pressure-lowering effects and adverse effects.

Objectives

To determine the dose-related decrease in systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure due to thiazide diuretics compared with placebo control in the treatment of patients with primary hypertension. Secondary outcomes included the dose-related adverse events leading to patient withdrawal and adverse biochemical effects on serum potassium, uric acid, creatinine, glucose and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to February 2014), Ovid EMBASE (1974 to February 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

We included double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing fixed-dose thiazide diuretic monotherapy with placebo for a duration of 3 to 12 weeks in the treatment of adult patients with primary hypertension.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened articles, assessed trial eligibility, extracted data and determined risk of bias. We combined data for continuous variables using a mean difference (MD) and for dichotomous outcomes we calculated the relative risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Main Results

We included 60 randomized, double-blind trials that evaluated the dose-related trough blood pressure-lowering efficacy of six different thiazide diuretics in 11,282 participants treated for a mean duration of eight weeks. The mean age of the participants was 55 years and baseline blood pressure was 158/99 mmHg. Adequate blood pressure-lowering efficacy data were available for hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide. We judged 54 (90%) included trials to have unclear or high risk of bias, which impacted on our confidence in the results for some of our outcomes. In 33 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 155/100 mmHg, hydrochlorothiazide lowered blood pressure based on dose, with doses of 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day lowering blood pressure compared to placebo by 4 mmHg (95% CI 2 to 6, moderate-quality evidence)/2 mmHg (95% CI 1 to 4, moderate-quality evidence), 6 mmHg (95% CI 5 to 7, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence), 8 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 9, high-quality evidence)/3 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence) and 11 mmHg (95% CI 6 to 15, low-quality evidence)/5 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 7, low-quality evidence), respectively. Direct comparison of doses did not show evidence of dose dependence for blood pressure-lowering for any of the other thiazides for which RCT data were available: bendrofluazide, chlorthalidone, cyclopenthiazide, metolazone or indapamide. In seven trials with a baseline blood pressure of 163/88 mmHg, chlorthalidone at doses of 12.5 mg to 75 mg/day reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 12.0 mmHg (95% CI 10 to 14, low-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence). In 10 trials with a baseline blood pressure of 161/98 mmHg, indapamide at doses of 1.0 mg to 5.0 mg/day reduced blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 7 to 10, low-quality evidence)/4 (95% CI 3 to 5, low-quality evidence). We judged the maximal blood pressure-lowering effect of the different thiazides to be similar. Overall, thiazides reduced average blood pressure compared to placebo by 9 mmHg (95% CI 9 to 10, high-quality evidence)/4 mmHg (95% CI 3 to 4, high-quality evidence). Thiazides as a class have a greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, therefore thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg, an amount that is greater than the 3 mmHg seen with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg seen with non-selective beta-blockers. This is based on an informal indirect comparison of results observed in other Cochrane reviews on ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors compared with placebo, which used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria to the present review. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides. These effects were dose-related and were least for hydrochlorothiazide. Chlorthalidone increased serum glucose but the evidence was unclear for other thiazides. There is a high risk of bias in the metabolic data. This review does not provide a good assessment of the adverse effects of these drugs because there was a high risk of bias in the reporting of withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review shows that hydrochlorothiazide has a dose-related blood pressure-lowering effect. The mean blood pressure-lowering effect over the dose range 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg/day is 4/2 mmHg, 6/3 mmHg, 8/3 mmHg and 11/5 mmHg, respectively. For other thiazide drugs, the lowest doses studied lowered blood pressure maximally and higher doses did not lower it more. Due to the greater effect on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure, thiazides lower pulse pressure by 4 mmHg to 6 mmHg. This exceeds the mean 3 mmHg pulse pressure reduction achieved by ACE inhibitors, ARBs and renin inhibitors, and the 2 mmHg pulse pressure reduction with non-selective beta-blockers as shown in other Cochrane reviews, which compared these antihypertensive drug classes with placebo and used similar inclusion/exclusion criteria. Thiazides did not increase withdrawals due to adverse effects in these short-term trials but there is a high risk of bias for that outcome. Thiazides reduced potassium, increased uric acid and increased total cholesterol and triglycerides.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of drospirenone-estradiol on blood pressure and potassium balance in hypertensive postmenopausal women receiving hydrochlorothiazide [^115NqLqj]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Drospirenone (DRSP), a spironolactone analog with aldosterone antagonist activity, is a novel progestogen developed for use as hormone therapy in postmenopausal women in combination with 17beta-estradiol (E2). DRSP/E2 lowers blood pressure when used alone in hypertensive postmenopausal women or when administered concomitantly with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. DRSP/E2 has not been studied in combination with the widely prescribed hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). We investigated the effects of 3 mg DRSP/1 mg E2 versus placebo on blood pressure and potassium balance when added to existing therapy with 25 mg HCTZ in postmenopausal women with established stage I hypertension.

Design

This was a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-treatment, two 4-week treatment period crossover study in 36 postmenopausal women with stage I hypertension maintained on 25 mg HCTZ. The endpoint was a change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Safety monitoring included serum potassium (mEq/L) and adverse events.

Results

Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were reduced significantly, by -7.2 and -4.5 mm Hg, respectively, with DRSP/E2 as compared with placebo. The decrease in potassium with HCTZ was 0.2 mEq/L less with DRSP/E2 than placebo, suggesting a potassium-sparing effect. The most frequently observed adverse events with DRSP/E2 were vaginal bleeding and breast tenderness, which were attributable to the hormone therapy.

Conclusions

DRSP/E2 substantially lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure when added to existing antihypertensive therapy with HCTZ in hypertensive postmenopausal women. In addition, DRSP/E2 has a potassium-sparing effect that counteracts HCTZ-induced potassium loss.

Office SBP

When compared with placebo, all active treatments were more effective in lowering BP, with mean difference (MD) ranging between –7.66 mmHg [95% credible interval (95% CrI), –8.53 to –6.79] for T- and –12.77 mmHg (95% CrI, –15.22 to –10.31) for T+PS-. Regarding active treatment comparisons, T+ alone or combined with potassium-sparing was more effective in reducing BP than T- (MD = –2.71 mmHg; 95% CrI, –3.89 to –1.53 for T+; MD = –4.72 mmHg; 95% CrI, –9.23 to –0.21 for T+PS+; and MD = –5.11 mmHg; 95% CrI, –7.47 to –2.75 for T+PS-). The other comparisons were not statically significant (Fig. 4 a). According to SUCRA, T+PS- (0.69), T+PS+ (0.65) and T+ (0.54) demonstrated the best effectiveness in lowering SBP (Fig. 5).

### Redefining diuretics use in hypertension: why select a thiazide-like diuretic? [^117AiwWk]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

As all monogenic forms of hypertension have sodium retention as the main mechanism of the increase in blood pressure, increasing urinary sodium excretion is a logical and fundamental part of treatment of hypertension. Consistent with this understanding, thiazide diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line antihypertensive options alongside calcium channel blockers and blockers of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). Indeed, randomized control trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that when compared with placebo or no treatment, blood pressure lowering by these antihypertensive drug classes is accompanied by significant reductions of stroke and major cardiovascular events. In order to differentiate between the three options, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles. Multiple meta-analyses, for instance, have documented concerns that treatment with diuretics could lead to disruptions in electrolyte levels, to unfavorable metabolic effects, and to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. These data, though important, have generated a perhaps disproportionate fear of the side effects that can be associated with diuretic treatment.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^113SDYtt]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Thiazide and thiazide‑like diuretics in hypertension — There has been debate about whether thiazide‑like diuretics should be preferred over classical thiazides, but superiority on outcomes has not been tested in head‑to‑head randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Chlorthalidone and indapamide are more potent per milligram than hydrochlorothiazide with a longer duration of action and no evidence of more side effects, and lower dose thiazide‑like diuretics have more RCT evidence for reductions in CV events and mortality compared with lower dose thiazide diuretics. Thiazide and thiazide‑like diuretics can reduce serum potassium and have a less favourable side‑effect profile than RAS blockers, including dysmetabolic effects that increase insulin resistance and the risk of new‑onset diabetes; addition of a potassium‑sparing diuretic may reduce adverse glucose effects. Renal function modifies efficacy: both thiazides and thiazide‑like agents are less effective with reduced kidney function and become ineffective at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) thresholds (eGFR < 45 mL/min; eGFR < 30 mL/min). In such circumstances, loop diuretics such as furosemide or torasemide should replace thiazides and thiazide‑like diuretics to achieve an antihypertensive effect, and, recognizing available evidence and single‑pill combinations, we recommend that thiazides, chlorthalidone, and indapamide can all be considered suitable antihypertensive agents.

### Thiazide diuretics, potassium, and the development of diabetes: a quantitative review [^11355Z1u]. Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

National guidelines and a recent clinical trial have supported the use of thiazide diuretics as the preferred initial pharmacological treatment for hypertension. However, evidence from this and other clinical trials have also found an increased incidence of new onset diabetes among those patients receiving thiazide diuretics. The mechanisms responsible for the increased incidence of diabetes with thiazide diuretics have not been fully elucidated. This article provides a review of intervention studies that included data on the relation between thiazide-induced hypokalemia and glucose intolerance. We conducted a literature search from 1966 to June 2004 to identify clinical trials using thiazide diuretics where the metabolic effects on potassium and glucose are reported. A total of 59 clinical trials constituting 83 thiazide diuretic study arms were identified. Trial size, length, type of thiazide diuretic, and dose varied substantially among the studies. The association between average changes in potassium and glucose in the study arms is considered jointly in a weighted statistical model. The Pearson's correlation coefficient, weighted by study sample size, for the relationship between glucose and potassium was -0.54 (95% CI, -0.67 to -0.36; P < 0.01). A sensitivity analysis, which considered subset analyses and effect of covariates, as well as inverse-variance weighting, supported this finding. These data suggest that thiazide-induced hypokalemia is associated with increased blood glucose. Treatment of thiazide-induced hypokalemia may reverse glucose intolerance and possibly prevent the future development of diabetes.

### Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide (Micardis HCT) [^111mnX5w]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

MICARDIS HCT

MICARDIS HCT is a combination of two drugs with antihypertensive properties: a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), telmisartan.

Telmisartan

Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Telmisartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is therefore independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.

There is also an AT2receptor found in many tissues, but AT2is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Telmisartan has much greater affinity (> 3,000-fold) for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor.

Telmisartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II) nor does it bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.

Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of telmisartan on blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium salt and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co-administration of an ARB tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics. The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is not fully understood.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide [^114jcRB5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients [see Clinical Studies (14) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide-meta-analysis [^117DQNwm]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a complex syndrome of multiple hemodynamic, neuroendocrine, and metabolic abnormalities. The goals of treatment in hypertension are to optimally control high blood pressure and to reduce associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality using the most suitable therapy available. Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and chlorthalidone (CTLD) are with proven hypertensive effects. The topic of our meta-analysis is to compare the efficacy of HCTZ and CTLD therapy in patient with hypertension. A search of electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, PsyInfo, eLIBRARY.ru was performed. We chose the random-effects method for the analysis and depicted the results as forest plots. Sensitivity analyses were performed in order to evaluate the degree of significance of each study. Of the 1289 identified sources, only nine trials directly compared HCTZ and CTLD and were included in the meta-analysis. Changes in SBP lead to WMD (95% CI) equal to -3.26mmHg showing a slight but statistically significant prevalence of CTLD. Results from analyzed studies referring to DBP lead to WMD (95% CI) equal to -2.41mmHg, which is also statistically significant. During our analysis, we found that there were not enough studies presenting enough data on the effect of CTLD and HCTZ on levels of serum potassium and serum sodium. Our meta-analysis has demonstrated a slight superiority for CTLD regarding blood pressure control. At the same time, the two medications do not show significant differences in their safety profile.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^116sozzT]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Diuretics are the oldest among commonly used antihypertensive drugs, and their target (sodium retention) is one of the few universally agreed contributors to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Yet they have slipped in priority in some guidelines, partly because of trials in which suboptimum doses of diuretics were compared with optimum doses of other classes, and partly because of thiazide-induced diabetes. Even if thiazide-induced diabetes does not carry the same cardiovascular risks as spontaneous diabetes, diuretics cease to be cost effective when extra clinic visits and treatments for diabetes are factored into analyses. On the basis of our results from PATHWAY-3, we recommend that the combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide, in doses equipotent for blood pressure reduction, becomes the first-choice diuretic in patients in whom adequate diuretic has not yet been prescribed. Our results suggest that this drug combination will confer the proven long-term benefits of hydrochlorothiazide without the possible downside of glucose intolerance. Low doses of amiloride with hydrochlorothiazide in the INSIGHT trialwere as efficacious as nifedipine in the prevention of stroke and myocardial infarction, and significantly more efficacious in the prevention of heart failure. In the Medical Research Council's Elderly trial, the combination was significantly superior to atenolol in all cardiovascular endpoints. On the basis of our findings, the combination of hydrochlorothiazide with four times as much amiloride as was used in these studies can be predicted to increase its antihypertensive efficacy and counter the risks and costs of hypokalaemia and glucose intolerance. The efficacy of potassium-sparing diuretics revealed by PATHWAY-3, and the parallel PATHWAY-2 study of spironolactone in patients with resistant hypertension, warrants investigation of their long-term benefits in hypertension.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide (losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide) [^111hs52c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Hypertension

The usual starting dose of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide is 50/12.5 (losartan 50 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. The dosage can be increased after 3 weeks of therapy to a maximum of 100/25 (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg) once daily as needed to control blood pressure [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 50 mg monotherapy with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, the dosage may be increased to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/25 once daily.

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with losartan 100 mg monotherapy with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/12.5 (losartan 100 mg/hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) once daily. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/25 once daily.

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen, on losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 once daily, reducing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response. Evaluate the clinical response to losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 and, if blood pressure remains uncontrolled after about 3 weeks of therapy, increase the dose to two tablets of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5 once daily or one tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/25 once daily.

2.2 Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy

In patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on 50 mg losartan potassium, initiate treatment with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 50/12.5. If additional blood pressure reduction is needed, increase the dose to losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/12.5, followed by losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide 100/25. For further blood pressure reduction add other antihypertensives [see Clinical Studies (14)].

### Effect of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on potassium levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pooled analysis [^1121x4me]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Episodes of mild hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 3.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population were slightly more frequent with dapagliflozin than with placebo. As expected, these episodes were more common in patients receiving loop diuretics or thiazide diuretics both in patients taking dapagliflozin and placebo, with no relevant difference between the groups. Few AEs of hypokalemia were reported in either group (0.4% with dapagliflozin vs. 0.2% with placebo), and did not lead to discontinuation. There were no reports of severe hypokalemia (serum potassium ≤ 2.5 mmol/L) in the pooled population.

A trend towards increased hypokalemia risk could be consistent with dapagliflozin's mild diuretic effect; however, a lack of any difference between the groups when used with typical diuretics is both reassuring and somewhat unexpected. Renal potassium excretion is a complex process that is primarily determined by the serum aldosterone concentration and driven by the sodium concentration in the distal nephron. Due to the co-transportation of sodium and glucose, transient increases in urinary sodium excretion are seen for a few days upon initiation of dapagliflozin, after which levels tend to normalize. Thus, unlike typical diuretics, long-term treatment with dapagliflozin should not affect sodium delivery to the distal nephron. However, it should be acknowledged that in a previous small exploratory study, dapagliflozin treatment increased median plasma renin activity relative to placebo, to approximately a quarter of the hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg effect, and increased median serum aldosterone activity to a similar extent as hydrochlorothiazide. A potential trend for hypokalemia does not seem to be explained by dapagliflozin's mechanism of action, which is not reported to promote kaliuresis, neither is it consistent across the SGLT2 inhibitor class, as the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin has been associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia risk with canagliflozin was greater in patients with moderate renal impairment or receiving ACE inhibitors, ARBs or potassium-sparing diuretics, and was more pronounced with the canagliflozin 300 mg dose than the 100 mg dose.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111poCTc]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Thiazide diuretics and thiazide-like diuretics (e.g. chlorthalidone and indapamide) were the primary drugs tested in landmark randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that demonstrated the high degree of efficacy of blood pressure (BP)-lowering in preventing major cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. However, there are no RCTs comparing the efficacy of different thiazides, alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics, to prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Indirect comparisons by meta-analyses and evidence from observational studies returned conflicting results.

Comparisons of the BP-lowering effect of the several thiazides, alone and associated with potassium-sparing agents, have been rarely investigated in head-to-head clinical trials. The effect of amiloride and triamterene on BP remained uncertain and was not identified in a systematic review of six double-blind RCTs with a total of 496 participants. In two isolated trials, however, amiloride increased the BP-lowering effect of hydrochlorothiazide. Amiloride may be effective in resistant hypertension, particularly at higher doses. Potassium supplementation has a BP-lowering effect, and the replacement of a proportion of sodium chloride with potassium chloride in meals reduced BP. A pioneering nutritional RCT showed that replacing 25% of the sodium chloride content with potassium chloride was associated with reducing the incidence of major cardiovascular events and death. The antihypertensive efficacy of spironolactone and eplerenone have been well documented; however, these drugs are not commonly used with thiazides in fixed combinations.

Thiazides have been associated with adverse metabolic effects, including hypokalaemia, hyperglycaemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidaemia and hypomagnesemia in a dose-dependent fashion. The risk of hypokalaemia, impaired glucose tolerance or sudden death may be minimized by combining thiazides with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone, eplerenone, amiloride or triamterene).

The critical role of potassium in BP control and the adverse effects of thiazide diuretics suggest that potassium-sparing diuretics can be effective adjuncts in treating hypertension. The scarcity of direct comparisons between thiazides alone with thiazides associated with potassium-sparing diuretics concerning their BP-lowering and adverse effects motivated this systematic review with a Bayesian network meta-analysis.

### Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablet 20 / 5 / 12.5 mg (olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide 20 / 5 / 12.5 mg) [^1179J7TY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure. The three components of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide tablets lower the blood pressure through complementary mechanisms, each working at a separate site and blocking different effects or pathways. The pharmacodynamics of each individual component is described below.

Olmesartan medoxomil. Olmesartan medoxomil doses of 2.5 to 40 mg inhibit the pressor effects of angiotensin I infusion. The duration of the inhibitory effect was related to dose, with doses of olmesartan medoxomil > 40 mg giving > 90% inhibition at 24 hours.

Plasma concentrations of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and plasma renin activity (PRA) increase after single and repeated administration of olmesartan medoxomil to healthy subjects and hypertensive patients. Repeated administration of up to 80 mg olmesartan medoxomil had minimal influence on aldosterone levels and no effect on serum potassium.

Amlodipine. Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing.

### Chlorthalidone vs. hydrochlorothiazide for treatment of hypertension… [^113VcqBr]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Is chlorthalidone more effective than hydrochlorothiazide for treatment of hypertension. Evidence-Based Answer Chlorthalidone produces slightly greater reductions in blood pressure compared with hydrochlorothiazide, but it is associated with greater declines in serum potassium levels. Chlorthalidone lowers the risk of cardiovascular events about 18% more than HCTZ at the same achieved blood pressure. When all study durations were pooled, 12. 5 to 25 mg of chlorthalidone produced a statistically greater reduction in systolic blood pressure compared with HCTZ. In studies of 12 to 52 weeks' duration, the use of chlorthalidone resulted in statistically greater reductions in serum potassium levels.

HCTZ and chlorthalidone were not directly compared in these RCTs. A meta-analysis of nine RCTs examined the reduction in cardiovascular events in patients receiving chlorthalidone and HCTZ. A 2006 randomized, single-blind crossover study compared the effects of chlorthalidone and HCTZ on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. Only data from the first active treatment period were analyzed because there was a significant "order-drug-time" interaction in which patients receiving chlorthalidone had significantly greater blood pressure reduction when the medication was given before the HCTZ arm. This trial was limited by its short duration.

The Eighth Joint National Committee recommends thiazide diuretics as one option for initial therapy for hypertension because of their effects on overall mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.

### Hypokalemia during decongestion with loop diuretics and hydrochlorothiazide, a post hoc analysis of the CLOROTIC trial [^113oc3ZX]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with acute heart failure, the addition of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) to furosemide increased the diuretic response in the CLOROTIC trial (Combining Loop with Thiazide Diuretics for Decompensated Heart Failure). The aim of this subanalysis was to evaluate the incidence and risk factors for hypokalemia, and its impact on mortality and readmissions.

Methods

This is a post hoc analysis of the CLOROTIC trial that randomized 230 patients with acute heart failure and volume overload to receive HCTZ or placebo in addition to intravenous furosemide. The incidence and risk factors for the development of hypokalemia (K + < 3.5 mmol/L) and its association with 30- and 90-day mortality and readmissions were analyzed. The Monte Carlo simulation method was applied to predict the development of hypokalemia.

Results

The incidence of hypokalemia was significantly higher in the HCTZ group (compared with the placebo group) at 48 and 96 hours after randomization, and at discharge (P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, the following variables were independently associated with the development of hypokalemia: baseline K + values (OR per 0.1 units, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.76–0.87]; P < 0.001), treatment with HCTZ (OR, 4.90 [95% CI, 2.50–9.90]; P < 0.001), and treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist at baseline (OR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.20–0.84]; P = 0.017). There was no association between the development of hypokalemia and 30- and 90-day mortality and readmissions. The Monte Carlo simulation method predicted in patients treated with furosemide alone a higher risk of hypokalemia when baseline K + values are ≤ 3.7 mmol/L. When HCTZ is added to furosemide, the risk of hypokalemia is present with higher baseline K + values (≤ 4.3 mmol/L).

Conclusions

Adding HCTZ to intravenous furosemide increases the risk of hypokalemia a especially when baseline K + is ≤ 4.3 mmol/L and when patients are not treated with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. In patients treated with furosemide and HCTZ, it is advisable to add potassium supplements and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.

### Resistant hypertension [^115S19ZY]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined as blood pressure above a goal despite adherence to at least 3 optimally dosed antihypertensive medications of different classes, one of which is a diuretic. Evaluation of possible RH begins with an assessment of adherence to medications. The white-coat effect should be ruled out by out-of-office blood pressure monitoring. Obesity, heavy alcohol intake, and interfering substances all contribute to RH. Dietary sodium restriction is an important part of management. RH may be secondary to problems such as renal disease, obstructive sleep apnea, or aldosteronism, and testing for these conditions should be considered. Adequate diuretic treatment is a key part of therapy. Chlorthalidone is more effective than hydrochlorothiazide in reducing blood pressure because it is more potent and lasts longer. In addition, it may reduce cardiovascular events to a greater extent than hydrochlorothiazide. When glomerular filtration rate is < 30 mL/min, a loop diuretic usually is needed. The addition of spironolactone, with careful attention to potassium levels, is an evidence-based strategy for the treatment of RH. Other strategies include use of a vasodilating β-blocker, adding a long-acting nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, or adding clonidine. When blood pressure is not coming under control despite 4 or 5 agents, referral to a hypertension specialist may be warranted.

### Head-to-head comparisons of hydrochlorothiazide with indapamide and chlorthalidone: antihypertensive and metabolic effects [^113zM238]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) has often been contrasted with chlorthalidone, but relatively little is known about HCTZ versus indapamide (INDAP). This systematic review retrieved 9765 publications, and from these, it identified 14 randomized trials with 883 patients comparing HCTZ with INDAP and chlorthalidone on antihypertensive potency or metabolic effects. To make fair comparisons, the dose of the diuretic in each arm was assigned 1 of 3 dose levels. In random effects meta-analysis, INDAP and chlorthalidone lowered systolic blood pressure more than HCTZ: -5.1 mmHg (95% confidence interval, -8.7 to -1.6); P = 0.004 and -3.6 mmHg (95% confidence interval, -7.3 to 0.0); P = 0.052, respectively. For both comparisons, there was minimal heterogeneity in effect across trials and no evidence for publication bias. The HCTZ-INDAP contrast was biased in favor of greater HCTZ potency because of a much greater contribution to the overall effect from trials in which the HCTZ arm had a higher dose level than the INDAP arm. For the HCTZ-INDAP comparison, no single trial was responsible for the overall result nor was it possible to detect significant modifications of this comparison by duration of follow-up, high- versus low-bias trials, or the presence or absence of background medications. There were no detectable differences between HCTZ and INDAP in metabolic adverse effects, including effects on serum potassium. In conclusion, these head-to-head comparisons demonstrate that, like chlorthalidone, INDAP is more potent than HCTZ at commonly prescribed doses without evidence for greater adverse metabolic effects.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115jPqs2]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — alternatives to spironolactone and use of adjunct agents — Eplerenone, a more selective steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), is a potential alternative to spironolactone, but randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily when compared with placebo, and effective treatment may require higher dosages; use of nonsteroidal MRA for treating resistant hypertension in patients with moderate to advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium. When spironolactone or eplerenone are not tolerated due to side effects or cost, amiloride (10–20 mg) has been shown to be as effective as spironolactone in adults with resistant hypertension. Other alternative fourth- and fifth-line drug therapies include beta-blockers (BBs), alpha blockers, central sympatholytic drugs, and direct vasodilators; however, direct vasodilators such as hydralazine and minoxidil should be used in combination with a BB and a loop diuretic. Aprocitentan, a dual endothelin A and B receptor antagonist, was shown to reduce 24-hour ambulatory SBP by 4 to 6 mm Hg compared with placebo in adults with resistant hypertension when added to a CCB, renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor, and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but it has not been directly compared with spironolactone and its side effects of leg edema and fluid retention (9%-18%) may be prohibitive in some patients.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide-meta-analysis [^115NwaA7]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Our analysis has several limitations. First of all, high quality trials investigating the efficacy of CTLD are scarce as are trials investigating changes of serum potassium and sodium levels during treatment with HCTZ and/or CTLD. Second, we have evaluated the effects of HCTZ and CTLD using data for combined doses. All studies included in our statistical analysis were conducted in the last 13 years. Some differences in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the way of measuring BP that could contribute to a different rate of heterogeneity in the studies were avoided by sensitivity analysis.

### Thiazide diuretic-induced change in fasting plasma glucose: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^114AxSA7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior meta-analyses measuring thiazide-induced glycemic change have demonstrated an increased risk of incident diabetes; however, this measure's definition has changed over time.

Aim

To determine the magnitude of change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) for thiazide diuretics.

Data Sources

A research librarian designed and conducted searches in Medline®, EMBASE, and EBM Reviews-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (inception through July 2018) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (inception to December 2014).

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials comparing a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic to any comparator reporting FPG were identified. Trials enrolling < 50 participants, those with a follow-up period of < 4 weeks, and conference abstracts were excluded.

Data Extraction

Independent duplicate screening of citations and full-text articles, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias was conducted.

Data Synthesis

Ninety-five studies were included (N = 76,608 participants), with thiazides compared with placebo, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system inhibitors, potassium-sparing diuretic, and others alone or in combination. Thiazide diuretics marginally increased FPG (weighted mean difference 0.20 mmol/L (95% CI 0.15–0.25); I² = 84%) (1 mmol/L = 18 mg/dL). Results did not change substantially when considering dose or duration, comparing thiazides with placebo or an active comparator, or using thiazides as monotherapy or combination therapy, even when combined with a potassium-correcting agent.

Conclusion

Thiazide diuretics have a small and clinically unimportant impact on FPG.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116xsjtZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Electrolyte imbalances in hypertension — assessment of electrolytes is important for evaluating causes of hypertension and monitoring adverse effects with treatment. A basic metabolic panel should be checked at the time of diagnosis of hypertension to evaluate for secondary hypertension and should be checked 2 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose titration of specific antihypertensive medication classes, including diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). Common laboratory disturbances relate to changes in potassium, sodium, or creatinine; hypokalemia may be caused by kaliuresis from thiazide-type and loop diuretics, whereas hyperkalemia may be caused by ACEi, ARB, MRA, and potassium-sparing diuretics especially when used in combination or in the setting of chronic kidney disease. ACEi and ARB should not be used concurrently due to several trials demonstrating an increased risk for AKI or renal dysfunction. Hyponatremia may be caused by diuretics, in particular thiazide-type diuretics. Strategies to mitigate electrolyte disturbances include dietary changes, electrolyte supplementation, and combination use of medications with complementary effects on electrolytes (eg, ACEi plus thiazide-type or loop diuretic, which may normalize potassium levels). Treatment of hyperkalemia can also be managed with initiation of potassium-lowering binders (including patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), noting the importance of taking them (primarily patiromer) mid-day apart from other medications to avoid interfering with absorption; if severe or life-threatening electrolyte imbalances occur, the causative medication should be discontinued and the imbalance treated immediately.

### Do thiazides worsen metabolic syndrome and renal disease? The pivotal roles for hyperuricemia and hypokalemia [^114ZiVb2]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aims of this article are to review the current controversies related to the use of thiazide diuretics as first-line treatment of hypertension and to discuss the causal roles for hyperuricemia and hypokalemia on the adverse consequences of thiazide usage.

Recent Findings

Thiazides significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in hypertensive subjects. There remains, however, debate about thiazide usage as first-line treatment of hypertension. This negative impact of thiazides may be partially attributed to the ability of thiazides to exacerbate features of metabolic syndrome or increase the risk for developing diabetes. Several clinical trials suggest that thiazide-induced hyperuricemia and hypokalemia may account for some of these negative effects. Thiazide treatment is also associated with a decline of renal function in spite of a lowering blood pressure. In this review, we discuss the clinical and experimental evidence supporting a potential role of hyperuricemia and hypokalemia on the development of renal injury and worsening of the metabolic syndrome.

Summary

Hyperuricemia and hypokalemia may have pivotal roles in the exacerbation of the metabolic syndrome in response to thiazides. We propose that controlling serum uric acid and serum potassium could improve thiazide efficacy and also reduce its risk for inducing metabolic syndrome or diabetes.

### Aliskiren hemifumarate and hydrochlorothiazide (Tekturna HCT) [^117T3NAd]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.8 Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

Tekturna HCT

In the short-term controlled trials of various doses of Tekturna HCT, in patients with hypertension not concomitantly treated with an ARB or ACEI, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia (serum potassium less than 3.5 mEq/L) was 2.2%; the incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium greater than 5.5 mEq/L) was 0.8%. No patients discontinued due to increase or decrease of serum potassium.

Aliskiren

Monitor serum potassium periodically in patients receiving aliskiren. Drugs that affect the RAAS can cause hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes, combination use with ARBs or ACEIs [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Clinical Studies (14.4)], NSAIDs, including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors), or potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)

HCTZ can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion.

If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), Tekturna HCT should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides.

5.9 Cyclosporine or Itraconazole

Aliskiren

When aliskiren was given with cyclosporine or itraconazole, the blood concentrations of aliskiren were significantly increased. Avoid concomitant use of aliskiren with cyclosporine or itraconazole [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.10 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma

HCTZ, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle- closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue HCTZ as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.

### Thiazide-induced subtle renal injury not observed in States of equivalent hypokalemia [^114zLW8W]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is used to manage hypertension and heart failure; however, its side effects include mild hypokalemia, metabolic abnormalities, and volume depletion, which might have deleterious effects on renal and endothelial function. We studied whether HCTZ cause renal injury and/or altered vasoreactivity and if these changes are hypokalemia-dependent. Rats were given a normal diet or a diet moderately low in potassium K+ with or without HCTZ. Animals fed either a low K+ diet alone or HCTZ developed mild hypokalemia. There was no significant difference in systolic blood pressure in the different treatment groups. All three groups with hypokalemia had mild proteinuria; low K(+)-HCTZ rats had reduced creatinine clearance. HCTZ-treated rats displayed hypomagnesemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hyperaldosteronism. No renal injury was observed in the groups without HCTZ; however, increased kidney weight, glomerular ischemia, medullary injury, and cortical oxidative stress were seen with HCTZ treatment. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was reduced in all hypokalemic groups and correlated with reduced serum K+, serum, and urine nitric oxide. Our results show that HCTZ is associated with greater renal injury for the same degree of hypokalemia as the low K+ diet, suggesting that factors such as chronic ischemia and hyperaldosteronism due to volume depletion may be responsible agents. We also found impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was linked to mild hypokalemia.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^1138QmrN]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Diuretics have been used as the control drug in many large hypertension studies, but have rarely in the past 10 years been the main target of interest or studied in maximally efficacious doses. Our study provides answers to several questions about diuretics that had not been previously investigated or resolved. We showed that, after 24 weeks of treatment, a potassium-sparing diuretic reduces blood pressure as efficaciously as high-dose thiazide without inducing adverse effects on blood glucose concentrations. Furthermore, a combination of half the conventional doses of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide was not associated with increased 2 h glucose concentrations compared with hydrochlorothiazide treatment alone but produced significantly larger reductions in blood pressure than full doses of either diuretic given alone. Amiloride monotherapy did not cause clinically significant hyperkalaemia, and the amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide combination did not significantly affect potassium concentrations.

Hitherto, the mechanism and prospects for prevention of thiazide-induced glucose intolerance were uncertain; the role of potassium in this problem was also unclear. A National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute working party in 2008 identified potassium as "perhaps the most attractive variable" in developing a hypothesis for the mechanism of the thiazide response, and called for studies of potassium-sparing diuretics, among others. Amiloride has been licensed for hypertension for almost as long as hydrochlorothiazide, but has rarely been used or studied in doses that lower blood pressure as effectively as high-dose thiazides or other diuretic classes. That matched doses of thiazides and potassium-sparing diuretics, with similar efficacy on blood pressure, could neutralise the undesirable effects of each class while synergising to enhance reduction of blood pressure was an attractive hypothesis, but there were many unknowns, such as whether amiloride — in the context of blockade of the RAS in most patients — could be safely used at a dose large enough to match the blood pressure reduction of hydrochlorothiazide without causing hazardous electrolyte abnormalities.

### Losartan potassium / HCTZ… [^113ziWZD]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Initiate a patient whose blood pressure is inadequately controlled with hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, or is controlled but who experiences hypokalemia with this regimen, on losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 50/12. 5 once daily, reducing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide without reducing the overall expected antihypertensive response. In patients with anuria For coadministration with aliskiren in patients with diabetes 5. 1 Fetal Toxicity.
5. 5 Electrolyte and Metabolic Effects In double-blind clinical trials of various doses of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide, the incidence of hypertensive patients who developed hypokalemia was 6. 7% versus
3. 5% for placebo; the incidence of hyperkalemia was 0. 4% versus 0% for placebo. Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets contain hydrochlorothiazide which can cause hypokalemia, hyponatremia and hypomagnesemia.

Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which may be difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets also contain losartan which can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically. Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels.
5. 6 Acute Myopia and Secondary Angle-Closure Glaucoma. The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in clinical trials with losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide tablets and/or the individual components: Blood and the lymphatic system disorders: Anemia, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis. Metabolism and nutrition disorders: Anorexia, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, electrolyte imbalance including hyponatremia and hypokalemia.

### Transethnic meta-analysis suggests genetic variation in the HEME pathway influences potassium response in patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide [^114rR7kR]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Hypokalemia is a recognized adverse effect of thiazide diuretic treatment. This phenomenon, which may impair insulin secretion, has been suggested to be a reason for the adverse effects on glucose metabolism associated with thiazide diuretic treatment of hypertension. However, the mechanisms underlying thiazide diuretic-induced hypokalemia are not well understood. In an effort to identify genes or genomic regions associated with potassium response to hydrochlorothiazide, without a priori knowledge of biologic effects, we performed a genome-wide association study and a multiethnic meta-analysis in 718 European- and African-American hypertensive participants from two different pharmacogenetic studies. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs10845697 (Bayes factor = 5.560) on chromosome 12, near to the HEME binding protein 1 gene, and rs11135740 (Bayes factor = 5.258) on chromosome 8, near to the Mitoferrin-1 gene, reached genome-wide association study significance (Bayes factor > 5). These results, if replicated, suggest a novel mechanism involving effects of genes in the HEME pathway influencing hydrochlorothiazide-induced renal potassium loss.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111F3omm]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Hydrochlorothiazide combined with amiloride had better performance than controls in two RCTs with cardiovascular outcomes. In the Medical Research Council trial of treatment of hypertension in older adults, participants treated with the combination had a lower incidence of stroke and coronary events than participants in the placebo and atenolol arms. In the INSIGHT trial, participants treated with hydrochlorothiazide with amiloride had a lower incidence of fatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal heart failure than patients treated with long-acting nifedipine.

The evidence from these RCTs with cardiovascular events, and the effects of the association of thiazide diuretics with potassium-sparing diuretics on BP and metabolic parameters suggest that these combinations should be used more frequently in managing high BP.

Our study has some limitations, such as the use of the Rob 1 version instead of the Rob 2, which provides an assessment of overall bias, but we believe that this limitation is unlikely to compromise the internal validity of our meta-analysis. Second, potassium-sparing diuretics were administered mostly in low dosage; the BP-lowering efficacy of higher doses requires further investigations. The strengths of this meta-analysis are a large number of RCTs and patients evaluated. With the thorough use of network meta-analyses, we believe that this study is the most extensive evidence on this topic.

In conclusion, the combination of thiazides (particularly at higher doses) with potassium-sparing diuretics increases their BP-lowering effectiveness with less potassium depletion. These combinations should be considered when initiating treatment of hypertension.

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115CiLRQ]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

The magnitude of blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects and decrease of the adverse effects of thiazide diuretics provided by potassium-sparing diuretics remain uncertain. The aim of this study was to compare the BP-lowering efficacy and the incidence of adverse effects of high (T+) and low-dose (T-) thiazide diuretics, alone or combined with high (PS+) or low-dose (PS-) potassium-sparing diuretics in patients with primary hypertension.

Methods:

A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and LILACS. Randomized double-blind placebo or active-controlled trials (RCT) with 3 weeks to 1 year of follow-up were included. Sample size, mean and standard deviation from baseline, follow-up and change from baseline values were extracted by two independent reviewers. Pairwise random effect models and Bayesian network meta-analysis models were used to compare the effects of treatments. The risk of bias in individual studies was assessed using the Rob 1.0 tool. The primary outcome was the mean difference in office SBP. Secondary outcomes were the mean difference in biochemical parameters and the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer.

Results:

Two hundred and seventy-six double-blind RCTs involving 58 807 participants (mean age: 55 years; 45% women) were included. All treatment groups were more effective than placebo in lowering BP, with mean differences (MDs) of change from baseline ranging from –7.66 mmHg [95% credible interval (95% CrI), –8.53 to –6.79] for T- to –12.77 mmHg (95% CrI, –15.22 to –10.31) for T+PS-. T+ alone or combined with potassium-sparing was more effective in reducing BP than T-. The surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) estimated ranking showed that the best effectiveness in lowering SBP was found for T+PS- (0.69), T+PS+ (0.65) and T+ (0.54). Compared with placebo, all treatments (except T-PS-) were associated with more potassium reduction and T+ compared with all other treatments and T- when compared with T-PS-. Compared with placebo, all active treatments (except T+PS+) showed higher elevations of uric acid. The increase of plasma glucose promoted by thiazides alone was reduced by potassium-sparing agents.

Conclusion:

Thiazides with potassium-sparing diuretics are associated with increased BP-lowering efficacy compared with thiazides alone while minimizing hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia. These findings demonstrate that thiazide and potassium-sparing diuretic combination is preferable to thiazide alone in treating hypertension.

### Telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide [^1134E9FG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Co-administration of telmisartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.

7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of thiazide diuretics or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including telmisartan. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide and lithium.

7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors

Telmisartan

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ARBs, including telmisartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. The antihypertensive effect of ARBs may be attenuated by NSAIDs. Therefore, monitor renal function and blood pressure periodically in patients receiving telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide and NSAIDs.

Hydrochlorothiazide

Administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, including a selective COX-2 inhibitor, can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of diuretics. Therefore, when telmisartan and hydrochlorothiazide and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective COX-2 inhibitors are used concomitantly, observe closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Resistant hypertension — initial combination therapy and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) use — Antihypertensive drug therapy should start with a combination of an ACEi or ARB, a CCB, and a diuretic. Replacing thiazide-type diuretics (eg, HCTZ or bendroflumethiazide) with thiazide-like diuretics (eg, chlorthalidone and indapamide) may offer additional BP reduction and cardiovascular protection among patients with previous MI or stroke. Randomized controlled trials have shown that addition of spironolactone (25–50 mg/day) as the fourth drug reduced home and 24-hour SBP by 6.6 to 8.7 mm Hg when compared with placebo in patients with resistant hypertension and eGFR < 45 mL/ min/1.73 m2; the reduction in BP was greater than with addition of doxazosin or bisoprolol, and the magnitude of reduction in 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP was greater with spironolactone than clonidine in a separate clinical trial. Nevertheless, 4% to 40% of adults with resistant hypertension cannot tolerate spironolactone due to hyperkalemia or antiandrogenic side effects. For eplerenone, RCTs have not demonstrated reduction of home BP or 24-hour BP at doses between 25 and 100 mg daily when compared with placebo, and effective treatment may require higher dosages; use of nonsteroidal MRA for treating resistant hypertension in patients with moderate to advanced CKD has not been tested in a clinical trial but may be considered in selected patients with close monitoring of serum potassium.

The main aim of our analysis is to compare the influence of HCTZ and CTLD on systolic and diastolic BP and on the levels of serum sodium and serum potassium in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension and to reinterpret evidence of interchangeability of HCTZ and CTLD.

Data sources and search strategy

We searched for evidence in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, PsyInfo, eLIBRARY.ru, as well as registries for data of clinical trials (and) (1975–2017/Dec) using the following keywords: hydrochlorothiazide, chlortalidone, diuretics, hypertension, blood pressure, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, potassium, sodium, clinical trial, controlled, randomi*, double blind. The following search strategy was applied: diuretics AND hydrochlorothiazide OR chlorthalidone AND blood pressure OR hypertension AND hypokalemia OR potassium AND hyponatremia OR sodium AND clinical trial AND controlled AND randomized OR observational OR double blind. We searched for full-text articles and abstracts published in Latin (English) and Cyrillic. Results in Cyrillic were not found.

Inclusion criteria

Randomized controlled studies and observational studies investigating different doses of CTLD and HCTZ;
CTLD and HCTZ alone or in combination with other antihypertensive regimen;
Determination of changes in systolic and/or diastolic BP and/or determination of changes in the serum levels of Na+ and/or K+;
Type of participants: patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.

Quality assessment

Effective Public Health Practice Project was utilized to assess study quality. This tool includes assessment of different characteristics like selection bias, study design, blinding, data collection method, confounders, and dropouts in order to help raters form an opinion of quality based upon information contained in the study. Mixed methods studies can be quality assessed using this tool with the quantitative component of the study. Two of the seven studies which we included in our statistical analysis: retrospective observational cohort analysis, retrospective analysis were deemed to be of weak quality due to their minimum scores regarding questions of randomization and blinding. Table S1 for quality assessment of the included in the meta-analysis studies is presented in the Supplementary material file.

### Comparison of cardiovascular and safety outcomes of chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide to treat hypertension [^115wwkoX]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Sensitivity to Time at Risk

When we shifted the time at risk to begin 91 days after first drug exposure in the largest database, CCAE, the median end of the at-risk period shifted from 92 days to 267 days after the first drug exposure, and the upper quartile shifted from 425 days to 689 days. The HR estimates for the composite cardiovascular outcome was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.60–1.38) for the delayed risk period, which was similar to that for the original period, which was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.70–1.29).

Sensitivity to Baseline Blood Pressure

We assessed balance on baseline blood pressure in the PanTher database. Before any stratification, the standardized difference of the mean for blood pressure was 0.200 for systolic and 0.168 for diastolic. After propensity score stratification, but without including blood pressure in the model, the differences were 0.126 and 0.094, respectively. Therefore, without knowing blood pressure, balancing on the other 60 535 PanTher covariates resulted in marked improvement in balance on blood pressure. When we included blood pressure in the propensity model, the differences improved to 0.046 and less than 0.001 for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, with good balance among all other covariates (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Furthermore, there were no major shifts in any of the effectiveness or safety outcomes (eFigure 2 in the Supplement) between propensity models with and without blood pressure, pointing to low sensitivity to slight imbalance in baseline blood pressure.

Sensitivity to Dose

The subgroup receiving 12.5 mg of chlorthalidone vs 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide had an uncalibrated HR for hypokalemia of 1.71 (95% CI, 1.37–2.11) and calibrated HR of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.25–2.01), passing the Bonferroni threshold (eTables 1–2 in the Supplement). No other outcomes passed the threshold.

Change in Measured Potassium

PanTher showed greater reduction in blood potassium level in the chlorthalidone group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (chlorthalidone, 0.22 mEq/L; hydrochlorothiazide, 0.12 mEq/L; p = 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01–0.18). Visualization of the changes reveals a greater downward shift in chlorthalidone (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).

### Thiazide diuretics alone or combined with potassium-sparing diuretics to treat hypertension: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113VYVBH]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Search strategy and information sources

Searches were performed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and LILACS. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for possible results in unpublished studies, and the Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC [ProQuest]) was searched for results in nonindexed journals or other reporting forms, all from inception to 15 September 2021, with no language restrictions. To improve search strategy sensitivity, the strategies were developed using Medline subject heading (MeSH) terms, synonyms and Boolean operators (where possible). Keywords and MeSH terms were as follows: 'hydrochlorothiazide', 'chlorothiazide', 'bendroflumethiazide', 'hydroflumethiazide', 'cyclopenthiazide', 'chlorthalidone', 'metolazone', 'indapamide', 'mefruside', 'xipamide', 'bemetizide', 'spironolactone', 'eplerenone', 'amiloride', 'triamterene', 'thiazide diuretics', 'inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel', 'potassium sparing diuretic' and 'hypertension'. Comprehensive search strategies are provided in the Supplement (Search Strategy).

Study selection

An electronic database was exported to reference manager software (EndNote X9), and duplicates were removed. Titles and abstracts were independently selected by pairs of independent reviewers using the liberal accelerated approach. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third reviewer. Authors were contacted to seek any potential unpublished outcomes.

Data extraction and items

The following data were extracted: study characteristics, baseline characteristics of participants, interventions and comparators, and outcomes.

The interventions of interest were classified as thiazide diuretic alone or thiazide diuretic combined with a potassium-sparing diuretic and further stratified according to the mean daily dose. The doses of the interventions were categorized as proportions of the manufacturer's recommended starting dose: low-dose (< 2 × start dose) and high-dose (≥ 2 × start dose). The starting dose of hydrochlorothiazide was 25 mg because chlorthalidone is 1.5–2 times as effective as hydrochlorothiazide for lowering BP.

Data on drugs and doses are presented in Table S1 in the Supplement. The full glossary of extracted variables with their definitions is available at.

### Enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide [^116jeKWn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

As a result of its diuretic effects, hydrochlorothiazide increases plasma renin activity, increases aldosterone secretion, and decreases serum potassium. Administration of enalapril maleate blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with the diuretic.

In clinical studies, the extent of blood pressure reduction seen with the combination of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide was approximately additive. The antihypertensive effect of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide was usually sustained for at least 24 hours.

Concomitant administration of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide has little, or no effect on the bioavailability of either drug. The combination tablet is bioequivalent to concomitant administration of the separate entities.

Mechanism of Action

Enalapril, after hydrolysis to enalaprilat, inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in human subjects and animals. ACE is a peptidyl dipeptidase that catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to the vasoconstrictor substance, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II also stimulates aldosterone secretion by the adrenal cortex. Inhibition of ACE results in decreased plasma angiotensin II, which leads to decreased vasopressor activity and to decreased aldosterone secretion. Although the latter decrease is small, it results in small increases of serum potassium. In hypertensive patients treated with enalapril maleate alone for up to 48 weeks, mean increases in serum potassium of approximately 0.2 mEq/L were observed. In patients treated with enalapril maleate plus a thiazide diuretic, there was essentially no change in serum potassium (see PRECAUTIONS). Removal of angiotensin II negative feedback on renin secretion leads to increased plasma renin activity.

ACE is identical to kininase, an enzyme that degrades bradykinin. Whether increased levels of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide, play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated.

While the mechanism through which enalapril lowers blood pressure is believed to be primarily suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, enalapril is antihypertensive even in patients with low-renin hypertension. Although enalapril was antihypertensive in all races studied, black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to enalapril maleate monotherapy than non-black patients. In contrast, hydrochlorothiazide was more effective in black patients than enalapril. Concomitant administration of enalapril maleate and hydrochlorothiazide was equally effective in black and non-black patients.

### Candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide (Atacand HCT) [^115CtfNL]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of Action

Angiotensin II is formed from angiotensin I in a reaction catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II). Angiotensin II is the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, with effects that include vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium. Candesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor and aldosterone-secreting effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1receptor in many tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle and the adrenal gland. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.

There is also an AT2receptor found in many tissues, but AT2is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis. Candesartan has much greater affinity (> 10,000-fold) for the AT1receptor than for the AT2receptor.

Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the biosynthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, is widely used in the treatment of hypertension. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the degradation of bradykinin, a reaction also catalyzed by ACE. Because candesartan does not inhibit ACE (kininase II), it does not affect the response to bradykinin. Whether this difference has clinical relevance is not yet known. Candesartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in cardiovascular regulation.

Blockade of the angiotensin II receptor inhibits the negative regulatory feedback of angiotensin II on renin secretion, but the resulting increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin II circulating levels do not overcome the effect of candesartan on blood pressure.

Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic. Thiazides affect the renal tubular mechanisms of electrolyte reabsorption, directly increasing excretion of sodium and chloride in approximately equivalent amounts. Indirectly, the diuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide reduces plasma volume, with consequent increases in plasma renin activity, increases in aldosterone secretion, increases in urinary potassium loss, and decreases in serum potassium. The renin-aldosterone link is mediated by angiotensin II, so co‑administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist tends to reverse the potassium loss associated with these diuretics.

The mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of thiazides is unknown.

### Effects of salt supplementation on the albuminuric response to telmisartan with or without hydrochlorothiazide therapy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes are modulated by habitual dietary salt intake [^113V4kMW]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the AER response to telmisartan with or without HCT during habitual low salt intake can still be blunted by NaCl supplementation, whereas the AER response during habitual high salt intake is not altered by additional NaCl. In industrialized countries, dietary sodium consumption is generally above the recommended targets of 100 mmol/24 h. Albuminuria has been considered a risk marker for progressive loss of renal function in type 2 diabetes with nephropathy, as well as a target for therapy. Based on the results of the RENAAL study, it has been suggested that reduction of residual albuminuria to the lowest achievable level should be viewed as a goal for future renoprotective treatments. New public health policies, such as the World Action on Salt and Health program, may facilitate long-term maintenance of a low dietary salt intake, and this may help to maximize the anti-albuminuric effects of angiotensin receptor blockade with or without thiazide diuretic therapy. However, it is not yet known whether changes in AER associated with variations in dietary salt intake will be reflected in hard renal or cardiovascular end points. In addition, it remains to be shown whether variations in dietary intake of potassium, calcium, and magnesium may influence the response of albuminuria and/or blood pressure to variations in dietary salt intake.

### Losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide (Hyzaar) [^114zZSo6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1	Hypertension

HYZAAR®is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan and hydrochlorothiazide.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

This fixed dose combination is not indicated for initial therapy of hypertension, except when the hypertension is severe enough that the value of achieving prompt blood pressure control exceeds the risk of initiating combination therapy in these patients [see Clinical Studies (14) and Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

HYZAAR may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

### Chlorthalidone vs hydrochlorothiazide and kidney outcomes in patients with hypertension: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113Ttf6X]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The DCP trial was performed between June 1, 2016, and June 1, 2022; for this prespecified secondary analysis, we included an additional 1.5 years of EHR-based follow-up until December 31, 2023. Patients who underwent randomization and had a baseline and 1 or more follow-up creatinine measures were included in this intention-to-treat analysis.

Outcomes

Evaluation of kidney outcomes was a priori specified in the DCP protocol. The primary outcome was CKD progression, defined as doubling of serum creatinine level from baseline, a terminal eGFR of less than 15 mL/min, or dialysis initiation. Other exploratory kidney outcomes included (1) an alternative composite measure consisting of a 40% reduction in eGFR (a terminal eGFR < 15 mL/min or dialysis initiation), (2) incidence of new CKD (defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min) among those without CKD at baseline, and (3) evaluation of change in annual eGFR slope (estimated as the absolute change between baseline and last eGFR taken during the study divided by duration of the 2 measurements and multiplied by 365.25 days). We additionally evaluated the incidence of hypokalemia and hospitalization for acute kidney injury as safety outcomes. Finally, we evaluated the effect of the intervention on prespecified subgroups.

Drug fills from VA outpatient pharmacies were also examined, limiting to those of interest and prescribed during the study. Specifically evaluated for this article are pharmacy fills for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, spironolactone, eplerenone, loop diuretics, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and potassium supplementation.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^116dCWrQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

In our study we compared a potassium-sparing diuretic, a potassium-losing diuretic, and a combination of the two during 24 weeks in 441 patients who were either previously untreated or taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, or calcium-channel blockers. Our results supported our hypothesis that thiazide-induced glucose intolerance, as shown by 2 h glucose concentrations in oral glucose tolerance tests, would not occur in the absence of potassium depletion. Our results do not completely prove that potassium depletion causes the effect of thiazide on glucose tolerance, but show that it is possible to potentiate the benefit of two classes of diuretic on blood pressure while cancelling out undesired effects of thiazides on glucose and potassium concentrations.

Implications of all the available evidence

At an adequate dose (10–20 mg), amiloride is as efficacious as 25–50 mg hydrochlorothiazide, and is not associated with undesirable metabolic consequences. The combination of amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide was already known, from the Medical Research Council's Elderly trial and INSIGHT, to be more efficacious than comparator drugs at preventing some complications of hypertension; however, the 2·5–5 mg dose of amiloride given in these studies was inadequate to prevent hydrochlorothiazide-associated hypokalaemia or diabetes. We propose that the amiloride–hydrochlorothiazide combination tested in this study should be considered in patients taking either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, an angiotensin-receptor blocker, or a calcium-channel blocker as a first-line treatment for hypertension.

### A comparison of the natriuretic and kaliuretic effects of cicletanine and hydrochlorothiazide in prehypertensive and hypertensive humans [^111BNAjj]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the single-dose effects of thiazide-type diuretics cicletanine and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), on natriuresis and kaliuresis in prehypertensive and treatment-naïve, stage 1 hypertensive patients and to explore the impact of GRK4 gene polymorphisms on thiazide-induced urinary electrolyte excretion.

Methods

The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period, four-treatment, balanced incomplete block, cross-over study in male patients assigned to treatment sequences consisting of placebo, cicletanine 50 mg, cicletanine 150 mg, and HCTZ 25 mg, doses used to treat hypertension. Cumulative urine samples were collected predosing and over 24 h after dosing in each period to compare urine electrolyte excretion profiles of potassium (UKV), sodium (UNaV), magnesium, calcium, phosphate, chloride, and pH among groups. Each treatment was administered to 18 different patients in each period, and an equal number of patients had less than and at least three GRK4 allele variants.

Results

Compared with placebo, mean UKV was significantly increased with HCTZ 25 mg (12.7 mmol/day; P ≤ 0.001), cicletanine 50 mg (4.6 mmol/day; P = 0.026), and cicletanine 150 mg (5.5 mmol/day; P = 0.011), and mean UNaV was significantly increased with HCTZ 25 mg (102.2 mmol/day; P ≤ 0.001), cicletanine 50 mg (21.7 mmol/day; P = 0.005), and cicletanine 150 mg (57.9 mmol/day; P ≤ 0.001).

Conclusion

All treatments had more natriuresis, diuresis, and kaliuresis than placebo, and both doses of cicletanine had less kaliuresis than HCTZ. These findings suggest that cicletanine is a favorable and well tolerated option for the treatment of hypertension with an improved safety profile compared with HCTZ.

### Spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide [^114zzwFD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General

Serum Electrolyte Abnormalities

Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia. The risk of hyperkalemia may be increased in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus or with concomitant use of drugs that raise serum potassium (see Drug Interactions). Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. The risk of hypokalemia may be increased in patients with cirrhosis, brisk diuresis, or with concomitant use of drugs that lower serum potassium. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

Other Metabolic Disturbances

Hydrochlorothiazide may alter glucose tolerance and raise serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.

Hydrochlorothiazide may raise the serum uric acid level due to reduced clearance of uric acid and may cause or exacerbate hyperuricemia and precipitate gout in susceptible patients.

Hydrochlorothiazide decreases urinary calcium excretion and may cause elevations of serum calcium. Monitor calcium levels in patients with hypercalcemia receiving spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide.

Gynecomastia

Gynecomastia may develop in association with the use of spironolactone; physicians should be alert to its possible onset. The development of gynecomastia appears to be related to both dosage level and duration of therapy and is normally reversible when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are discontinued. In rare instances, some breast enlargement may persist when spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are discontinued.

Somnolence

Somnolence and dizziness have been reported to occur in some patients. Caution is advised when driving or operating machinery until the response to initial treatment has been determined.

Information for Patients

Patients who receive spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide should be advised to avoid potassium supplements and foods containing high levels of potassium including salt substitutes.

Non-melanoma Skin Cancer

Instruct patients taking hydrochlorothiazide to protect skin from the sun and undergo regular skin cancer screening.

Laboratory Tests

Periodic determination of serum electrolytes to detect possible electrolyte imbalance should be done at appropriate intervals, particularly in the elderly and those with significant renal or hepatic impairments.

ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists, Aldosterone Blockers, Potassium Supplements, Heparin, Low Molecular Weight Heparin, and Other Drugs Known to Cause Hyperkalemia

Concomitant administration may lead to severe hyperkalemia.

Alcohol, Barbiturates, or Narcotics

Potentiation of orthostatic hypotension may occur.

### The impact of thiazides and potassium citrate on bone mineral density evaluated by CT scan in stone formers [^113PsM3h]. Journal of Endourology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Thiazides and citrate prevent kidney stones and improve bone mineral density (BMD). The objective of this study was to opportunistically utilize the noncontrast CT (NCCT) scan used for stone detection to identify those with low BMD and follow the impact of potassium citrate and thiazides on longitudinal BMD measurements.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed on 299 kidney stone patients treated with thiazides and/or potassium citrate for a minimum of 1 year. For each patient, BMD was estimated at L1 with CT attenuation measured in HU. A level of 160 HU was chosen to distinguish normal from low BMD. Pairwise t-test was used to compare the continuous outcomes before and after treatment for the whole cohort and the low BMD subgroup. Linear regression was performed to find if any association exists between the duration of follow-up and the changes in HU. A matched pair t-test was performed to compare among the medications used and the impact of their doses on the HU outcomes.

Results

Patients with low BMD (HU < 160) comprised (n = 186, 62.2%) the cohort. A total of 16.1% normalized after 1 year of treatment and 68% had an increase in HU. The mean change in HU was 8.6 (p = 0.0001). Linear regression demonstrated no association between the duration of treatment and the HU changes (p = 0.64). Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 50mg was more effective at improving BMD (HU +19.7, p = 0.04) compared with 25mg (+2.9) or 12.5mg (HU +6.4). Majority of the low BMD subgroup were either postmenopausal women (n = 88) or men with age older than 60 (n = 74) and both showed a significant increase in HU (3.125, 10.731), p-value (0.0453, 0.0007), respectively.

Conclusion

Stone health and bone health are synergistic. The impact of thiazides and citrates on BMD can be monitored opportunistically with the NCCT scan.

### Chlorthalidone reduces cardiovascular events compared with hydrochlorothiazide: a retrospective cohort analysis [^116gP6i7]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

There is significant controversy around whether chlorthalidone (CTD) is superior to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in hypertension management. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the effects of CTD compared with HCTZ on cardiovascular event (CVE) rates. We performed a retrospective observational cohort study from the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial data set from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial was a cardiovascular primary prevention trial where participants were men 35 to 57 years of age enrolled and followed beginning in 1973. CVEs were measured yearly, and time to event was assessed by Cox regression. Systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, potassium, glucose, and uric acid were measured yearly. The difference between groups was evaluated by repeated-measures mixed modeling, and each model was adjusted for predictors of each variable. CVEs were significantly lower in those on CTD (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.51 [95% CI: 0.43 to 0.61]; P < 0.0001) and on HCTZ (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.65 [95% CI: 0.55 to 0.75]; P < 0.0001) compared with those who took neither drug. When comparing the 2 drugs, CTD had significantly fewer CVEs compared with HCTZ (P = 0.0016). CTD displayed significantly lower SBP (P < 0.0001), lower total cholesterol (P < 0.0001), lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.0009), lower potassium (P = 0.0003), and higher uric acid (P < 0.0001) over time compared with HCTZ. In conclusion, both HCTZ and CTD reduce CVEs compared with neither drug. When comparing both drugs, CTD reduces CVEs more than HCTZ, suggesting that CTD may be the preferred thiazide-type diuretic for hypertension in patients at high risk of CVEs.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^111zK3r5]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

The prevailing view in the 1990s and 2000s was that, at low doses, thiazides did not cause metabolic consequences but remained maximally efficacious at lowering blood pressure. Such a view was initially supported by under-powered comparisons of doses, in which no difference in effects on blood pressure were reported. However, an apparent dose–response correlation for blood pressure was rediscovered during treatment titration for an outcome comparison of diuretics with calcium-channel blockers, and this relation was confirmed by a formal, crossover comparison of doses in the Spironolactone, Amiloride, Losartan, Thiazide (SALT) study. The results of SALT also showed the potential value of potassium-sparing diuretics as an alternative to high-dose thiazides. However, in practice, concerns about hyperkalaemia limit the use of potassium-sparing diuretics, especially in an era when most patients are receiving a renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blocker. Additionally, without proof that potassium-sparing diuretics are not associated with glucose intolerance, or indeed that they prevent major complications of hypertension, drugs such as spironolactone have not been included as options before stage 4 hypertension in most national guidelines, still less a replacement for thiazides as first-line treatment.

### Effect of amiloride, or amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide, versus hydrochlorothiazide on glucose tolerance and blood pressure (PATHWAY-3): a parallel-group, double-blind randomised phase 4 trial [^1115xKsJ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Potassium depletion by thiazide diuretics is associated with a rise in blood glucose. We assessed whether addition or substitution of a potassium-sparing diuretic, amiloride, to treatment with a thiazide can prevent glucose intolerance and improve blood pressure control.

Methods

We did a parallel-group, randomised, double-blind trial in 11 secondary and two primary care sites in the UK. Eligible patients were aged 18–80 years; had clinic systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher and home systolic blood pressure of 130 mmHg or higher on permitted background drugs of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, β blockers, calcium-channel blockers, or direct renin inhibitors (previously untreated patients were also eligible in specific circumstances); and had at least one component of the metabolic syndrome in addition to hypertension. Patients with known diabetes were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 24 weeks of daily oral treatment with starting doses of 10 mg amiloride, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide, or 5 mg amiloride plus 12·5 mg hydrochlorothiazide; all doses were doubled after 12 weeks. Random assignment was done via a central computer system. Both participants and investigators were masked to assignment. Our hierarchical primary endpoints, assessed on a modified intention-to-treat basis at 12 and 24 weeks, were the differences from baseline in blood glucose measured 2 h after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), compared first between the hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride groups, and then between the hydrochlorothiazide and combination groups. A key secondary endpoint was change in home systolic blood pressure at 12 and 24 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00797862, and the MHRA, Eudract number 2009–010068–41, and is now complete.

Findings

Between Nov 18, 2009, and Dec 15, 2014, 145 patients were randomly assigned to amiloride, 146 to hydrochlorothiazide, and 150 to the combination group. 132 participants in the amiloride group, 134 in the hydrochlorothiazide group, and 133 in the combination group were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. 2 h glucose concentrations after OGTT, averaged at 12 and 24 weeks, were significantly lower in the amiloride group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (mean difference -0·55 mmol/L [95% CI -0·96 to -0·14]; p = 0·0093) and in the combination group than in the hydrochlorothiazide group (-0·42 mmol/L [-0·84 to -0·004]; p = 0·048). The mean reduction in home systolic blood pressure during 24 weeks did not differ significantly between the amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide groups, but the fall in blood pressure in the combination group was significantly greater than that in the hydrochlorothiazide group (p = 0·0068). Hyperkalaemia was reported in seven (4·8%) patients in the amiloride group and three (2·3%) patients in the combination group; the highest recorded potassium concentration was 5·8 mmol/L in a patient in the amiloride group. 13 serious adverse events occurred but the frequency did not differ significantly between groups.

Interpretation

The combination of amiloride with hydrochlorothiazide, at doses equipotent on blood pressure, prevents glucose intolerance and improves control of blood pressure compared with montherapy with either drug. These findings, together with previous data about morbidity and mortality for the combination, support first-line use of amiloride plus hydrochlorothiazide in hypertensive patients who need treatment with a diuretic.

5.4 Impaired Renal Function

Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system and by diuretics. Patients whose renal function may depend in part on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g., patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing acute renal failure on Exforge HCT. Monitor renal function periodically in these patients. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function on Exforge HCT [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.5 Potassium Abnormalities

In the controlled trial of Exforge HCT in moderate to severe hypertensive patients, the incidence of hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) at any time post-baseline with the maximum dose of Exforge HCT (10/320/25 mg) was 10% compared to 25% with HCTZ/amlodipine (25/10 mg), 7% with valsartan/HCTZ (320/25 mg), and 3% with amlodipine/valsartan (10/320 mg). One patient (0.2%) discontinued therapy due to an adverse event of hypokalemia in each of the Exforge HCT and HCTZ/amlodipine groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) was 0.4% with Exforge HCT compared to 0.2% to 0.7% with the dual therapies.

Some patients with heart failure have developed increases in potassium on valsartan. These effects are usually minor and transient, and they are more likely to occur in patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Dosage reduction and/or discontinuation of the diuretic and/or valsartan may be required.

Hydrochlorothiazide can cause hypokalemia and hyponatremia. Hypomagnesemia can result in hypokalemia which appears difficult to treat despite potassium repletion. Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Monitor serum electrolytes periodically.

If hypokalemia is accompanied by clinical signs (e.g., muscular weakness, paresis, or ECG alterations), Exforge HCT should be discontinued. Correction of hypokalemia and any coexisting hypomagnesemia is recommended prior to the initiation of thiazides.

Dose Titration Guided by Clinical Effect

A patient whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled with either lisinopril or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy may be switched to lisinopril /HCTZ 10 /12.5 or lisinopril/HCTZ 20 /12.5, depending on current monotherapy dose. Further increases of either or both components should depend on clinical response with blood pressure measured at the interdosing interval to ensure that there is an adequate antihypertensive effect at that time. The hydrochlorothiazide dose should generally not be increased until 2 to 3 weeks have elapsed. After addition of the diuretic it may be possible to reduce the dose of lisinopril. Patients whose blood pressures are adequately controlled with 25 mg of daily hydrochlorothiazide, but who experience significant potassium loss with this regimen may achieve similar or greater blood-pressure control without electrolyte disturbance if they are switched to Lisinopril/HCTZ 10 /12.5.

In patients who are currently being treated with a diuretic, symptomatic hypotension occasionally may occur following the initial dose of lisinopril. The diuretic should, if possible, be discontinued for two to three days before beginning therapy with lisinopril to reduce the likelihood of hypotension (See WARNINGS). If the patient's blood pressure is not controlled with lisinopril alone, diuretic therapy may be resumed.

If the diuretic cannot be discontinued, an initial dose of 5 mg of lisinopril should be used under medical supervision for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions).

Concomitant administration of lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide with potassium supplements, potassium salt substitutes or potassium-sparing diuretics may lead to increases of serum potassium (See PRECAUTIONS).

Replacement Therapy

The combination may be substituted for the titrated individual components.

Use in Renal Impairment

Regimens of therapy with lisinopril/HCTZ need not take account of renal function as long as the patient's creatinine clearance is > 30 mL/min/1.7m2(serum creatinine roughly ≤ 3 mg/dL or 265 µmol/L). In patients with more severe renal impairment, loop diuretics are preferred to thiazides, so lisinopril/HCTZ is not recommended (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid Reactions During Membrane Exposure).
