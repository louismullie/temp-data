## Question

Valerian tea

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether valerian tea is effective and safe for insomnia, and how to counsel on its use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic plausibility and whether tea delivers active constituents. Then, I should appraise the clinical evidence base for efficacy, including meta-analyses and guidelines. Next, I will evaluate safety, including hepatotoxicity, withdrawal, and drug interactions. After that, I need to consider special populations and perioperative contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and outline safer, evidence-based alternatives with dosing and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic rationale and formulation issues. Valerian's sedative effects are typically attributed to valerenic acid and related constituents modulating GABAergic neurotransmission, but standardization varies widely across products, and teas are particularly heterogeneous in content and concentration, which complicates both efficacy and safety assessment [^b0d6c472] [^6b7f3802]. Wait, let me verify the tea-specific data: most clinical trials use capsules or extracts, not teas, and when teas are mentioned, dosing is often imprecise (for example, 2–3 g dried root steeped 10–15 minutes), so the active dose in a cup of valerian tea is uncertain and likely lower than studied extract doses, which undermines confidence in benefit from tea preparations [^6b7f3802].

> Next, I should review the efficacy evidence. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from single studies. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews show mixed results at best, with older summaries suggesting possible subjective sleep improvements but also evidence of publication bias, while more rigorous reviews conclude no consistent benefit on objective sleep parameters or validated insomnia scales, and contemporary guidelines consistently recommend against valerian for chronic insomnia due to lack of efficacy [^b0a0de59] [^45758ead] [^b1ddcccf] [^9c645a15]. I should double-check the magnitude of any claimed effects: one guideline summary estimates a small reduction in sleep latency of about 9 minutes without improvement in sleep quality, which is not clinically meaningful, reinforcing that routine use is not supported [^9eff8409].

> I will now examine safety. Initially, I thought valerian had no credible hepatotoxicity signals, but wait, I need to correct that. Although valerian is generally well tolerated in short-term use, there are case reports of serious adverse events including cardiac complications and delirium associated with withdrawal after prolonged high-dose use, and hepatotoxicity has been reported in the context of multi-ingredient products and susceptible patients, so I should not dismiss hepatic risk entirely, especially with uncertain product quality and prolonged exposure [^55d9a83e] [^ed5469b0]. I should confirm interaction potential: valerian can potentiate sedatives via GABAergic effects and has been flagged in perioperative safety reviews as a concern for additive sedation with anesthetics, so it warrants caution with CNS depressants and around procedures [^4baf755c] [^dbd96c48]. But wait, what about CYP interactions? A controlled phenotyping study did not show clinically meaningful CYP inhibition with valerian, which is reassuring, though this does not negate pharmacodynamic concerns with sedatives [^7fbbc0af].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In pregnancy and lactation, data are sparse and quality is low, so risk–benefit counseling should err conservative. In pediatrics, evidence is limited and guidelines emphasize caution with herbal sedatives. In older adults, polypharmacy and fall risk magnify concerns with sedatives, including valerian. And in perioperative settings, many guidelines advise stopping herbal sedatives like valerian 1–2 weeks before surgery due to potential potentiation of anesthetics and withdrawal phenomena, so I should explicitly counsel on this timing [^90b4dc14] [^dbd96c48] [^fc47f6b9]. I should also remember that product quality is inconsistent and some herbal supplements contain contaminants like lead, which is another reason to avoid unregulated teas when possible [^0536ee6e].

> Now, I should synthesize the risk–benefit balance. Given uncertain dosing in teas, inconsistent efficacy across trials, and nonzero safety concerns including withdrawal and potential hepatotoxicity in vulnerable patients, the balance does not favor routine use of valerian tea for insomnia, particularly when evidence-based alternatives exist. Guidelines from AASM, VA/DoD, and related bodies consistently recommend against valerian for chronic insomnia, which aligns with a cautious stance on valerian tea as well [^b1ddcccf] [^6bebe6eb] [^54aba089]. Hold on, I should verify whether any niche indication changes this: even in menopausal sleep disturbance, where some guidelines mention valerian as a consideration, the evidence remains limited and inconsistent, so shared decision-making should emphasize uncertainty and the availability of better-supported options [^d4882559] [^951348cb].

> Next, I should review safer, evidence-based alternatives and dosing. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is first-line and has durable benefits. For pharmacologic options, short-term use of agents like eszopiclone or zolpidem can be considered in selected adults, with careful attention to risks. Melatonin has modest effects on sleep onset and is reasonable for some, though guidelines increasingly suggest against routine melatonin for chronic insomnia due to small benefits and variability. If a patient insists on trying valerian, I should recommend a standardized extract capsule in the 300–600 mg range taken 30–120 minutes before bedtime, rather than tea, to approximate studied doses and reduce variability, while monitoring for sedation, GI upset, and drug interactions, and avoiding use with other sedatives or before surgery [^b1ddcccf] [^9eff8409] [^6b7f3802] [^fc47f6b9]. I need to ensure we also address sleep hygiene, stimulus control, and comorbidities like pain, anxiety, and medications that impair sleep, because these often drive symptoms more than any herbal tea could correct [^notfound].

> Finally, I should translate this into practical counseling. I would explain that valerian tea may taste pleasant and feel relaxing, but the amount of active constituents is unpredictable, high-quality evidence for benefit is weak, and there are real safety concerns with long-term or high-dose use, especially around procedures and when combined with sedatives. I would document any use, review all medications and supplements, and set a plan to taper and stop valerian if it is not clearly helping within a few weeks. If the patient is already using valerian tea and benefiting without adverse effects, I would not abruptly discontinue, but I would pivot toward standardized extracts if continued, and I would coordinate perioperative holds if surgery is planned [^4baf755c] [^fc47f6b9] [^6b7f3802]. Hold on, I should verify one more thing: I initially thought teas might be safer because they are "just tea", but given contamination risks and dose uncertainty, that assumption is too simplistic, so I should reinforce choosing reputable, standardized products and discussing all CAM use openly to mitigate harm [^0536ee6e] [^87a4a4bf].

Valerian tea is **unlikely to help sleep** because clinical trials show minimal or no benefit for insomnia, and major guidelines advise against its use for chronic insomnia [^b1ddcccf] [^6bebe6eb]. It is **generally safe** in the short term, with mild effects such as dizziness or GI upset, but rare liver injury and withdrawal symptoms have been reported, so caution is warranted with long-term use or in patients with liver disease [^ed5469b0] [^55d9a83e]. Valerian tea is not recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, children, or those taking sedatives or CNS depressants. If used, limit to 2–4 weeks and monitor for adverse effects; **CBT-I remains first-line** for persistent insomnia [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacological properties relevant to sleep

Valerian root contains **valerenic acid**, **valepotriates**, and **essential oils** that are thought to modulate GABA signaling and exert sedative effects, though human data are inconsistent [^b0d6c472] [^82445d9d]. These constituents vary with preparation, and teas are less standardized than extracts, which limits predictability of effect [^6b7f3802].

---

## Clinical evidence for efficacy in sleep disorders

- **Systematic reviews and meta-analyses**: Evidence for valerian in insomnia is mixed, with small studies showing modest subjective improvements but no consistent benefit on objective measures; publication bias is likely [^b0a0de59] [^45758ead].

- **Guideline recommendations**: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and VA/DoD recommend against valerian for chronic insomnia due to limited efficacy and variable quality of evidence [^b1ddcccf] [^6bebe6eb].

- **Specific populations**: A randomized trial in postmenopausal women suggested improved sleep quality with 530 mg valerian extract twice daily, but larger confirmatory studies are needed [^d48a90f3].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Mild GI upset, dizziness, headache, and drowsiness are most frequent and usually self-limited.

- **Rare adverse effects**: Isolated cases of liver injury and withdrawal symptoms (delirium, cardiac complications) have been reported, particularly with prolonged high-dose use [^ed5469b0] [^55d9a83e].

- **Drug interactions**: Valerian may potentiate sedatives, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol; caution is advised with CNS depressants [^4baf755c] [^dbd96c48].

---

## Special populations and precautions

- **Pregnancy and lactation**: Safety is unknown; avoid use.

- **Children and adolescents**: Limited data; avoid routine use.

- **Liver disease**: Use with caution due to rare hepatotoxicity reports.

- **Perioperative use**: Discontinue at least 2 weeks before surgery to avoid interactions with anesthesia [^fc47f6b9].

---

## Recommended dosage and preparation

There is **no established tea dose**; trials typically use 300–600 mg standardized extract 30–120 minutes before bedtime. For tea, 2–3 g dried root steeped 10–15 minutes is sometimes suggested, but potency varies and clinical support is limited [^6b7f3802].

---

## Comparison with other herbal sleep aids

| **Attribute** | **Valerian** | **Chamomile** | **Melatonin** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | Mixed; limited | Minimal evidence | Modest benefit for sleep onset |
| Safety | Generally safe; rare liver effects | Generally safe; rare allergies | Generally safe; vivid dreams, drowsiness |
| Guideline stance | Not recommended | Not recommended | Not recommended for chronic insomnia |

---

## Regulatory considerations and quality control

Valerian is sold as a dietary supplement in the US, with **no FDA approval** for insomnia. Product quality varies, and some supplements contain contaminants; choose reputable brands with third-party testing [^0536ee6e].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Short-term use**: If tried, limit to 2–4 weeks and monitor for adverse effects.

- **Avoid in high-risk groups**: Pregnant/lactating women, children, those with liver disease, or anyone taking sedatives.

- **Prefer standardized extracts**: Over teas due to dose consistency and quality control.

- **First-line therapy**: Use CBT-I for chronic insomnia; valerian is not a substitute [^notfound].

---

Valerian tea has **limited evidence** for sleep benefit and is not recommended for chronic insomnia. It is **generally safe** short term, but rare liver and withdrawal effects can occur. Use cautiously, avoid in high-risk groups, and prioritize evidence-based therapies like CBT-I.

## References

### Valerian [^de4760c7]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Valerian is a traditional herbal sleep remedy that has been studied with a variety of methodologic designs using multiple dosages and preparations. Research has focused on subjective evaluations of sleep patterns, particularly sleep latency, and study populations have primarily consisted of self-described poor sleepers. Valerian improves subjective experiences of sleep when taken nightly over one- to two-week periods, and it appears to be a safe sedative/hypnotic choice in patients with mild to moderate insomnia. The evidence for single-dose effect is contradictory. Valerian is also used in patients with mild anxiety, but the data supporting this indication are limited. Although the adverse effect profile and tolerability of this herb are excellent, long-term safety studies are lacking.

### Valerian for sleep: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b0a0de59]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Insomnia affects approximately one-third of the adult population and contributes to increased rates of absenteeism, health care use, and social disability. Extracts of the roots of valerian (Valeriana officinalis) are widely used for inducing sleep and improving sleep quality. A systematic review of randomized, placebo-controlled trials of valerian for improving sleep quality is presented. An extensive literature search identified 16 eligible studies examining a total of 1093 patients. Most studies had significant methodologic problems, and the valerian doses, preparations, and length of treatment varied considerably. A dichotomous outcome of sleep quality (improved or not) was reported by 6 studies and showed a statistically significant benefit (relative risk of improved sleep = 1.8, 95% confidence interval, 1.2–2.9), but there was evidence of publication bias in this summary measure. The available evidence suggests that valerian might improve sleep quality without producing side effects. Future studies should assess a range of doses of standardized preparations of valerian and include standard measures of sleep quality and safety.

### Use of complementary and alternative medicine by older adults – a cross-sectional survey [^9be88aaa]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Germany has a very long tradition of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Many older adults have lifelong experience with herbal medicine and other home remedies due to unavailable conventional care during their childhood. CAM therapies are often used as self-care to enhance wellbeing, to prevent and to cure illnesses. However, the use of CAM by older adults in Germany has not been investigated extensively. In particular, data from older adults under legal guardianship or requiring nursing care are missing, largely, because these groups are hard to reach by conventional survey techniques such as questionnaires and telephone surveys, and health status may preclude responding. Previous studies exploring CAM use in Germany only investigated clients of one private health insurance company, excluded person of 70 or 80 years and older, or have not been evaluated specifically for the older adults, despite a high, and rising, rate of CAM users among this group (respondents of at least 60 years: 61% in 1970, 73% in 2010).

Polypharmacy is also a problem in the geriatric care in Germany and poses a risk for side effects and drug interactions. While seniors at the age of 60 years take 2–3 prescribed medications daily, the number increases among those over 80 years to more than 4–5 drugs per day. Self acquired additional drugs such as herbal medicines or vitamins are not recorded in the statistics of the statutory health insurance because they are not covered. Many herbal drugs and products interactions and side effects are well known, e.g. (i.e. Ginkgo biloba, Valeriana officinalis, St. John's wort, and grapefruit juice.

Therefore we investigated the use of CAM and other health promoting substances (e.g. herbal teas) by older adults of at least 70 years, taking care to include under-researched areas such as rural areas or nursing homes.

Our survey solicited information regarding which form(s) of CAM is used and how its use is subjectively assessed, as well as medical context information. We asked for all natural products, drugs and therapies that were taken for treatment or prevention of diseases, this included not only drugs but also medically applied herbal teas and juices. To get the best possible representation of real-life conditions, we included older adults living with a variety of needs for care, living in either a metropolitan or a rural area, and with or without a legal guardian.

### A systematic review of valerian as a sleep aid: safe but not effective [^45758ead]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Valerian is an herb that is widely available in a variety of commercial preparations and is commonly used as a sleep aid. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of valerian concluded that evidence in support of the effectiveness of the herb was inconclusive. Therefore, in an effort to more closely examine this issue, a systematic review was conducted to examine the evidence on the efficacy of valerian as a sleep aid with specific attention to the type of preparations tested and the characteristics of the subjects studied. A comprehensive search of studies investigating valerian was conducted through computerized databases and hand searches of reference lists. Standardized forms were used to summarize findings and standardized criteria were used to assess study quality. Out of 592 articles initially identified, a total of 36 articles describing 37 separate studies met criteria for review: 29 controlled trials evaluated for both efficacy and safety, and eight open-label trials evaluated for safety only. Most studies found no significant differences between valerian and placebo either in healthy individuals or in persons with general sleep disturbance or insomnia. None of the most recent studies, which were also the most methodologically rigorous, found significant effects of valerian on sleep. Overall, the evidence, while supporting that valerian is a safe herb associated with only rare adverse events, does not support the clinical efficacy of valerian as a sleep aid for insomnia.

### Common herbal dietary supplement-drug interactions [^87a4a4bf]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Nearly 25% of U.S. adults report concurrently taking a prescription medication with a dietary supplement. Some supplements, such as St. John's wort and goldenseal, are known to cause clinically important drug interactions and should be avoided by most patients receiving any pharmacologic therapy. However, many other supplements are predicted to cause interactions based only on in vitro studies that have not been confirmed or have been refuted in human clinical trials. Some supplements may cause interactions with a few medications but are likely to be safe with other medications (e.g., curcumin, echinacea, garlic, Asian ginseng, green tea extract, kava kava). Some supplements have a low likelihood of drug interactions and, with certain caveats, can safely be taken with most medications (e.g., black cohosh, cranberry, ginkgo, milk thistle, American ginseng, saw palmetto, valerian). Clinicians should consult reliable dietary supplement resources, or clinical pharmacists or pharmacologists, to help assess the safety of specific herbal supplement-drug combinations. Because most patients do not disclose supplement use to clinicians, the most important strategy for detecting herb-drug interactions is to develop a trusting relationship that encourages patients to discuss their dietary supplement use.

### Herbal and non-herbal dietary supplements for psychiatric indications: considerations in liver transplantation [^ed5469b0]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) modalities are widely employed. However, TCIM, specifically herbal and non-herbal dietary supplements, can pose challenges in the context of organ transplantation. In this review, we discuss common supplements used for psychiatric purposes and highlight important considerations for candidates and recipients of liver transplants.

Recent Findings

Ashwagandha, kava kava, green tea extract, skullcap, turmeric, and valerian have known idiosyncratic hepatotoxic potential and may complicate the liver transplantation course. Multiple supplements reportedly carry a lower risk of hepatotoxicity, though evidence for widespread use in those at risk for or with hepatic impairment is limited. Psychiatrists caring for candidates and recipients of liver transplants must recognize that patients may find supplements helpful in alleviating psychiatric symptoms, despite an overall limited evidence base. Evaluating benefit versus risk ratios and reviewing drug-drug interactions is essential to promote transplant candidacy and mitigate the possibility of native or graft liver dysfunction.

### Herbal medicine for insomnia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^556402a2]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder that can profoundly impact a person's health and wellbeing. Herbal medicine represents one of the most frequently used complementary and alternative treatments of insomnia. However, the safety and efficacy of herbal medicine for the treatment of this disorder is currently uncertain. In order to ascertain the evidence base for herbal medicine for insomnia, we systematically searched seventeen electronic databases and the reference lists of included studies for relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Fourteen RCTs, involving a total of 1602 participants with insomnia, met the inclusion criteria. Four distinct orally administered herbal monopreparations were identified (i.e., valerian, chamomile, kava and wuling). There was no statistically significant difference between any herbal medicine and placebo, or any herbal medicine and active control, for any of the thirteen measures of clinical efficacy. As for safety, a similar or smaller number of adverse events per person were reported with kava, chamomile and wuling when compared with placebo. By contrast, a greater number of events per person were reported with valerian. While there is insufficient evidence to support the use of herbal medicine for insomnia, there is a clear need for further research in this area.

### Internet marketing of herbal products [^8be5373c]. JAMA (2003). Excellent credibility.

Context

Passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in 1994 restricted the Food and Drug Administration's control over dietary supplements, leading to enormous growth in their promotion. The Internet is often used by consumers as a source of information on such therapies.

Objective

To assess the information presented and indications claimed on the Internet for the 8 best-selling herbal products.

Data Sources

We searched the Internet using the 5 most commonly used search engines. For each, we entered the names of the 8 most widely used herbal supplements (ginkgo biloba, St John's wort, echinacea, ginseng, garlic, saw palmetto, kava kava, and valerian root). We analyzed the health content of all Web sites listed on the first page of the search results.

Study Selection

We analyzed all accessible, English-language Web sites that pertained to oral herbal supplements. A total of 522 Web sites were identified; of these, 443 sites met inclusion criteria for the analysis.

Data Extraction

The nature of the Web site (retail or nonretail), whether it was a sponsored link, and all references, indications, claims, and disclaimers were recorded. Two reviewers independently categorized medical claims as disease or nondisease according to Food and Drug Administration criteria.

Data Synthesis

Among 443 Web sites, 338 (76%) were retail sites either selling product or directly linked to a vendor. A total of 273 (81%) of the 338 retail Web sites made 1 or more health claims; of these, 149 (55%) claimed to treat, prevent, diagnose, or cure specific diseases. More than half (153/292; 52%) of sites with a health claim omitted the standard federal disclaimer. Nonretail sites were more likely than retail sites to include literature references, although only 52 (12%) of the 443 Web sites provided referenced information without a link to a distributor or vendor.

Conclusions

Consumers may be misled by vendors' claims that herbal products can treat, prevent, diagnose, or cure specific diseases, despite regulations prohibiting such statements. Physicians should be aware of this widespread and easily accessible information. More effective regulation is required to put this class of therapeutics on the same evidence-based footing as other medicinal products.

### Effect of valerian on sleep quality in postmenopausal women: a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial [^d48a90f3]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Sleep disturbances reduce the quality of life. About 50% of postmenopausal women experience sleep disturbances such as insomnia. Complementary and alternative medical therapies may be useful for the management of sleep disturbances among postmenopausal women. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of valerian extract taken nightly on the improvement of sleep quality in postmenopausal women experiencing insomnia.

Methods

A randomized, triple-blind, controlled trial design was used for this study. Participants consisted of 100 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 60 years who were experiencing insomnia. A demographic data form and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to collect data. The women were randomly divided into two groups. Each group received either 530 mg of concentrated valerian extract or a placebo twice a day for 4 weeks. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze the data.

Results

A statistically significant change was reported in the quality of sleep of the intervention group in comparison with the placebo group (P < 0.001). Also, 30% of the participants in the intervention group and 4% in the placebo group showed an improvement in the quality of sleep (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Valerian improves the quality of sleep in women with menopause who are experiencing insomnia. Findings from this study add support to the reported effectiveness of valerian in the clinical management of insomnia.

### Valerian for anxiety disorders [^7834893b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Anxiety disorders are very common mental health problems in the general population and in primary care settings. Herbal medicines are popular and used worldwide and might be considered as a treatment option for anxiety if shown to be effective and safe.

Objectives

To investigate the effectiveness and safety of valerian for treating anxiety disorders.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches: The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) searched on 04/08/2006, MEDLINE, Lilacs. References of all identified studies were inspected for additional studies. First authors of each included study, manufacturers of valerian products, and experts in the field were contacted for information regarding unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials of valerian extract of any dose, regime, or method of administration, for people with any primary diagnosis of general anxiety disorder, anxiety neurosis, chronic anxiety status, or any other disorder in which anxiety is the primary symptom (panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, agoraphobia, other types of phobia, postraumatic stress disorder). Effectiveness was measured using clinical outcome measures and other scales for anxiety symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently applied inclusion criteria, extracted and entered data, and performed the trial quality assessments. Where disagreements occurred, the third review author was consulted. Methodological quality of included trials was assessed using Cochrane Handbook criteria. For dichotomous outcomes, relative risk (RR) was calculated, and for continuous outcomes, the weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated, with their respective 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

One RCT involving 36 patients wih generalised anxiety disorder was eligible for inclusion. This was a 4 week pilot study of valerian, diazepam and placebo. There were no significant differences between the valerian and placebo groups in HAM-A total scores, or in somatic and psychic factor scores. Similarly, there were no significant differences in HAM-A scores between the valerian and diazepam groups, although based on STAI-Trait scores, significantly greater symptom improvement was indicated in the diazepam group. There were no significant differences between the three groups in the number of patients reporting side effects or in dropout rates.

Authors' Conclusions

Since only one small study is currently available, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the efficacy or safety of valerian compared with placebo or diazepam for anxiety disorders. RCTs involving larger samples and comparing valerian with placebo or other interventions used to treat of anxiety disorders, such as antidepressants, are needed.

### Botanical dietary supplement use in peri-and postmenopausal women [^43f14bb7]. Menopause (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine use of botanical dietary supplements (BDS) in women between the ages of 40 and 60 years at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) clinics, including information about commonly used BDS, the reason for use, information resources used, and the overall perception of safety and efficacy of BDS.

Design

Five hundred female outpatients at UIC clinics were interviewed by healthcare practitioners using a botanical/drug history questionnaire. Respondents were 46.8% African American, 39.6% Caucasian, 11.7% Hispanic, and 1.5% Asian, with a mean age of 50.34 years.

Results

BDS were used by 79% of respondents (= 395), of which 36.5% used BDS daily. Of the positive respondents, 51.7% used one or two BDS, whereas 48.4% used three or more. Commonly used botanicals included soy (42%), green tea (34.68%), chamomile (20.76%), gingko (20.51%), ginseng (17.97%), Echinacea (15.44%), and St. John's wort (7.34%). Black cohosh, garlic, red clover, kava, valerian, evening primrose, and ephedra were used by less than 15% of respondents. Efficacy ratings were high for BDS, and 68% claimed to have no side effects. Only 3% of respondents obtained BDS information from healthcare professionals, and 70% of respondents were not informing their physician of BDS use.

Conclusions

A high percentage of women at UIC clinics were using multiple BDS. The respondents believed that these products were both safe and effective for the treatment of common ailments. Concomitant BDS use with prescription and over-the-counter medications was commonplace, often without a physician's knowledge. Consumer education about the possible benefits and risks associated with BDS use is urgently needed.

### Herbal and dietary supplements for treatment of anxiety disorders [^29ced651]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Use of complementary and alternative medicine has increased over the past decade. A variety of studies have suggested that this use is greater in persons with symptoms or diagnoses of anxiety and depression. Data support the effectiveness of some popular herbal remedies and dietary supplements; in some of these products, particularly kava, the potential for benefit seems greater than that for harm with short-term use in patients with mild to moderate anxiety. Inositol has been found to have modest effects in patients with panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Physicians should not encourage the use of St. John's wort, valerian, Sympathyl, or passionflower for the treatment of anxiety based on small or inconsistent effects in small studies. Although the evidence varies depending on the supplement and the anxiety disorder, physicians can collaborate with patients in developing dietary supplement strategies that minimize risks and maximize benefits.

### Effect of valerian on cognitive disorders and electroencephalography in hemodialysis patients: a randomized, cross over, double-blind clinical trial [^7f68cf14]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Result

The mean ± SD of patients age was 66.4 ± 14 years in group A and 65.6 ± 12.4 years in group B; the difference was not significant (P = 0.857). Minimum and maximum ages were respectively 35 and 88 years in group A and 41 and 86 years in group B. Females consisted of 52.6% of patients in group A and 45.0% of patients in group B; the difference was not significant (P = 0.634). The mean BMI was 23.6 ± 3.3 kg/m 2 in group A and 23 ± 3.1 kg/m 2 in group B; the difference was not significant (P = 0.549). None of the patients in both groups was obese (BMI ≥ 30). All patients in both groups were married, 31.6% in group A and 35% of patients in group B were illiterate. Distribution of patients' literacy level was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.588). The level of income was low in 21.1% of patients in group A and 30.0% of patients in group B. Distribution of income between the two groups were not significantly different (P = 0.513). None of the patients in group A was smoker and only 1 patient (5%) in group B was smoking; the difference was not significant (P = 1.00). Diabetes mellitus was the most common cause of dialysis in both groups; the difference was not significant (P = 0.618). In this respect, 26.3% of the patients in group A and 25% of them in group B had heart disease and the difference was not significant (p = 0.925). Moreover, 68.4% of the individuals in group A and 45.0% of them in group B suffered from restless leg syndrome (RLS) although the difference was not significant (p = 0.140). In terms of taking tea, distribution of cups consumed was not significantly different between the two groups (P = 0.857) (Table 1). As well, 68.4% of the patients in group A and 75% of them in group B had a history of hemodialysis of less than 5 years. The mean ± SD of the duration of dialysis in group A patients was also equal to 3.42 ± 2.75 years and they were 3.55 ± 2.96 years in group B patients. The duration of hemodialysis in both groups was not significant (p = 0.945). Duration of hemodialysis in each dialysis session was 4 h in all patients in both groups. In this regard, 26.3% of the patients in group A and 30.0% of them in group B had vascular fistula although the difference was not significant (p = 0.998). Other patients in both groups were also undergoing hemodialysis with long-term hemodialysis catheter (permcath). None of the patients in group A had a history of lung disease and 10% (n = 2) of patients in group B had a history of lung disease; the difference was not significant (P = 0.487). None of the patients had a history of gastrointestinal disease groups. Moreover, 52.6% (n = 10) of patients in group A and 35% (n = 7) of patients in group B were taking hypnotic drugs; the difference was not significant (P = 0.267). Anti-anxiety and anti-depression drugs were not reported in any of the patients in both groups.

### Effect of valerian on cognitive disorders and electroencephalography in hemodialysis patients: a randomized, cross over, double-blind clinical trial [^b2cee9c1]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The present findings demonstrated that valerian was effective as a safe herbal remedy in reducing the cognitive disorders. Regarding the high prevalence of cognitive disorders in hemodialysis patients, the use of valerian for treatment of these disorders may be considered. Additionally, the cognitive function should be investigated in all periodic examinations in these patients in order to provide early diagnosis of the cognitive disorders.

### The peri-operative implications of herbal medicines [^fc47f6b9]. Anaesthesia (2002). Low credibility.

An increasing number of patients are taking herbal medicines such as echinacea, garlic, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, St John's Wort, valerian, ephedra, kava, grapefruit juice and ginger. Although these herbal medications are considered 'natural' products that may have some benefits, adverse effects such as increased bleeding tendencies and drug interactions are associated with their use. Surgeons and anaesthetists may be unaware of their patients' use of these medications because it is common for patients not to disclose their use of this form of medication, and both surgeons and anaesthetists often fail to enquire about their use. Anaesthetists and surgeons must be familiar with the effects of herbal medicines and should specifically enquire about the use of herbal medicines during pre-operative assessment. Currently available data suggest that all herbal medicines should be ceased 2 weeks before surgery.

### Herbs commonly used by women: an evidence-based review [^34b36be8]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the evidence of herbs commonly used by women.

Data Sources

Articles were located by searching Medline, Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, and the Combined Health Information Database and by hand searching the reference lists of recent systematic reviews. The databases were searched in January 2000 and October 2000 by using the Latin and common name of each herb.

Methods Of Study Selection

Preference was given to randomized, placebo-controlled trials. When available, English language studies were reviewed. If not, data are presented from review articles that summarize the foreign study.

Results

Many women use herbal therapies. In the United States, herbs are considered dietary supplements. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cannot remove them from the market unless they are proven unsafe. The herb industry plans to improve monitoring. Many prospective randomized controlled trials are being funded. Gingko biloba seems to slow the progression of dementia but increases the risk of bleeding. St John's Wort is efficacious for treating mild to moderate depression but has many drug interactions. Ginseng seems to improve well being in perimenopausal women, but it is often impure and has side effects and drug interactions. Garlic slightly lowers blood pressure and lipids. Echinacea slightly decreases the duration of colds but does not prevent them. Valerian is beneficial for insomnia, but there is no long-term safety data. Black cohosh may help the symptoms of perimenopause, and chasteberry may improve premenstrual syndrome. More study is needed on both herbs.

Conclusion

Some herbs are medically useful, but the American public would benefit from increased regulation. Manufacturers should be able to ensure that herbs contain pure ingredients. Side effects and drug interactions should be listed. Well-designed studies are being conducted. The results will be helpful to physicians and patients when the clinical evidence becomes available.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^08af1499]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic insomnia — valerian (systematic review): One systematic review reviewed 60 RCTs evaluating valerian supplements and included 5 RCTs of valerian (V. officinalis) as a single herb for insomnia over 2 to 4 weeks (n = 966). The studies reviewed did not evaluate objective sleep measures such as total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), or sleep efficiency (SE), and there were mixed results for subjective sleep benefits based on the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) with some studies showing benefit and others showing no difference. Reported side effects included agitation, restlessness, dyspepsia, dizziness, vivid dreams, headaches, and diarrhea, and the quality of evidence was rated as very low due to inconsistency in the data with variable size and direction effects.

### Effects of valerian on the severity and systemic manifestations of dysmenorrhea [^5f625f8b]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of valerian-a herb with sedative effects and antispasmodic effects on smooth muscles-on the severity of dysmenorrhea.

Methods

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 100 students were randomly assigned to receive valerian (n = 49) or placebo (n = 51). Valerian (dose 255 mg) was given 3 times daily for 3 days beginning at the onset of menstruation, for 2 consecutive menstrual cycles. At baseline and during the intervention cycles, the pain severity was evaluated with a visual analog scale and the systemic manifestations were assessed using a multidimensional verbal scale.

Results

The pain severity at baseline did not differ significantly between the groups. After the intervention, the pain severity was significantly reduced in both groups (P < 0.001), but the extent of the reduction was larger in the valerian group, with the difference between the 2 groups being statistically significant (P < 0.05). The total scores of the systemic manifestations associated with dysmenorrhea decreased after the intervention, but there was no significant difference between the groups, with the exception for syncope (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

Valerian seems to be an effective treatment for dysmenorrhea, probably because of its antispasmodic effects.

### Herbal medicines and perioperative care [^4baf755c]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Widespread use of herbal medications among the presurgical population may have a negative impact on perioperative patient care.

Objectives

To review the literature on commonly used herbal medications in the context of the perioperative period and provide rational strategies for managing their preoperative use.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE and Cochrane Collaboration databases were searched for articles published between January 1966 and December 2000 using the search terms herbal medicine, phytotherapy, and alternative medicine and the names of the 16 most commonly used herbal medications. Additional data sources were obtained from manual searches of recent journal articles and textbooks.

Study Selection

We selected studies, case reports, and reviews addressing the safety and pharmacology of 8 commonly used herbal medications for which safety information pertinent to the perioperative period was available.

Data Extraction

We extracted safety, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic information from the selected literature and reached consensus about any discrepancies.

Data Synthesis

Echinacea, ephedra, garlic, ginkgo, ginseng, kava, St John's wort, and valerian are commonly used herbal medications that may pose a concern during the perioperative period. Complications can arise from these herbs' direct and pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic effects. Direct effects include bleeding from garlic, ginkgo, and ginseng; cardiovascular instability from ephedra; and hypoglycemia from ginseng. Pharmacodynamic herb-drug interactions include potentiation of the sedative effect of anesthetics by kava and valerian. Pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions include increased metabolism of many drugs used in the perioperative period by St John's wort.

Conclusions

During the preoperative evaluation, physicians should explicitly elicit and document a history of herbal medication use. Physicians should be familiar with the potential perioperative effects of the commonly used herbal medications to prevent, recognize, and treat potentially serious problems associated with their use and discontinuation.

### Herbal medicines in pediatric neuropsychiatry [^992552ab]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

An increasing number of studies have evaluated the role of herbal supplements in pediatric disorders, but they have numerous limitations. This review provides an overview of herbal components, regulation of supplements, and importance of product quality assurance. Use of herbal supplements is discussed with reference to factors that influence use in the pediatric population. The remainder of the article discusses the use of St John's wort, melatonin, kava, valerian, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid, focusing on indications, adverse effects, and drug interactions, and providing a limited efficacy review. Herbal supplements used for weight loss are also briefly discussed.

### The chronic effects of a combination of herbal extracts (euphytose) on psychological mood state and response to a laboratory stressor: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind study in healthy humans [^b0d6c472]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Herbal approaches to reduce anxiety may be as effective as pharmacological treatments and are less likely to be associated with adverse side effects. Several herbal species including Valeriana officinalis (valerian), Passiflora incarnata L. (passionflower) and Ballota nigra L. (ballota) have a long history of use as anxiolytics in traditional medicine, further supported by recent pre-clinical and clinical trials. For example, in vitro studies suggest that certain constituents of valerian can bind to and influence the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A sites, the same sites influenced by benzodiazepines commonly used as prescribed anxiolytics. Valerian extract has also been found to influence the transport of GABA itself. While modulation of GABA receptors is thought to be one of the leading mechanisms of action of the plant, the extract has also demonstrated partial agonist activity at serotonin receptors as well as adenosine A 1 receptor signalling. In vivo, valerian has potent anxiolytic effects in rodents, with those administered valerian root extract showing significantly lower levels of anxiety than those administered a control substance. Valerian, in combination with Melissa officinalis (lemon balm), led to significantly lower levels of anxiety during laboratory-induced stress in humans. Here, individuals given a 600-mg dose reported significantly lower levels of anxiety than those given placebo or a higher 1800 mg dose. A similar dose in isolation (530 mg) significantly reduced state anxiety (as measure by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)) following 1 month's supplementation in haemodialysis patients. Anxiolytic effects have also been demonstrated following lower doses. Individuals administered with a 100-mg dose of valerian within a clinical setting, reported feeling subjectively calmer and less anxious compared to controls when receiving dental surgery. Similarly, 100 mg of valerian provided comfort and relaxation (in the absence of sedating effects) during molar extraction in anxious patients. Valerian has also led to increases in frontal alpha activity as measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) following a 300-mg daily dose for 1 month, a finding correlated with anxiolysis.

### Effect of valerian on cognitive disorders and electroencephalography in hemodialysis patients: a randomized, cross over, double-blind clinical trial [^82445d9d]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Complementary medicine has attracted further attentions among the various approaches to heal cognitive disorders. The name valerian, Valeriana officinalis, comes from the Latin word valere, meaning to be strong or healthy. Valerian contains 150 to 200 different substances, including volatile oils, ketones, and phenols, iridoid esters such as valreotriate, valric acid, alkaloids, and amino acids like aminobutric acid, tyrosine, arginine, glutamine and noncyclic, monocyclic and bicyclic hydrocarbons. This herbaceous perennial plant with short rhizomes creates underground creeping stem and is widely found in temperate regions of Asia, Europe and North America, and has beneficial properties for the heart, brain and stomach.

Valerian extract as an agonist of adenosine A1 receptors inhibits cholinergic transmission, increases the frequency strength of delta, theta and alpha waves in the frontal cortex and has sedative-like effects. Valerian has been considered as a sedative in Europe and then the United States since the 16th and 17th centuries and has been a part of the pharmacopoeia in Europe and America. The American Herbal Products Association (AHPA) categorized Valerian as Class I in terms of health and safety, and the US Food and Drug Administration has allowed its entry in food. Valerenic acid, as a sesquiterpenoid, is considered among the major secondary bioactive metabolites of Valeriana officinalis L. Until now, the number of in vivo studies on the absorption, bioavailability, disposition, and metabolism of Valerenic acid has been limited. Pharmacokinetics of Valerenic acid in rats after oral treatment has been also described by a two-compartment model with a clearance (CL/F) of 2–5 L/h/kg and a volume of distribution of 17–20 L/kg. The extent of the absorption after oral administration has been similarly estimated to be 33.70% with a half-life of 2.7–5 h. According to a study on valerian, different doses of this medication could cause no increase in blood urine nitrogen and creatinine (compared to sham group). Therefore, the extract of this herb was not likely to have toxic effects on rat kidneys.

### Green tea: potential health benefits [^f37b3942]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Green tea has been used widely and in high doses for centuries as a health tonic in many societies. Evidence suggests that green tea is effective for treating genital warts. There is some supportive evidence for the use of green tea in cancer prevention. Drinking green tea is associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality, but not in cancer-related mortality. Small clinical studies have found that green tea may also be helpful in losing and managing weight, and lowering cholesterol. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that green tea may prevent stroke and cardiovascular disease. Green tea appears to be safe, although there have been case reports of hepatotoxicity possibly related to a specific extract in pill or beverage form. Green tea seems to be a low-risk complementary therapy for a number of conditions, but more studies are needed.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of chronic insomnia disorder and obstructive sleep apnea [^b7643877]. VA/DoD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic insomnia — herbal supplements (chamomile, melatonin, passionflower, saffron, valerian): The Work Group systematically reviewed evidence and reported that these supplements did not show improvement in insomnia outcomes, are associated with side effects, and can delay appropriate insomnia treatment; the harms slightly outweighed the benefits and the Work Group decided on a Weak against recommendation. The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low, and the recommendation was categorized as Reviewed, Amended with no new evidence regarding chamomile, with limitations including small sample size, risk of bias, imprecision of data, and indirectness of data. Additional considerations noted that herbal supplements are not FDA regulated, there are concerns about purity and composition, costs can vary from cheap to expensive which can place an additional financial burden, melatonin has been associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, vivid dreams, and nightmares, and valerian has also been associated with liver toxicity; given these supplements were not shown to improve insomnia, choosing them over proven treatments could be detrimental to the patient.

### Medicinal plants for insomnia: a review of their pharmacology, efficacy and tolerability [^f1e84a50]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2005). Low credibility.

A number of medicinal plants are traditionally endowed with anxiolytic or sedative properties and, in the context of this revue, both indications are considered since the former may induce a mood conducive to the latter. For any sleep-inducing drug to be effective, a tranquil ambience needs to be established a priori. Thus, physical ailments (i.e. pain), factors interfering with sleep (i.e. noise), psychological conditions causing stress, psychiatric illnesses (i.e. depression) and other drugs that interfere with sleep (i.e. caffeine) need to be controlled, if possible. Kava-kava is a well-established hypnotic drug, with a rapid onset of effect, adequate duration of action and minimal morning after-effects. However, reports of serious hepatotoxicity with this preparation have led to it being banned in most countries worldwide. On the other hand, side-effects with valerian would appear to be bland indeed. However, it's slow onset of effect (2–3 weeks) renders it unsuitable for short-term use (i.e. 'jet-lag'), but it does have profound beneficial effects on sleep architecture (augments deep sleep) that may make it particularly suitable for long-term use and for the elderly. In a personal trial (not double-blind) in stress-induced insomnia, both kava and valerian improved sleep and the ill-effects of stress, and the combination of the two was even more effective for the control of insomnia. Aromatherapy (lavender, chamomile, Ylang-Ylang) would appear to improve sleep, but how practical a form of treatment this may be remains to be determined. The only other plant drug that may have some effect on sleep is melissa, but reports are too scanty to form any opinion about this. Based on animal experiments, passion flower (passiflora) may have a sedative action, but the sedative action of hops has not been investigated in any detail. In conclusion, there is a need for longer-term controlled studies with some of these compounds (particularly valerian). Aromatherapy constitutes a tantalising possibility. In the interpretation of this review, it should be borne in mind that the evidence on which it is based is often incomplete or missing, but that is all that is available. Consequently some conjecture on the part of the author is inevitable and should be appreciated as such.

### Oral nonprescription treatment for insomnia: an evaluation of products with limited evidence [^dd49f480]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the level of evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of nonprescription therapies used for insomnia.

Reviewers

Members of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine's Clinical Practice Review Committee.

Methods

A search of the World Wide Web was conducted using the terms insomnia, herbal remedies, and alternative treatments to develop a list of therapies. Therapies in this review include passionflower, valerian, Jamaican dogwood, hops, California poppy, chamomile, lemon balm, St. John's wort, kava kava, wild lettuce, scullcap, Patrinia root, first-generation histamine-1-receptor antagonists, alcohol, calcium, vitamin A, nicotinamide, magnesium, vitamin B12, I-tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptophan, dietary changes, Natrum muriaticum, and Yoku-kan-san-ka-chimpi-hange. A search of the PubMed database was conducted in October 2002 using MeSH terms insomnia and each product listed in this paper, including only articles published in English between 1980 and 2002. Additional relevant articles from reference lists were also reviewed. Given the paucity of pediatric publications, this age group was excluded from this review.

Results and Conclusions

Although randomized, placebo-controlled studies were available for a few compounds, rigorous scientific data supporting a beneficial effect were not found for the majority of herbal supplements, dietary changes, and other nutritional supplements popularly used for treating insomnia symptoms. Nevertheless, such treatments are described as alternative remedies for insomnia. Studies are limited by small numbers of participants and, in some instances, inadequate design, lack of statistical analysis, and sparse use of objective measurements. Sparse or no scientific data were found to support the efficacy of most products as hypnotics, including chamomile and St. John's wort. There is preliminary but conflicting evidence suggesting Valerian officinalis L. and first-generation histamine-1-receptor antagonists have efficacy as mild hypnotics over short-term use. There are significant potential risks associated with the use of Jamaican dogwood, kava kava, alcohol, and I-tryptophan. Physicians may find this information useful in counseling their patients.

### A systematic review of insomnia and complementary medicine [^308380ec]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

In concert with growing public interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), these therapies and products have been increasingly studied over the past two decades for the treatment of sleep disorders. While systematic reviews have been conducted on acupuncture and valerian in the treatment of insomnia, to date no comprehensive review has been conducted on all major CAM treatments. We sought to address this via a rigorous systematic review of hypnotic CAM interventions, including herbal and nutritional medicine, acupuncture, acupressure, yoga, tai chi, massage, aromatherapy and homoeopathy. The electronic databases MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, PsycINFO, and The Cochrane Library were accessed during late 2009 for CAM randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the treatment of chronic insomnia. Sixty-four RCTs were identified, of which 20 studies involving eight CAM interventions met final inclusion criteria. Effect size calculations (where possible) and a quality control analysis using a modified Jadad scale were undertaken. Many RCTs lacked methodological rigor, and were commonly excluded due to small sample size or an inadequate control condition. Among the studies that met inclusion criteria, there was evidentiary support in the treatment of chronic insomnia for acupressure (d = 1.42–2.12), tai chi (d = 0.22–2.15), yoga (d = 0.66–1.20), mixed evidence for acupuncture and L-tryptophan, and weak and unsupportive evidence for herbal medicines such as valerian. Surprisingly, studies involving several mainstream CAM therapies (e.g., homoeopathy, massage, or aromatherapy) were not located or did not meet basic inclusion criteria. If CAM interventions are to be considered as viable stand-alone or adjuvant treatments for sleep disorders, future researchers are urged to use acceptable methodology, including appropriate sample sizes and adequate controls. RCTs evaluating other untested CAM therapies such as massage, homoeopathy, or osteopathy are encouraged, as is the exploration of using CAM therapies adjuvantly with conventional therapies.

### Ancient and modern anticonvulsants act synergistically in a KCNQ potassium channel binding pocket [^9c00bb8f]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

IVA has been quantified to be ~12% of the methanol extract of the Mallotus leaf extract. IVA is also a component of valerian root, an herbal medicine used since ancient Greek and Roman times to treat insomnia, and since medieval times in Europe specifically to treat seizures. Valerian root extract is still used extensively today for anxiety and insomnia, although randomized controlled trials evaluating its efficacy have achieved mixed results –. It has been estimated that 10 g of valerian root might yield as much as 100 mg of IVA, and that valerian root doses of 30–50 g per day would have the potential for anticonvulsant activity. Pharmacokinetic studies in humans have been performed for NPS 1776, or isovaleramide, the amide derivative of IVA. Isovaleramide readily passes though biological membranes, and is well tolerated in humans up to at least 2400 mg per day. Absorption is rapid (mean T max of 30–45 min) and mean elimination half-life is 2.5 h. Furthermore, volatile fatty acids similar to IVA, e.g. acetate, readily cross the blood brain barrier. Taken together, these studies together with our current findings suggest that herbal extracts contain sufficient bioavailable IVA to exert effects on KCNQ2/3 channels, particularly if synergizing with MTX.

Mutagenesis results indicating differential requirement of W236/W265 (Fig. 5g) suggest that MTX and IVA can sit together in the same binding pocket (Fig. 6j), a site we recently discovered evolved to accommodate neurotransmitters including GABA. When combined with the modern anticonvulsant RTG, the herbal extracts IVA and MTX have the unprecedented capacity to lock open KCNQ2/3 at all voltages tested, converting it into a voltage-independent leak channel. Our cellular electrophysiology and docking predictions support a mechanism for this: while RTG is a more potent agonist of KCNQ3 (refs.), IVA and MTX are more potent agonists of KCNQ2 (Figs. 2 and 5). Thus, the combination of either herbal component with RTG can leverage subunit heterogeneity in KCNQ2/3, a feature lacking in modern anticonvulsants, to increase synergy.

### Spp. derivatives for COVID-19 treatment: anecdotal use, political hype, treatment potential, challenges, and road map to randomized clinical trials [^961c7bf5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

ANECDOTAL USE OF A. ANNUA PRODUCTS FOR COVID-19 TREATMENT

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, formulations of A. annua have been used in Africa and China for COVID-19 prevention and treatment. In the DRC, herbal formulations have been used for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 by fumigation, infusion, or decoction. It is important to emphasize that there are no controlled data supporting the use of any of these, and their efficacy for COVID-19 is unknown. Arguably, natural product research is only relevant to the development of new drugs as a first step to identifying specific molecules with activity. Teas cannot function as drugs meeting international standards, as their components are unknown and not standardized. Advancing traditional medicines will require identification of active components of plant extracts, methods to yield purified compounds, and determination of compound pharmacology including studies of biological activity, bioavailability, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties of each molecule. For evaluation of the antiviral effects of herbal formulations, the screening system should meet all requirements of any good assay, including validity, lack of ambiguity, accuracy, reproducibility, simplicity, and reasonable cost. Because these requirements are better met by in vitro screening, in vitro bioassays must be used to guide the isolation of active compounds from plant extracts. The antiviral activities of the pure compounds must then be confirmed at a later stage by in vivo assays in appropriate animal models.

### Effect of valerian on cognitive disorders and electroencephalography in hemodialysis patients: a randomized, cross over, double-blind clinical trial [^875dd712]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Scientific studies on valerian have begun on humans since 1970. Vonderheid-Guth et al. (2000) argue that the use of valerian-hops mix has pharmacodynamic responses in the brain. Schulz et al. (1998) in two multiple crossover studies, each involving 12 adult female subjects, screened for acute sedative effects of eight different plant extracts. Valerian extract, which was administered in both studies, displayed an increase of power in the delta and theta bands and a decrease in the beta band. The results correspondingly showed that sedating effects of plant extracts could be identified by quantitative EEG analysis as well as self-assessment instruments. In addition, Hasani et al. (2013) has suggested valerian as a prophylactic strategy for the prevention of cognitive disorders after heart surgery.

Since cognitive disorders are common in hemodialysis patient, the severity and characteristics of them are not well defined, which are associated with prolonged hospitalization, poor quality of life, mortality and morbidity among the hemodialysis patients. On the other hand, cognitive disorders have more serious consequences; for example, lowering life expectancy that might prevent the hemodialysis patients participating in the hemodialysis programs, taking medications and adhering to dietary restrictions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the cognitive disorders and control the related complications in order to achieve better therapeutic outcomes in these patients. Considering the effects of valerian extract on brain wave in EEG and its possible role in improving cognitive disorders, we decided to evaluate the effect of valerian on cognitive disorders and EEG in the hemodialysis patients.

### Unnecessary hospitalisations and polypharmacy practices in Tajikistan: a health system evaluation for strengthening primary healthcare [^a346483f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2023). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobials

Prior to admission, 110/299 (36.8%) children received at least one antibiotic, corresponding to 77/194 (39.7%) children with a respiratory infection and 33/105 (31.4%) children with diarrhoea. These drugs were given intramuscularly in 64/110 (58.2%) children.

During hospitalisation, 407/440 (92.5%) children received at least one antimicrobial and 115/440 (26.1%) received at least two. Antibiotics were prescribed to 122/142 (85.9%) children with diarrhoea. Overall, the antibiotics most prescribed were ampicillin (received by 135/440 (30.7%) children), ceftriaxone (98/440; 22.3%), cefotaxime (45/440; 10.2%), gentamicin (34/440; 7.7%) and amikacin (29/440; 6.6%).

Overall, 122/422 (28,9%) women were prescribed antibiotics during hospitalisation, mostly ampicillin, ceftriaxone or metronidazole. The reason for prescription was frequently due to secondary diagnoses such as chronic pyelonephritis or respiratory infections, which were in most cases not confirmed clinically or by laboratory tests on admission but based on diagnoses reported in the referral paper and therefore likely to be unjustified.

Polypharmacy

Hospitalised children and women received an average of 5 and 6.5 drugs, respectively. Drugs in children included oral rehydration salts, intravenous fluids and short-acting bronchodilators. Medications were often not indicated or with no evidence of benefits, such as antihistamines, probiotics, spasmolytics, mucolytics, interferon alfa-2b (Viferon), affinity-purified antibodies to human interferon gamma (Anaferon) and vitamin complex. Some children received intravenous insulin together with intravenous glucose solution.

Women were also commonly prescribed medications when they were not indicated or with no evidence of benefits, such as valerian, papaverine suppository, different types of vitamins, vitamin C and herbal tea for kidney diseases.

### Herbal medicine use by children presenting for ambulatory anesthesia and surgery [^d1e6d2a5]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Herbal medicine use has become increasingly popular throughout the world. Some of these agents may have serious interactions with anesthetic drugs. Children may potentially be more vulnerable to such interactions because of altered drug handling. While the prevalence of herbal medicine use by children with some chronic illnesses has been estimated, the incidence of this in a population of otherwise healthy children admitted for minor ambulatory anesthesia and surgery is currently unknown.

Methods

Parents of 601 children presenting consecutively for ambulatory surgery were asked to complete a questionnaire detailing administration of herbal medicines to their child.

Results

This study identified that 6.4% of children were currently taking an herbal preparation; while a further 10.1% had taken an herbal medicine in the past. Echinacea and arnica were the commonest used herbal remedies. A significant number of children had taken agents which may interact with anesthesia and surgery: St John's Wort, valerian, garlic and gingko. Information on herbal medicines was mostly obtained by parents from nonmedical sources.

Conclusions

A total of 16.6% of children had a current or past history of ingestion of herbal medicines. This finding may have implications for the perioperative management of children presenting for day-case surgery.

### Use of complementary and alternative medicine by older adults – a cross-sectional survey [^370e6518]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Nearly two out of three participants (61.3%) used at least one CAM preparation (Table 2). Both highest and lowest rates were seen in home care service clients (78.0% without, and 33.3% (2 of 6) with legal guardians). Most frequently they took dietary supplements (35.5%) and herbal medicines (33.3%). Physical therapy (41.3%) led the non-pharmaceutical therapies. Cardiovascular diseases were the most frequent reason for medication of any kind (26.8%), followed by chronic pain (24.5%). Table 2 shows details for all subgroups.

CAM preparations used most frequently by older adults without legal guardians

CAM (as defined in this study, see text) preparations that were most frequently used in the respective category. Percent of 355 older adults without legal guardian. Multiple answers possible; 751 answers in total.

Of the older adults with legal guardians, 88.9% used CAM. In 92.9% of cases, their GPs prescribed the preparations but only 51.3% documented the reason. Users took predominantly dietary supplements: Vitamin D 3 (22.2%), vitamin B 12 (20.0%), folic acid (13.3%), calcium (6.7%), magnesium (2.2%), and iron (2.2%) and only in 2.2% the herbal preparation, valerian. CAM users without legal guardians expected a marked (44.9%) or moderate (37.1%) improvement of their conditions; 11.7% did not state their expectations. More than half (58.7%) of the users experienced a good effect, 27.4% only a minor effect, and 6.0%, no effect.

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^9eff8409]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Table 5 — not recommended for treating sleep onset or sleep maintenance insomnia, diphenhydramine, melatonin, tiagabine, trazodone, l-tryptophan, and valerian show limited or unreported benefits with these estimates: Diphenhydramine reduced sleep latency by 9 min (95% CI: 2 min increase to 17 min reduction) and increased total sleep time by 12 min (95% CI: 13 min reduction to 38 min improvement) with no improvement in quality of sleep; Melatonin reduced sleep latency by 7 min (95% CI: 2 to 15 min reduction) with small improvement in quality of sleep; Tiagabine increased total sleep time by 1–11 min (95% CI: 2 min reduction to 15 min improvement) and reduced wake after sleep onset by 1–9 min (95% CI: 6 min increase to 25 min reduction) with No-to-Small improvement in quality of sleep; Trazodone reduced sleep latency by 10 min (95% CI: 9 to 11 min reduction) and reduced wake after sleep onset by 5 min (95% CI: 7 to 9 min reduction) with no improvement in quality of sleep; L-tryptophan had wake after sleep onset reduction of 10 min (95% CI: 4 to 15 min reduction) with small improvement in quality of sleep; Valerian reduced sleep latency by 9 min (95% CI: 0 to 18 min reduction) with quality of sleep not reported.

### Potential for interactions between dietary supplements and prescription medications [^ccec035d]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of clinically significant interactions caused by concurrent use of dietary supplements and prescription medication.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional, point-of-care survey and combined the findings with a review of patient medical records. Patients treated at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minn) in 6 different specialty clinics were surveyed for their use of dietary supplements. Concurrent use of prescription medications was obtained from patients' medical records. We used the Lexi-Interact online medication and dietary supplement interaction analysis program to assess the potential clinical significance of each interaction.

Results

We surveyed 1818 patients; 1795 responded (overall response rate of 98.7%) and 710 (39.6%) reported use of dietary supplements. In total, 107 interactions with potential clinical significance were identified. The 5 most common natural products with a potential for interaction (garlic, valerian, kava, ginkgo, and St John's wort) accounted for 68% of the potential clinically significant interactions. The 4 most common classes of prescription medications with a potential for interaction (antithrombotic medications, sedatives, antidepressant agents, and antidiabetic agents) accounted for 94% of the potential clinically significant interactions. No patient was harmed seriously from any interaction.

Conclusions

A small number of prescription medications and dietary supplements accounted for most of the interactions. The actual potential for harm was low.

### Ancient and modern anticonvulsants act synergistically in a KCNQ potassium channel binding pocket [^f86dd27c]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

M. oppositifolius component IVA potently activates KCNQ2

In addition to MTX, previous gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis of M. oppositifolius extract identified nine additional compounds, three of which we found to activate KCNQ2/3 channels in our initial screen (Fig. 1). One, IVA, is a phytocompound found both in M. oppositifolius leaf extract and in the extract of valerian root (from Valeriana officinalis) (Fig. 5a). Valerian root has been used in herbal medicine for more than two millennia, in ancient Greece and Rome for disorders including insomnia, and since the sixteenth century in northern England and Scotland for convulsions. As recently as 2002, an estimated 1.1% of the United States adult population (~2 million people) had used valerian root extract in the past week. IVA shares a chemical feature of RTG important for KCNQ2/3 activation, i.e. strongly negative electrostatic surface potential close to a carbonyl oxygen (Fig. 5a) and is predicted by SwissDock to bind close to KCNQ3-W265 (Fig. 5b). In addition to KCNQ2/3 (Fig. 1), IVA potently and effectively activated homomeric KCNQ2 at −60 mV (EC 50, 0.34 µM) and, to a lesser extent, KCNQ3* (EC 50, 0.5 µM) and KCNQ4 (EC 50, 16.2 µM), with no effect on KCNQ5 (Fig. 5c, d; Supplementary Figures 14–17; Supplementary Tables 22–25). Like MTX, IVA did not alter currents generated by KCNA1 (Supplementary Figure 18; Supplementary Table 26).

### Effect of valerian on cognitive disorders and electroencephalography in hemodialysis patients: a randomized, cross over, double-blind clinical trial [^e44e8cef]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, the changes in EEG were not significant in the two groups of A and B in the two one-month treatment periods. Diaper et al. (2004) studied the effects of two different concentrations of valerian on sleep, cognitive function and motor function in elderly people with sleep disorders. The results showed no significant difference between valerian 300 mg, 600 mg or placebo in EEG indices and psychometric measurements. Vonderheid-Guth et al. (2000) in Germany within a double-blind crossover study investigated the pharmacodynamic effects of different amounts of commercial valerian-hops extract mix on quantitative EEG topography (QEEG) in 12 young healthy volunteers compared to the placebo. The results showed that the EEG was able to show mild, but visible, effects especially after taking high concentrations of valerian-hops mix.

In this study, the reason for the insignificant changes in EEG before and after intervention might be attributed to inappropriate cooperation of patients with EEG. Some patients refused to perform EEG due to various works and time consuming during the intervention phase. The results of this study can be guidelines for designing new programs and using non-chemical methods to attenuate the cognitive disorders in patients undergoing hemodialysis, as well as can be a model for further researches regarding the examination of other Valerian properties and the use of complementary medicine.

### Botanical and dietary supplements for mood and anxiety in menopausal women [^2ef2319a]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This paper reviews the commonly used botanicals for treatment of mood and anxiety disorders in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women and presents information on their safety and efficacy.

Design

The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for clinical trials related to the use of botanicals for depression, anxiety, and mood disturbances. Papers were excluded if they were in a language other than English, did not include midlife women as study participants, or did not report on changes in mood, depression, or anxiety.

Results

Five of seven trials of St. John's wort for mild to moderate depression showed a significant improvement. The one randomized, controlled trial of ginseng in postmenopausal women reported improvements in mood and anxiety. All three randomized, controlled trials of ginkgo found no effect on depression. In four of eight controlled trials, kava significantly reduced anxiety. Black cohosh significantly reduced depression and anxiety in all studies reviewed.

Conclusions

St. John's wort and black cohosh appear to be the most useful in alleviating mood and anxiety changes during menopause. Ginseng may be effective, but more research needs to be done. Kava holds promise for decreasing anxiety in peri- and postmenopausal women; however, women should be careful in the amount and duration of use. Finally, ginkgo and valerian do not appear to be useful in reducing depression or anxiety in this population.

### Tea and flavonoids: where we are, where to go next [^9a2c86ff]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

There is a need to evaluate the evidence about the health effects of tea flavonoids and to provide valid, specific, and actionable tea consumption information to consumers. Emerging evidence suggests that the flavonoids in tea may be associated with beneficial health outcomes, whereas the benefits and risks of tea extracts and supplements are less well known. The next steps in developing tea science should include a focus on the most promising leads, such as reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke, rather than pursuing smaller, more diffuse studies of many different health outcomes. Future tea research should also include the use of common reference standards, better characterization of intervention products, and application of batteries of biomarkers of intakes and outcomes across studies, which will allow a common body of evidence to be developed. Mechanistic studies should determine which tea bioactive constituents have effects, whether they act alone or in combination, and how they influence health. Clinical studies should use well-characterized test products, better descriptions of baseline diets, and validated biomarkers of intake and disease risk reduction. There should be more attention to careful safety monitoring and adverse event reporting. Epidemiologic investigations should be of sufficient size and duration to detect small effects, involve populations most likely to benefit, use more complete tea exposure assessment, and include both intermediary markers of risk as well as morbidity and mortality outcomes. The construction of a strong foundation of scientific evidence on tea and health outcomes is essential for developing more specific and actionable messages on tea for consumers.

### In vivo effects of goldenseal, kava kava, black cohosh, and valerian on human cytochrome P450 1A2, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 / 5 phenotypes [^7fbbc0af]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

Phytochemical-mediated modulation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity may underlie many herb-drug interactions. Single-time point phenotypic metabolic ratios were used to determine whether long-term supplementation of goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa), kava kava (Piper methysticum), or valerian (Valeriana officinalis) extracts affected CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4/5 activity.

Methods

Twelve healthy volunteers (6 women) were randomly assigned to receive goldenseal, black cohosh, kava kava, or valerian for 28 days. For each subject, a 30-day washout period was interposed between each supplementation phase. Probe drug cocktails of midazolam and caffeine, followed 24 hours later by chlorzoxazone and debrisoquin (INN, debrisoquine), were administered before (baseline) and at the end of supplementation. Presupplementation and postsupplementation phenotypic trait measurements were determined for CYP3A4/5, CYP1A2, CYP2E1, and CYP2D6 by use of 1-hydroxymidazolam/midazolam serum ratios (1-hour sample), paraxanthine/caffeine serum ratios (6-hour sample), 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone/chlorzoxazone serum ratios (2-hour sample), and debrisoquin urinary recovery ratios (8-hour collection), respectively. The content of purported "active" phytochemicals was determined for each supplement.

Results

Comparisons of presupplementation and postsupplementation phenotypic ratio means revealed significant inhibition (approximately 40%) of CYP2D6 (difference, -0.228; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.268 to -0.188) and CYP3A4/5 (difference, -1.501; 95% CI, -1.840 to -1.163) activity for goldenseal. Kava produced significant reductions (approximately 40%) in CYP2E1 only (difference, -0.192; 95% CI, -0.325 to -0.060). Black cohosh also exhibited statistically significant inhibition of CYP2D6 (difference, -0.046; 95% CI, -0.085 to -0.007), but the magnitude of the effect (approximately 7%) did not appear to be clinically relevant. No significant changes in phenotypic ratios were observed for valerian.

Conclusions

Botanical supplements containing goldenseal strongly inhibited CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 activity in vivo, whereas kava inhibited CYP2E1 and black cohosh weakly inhibited CYP2D6. Accordingly, serious adverse interactions may result from the concomitant ingestion of goldenseal supplements and drugs that are CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 substrates. Kava kava and black cohosh may interact with CYP2E1 and CYP2D6 substrates, respectively. Valerian appears to be less likely to produce CYP-mediated herb-drug interactions.

### Valerian… [^6b7f3802]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

4 In a double-blind study, 5 eight subjects who described themselves as having lengthy sleep latency wore a wrist activity meter and provided subjective sleep ratings in a study of the effects of valerian. Participants received either a 450- or 900-mg dose of an aqueous extract of valerian root or placebo. Single-dose valerian extract resulted in significant decreases in measured and subjective sleep latency and more stable sleep during the first quarter of the night, with no effect on total sleep time. The 900-mg dose produced increased sleepiness on awakening compared with placebo. Another RCT 17 compared 120 mg of kava, 600 mg of valerian, and placebo taken daily for seven days in relieving physiologic measures of stress induced under laboratory conditions in 54 healthy volunteers. Valerian and kava, but not placebo, significantly decreased systolic blood pressure responsivity, heart rate reaction, and self-reported stress. A randomized, controlled, double-blind study 19 of 102 subjects evaluated reaction time, alertness, and concentration the morning after using valerian root extract and found no negative effect in single- or repeated-dose administrations of valerian. Only one adverse effect was attributed to the valerian extract. Dosage Based on the reviewed studies, the effective dosage of valerian root extract for treatment of insomnia ranges from 300 to 600 mg. An equivalent dose of dried herbal valerian root is 2 to 3 g, soaked in one cup of hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. 25 The product should be ingested 30 minutes to two hours before bedtime. Final Comment Valerian is a safe herbal choice for the treatment of mild insomnia and has good tolerability.

Most studies suggest that it is more effective when used continuously rather than as an acute sleep aid; more rigorous studies are needed to confirm these results. A potential advantage of valerian over benzodiazepines is the lack of sleepiness on awakening when used at the recommended dosages. Valerian also may be helpful in weaning patients with insomnia from benzodiazepines. The use of valerian as an anxiolytic requires further study. Long-term safety studies are lacking.

### Interactions with herbal products: what do we know? [^9db46440]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

The increasing use of herbal remedies by the general public presents several challenges to healthcare professionals who may be asked to give advice on the use of such products in conjunction with other medicines. In particular, the pharmacological properties and potential interactions of herbal products are often less well understood than those of conventional medicines, increasing the risk of adverse effects and drug interactions. In addition, good quality data on herbal medicines are often lacking. Here we highlight the problem of drug-herb interactions and consider the nature of the evidence supporting drug interactions with herbal products.

### Acute liver failure induced by green tea extracts: case report and review of the literature [^eab994b9]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

In industrialized countries, over-the-counter dietary supplements have become popular in preventing and treating an expanding list of medical conditions. Although most commercially available supplements have not been rigorously tested for safety and efficacy, they have found an enlarging market because they are considered natural. Oral supplements containing green tea extract have been marketed as effective for weight loss and to prevent and cure some solid tumors. Although there is little scientific evidence of the effectiveness of green tea extracts to improve the quality of health of regular consumers, there is an increasing body of medical literature supporting the hypothesis that they can cause serious side effects. Our experience adds to previous reports of acute liver toxicity observed in individuals consuming supplements containing green tea extract. We highlight the importance of obtaining a detailed history of dietary supplement consumption when evaluating a patient presenting with acute liver dysfunction.

### Novel perspective of' poor sleep' in public health: a narrative review [^2cf97b67]. BMJ Public Health (2024). High credibility.

A number of other popular non-prescription treatments have demonstrated safety and varying levels of effectiveness. Melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, plays a fundamental role in regulating sleep–wake cycle and circadian rhythm, and melatonin-based supplements are available to manage sleep disturbances. Melatonin helps to reduce the time to fall asleep; however, there is no recommended dosage regimen for melatonin supplementation. Common side effects, such as somnolence and headaches, have been associated with the use of melatonin.

Plants or plant-derived materials have long been used to treat a range of sleep disturbances; these include chamomile (Matricaria recutita), valerian (Valeriana officinalis), hops (Humulus lupulus), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) and passionflower (Passiflora incarnata). Recent meta-analyses found conflicting results on the actual efficacy of these substances, but have emphasised the lack of efficacy of most herbal components for insomnia. Some dietary supplements, for example, iron, zinc, magnesium, calcium, nicotinamide, B vitamins and polyphenols, have shown some positive effect on sleep. There are still a few studies examining the relationship between micronutrient status and sleep; however, emerging evidence suggests a link between dietary micronutrient intake and sleep.

Finally, other sleep aids can improve sleep by modifying environmental factors. Body temperature is a critical determinant of both falling asleep (core body temperature drops) and staying asleep (core body temperature increases). Different devices have been investigated (mattress, bedsheet and warming eye mask) and results were consistent in reporting objective and subjective sleep quality in adults with mild difficulty in falling asleep. Light plays a central role in regulating the circadian rhythm. In response to darkness, the pineal gland initiates production of melatonin, but light exposure slows or halts that production. Short wavelength light, emitted by smartphone screens, highly influences the biological clock and therefore can affect sleep quality through suppression of melatonin production. A study investigated the effect of an amber filter for screens on sleep quality and found that blocking the short-wavelength light component may improve sleep length.

### Assessment of valeriana officinalis L. (valerian) for conscious sedation of patients during the extraction of impacted mandibular third molars: a Randomized, split-mouth, double-blind, crossover study [^25dc5e24]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an herbal drug (valerian) to control anxiety during mandibular third molar extraction compared with a reference benzodiazepine drug commonly used in dental procedures (midazolam).

Materials and Methods

Twenty anxious patients with an indication for bilateral extraction of mandibular third molars were selected. The patients received capsules containing valerian 100 mg or midazolam 15 mg orally 60 minutes before the procedures in a randomized, split-mouth, crossover design. Changes in the physiological parameters (eg, oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate) were assessed at specific times during surgery, and the patients completed a questionnaire postoperatively. The data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon and paired t tests, with a significance level of 5%.

Results

No statistically significant differences in oxygen saturation were observed, regardless of the drug used. However, the other physiological parameters were significantly lower when the patients had taken midazolam compared with valerian. Somnolence was the most common side effect reported with both drugs.

Conclusions

Although midazolam was more effective in reducing the physiological parameters studied, valerian seemed to provide the comfort and relaxation required, with no sedation and less somnolence than midazolam, during third molar extraction. Further studies are necessary before valerian can be clinically recommended.

### Dysmenorrhea, a narrative review of therapeutic options [^8612e71a]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Diet

Dietary supplements have also been used by women to treat dysmenorrhea. Supplements can be taken as vitamins, minerals, herbals, enzymes and amino acids and are often easily attainable and self-administered by women. Interventions studied in one review included 12 different herbal medicines (German chamomile, cinnamon, Damask rose, dill, fennel, fenugreek, ginger, guava, rhubarb, uzara, valerian, zataria and five non-herbal supplements [fish oil, melatonin, vitamins B1 and E, and zinc sulphate]) in a variety of formulations and doses. Evidence for dietary supplements in improving pain levels for dysmenorrhea was deemed to be low quality with many limitations including small sample sizes, failure to report methods, and inconsistency. While there is limited data to support the efficacy of supplements, the majority of supplements pose little harm to patients and should be reviewed with providers to ensure no interactions with other prescribed medications.

Cannabinoids

Another modality used by patients for pain management is cannabinoids. It is important to note that FDA has not approved cannabinoids for medical use, and in this review, cannabinoids for symptom management will be discussed as "off-label" use. The delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) component of cannabinoids has analgesic, anti-inflammatory and sedative properties. Previous research has shown that there are altered levels of endocannabinoids and cannabinoid receptor expression in patients with pelvic pain disorders such as endometriosis and adenomyosis. Endocannabinoids are produced in response to tissue injury and reduce pain by activation of cannabinoid receptors. Data-driven evidence for cannabinoids in the treatment for dysmenorrhea is limited; however, one study of over 200 patient reported that 25% used cannabinoids as adjunct treatment, and over 90% of patient reported improvement in pain with the addition of the drug. Patients who used cannabinoids also reported improvement in mood/psychologic symptoms, which plays a large role in patients' overall pain experiences. The variation in legality of cannabinoids has led to challenges for certain populations of patients to access the drug for medicinal use, and there is a lack of oversight in the distribution of cannabinoids, especially if illegally acquired. There is a need for randomized control trials investigating the efficacy of cannabinoids on quality of life and pain in primary dysmenorrhea.

### The chronic effects of a combination of herbal extracts (euphytose) on psychological mood state and response to a laboratory stressor: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind study in healthy humans [^b715282f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the current study, 14 days' supplementation with MHEP was associated with reduced tension-anxiety. In addition, participants showed an attenuated response to the OMS psychosocial stressor following MHEP, evidenced by lower salivary α-amylase and GSR. With regards to cognitive performance assessed at home via Cognim app, MHEP led to significantly fewer false alarms on the RVIP task compared with placebo. A significant reduction in speed of performance on the digit vigilance task following MHEP was also observed. However, this isolated negative effect was only observed during the morning assessment on day 7 and appears to contradict the pattern of response for the other assessments where performance was numerically faster following MHEP.

Concerning mood, tension-anxiety was significantly lower following MHEP, compared to placebo. The POMS questionnaire from which this measure is derived was completed prior to the start of the study day and therefore represents a reduction in tension-anxiety following 14 days' treatment. Of the species contained within the extract, both passionflower and valerian have demonstrated subjective anxiolytic properties within the literature following an acute, sometimes larger, dose of the individual extracts. Since the quantities of valerian and passionflower contained within the MHEP are in some cases lower than those previously observed to have anxiolytic effects, the improvement in subjective anxiety seen here may represent the cumulative effect of a smaller dose of each extract. In terms of mechanisms, the sesquiterpene valerenic acid contained within valerian (when extracted from the underground organs of the V. officinalis species as in MHEP) has been shown to increase central GABA levels. This leads to a reduction in central nervous system activity, which may have contributed to the reduction in tension-anxiety observed here following MHEP. It has been demonstrated that the ratio of valerenic acid to acetoxy valerenic acid contained within the extract is of importance in this regard, with extracts containing higher levels of valerenic acid leading to more pronounced anxiolytic effects. With regards to the Passiflora species, despite a long history of use as an anxiolytic, its mechanism of action is not well understood. A role of the flavonoid chrysin in the agonism of benzodiazepine receptors has been proposed; however, consensus here is lacking. Interestingly, the anxiolytic activity profile of the P. incarnata extract is reportedly determined by the parts of the plant used, with the roots shown to be devoid of anxiolytic effects and the leaves said to contain maximum concentrations of bioactive constituents. Importantly, the P. incarnata extract contained within MHEP is obtained from the aerial parts of the plant. It should be noted that this was an isolated effect on mood, and there was no evidence of a chronic effect of treatment on state or trait anxiety – the primary outcome measure – or any other of the mood measures. This positive effect, albeit in the expected direction, should therefore be interpreted with caution. One consideration here is the context in which the pre-dose mood and well-being questionnaires were administered. Participants completed these questionnaires and mood scales in full knowledge that they were going to complete the OMS, and this may have influenced their responses on these questionnaires. Subjective well-being has been shown to correlate with current mood and is also affected by experimental manipulation. It may be that that anticipation of the OMS masked any chronic effect of treatment on state anxiety or indeed any of the other subjective measures.

### Over-the-counter sleeping pills: a survey of use in Hong Kong and a review of their constituents [^be9534fe]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

This study examined the composition of over-the-counter (OTC) sleeping pills in Hong Kong and reviewed the current knowledge about the hypnotic efficacy and safety of their major herbal and dietary supplement constituents. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of OTC sleep aids at drug stores in a residential district of 0.3 million population and literature search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, China Journal Net, China Biomedical Database and relevant English and Chinese literature. We identified 17 brands of OTC sleeping pill: eleven of them were composed of mixtures of Chinese and Western herbal agents and six brands contained 3 mg of melatonin. The Chinese herbal mixture suanzaorentang, comprising zizyphi spinosi semen, poria cocos, ligusticum wallichii, anemarrhenae rhizoma and glycyrrhizae radix in ratio of 7:5:2:1:1, was the most common OTC sleeping pill available in the survey. Our literature review showed that kava, valerian and melatonin were the better-researched herbs and dietary supplements, however, the data on hypnotic efficacy and safety was inadequate to support their clinical use. More rigorous investigations of the risk-benefit relationship of herbal agents and dietary supplements used for insomnia are needed.

### Efficacy and safety of valerian root extract and lavender essential… [^c96c6600]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Efficacy and Safety of Valerian Root Extract and Lavender Essential Oil Combination, Over 4 Weeks in Subjects With Sleep Complaints ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Lavender oil as well as valerian officinalis are benefiting from a long traditional use in sleep and these products have moderate sedative effects compared to classical hypnotic compounds. This study is proposed to assess the efficacy and the safety of this combination in subjects with slight to moderate sleep complaints. As single ingredients, valerian officinalis root extract has been identified as having clinical evidence to demonstrate improvement in insomnia complaints:

- Sleep onset latency
- Night awakenings
- Sleep quality
- Sleep efficiency Studies have also demonstrated that Lavandula angustifolia essential oil had a beneficial effect on anxiety and disturbed sleep.

Lavender oil as well as valerian officinalis are benefiting from a long traditional use in sleep and these products have moderate sedative effects compared to classical hypnotic compounds. The existing published clinical trials as well as the traditional use suggest a positive effect on sleep and stress, however Valerian aqueous extract and lavender essential oil have been studied in the past for different dosages, for small simple size and standalone only. Therefore it is difficult to fully rely on the past literature to estimate the potential effect of the combination Valerian
- Lavender Essential Oil, that explain the purpose of this proof of concept study which aim to better quantify the effect of the combination on sleep complaints compared to a placebo group in the targeted population. This study is proposed to assess the efficacy and the safety of this combination in subjects with slight to moderate sleep complaints.

### Nutritional and herbal supplements in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder [^43aab115]. General Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Milk thistle (Silybum marianum)

Silybum marianum (milk thistle) is a medicinal plant, which is grown in Mediterranean and Persian regions. It contains flavonoid complex silymarin, which has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune modulator, sedative and antidepressant effects. Also silymarin has been found to increase serotonin in the cortex and acts as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor.

Results of the only randomised controlled trial (n = 35) of milk thistle for OCD treatment revealed no significant difference in treatment effects between milk thistle (600 mg/d) and fluoxetine. It is indicated that milk thistle has similar effects with fluoxetine in OCD symptoms and its positive effect starts in the fifth week without severe side effects.

Valerian root (Valeriana officinalis L)

Valerian is a perennial plant, which was used as a perfume in the 16th century. Valerian roots have aleuronic acid that is associated with the modulation of GABA A receptors. The other content of valerian roots is valepotriates, which is effective in treating the psychotic symptoms of severe anxiety. Valerian is most commonly used in insomnia and migraine treatment due to its sedative, pain reliever effects. There is only one double-blind placebo-controlled trial of valerian extract in OCD treatment (n = 31). They found that valerian extract was more effective in OCD treatment compared with placebo. Also, they observed the rapid onset of the effects of extract (28, 42, 56 days). Low incidence of impairment of libido with valerian extract was an important advantage of this treatment.

### Effect of valerian in preventing neuropsychiatric adverse effects of efavirenz in HIV-positive patients: a pilot randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^2c474f8a]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Several neuropsychiatric adverse effects of efavirenz are known. Preventing these adverse effects may improve patients' adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of valerian in preventing neuropsychiatric adverse effects of efavirenz in HIV-positive patients.

Method

In this pilot randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, 51 HIV-positive patients who were receiving efavirenz were recruited into the valerian (n = 25) or placebo (n = 26) group. Patients received valerian (530 mg) or placebo nightly 1 hour before sleep for 4 weeks. The neuropsychiatric status (sleep, anxiety, depression, suicidal thought, and psychosis) of patients was assessed at baseline and week 4 using validated questionnaires.

Results

Sleep (P ≤ 0.001) and anxiety (P = 0.001) significantly improved in the valerian group compared with the placebo group. Dizziness was the most common complaint of patients in first days of the intervention. In the valerian and placebo groups, 92% and 84.6% of patients experienced dizziness, respectively (P = 0.35). Nausea was the second common adverse effect that 84% and 76.9% of patients in the valerian and placebo groups experienced (P = 0.39).

Conclusion

In the first 4 weeks of ART including efavirenz, valerian significantly improved sleep and anxiety in HIV-positive patients. Valerian may be considered as a potential option in preventing neuropsychiatric adverse effects of efavirenz in HIV-positive patients.

### Effect of valerian on cognitive disorders and electroencephalography in hemodialysis patients: a randomized, cross over, double-blind clinical trial [^7c8296ee]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of cognitive disorders in the hemodialysis patients is twice as high as in the general population, The prevalence of cognitive disorders in the Dialysis Population from 6.6 to 51%. which occur frequently in the hemodialysis patients due to several factors, including serum level of lipids, low level of education, race and aging. The risk of cognitive disorders can be increased because of vascular diseases and the high prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, anemia, abnormal sleep and acute vascular events like strokes. Following the stroke, the risk of dementia and cognitive disorders are up to 9 times more common. Type II diabetes is associated with a decrease in cognitive function, especially in verbal memory, information processing speed and executive functioning. However, the hemodialysis, in turn, has no significant effect on the overall brain function.

### Effect of valerian on cognitive disorders and electroencephalography in hemodialysis patients: a randomized, cross over, double-blind clinical trial [^b43b2244]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this study revealed that valerian could be effective and significantly improve cognitive status although no significant changes were observed in the EGG of the hemodialysis patients. The MMSE scores in the valerian group within the first and the second one-month treatment periods had also significantly increased. In line with these results, Hassani et al. (2013) in Sari, Iran, examined the effects of valerian root extract on early prevention of the postoperative cognitive disorders after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. They conducted a standardized MMSE on the day before surgery, 10 days and 2 months after surgery. A significant reduction in the cognitive disorders was seen in the Group valerian compared to the Group placebo within 10 days after surgery and a greater improvement in cognitive function within eight weeks after surgery. Ceddia et al. (2015) in the United States showed that the extract of herbs from the peppermint family also has a positive effect on cognitive health, including improvement in memory, reasoning, attention, concentration, planning and mood. In the study by Hensel et al. (2007), at least 2–4 points indicated that the reliable changes in the MMSE scores were clinically significant. In the present study, the results showed that valerian could significantly increase the overall cognitive scores of hemodialysis patients (between 0.88 and 0.97). More examples were similarly suggested for the sub-quantifiers that were not significant probably due to the limited time period of the study as well as different times considered for the evaluation of the MMSE scores in morning, evening, and night shifts.

In this study MMSE was completed the first hour of hemodialysis and then the EEG was done in the morning shift on the day after hemodialysis between 8 AM until 12 MD. Drew et al. (2015) also performed cognitive testing during hemodialysis, which in theory may influence cognitive performance through fluid shifts and changes in electrolyte levels. Drew et al. (2013) previously conducted a randomized crossover study in hemodialysis patients found no difference in performance based on the timing of testing. Also, the results of the study by Sperschneider et al. (1980) in Germany showed that changes in EEG remained constant or increased during the hemodialysis period. Also, Wendland and Susantija (1983) in assessment of EEG in the hemodialysis patients before and after hemodialysis, in 10 men and 11 women, showed that an increase in abnormal waves after hemodialysis. The changed of EEG was lower on the day after hemodialysis treatment.

### Guidelines for monitoring and management of pediatric patients before, during, and after sedation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures [^dbd96c48]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Pediatric sedation drug interaction assessment — herbal and prescription agents can alter sedative effects, so a careful drug history and consultation of interaction resources are advised. An important concern is the widespread use of medications that may interfere with drug absorption or metabolism and therefore enhance or shorten the effect time of sedating medications; herbal medicines (eg, St John's wort, ginkgo, ginger, ginseng, garlic) may alter drug pharmacokinetics through inhibition of the cytochrome P450 system, resulting in prolonged drug effect and altered blood drug concentrations (midazolam, cyclosporine, tacrolimus); kava may increase the effects of sedatives and valerian may itself produce sedation via g-aminobutyric acid mechanisms; drugs such as erythromycin and cimetidine may inhibit the cytochrome P450 system, resulting in prolonged sedation with midazolam; medications used to treat HIV infection, some anticonvulsants, immunosuppressive drugs, and some psychotropic medications may also produce clinically important drug-drug interactions; therefore, a careful drug history is a vital part of the safe sedation of children, and the practitioner should consult various sources for specific information on drug interactions.

### Botanical ingredients in cosmeceuticals [^cac24d84]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

During the last 10 to 15 years, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has become increasingly popular in the US. Within this realm of health care, oral and topical herbal supplements have become some of the most frequently used alternative therapies. Most herbal supplements are based on, or include, several botanical ingredients with long histories of traditional or folk medicine usage. Among the numerous botanical ingredients available on the market today, several are believed to confer dermatologic benefits. This article will focus on a select group of botanical compounds, many of which have long traditions in Asian medicine, with potential or exhibited dermatologic applications, including curcumin, Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, silymarin, soy, and tea tree oil. Other botanical agents, such as arnica, bromelain, chamomile, pomegranate, caffeine, green tea, licorice, and resveratrol, are also briefly considered. Some of these ingredients have been incorporated into topical formulations.

### Use of dietary supplements by female seniors in a large Northern California health plan [^27d6a867]. BMC Geriatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Our finding that much larger percentages of adult women are taking NVNMs and VMs other than multivitamins and calcium suggests that for purposes of surveying populations about complementary and alternative therapy use and for medical interviews, the focus should be on use of all types of dietary supplements and medicinal teas, not just herbal supplements. There are several reasons for this. First, VMs and NVNMs other than herbals have the potential for causing adverse reactions, such as high doses of Vitamin C or zinc resulting in gastric upset, that can lead to further self-medication and/or medical visits. Second, certain VMs and NVNMs other than herbals also have the potential to interact with prescription medications, resulting in decreased effectiveness or affecting physiological indicators of how the medication is affecting the individual. Third, a focus on herbals alone excludes other NVNMs that are commonly used by patients with certain health conditions. For example, we estimate that nearly 3% of women used melatonin and 15% of whiteNH women (24% of those with arthritis) use glucosamine, neither of which is an herbal supplement. Finally, surveys of Mexican-American and Central American older women have shown a high prevalence of use herbal and other types of medicinal teas, which may not be picked up by questions asking about dietary supplement use. However, since a growing proportion of the population is drinking herbal teas for nonmedicinal reasons (i.e. other than to treat health problems or symptoms), it will be important to find the best way to ask about medicinal tea use so as to avoid including in estimates those people who are drinking non-medicinal herbal teas as an alternative to caffeinated beverages.

### Evidence-based opinions from multidisciplinary experts on use of naturopathic herbal remedies in pain management [^71700fe3]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Sleeplessness Due to Pain

Population-based studies have found that up to a third of people may report sleep disorders; however, sleep complaints are more prevalent in people with chronic pain disorders (50–88%). Furthermore, a bidirectional relationship between sleep and pain exists, whereby pain reduces sleep qualityand poor sleep quality amplifies pain perception. Sleeplessness due to pain can increase a patient's risk for depression and anxiety, reduce functional ability, and increase systemic/widespread pain.

Among naturopathic treatments for sleeplessness, the use of Valeriana officinalis is widely supported in the literature. In 2021, experts from most regions, except Europe, concurred that V. officinalis has a role in managing sleeplessness due to pain, although there were some differing practices. Australia experts also recommended magnesium and St John's Wort/Ziziphus (2 votes each). Experts from Europe (ie, UK, Finland, and Italy) preferred magnesium, boswellia, and melatonin (1 vote each). Singapore/Malaysia experts preferred ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) (2 votes) and passiflora (1 vote). Saudi Arabia/UAE experts preferred passiflora and melatonin (1 vote each).

A consensus discussion focused on the use of ashwagandha to promote sleep in patients with associated chronic pain. While experts reported positive feedback from patients using ashwagandha for this purpose, the experts were divided on the use of ashwagandha for this specific novel combination of indications (6 of 12 in favor) but concluded that ashwagandha might be useful in managing sleeplessness with pain.

Use of melatonin and its combination with other nutrients are supported for use in sleeplessness; however, long-term use of OTC products can have adverse effects on regulation of endogenous melatonin production and release by the pineal glands. Experts across different specialties concurred that the most convincing evidence for treating sleeplessness due to pain was in melatonin. In Saudi Arabia and Italy, fewer patients sought naturopathic solutions (0% and 3%, respectively) for sleeplessness compared with 50% of patients in Australia, which might reflect the status of melatonin as a prescription drug in the former regions. Consumers from these countries may be more likely to seek medicated solutions for sleeplessness (eg, prescription melatonin and potentially other pharmacological treatments) rather than natural options.

### Empirical research evaluating the effects of non-traditional approaches to enhancing sleep in typical and clinical children and young people [^ca72ec98]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

This paper examines the effects of non-traditional (non-behavioural and non-prescription pharmaceutical) approaches to sleep in children and young people (0–18 y). A systematic search identified 79 studies that met inclusion criteria. Seventeen percent of the studies were rated as having a conclusive level of evidence, forty-two percent with preponderant evidence and forty-one percent with only suggestive evidence. There were promising indications, with certain populations only, for aromatherapy, ketogenic diets, an elimination diet (few foods diet), elimination of cow's milk, avoidance of caffeine, tryptophan with adenosine and uridine, omega-3 and omega-6, valerian, music, osteopathic manipulation and white noise. Bright light therapy and massage returned some positive results. All of these interventions warrant further, more rigorous research. There was limited or no evidence to support acupressure or acupuncture, other diets or dietary supplements, exercise or weighted blankets. Caution is needed in interpreting some studies because poorer quality studies were more likely to return positive results. Suggestions are made for the improvement of large and smaller scale research, especially conceptualization around multiple physiological measures of sleep and the adoption of research methods which are of use in clinical settings.

### Herbal supplement use and blood lead levels of United States adults [^0536ee6e]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Some herbal supplements may contain lead.

Objective

To examine whether use of specific herbal dietary supplements during the last 30 days is associated with blood lead levels in US men and women.

Design

Cross-sectional analysis.

Study Population

NHANES participants from 1999–2004, a representative sample of the civilian non-institutionalized US population.

Measurements

Lead was measured in blood. Associations between lead and self-reported supplement use were estimated using multivariable regression weighted to account for NHANES sampling. Herbal supplements investigated were those previously reported to contain high heavy metal content: Ayurvedic or traditional Chinese medicine herbs, echinacea, ginkgo, ginseng, St. John's wort, and "other" herbs (specifically, kava, valerian, black cohosh, bee pollen, and nettle).

Main Results

Among 6,712 women ≥ 20 years, those using herbal supplements had lead levels that were 10% higher than non-users (95% CI 3%-17%, p = 0.005). Women using Ayurvedic or traditional Chinese medicine herbs, St. John's wort, and "other" herbs had lead levels 24% (95% CI 5%-45%, p = 0.01), 23% (95% CI 4%-46%), p = 0.02), and 21% (95% CI 2%-44%, p = 0.03) higher, respectively, than non-users. No significant associations were observed between herb use and lead levels among men (n = 6,095). Among reproductive-aged women (16–45 years), herbal supplement users had lead levels 20% higher than non-users (95% CI 5%-34%, p = 0.008). In contrast, garlic and other dietary supplements were not associated with higher lead levels.

Conclusion

Use of specific herbal supplements is associated with higher blood lead levels among women. Our data suggest testing guidelines for herbal supplements and regulations limiting lead in supplements are needed.

### Genome assembly of wild tea tree DASZ reveals pedigree and selection history of tea varieties [^7b609b2f]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze), a member of the genus Camellia (Theaceae), is one of the most popular beverages worldwide with rich flavors and health benefits. It is known that tea drinking in China can be dated back to the 5th century AD, and by the end of the 6th century, the Chinese people began to have different cognitions of tea drinking: tea was no longer regarded as a mere medicinal drink, but also as a refreshing beverage. The planting area of tea was more than 3.8 million hectares, resulting in the production of 6.1 million metric tons of tea worldwide in 2017. Research in tea science is very diverse, and is gradually verifying the folk wisdom concerning the health benefits of tea. Tea contains abundant medically important bioactive chemical compounds such as phenolics, amino acids, caffeine, and terpenes, which contribute to the pleasant flavors as well as high industrial and medical value of tea. For instance, Nakayama et al. showed that tea polyphenols such as Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and theaflavin digallate (TF3) could inhibit the infection of influenza virus by binding to haemagglutinin. EGCG can not only prevent the infection of influenza virus, but can also block the infectivity of other representative viruses such as HCV, HIV-1, and HBV.

### Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled intervention study on the nutritional efficacy of a food for special medical purposes (FSMP) and a dietary supplement in reducing the symptoms of veisalgia [^aaa1ee58]. BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health (2020). High credibility.

What this paper adds?

Complex mixtures of nutritional food supplements seem suitable for effective treatment of veisalgia in the context of non-excessive alcohol consumption.
Haemostasis of electrolytes and minerals inferred by alcohol consumption might be neglectable.
No significant dehydration due to alcohol consumption seems to occur after moderate alcohol consumption.

### Fulminant hepatitis During self-medication with hydroalcoholic extract of green tea [^9f87a5a0]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Despite an ancient reputation for potential phytotherapeutic effects and innocuity, traditional herbal medicine has previously been implicated in severe adverse events. Exolise is an 80% ethanolic dry extract of green tea (Camellia sinensis) standardized at 25% catechins expressed as epigallocatechin gallate, containing 5–10% caffeine. It has been available in France, Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom since 1999, as an adjuvant therapy for use in weight loss programmes. In various studies, green tea has to date been considered useful for its potential hepatic protective properties. In this study, we report a case of fulminant hepatitis during self-medication with Exolise, requiring liver transplantation.
