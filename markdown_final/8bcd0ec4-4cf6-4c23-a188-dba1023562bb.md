## Question

What are the guidelines after identifying a adrenal incidentaloma on Ct

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended guidelines and step-by-step management after identifying an adrenal incidentaloma on CT. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the lesion and confirming it meets incidentaloma criteria. Then, I should verify the initial clinical assessment and history elements that change pretest probabilities. Next, I will review the first-line imaging strategy and how to interpret non-contrast CT attenuation and size. After that, I need to check the mandatory hormonal evaluation and its components. Then, I will stratify management by imaging and hormonal results, including when to use washout CT, MRI, PET/CT, and when to refer for surgery. Finally, I should confirm surveillance protocols, special populations, and quality improvement strategies, and reconcile areas of controversy across guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition and scope so I don't misclassify the case. An adrenal incidentaloma is typically defined as an adrenal mass ≥ 1 cm discovered on imaging obtained for unrelated reasons, in patients without current or prior extra-adrenal malignancy and without clinically suspected adrenal disease, and lesions < 1 cm generally do not require further workup unless clinically indicated, which aligns with ESE/ENSAT and ACR guidance [^114E7j18] [^111VXECj] [^114AWGe4].

> Wait, let me verify the initial clinical assessment elements that meaningfully shift risk. I need to check for symptoms and signs of cortisol, catecholamine, and mineralocorticoid excess, screen for hypertension and hypokalemia, and document age, because patients < 18 years have a higher risk of adrenocortical carcinoma and warrant a lower threshold for surgical consultation, and I should confirm whether there is a history of extra-adrenal malignancy, which increases the risk of adrenal metastasis and changes imaging strategy [^113soc8S] [^114CShgV] [^116T1Njm].

> Next, I should review first-line imaging. Hold on, I should verify that non-contrast CT is indeed the preferred initial modality and that attenuation in Hounsfield units is the key discriminator. Non-contrast CT is first-line to assess homogeneity and lipid content; lipid-rich adenomas are typically homogeneous with attenuation ≤ 10 HU, and in this scenario, no further imaging is required if the lesion is < 4 cm and nonfunctioning, which is consistent with ESE/ENSAT and AAES positions [^1124VtgU] [^1168uMii] [^11782jLp].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the benign threshold was universally ≤ 10 HU regardless of size, but I should double-check evolving data. Some contemporary analyses propose that for lesions < 4 cm, a ≤ 20 HU threshold may suffice to exclude malignancy in true incidentalomas, and they argue against routine adrenal washout CT in this low-risk population. However, this is not yet uniformly adopted across major guidelines, so I will flag this as an area of controversy and continue to apply the ≤ 10 HU standard in most patients while acknowledging emerging evidence [^117Ah7mN] [^112d58eQ] [^1168uMii].

> I will now examine how to interpret non-contrast CT by size and attenuation to guide next steps. If the lesion is ≤ 4 cm and ≤ 10 HU, I can be confident it is benign and no further imaging is needed; if it is 1–4 cm with HU 11–20, I should consider one repeat non-contrast CT or MRI at 6–12 months to confirm stability; if it is ≥ 4 cm or has HU > 20, I should suspect primary adrenal malignancy and discuss multidisciplinary management and surgical referral, recognizing that size ≥ 4 cm and HU > 20 carry the highest concern and that pediatric patients warrant a lower threshold for surgery [^115Hgen8] [^114CShgV].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of washout CT before I over-order it. Traditional teaching favored adrenal protocol CT with delayed washout for indeterminate lesions, with absolute percentage washout > 60% supporting adenoma. However, recent critiques argue washout CT adds little in true incidentalomas and may be unnecessary when non-contrast features and endocrine testing are applied, so I should reserve washout CT for cases where it will change management and avoid it when HU are already ≤ 10 or when the lesion is < 4 cm with low suspicion [^111vJT4U] [^116Mkohs] [^117Ah7mN].

> Next, I should review the mandatory hormonal evaluation, because missing a functional tumor would be a key error. All patients with an adrenal incidentaloma ≥ 1 cm should undergo biochemical testing for autonomous cortisol secretion with a 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, screening for pheochromocytoma with plasma free metanephrines, and, if hypertensive or hypokalemic, evaluation for primary aldosteronism with aldosterone and renin. I need to ensure I do not omit catecholamine testing in lipid-rich lesions, as guidelines still recommend universal screening despite older suggestions to skip when HU ≤ 10 [^115PFCBY] [^114AWGe4].

> Let me consider management pathways by imaging phenotype and hormonal status. If the lesion has benign imaging features (≤ 10 HU, < 4 cm, homogeneous) and is nonfunctioning, I should discharge the patient without routine scheduled follow-up, given the very low risk of malignancy or later hyperfunction. If the lesion is indeterminate (1–4 cm, HU 11–20), I should repeat non-contrast CT or MRI at 6–12 months to confirm stability. If the lesion is high risk (≥ 4 cm, HU > 20, heterogeneous, irregular margins), I should refer for surgical evaluation and consider PET/CT or additional imaging based on clinical context and history of malignancy [^1168uMii] [^115tz1Ys] [^112Dv8qu].

> I should confirm the indications for adrenalectomy so I don't over- or under-operate. Surgery is indicated for any functional tumor regardless of size, for nonfunctioning tumors ≥ 4 cm or with HU > 20 or other suspicious imaging features, and for documented growth exceeding 20% with at least a 5 mm absolute increase on serial imaging; minimally invasive adrenalectomy is preferred when feasible, but open surgery remains appropriate for large, invasive, or high-suspicion lesions, ideally at high-volume centers with adrenal expertise [^111hxQ7X] [^115Hgen8] [^115PdzfL].

> But wait, what if the patient has a history of extra-adrenal malignancy; I need to ensure I adjust the pathway. In patients with prior malignancy, the risk of adrenal metastasis is higher, so I should obtain PET/CT for indeterminate adrenal lesions, consider adrenal biopsy only if it will change management and pheochromocytoma has been excluded, and avoid further adrenal-specific imaging if the lesion is clearly benign on non-contrast CT, tailoring decisions to the primary cancer and disease status [^115xqeDB] [^113DzDkm] [^114QzVut].

> Next, I should review surveillance protocols for patients managed nonoperatively so I don't over-image. For indeterminate 1–4 cm lesions, one repeat non-contrast CT or MRI at 6–12 months is reasonable; if stable, many guidelines support stopping further imaging, whereas growth exceeding 20% plus ≥ 5 mm should prompt surgical consideration; repeat hormonal testing is not routinely needed unless new clinical features emerge, though patients with mild autonomous cortisol secretion may benefit from periodic reassessment of cortisol status and comorbidities [^115Hgen8] [^115tz1Ys] [^112ehP7x].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In patients < 18 years, I should maintain a lower threshold for surgical referral due to higher ACC risk. In patients with poor health or frailty, I should individualize and avoid aggressive interventions unlikely to improve outcomes. In bilateral adrenal masses, I should evaluate each lesion independently and individualize management, especially if bilateral hyperplasia or adenomas with mild autonomous cortisol secretion are present. In pregnancy, MRI without gadolinium is preferred to avoid radiation [^114CShgV] [^11378H7Q] [^117JfEGn] [^115zjqhM].

> Hold on, I should verify quality improvement levers because real-world adherence is often poor. Embedding explicit recommendations for hormonal testing in radiology reports and establishing multidisciplinary adrenal pathways improve completion of biochemical evaluation and timeliness of care. Electronic systems and prioritization strategies can reduce time to MDT and costs while improving safety, and referral to endocrinology increases the likelihood of complete workups and appropriate surgical triage [^115TCF3C] [^117AQ1UM] [^11641Pn9].

> Let me reconsider the main controversies so I don't overstate consensus. There is ongoing debate about raising the benign attenuation threshold from 10 to 20 HU for small lesions and about the role of washout CT, with some experts arguing these traditional tools lead to over-investigation in low-prevalence incidentalomas; until guidelines converge, I will apply the ≤ 10 HU standard for homogeneous lesions < 4 cm while acknowledging emerging data and tailoring to patient risk and local expertise [^117Ah7mN] [^112d58eQ] [^1168uMii].

> In summary, I should confirm the incidentaloma definition, perform a targeted clinical assessment, obtain non-contrast CT as first-line imaging, interpret attenuation and size to stratify risk, complete universal hormonal testing for cortisol, catecholamines, and aldosterone when indicated, escalate to surgery for functional or high-risk lesions, surveil indeterminate lesions with a single 6–12 month repeat if nonoperative, and embed system-level supports to ensure reliable, cost-effective care pathways [^115Hgen8] [^111hxQ7X] [^115tz1Ys].

After an adrenal incidentaloma is found on CT, follow a **stepwise approach**: confirm it's a true incidentaloma (≥ 1 cm, no known malignancy or adrenal symptoms) [^114E7j18], then obtain a **non-contrast CT** to assess attenuation and size [^1124VtgU]; if ≤ 10 HU and homogeneous, no further imaging is needed [^1168uMii]. For indeterminate lesions (11–20 HU or 1–4 cm), repeat non-contrast CT or MRI in 6–12 months [^115Hgen8]; for ≥ 4 cm or > 20 HU, discuss surgery and consider PET/CT [^112Dv8qu]. All patients need biochemical testing for cortisol, metanephrines, and aldosterone if hypertensive [^114AWGe4]. Management is guided by imaging and hormonal results: surgery for functional tumors, suspicious imaging, or growth > 20% with ≥ 5 mm increase [^115Hgen8]; otherwise, surveillance with repeat imaging and selective hormone retesting [^115tz1Ys].

---

## Initial confirmation and characterization

Confirm that the lesion is a **true incidentaloma** — ≥ 1 cm, no known extra-adrenal malignancy, and no clinical suspicion of adrenal disease [^114AWGe4]. Obtain a **non-contrast CT** to measure attenuation (HU) and assess size, homogeneity, and growth [^111JGsWt].

---

## Imaging-based risk stratification

| **Imaging feature** | **Risk category** | **Recommended action** |
|-|-|-|
| ≤ 10 HU, homogeneous, < 4 cm | Benign | No further imaging [^1168uMii] |
| 11–20 HU or 1–4 cm | Indeterminate | Repeat non-contrast CT or MRI in 6–12 months [^115Hgen8] |
| ≥ 4 cm or > 20 HU | Suspicious | - Multidisciplinary discussion <br/> - Consider PET/CT <br/> - Surgical referral [^112Dv8qu] |

---

## Biochemical evaluation

Perform **hormonal testing** in all patients with adrenal incidentalomas ≥ 1 cm [^111hxQ7X]:

- **Cortisol**: 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test [^116qkURQ].
- **Metanephrines**: Plasma free metanephrines for pheochromocytoma [^114VG2mk].
- **Aldosterone**: Aldosterone-to-renin ratio if hypertensive or hypokalemic [^114VG2mk].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated for:

- **Functional tumors**: Autonomous cortisol secretion, pheochromocytoma, or aldosteronoma [^115PFCBY].
- **Suspicious imaging**: ≥ 4 cm, > 20 HU, or heterogeneous lesions [^112Dv8qu].
- **Growth**: > 20% increase with ≥ 5 mm absolute increase on follow-up [^115Hgen8].

---

## Surveillance protocols

For **benign lesions** (≤ 10 HU, < 4 cm, nonfunctioning), no routine follow-up imaging is needed [^11641bnC]. For **indeterminate lesions** (11–20 HU or 1–4 cm), repeat non-contrast CT or MRI in 6–12 months; if stable, discontinue imaging [^115Hgen8]. For **functional tumors**, monitor clinically and biochemically; consider repeat imaging if clinical status changes [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

In patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy, the **risk of metastasis is higher**; use PET/CT and consider biopsy if it will change management [^1131jbVG] [^113DzDkm]. In patients younger than 18 years, maintain a lower threshold for surgical referral due to higher malignancy risk [^114CShgV]. In elderly or comorbid patients, individualize management to frailty and comorbidities [^11378H7Q].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Non-contrast CT**: First-line to assess attenuation and size [^1124VtgU].
- **Benign features**: ≤ 10 HU, homogeneous, < 4 cm → no further imaging [^114gHwiz].
- **Indeterminate**: 11–20 HU or 1–4 cm → repeat imaging in 6–12 months [^115Hgen8].
- **Suspicious**: ≥ 4 cm or > 20 HU → multidisciplinary review, PET/CT, surgical referral [^112Dv8qu].
- **Biochemical testing**: Cortisol, metanephrines, aldosterone (if hypertensive) [^114AWGe4].
- **Surgery**: Functional tumors, suspicious imaging, or significant growth [^111z3aT3].
- **Surveillance**: Tailored to imaging and hormonal results [^111z3aT3].

---

This stepwise approach balances the **risks of malignancy and hormone excess** against the harms of overtreatment, ensuring appropriate management of adrenal incidentalomas.

Introduction

The malignant potential of a small, incidentally found lesion of the adrenal gland causes great anxiety amongst patients, but rarely causes harm. An adrenal incidentaloma (AI) is defined as mass measuring greater than 1 cm on the adrenal gland found fortuitously during radiographic imaging. The diameter of the average AI measures approximately 3–3.5 cm on Computed Tomography (CT) scan. With increased utilization and advancements in the sensitivity of medical imaging, adrenal masses are observed in as many as 4.4% of all patients undergoing CT scan.

Over the past two decades, an increasing body of evidence has supported restructuring the current guidelines for the management of AIs. Most AIs result in the histological diagnosis of benign adrenal cortical adenoma. Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is more commonly diagnosed at younger ages than benign adrenal masses and is found more often in males than females. For patients without a history of malignancy, the estimated prevalence of ACC is less than 2 cases per million adrenal lesions identified. Twenty-five percent of benign masses increase in size during follow up; however, given the estimated 1 in 1000 risk of malignant transformation over time for benign masses, continued observation may be an appropriate option. Exposing patients to additional risks with surgery for a rare chance of cancer in smaller adrenal masses may not be warranted.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) guidelines have changed over the last decade in regards to excision based on size from a previous cutoff of ≥ 6 cm to now only > 4 cm. Current clinical guidelines recommend a workup to include contrasted cross-sectional imaging and a functional evaluation to investigate for hormonal activity. Surgical excision is then recommended if the lesion is radiographically suspicious, > 4 cm in size, or hormonally active. Due to the rarity of ACC, most of these recommendations are based on information obtained from controlled trials without randomization (Level 3 Evidence).

Because there have been few randomized controlled studies regarding the management of AIs, there is a lack of qualified management guidelines for patient care. To address this clinical question, we sought to perform a collaborative effort reviewing ten years of adrenalectomy data comparing pathologic outcomes based on size criteria. It was hypothesized that our data would further support a needed modification in the current guidelines for removal of AIs.

Adrenal adenomas are incidentally identified in up to 5% of computer tomography scans performed for unrelated indications. A proportion of these adrenal incidentalomas are found to autonomously secrete cortisol based on definitions in current guidelines. Epidemiological studies suggest that chronic exposure to mild glucocorticoid excess from adrenal incidentalomas is associated with significantly increased cardiometabolic risk. However, current management guidelines adopt a conservative approach as no large prospective randomized studies have demonstrated that these patients benefit from surgery. This narrative review examines the epidemiological and mechanistic studies related to three common clinical settings of mild glucocorticoid excess to gain further insight into the potential benefits of treating patients with adrenal incidentaloma and possible autonomous cortisol secretion.

### The landmark series: evaluation and management of adrenal incidentalomas [^111z3aT3]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Adrenal incidentalomas are adrenal masses ≥ 1 cm discovered on imaging studies for unrelated clinical conditions. The prevalence of adrenal incidentalomas has increased as a byproduct of the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging, particularly in older adults. The clinical significance of adrenal incidentalomas varies based on tumor size, hormonal activity, and imaging characteristics. While most adrenal incidentalomas are benign and asymptomatic, a significant minority are hormonally active or malignant, necessitating careful evaluation and management. Adrenal hormone secretion can have significant clinical implications. Biochemical testing is crucial to assess for hormone excess, including steroid hormones (mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens), which are made in the adrenal cortex, as well as catecholamines, which are made in the adrenal medulla. Non-contrast computed tomography (CT) is the preferred modality for evaluating adrenal nodules as it allows for assessment of tissue density in Hounsfield units (HU). Benign lesions typically have an homogeneous appearance with HU ≤ 10. Contrast-enhanced CT with delayed washout can help differentiate benign tumors from malignant tumors. Tumors ≥ 4 cm, or those with indeterminate features may require further imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. The management of adrenal incidentalomas is determined by hormonal secretion and imaging characteristics. Surgical resection is recommended for functional tumors and those that are suspicious for malignancy, including tumors ≥ 4 cm in size and those with rapid growth. Non-functional tumors < 4 cm may undergo imaging surveillance. The goal of this review is to summarize the contemporary literature and guidelines on adrenal incidentalomas, and to describe the key principles regarding evaluation and management.

### Prevalence and outcomes of incidental imaging findings: umbrella review [^114kfAZ9]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Our results also equip clinicians to make evidence based decisions regarding the management of patients with incidentalomas. Clinicians who routinely request images have expressed uncertainty regarding further investigations and/or treatment of incidentalomas. Clinicians, particularly primary care physicians, are unsure which incidentalomas require urgent further investigation, nor are they sure which incidentalomas are likely to be benign. As such, there have been calls for "more research to investigate potential outcomes (of incidentalomas)". Our study helps meet these calls. For 12 different organs, we provide the prevalence of malignancy from incidentalomas, and list the other, non-malignancy outcomes. These data will reduce uncertainty surrounding clinical management of incidentalomas and thus help clinicians make evidence based management decisions. Our results will also help clinicians adequately inform patients about the likely outcomes from incidental findings. For instance, our results provide clinicians with the data to confidently reassure patients that an adrenal incidentaloma is likely to be benign. Our results similarly equip clinicians to urgently investigate a patient with an incidental finding of the breast. Although our results can equip clinicians and patients to make evidence based decisions regarding the management of incidental findings, clinicians should interpret the available evidence in the context of the individual patient.

Lastly, our results can be used to support evidence based guidelines concerning the management of incidental findings. New and updated guidelines can reduce uncertainty in the management of incidental findings internationally. We elaborate on the guideline implications from our results in the Policy makers section below.

Patients

Healthcare is moving towards a shared decision making model. In this patient centred approach, diagnostic and treatment decisions are made collaboratively between clinician and patient. A major barrier to achieving shared decision making is the difficulty informing patients appropriately of the intricacies and complexity of clinical decisions. One solution to duly inform patients is evidence based decision guides. Ideally, these guides should inform patients of the chance of an incidental finding from an imaging scan, and might also explain the likely outcomes of different incidentalomas. Our study provides the data to fill these decision guidelines and thus adequately inform patients. This could facilitate a truly shared decision on whether to undergo an imaging scan and help decide the next steps for handling an incidentaloma.

### Discrepancies in the recommended management of adrenal incidentalomas by various guidelines [^111dyqpe]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Adrenal incidentalomas are being discovered with increasing frequency, and their discovery poses a challenge to clinicians. Despite the 2002 National Institutes of Health consensus statement, there are still discrepancies in the most recent guidelines from organizations representing endocrinology, endocrine surgery, urology and radiology. We review recent guidelines across the specialties involved in diagnosing and treating adrenal incidentalomas, and discuss points of agreement as well as controversy among guidelines.

Materials and Methods

PubMed®, Scopus®, Embase™ and Web of Science™ databases were searched systematically in November 2019 in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement to identify the most recently updated committee produced clinical guidelines in each of the 4 specialties. Five articles met the inclusion criteria.

Results

There is little debate among the reviewed guidelines as to the initial evaluation of an adrenal incidentaloma. All patients with a newly discovered adrenal incidentaloma should receive an unenhanced computerized tomogram and hormone screen. The most significant points of divergence among the guidelines regard reimaging an initially benign appearing mass, repeat hormone testing and management of an adrenal incidentaloma that is not easily characterized as benign or malignant on computerized tomography. The guidelines range from actively recommending against any repeat imaging and hormone screening to recommending a repeat scan as early as in 3 to 6 months and annual hormonal screening for several years.

Conclusions

After reviewing the guidelines and the evidence used to support them we posit that best practices lie at their convergence and have presented our management recommendations on how to navigate the guidelines when they are discrepant.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® adrenal mass evaluation: 2021 update [^115r88ig]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The appropriate evaluation of adrenal masses is strongly dependent on the clinical circumstances in which it is discovered. Adrenal incidentalomas are masses that are discovered on imaging studies that have been obtained for purposes other than adrenal disease. Although the vast majority of adrenal incidentalomas are benign, further radiological and biochemical evaluation of these lesions is important to arrive at a specific diagnosis. Patients with a history of malignancy or symptoms of excess hormone require different imaging evaluations than patients with incidentalomas. This document reviews imaging approaches to adrenal masses and the various modalities utilized in evaluation of adrenal lesions. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Summarised recommendations for adrenal incidentaloma management

Based on the presented evidence, and with acknowledgement of areas requiring further research, the following AI management principles are provided:

Definition of adrenal incidentalomas

A robust definition of an AI inherently delineates a population with an extremely low prevalence of malignancy. To reiterate, we define AIs as ≥ 1 cm lesions in patients without current or prior extra-adrenal malignancy, or clinically suspected adrenal disease. AIs with overtly benign imaging features, such as myelolipomas or cysts, or those with long-term stability (for now, defined as 6–12 months) do not require further evaluation.

Recommendation for hormonal correlation

Radiology reports should include a recommendation to perform a hormonal evaluation for all remaining AIs, which will identify nearly all PCC, as well as most ACC. Additionally, endocrine correlation identifies subclinically functional adenomas (including MACS), where clinical management may take precedence. Recommending additional endocrinologist referral may depend on local preferences, as in some regions, to manage cost and access issues, endocrine testing can be performed by primary care physicians, with endocrinologist referral limited to those with abnormal results.

Elimination of adrenal washout CT

In the defined AI population, and with application of endocrine assessment, current evidence indicates no role for AWCT.

Categorisation on noncontrast CT

On ncCT (Fig. 1), homogeneous AIs ≤ 20 HU and ≤ 4 cm, or as per existing guidelines, < 10 HU and any size, are considered benign (Category-1), with no imaging follow-up required. AIs which are > 20 HU and 1–4 cm, OR 10–20 HU but > 4 cm, are highly likely benign (Category-2), and therefore 6–12 month ncCT is currently suggested as supported by most AI guidelines, purely to identify growth or stability.

Fig. 1
Management of adrenal incidentalomas on noncontrast CT a. a Table only to be used in conjunction with summarised recommendations. HU, Hounsfield unit

Those > 20 HU AND > 4 cm are considered higher risk (Category-3), with multidisciplinary meeting or surgical referral recommended, albeit acknowledging that most will still be of benign aetiology. As discussed prior, a more cautious approach is advised if AIs are > 40 HU and/or > 6 cm.

### Diagnosis, management, and follow-up of the incidentally discovered adrenal mass: CUA guideline endorsed by the AUA [^1119fiaa]. The Journal of Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Incidental adrenal masses are common and require a multidisciplinary approach to evaluation and management that includes family physicians, urologists, endocrinologists, and radiologists. The purpose of this guideline is to provide an updated approach to the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of adrenal incidentalomas, with a special focus on the areas of discrepancy/controversy existing among the published guidelines from other associations.

Materials and Methods

This guideline was developed by the Canadian Urological Association (CUA) through a working group comprised of urologists, endocrinologists, and radiologists and subsequently endorsed by the American Urological Association (AUA). A systematic review utilizing the GRADE approach served as the basis for evidence-based recommendations with consensus statements provided in the absence of evidence. For each guideline statement, the strength of recommendation was reported as weak or strong, and the quality of evidence was evaluated as low, medium, or high.

Results

The CUA working group provided evidence- and consensus-based recommendations based on an updated systematic review and subject matter expertise. Important updates on evidence-based radiological evaluation and hormonal testing are included in the recommendations. This guideline clarifies which patients may benefit from surgery and highlights where short term surveillance is appropriate.

Conclusion

Incidentally detected adrenal masses require a comprehensive assessment of hormonal function and oncologic risk. This guideline provides a contemporary approach to the appropriate clinical, radiographic, and endocrine assessments required for the evaluation, management, and follow-up of patients with such lesions.

### Adrenal referral pattern: management of patients with an adrenal incidentaloma [^11641Pn9]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are found in 3%-4% of abdominal computed tomography scans. Timely evaluation of their functional status and malignant potential is necessary to guide nonoperative surveillance or surgery. This study aims to evaluate the adherence of referring service patterns to the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guidelines for the biochemical workup of AIs at a tertiary surgical clinic.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of 125 patients evaluated for AIs at the endocrine surgery clinic between 2017 and 2022. Information on patient demographics, referral source, and reasons for referral was collected. The appropriateness of the biochemical workup for AIs by referring physicians was assessed. Statistical analyses included chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests.

Results

Referrals came from endocrinologists (44.8%), other subspecialists (31.2%), and primary care physicians (PCPs) (19.2%). Among 125 patients, diagnoses included benign adrenal masses (52.8%), aldosteronomas (10.4%), cortisol-secreting tumors (15.2%), pheochromocytomas (12.8%), and metastatic masses (4.0%). Endocrinologists were more likely to conduct a complete biochemical workup compared to other subspecialties and PCPs (P < 0.001). Eighty-three (66.4%) patients underwent adrenalectomy, with those referred by endocrinologists more likely to undergo surgery than those referred by other subspecialties and PCPs (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the time from the initial clinic visit to surgery by referral source (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Over half of AIs referrals to the endocrine surgery clinic came from subspecialists and PCPs rather than endocrinologists. Familiarizing all referring physicians with American Association of Endocrine Surgeons/Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guidelines may reduce undiagnosed functional AI cases and facilitate timely surgical management.

Adrenal incidentaloma guidelines and endocrine evaluation

Initial AI guidelines were conservative, with the combined American Associations of Clinical Endocrinologists and Endocrine Surgeons 2009 publication recommending re-imaging of radiologically benign lesions (< 4 cm and < 10 HU), at 3–6 months, then annually for 1–2 years, a stance that has perpetuated as recently as 2017.

The American College of Radiology 2010 Incidental Findings White Paper and 2017 update, however, proposed that radiologically benign lesions: myelolipomas, non-enhancing lesions ± calcification, those ≤ 10 HU (or with MRI opposed-phase signal loss), and lesions with ≥ 1 year stability did not require imaging follow-up. Notably, they also recommended AWCT for lesions > 10 HU.

Similarly, AWCT and the 10 HU threshold were incorporated into the 2011 & 2023 Canadian Urological Association, 2016 & 2023 European Society of Endocrinology (ESE)/European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENSAT), 2017 Korean Endocrinology Society and 2023 BMJ Best Practice guidelines.

Additionally, these guidelines all recommend initial hormone testing for AIs, as approximately 15% are hormonally active, and 20–50% of adenomas may cause mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS). Whilst the details lie beyond this article's scope, the recommended initial endocrine assessment includes: clinical examination for hormone excess; testing for cortisol secretion and metanephrines; and aldosterone/renin ratios, sex-hormones and steroid precursors in select populations (Table S1). In the 2023 ESE revision, metanephrine assessment for lesions < 10 HU was removed, following studies demonstrating phaeochromocytomas (PCCs) were consistently above this threshold.

We therefore reiterate that radiology reports for all AIs (excluding non-adenomatous benign aetiologies, such as myelolipomas and cysts) include a generalised recommendation for hormonal evaluation. In one study, this improved rates of endocrine testing from 13.9 to 48.0%, whilst 100% were evaluated if seen by endocrinologists, implying additional benefits of recommending endocrinologist referral.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for adrenal incidentaloma, more specifically with respect to imaging follow-up, ENSAT/ESE 2023 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining one repeat non-contrast CT or MRI after 6–12 months to exclude significant growth in patients with an indeterminate adrenal mass opting not to undergo adrenalectomy following initial assessment.
Consider performing surgical resection if the lesion enlarges by > 20% in maximum diameter during this period, in addition to at least a 5 mm increase in maximum diameter. Consider obtaining additional imaging again after 6–12 months if there is a growth of the lesion below this threshold.

The ACR Incidental Findings Committee (IFC) presents recommendations for renal masses that are incidentally detected on CT. These recommendations represent an update from the renal component of the JACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The Renal Subcommittee, consisting of six abdominal radiologists and one urologist, developed this algorithm. The recommendations draw from published evidence and expert opinion and were finalized by informal iterative consensus. Each flowchart within the algorithm describes imaging features that identify when there is a need for additional imaging, surveillance, or referral for management. Our goal is to improve quality of care by providing guidance for managing incidentally detected renal masses.

### Washed up: the end of an era for adrenal incidentaloma CT [^117Ah7mN]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

For over 20 years, the two key tenets of adrenal incidentaloma (AI) evaluation have been the upper threshold of 10 Hounsfield units (HU) on noncontrast CT (ncCT) to delineate benignity, and the utilisation of adrenal washout CT (AWCT) to evaluate those above this cutoff. In light of growing recent evidence that challenges these two traditional principles, as well as re-evaluation of the data that led to their acceptance, we conclude that neither of these mainstays of adrenal CT remains relevant in modern AI diagnostic workup. With an appropriate definition of an incidentaloma and endocrine assessment for the majority of adrenal lesions, our analysis establishes that the use of AWCT should be ceased in the assessment of AIs, and that a 20 HU attenuation threshold for lesions < 4cm should replace the traditional 10 HU threshold to exclude malignancy in this patient population. We therefore propose new recommendations for the management of AIs based primarily on CT attenuation and lesion size on ncCT. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Increasing the CT attenuation threshold to 20 HU for lesions < 4cm and eliminating washout CT for true adrenal incidentalomas, together with recommendations for endocrine assessment, will significantly decrease the over-investigation of overwhelmingly benign adrenal lesions, whilst confidently excluding malignancy. KEY POINTS: True incidentalomas exclude current or prior extra-adrenal malignancy and clinically suspected adrenal disease. Adrenal washout CT was never proven in the malignancy-sparse true incidentaloma population. Hormonal correlation in parallel with < 20 HU and < 4 cm thresholds of homogeneous lesions on noncontrast CT excludes malignancy.

### Surgery for advanced adrenal malignant disease: recommendations based on European Society of Endocrine Surgeons consensus meeting [^113uDnHJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Incidental radiological abnormalities of the adrenal glands can be identified in between 1 in 10 and 1 in 20 CT images in adults. The current challenge is to institute cost-efficient clinical pathways, to avoid excessive investigations in patients with benign non-functional adrenal tumours, to ensure that functional tumours are identified and treated, and to avoid missing the very rare but extremely aggressive adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs).

The relative rarity of malignant adrenal tumours makes it very difficult to organize randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to address areas of uncertainty, so most of the guidelines published in recent years have been based on level III–V evidence. In this context, it is important to review the information from recent cohort studies to ensure that the management of contemporaneous patients is in line with up-to-date evidence.

The European Society of Endocrine Surgeons (ESES) has dedicated the 2023 symposium to discussing the management of advanced endocrine malignant tumours. This paper summarizes current knowledge and discusses areas of uncertainty related to the management of ACC, malignant phaeochromocytoma, and adrenal metastases. The emphasis is on data published in the past decade, and on changes to surgical practice since the previous similar publication from ESES in 2012and after the publication of most recent clinical guidelines from the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENSAT), the European Society for Endocrinology, the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (NANETS), and the European Society of Medical Oncology.

Recognize that the likelihood of malignancy is still low. Prefer obtaining immediate additional imaging according to the center's expertise and availability in most cases. Obtain interval imaging in 6–12 months (non-contrast CT/MRI) if the tumor is still judged as an indeterminate mass and surgery is not performed.

### Incidental adrenal nodules [^1177wYAZ]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Incidentally detected adrenal nodules are common, and prevalence increases with patient age. Although most are benign, it is important for the radiologist to be able to accurately determine which nodules require further testing and which are safely left alone. The American College of Radiology incidental adrenal White Paper provides a structured algorithm based on expert consensus for management of incidental adrenal nodules. If further diagnostic testing is indicated, adrenal computed tomography is the most appropriate test in patients for nodules less than 4 cm. In addition to imaging, biochemical testing and endocrinology referral is warranted to exclude a functioning mass.

### Adrenal incidentaloma [^111YChyt]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

An adrenal incidentaloma is now established as a common endocrine diagnosis that requires a multidisciplinary approach for effective management. The majority of patients can be reassured and discharged, but a personalized approach based upon image analysis, endocrine workup, and clinical symptoms and signs are required in every case. Adrenocortical carcinoma remains a real concern but is restricted to < 2% of all cases. Functional adrenal incidentaloma lesions are commoner (but still probably < 10% of total) and the greatest challenge remains the diagnosis and optimum management of autonomous cortisol secretion. Modern-day surgery has improved outcomes and novel radiological and urinary biomarkers will improve early detection and patient stratification in future years to come.

Q: What diagnostic tests should be performed in all patients with an adrenal incidentaloma. A: An overnight dexamethasone suppression test should be performed in all patients with adrenal incidentaloma. Guidelines recommend that all patients with adrenal incidentaloma undergo biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma because these tumors may be clinically silent. However, some investigators have suggested that biochemical screening for pheochromocytoma is not necessary in a patient who has a lipid-rich tumor with a computed tomography attenuation of 10 Hounsfield units or less, because these tumors are rarely pheochromocytomas. Any patient with adrenal incidentaloma and hypertension or hypokalemia should be screened for primary hyperaldosteronism with measurement of the mid-morning plasma aldosterone concentration and plasma renin activity.

A: Tumor size and imaging features are key to determining the likelihood of cancer and guiding treatment. Although many studies of the risks of cancer associated with tumor size are limited by small samples, retrospective design, and selection bias, data consistently support associations between tumors that are larger than 4 cm in greatest diameter and an increased risk of cancer among patients with a unilateral adrenal mass. A: On CT imaging, features other than tumor size can help to differentiate benign from malignant adrenal incidentalomas, although the ultimate diagnosis is based on histologic findings or clinical follow-up. Irregular tumor margins, heterogeneity, necrosis, vascularity, and calcification are features that arouse suspicion for cancer. An attenuation of 10 Hounsfield units or less on unenhanced CT is consistent with a benign lesion; in a series of 1161 adrenal tumors with an attenuation of 10 Hounsfield units or less, no malignant tumors were observed.

Guidelines differ with respect to follow-up recommendations for nonfunctioning tumors that are smaller than 4 cm in diameter with attenuation of 10 Hounsfield units or less, but the most recent guidelines recommend that no follow-up imaging is needed unless clinical manifestations develop. All other adrenal incidentalomas with indeterminate features on imaging may warrant additional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT, magnetic resonance imaging with chemical-shift analysis, positron-emission tomography–CT with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose, or all of these tests. The management of these masses should be individualized and should involve a multidisciplinary team consisting of an endocrinologist, an endocrine surgeon, and a radiologist.

### Adrenal lesions found incidentally: how to improve clinical and cost-effectiveness [^117AQ1UM]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Adrenal incidentalomas are lesions that are incidentally identified while scanning for other conditions. While most are benign and hormonally non-functional, around 20% are malignant and/or hormonally active, requiring prompt intervention. Malignant lesions can be aggressive and life-threatening, while hormonally active tumours cause various endocrine disorders, with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite this, management of patients with adrenal incidentalomas is variable, with no robust evidence base. This project aimed to establish more effective and timely management of these patients.

Methods

We developed a web-based, electronic Adrenal Incidentaloma Management System (eAIMS), which incorporated the evidence-based and National Health Service–aligned 2016 European guidelines. The system captures key clinical, biochemical and radiological information necessary for adrenal incidentaloma patient management and generates a pre-populated outcome letter, saving clinical and administrative time while ensuring timely management plans with enhanced safety. Furthermore, we developed a prioritisation strategy, with members of the multidisciplinary team, which prioritised high-risk individuals for detailed discussion and management. Patient focus groups informed process-mapping and multidisciplinary team process re-design and patient information leaflet development. The project was partnered by University Hospital of South Manchester to maximise generalisability.

Results

Implementation of eAIMS, along with improvements in the prioritisation strategy, resulted in a 49% reduction in staff hands-on time, as well as a 78% reduction in the time from adrenal incidentaloma identification to multidisciplinary team decision. A health economic analysis identified a 28% reduction in costs.

Conclusions

The system's in-built data validation and the automatic generation of the multidisciplinary team outcome letter improved patient safety through a reduction in transcription errors. We are currently developing the next stage of the programme to proactively identify all new adrenal incidentaloma cases.

Surgical Management of Adrenal Incidentaloma

Indications for unilateral adrenalectomy

The principle threat of a unilateral adrenal lesion, with indeterminate imaging characteristics, is an ACC. For ACC without metastases, surgery is the most important single therapeutic measure. Guidelines recommend that surgery for patients with ACC should be limited to referral centers and performed by surgeons with expertise in adrenal surgery (open and laparoscopic) and with a volume of more than 15 adrenalectomies per year (benign and malignant).

Patients with a functional unilateral adenoma, with clinically significant hormone excess, are offered unilateral adrenalectomy. Patients with a unilateral adrenal adenoma and ACS, are considered for surgery on an individual basis and after MDT discussion. Surgery is taken into consideration along with the patient's age, degree of cortisol excess, general health, comorbidities, and patient preference. In all patients, considered for surgery, ACTH-independent cortisol excess should be confirmed.

There is no absolute size for the recommendation of surgery in nonfunctioning adenomas. Due to the paucity of follow-up data on the natural history of large suspected benign AIs, and the realization that the larger the mass, the higher the incidence of malignancy, surgery may be considered in larger lesions (> 4 cm) even if imaging characteristics suggest a benign lesion. Any indeterminate nodule on imaging greater than 4 cm should be offered surgery.

Occasionally myelolipomas and adrenal cysts are removed if they get to a significant size and cause compressive symptoms. Adrenal metastases are resected if appropriate in the context of the underlying pathology. In general, patients are deemed suitable if the underlying extra-adrenal malignancy is controlled, the metastasis is isolated to the adrenal gland and the patient has an adequate performance status to justify aggressive treatment.

### Imaging of adrenal masses [^115zjqhM]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Adrenal lesions are common and require appropriate management when clinically relevant. The approach to the evaluation of an adrenal lesion is to exclude malignancy and hormone excess as these are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

Methods

Imaging of adrenal lesions primarily aims to identify features indicating benignity. Noncontrast computed tomography is recommended as first-line imaging for adrenal lesions. Indeterminate lesions that require further characterization may proceed to adrenal protocol computed tomography (with contrast) or magnetic resonance imaging, with a trend in recent years towards increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography may also be used to assess adrenal lesions in certain clinical scenarios.

Results

Clinical guidelines recommend that all adrenal incidentalomas require further dedicated imaging unless they are clearly benign on imaging. The imaging strategy of adrenal lesions depends upon a number of factors including patient history, nature of detection, imaging characteristics (size, heterogeneity, presence of intracellular lipid), and the presence or absence of hormone excess. Special considerations are given to pregnant patients, young patients < 40 years, and those with a history of an extra-adrenal malignancy.

Conclusion

This review outlines the role of imaging for adrenal lesions, describes the various imaging options and investigation strategies, and highlights relevant imaging findings.

- evidence of hormone excess (including mild autonomous cortisol secretion in patients with clinically relevant comorbidities potentially attributable to cortisol)

### Adrenal incidentalomas – a continuing management dilemma [^114jzmKA]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Adrenal incidentalomas (AI), adrenal tumors detected through an imaging procedure done for reasons unrelated to adrenal dysfunction, is becoming a common clinical problem with the more frequent utilization of different imaging techniques. Most such tumors are benign and hormonally inactive. A variety of diagnostic strategies have been developed to distinguish the latter; however, they are still controversial. Even after a commissioned systematic review of the literature and a state of the science conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, the optimal strategy for hormonal screening of a patient with AI is unknown, but we anticipate further refinements and major advances in the field. Surgery is the ultimate solution for the diagnostic-therapeutic dilemma of AI. Careful planning is required, and the learning curve which influences clinical decision making is especially relevant to immediate outcomes. The benefit of making a diagnosis of a clinically significant AI must be considered in the context of the patient's overall condition and preferences.

Follow-up in patients without surgery

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommends repeated imaging for up to 5 years for benign tumors. However, the more recent European guidelines do not recommend further imaging for benign, nonfunctioning lesions of less than 4 cm. Patients with adrenal lesions over 4cm or indeterminate lesions, who have not undergone surgery are recommended to have repeat imaging, either a noncontrast CT or MRI in 6 to 12 months, the optimal timing is at the discretion of the MDT and depends on the index of suspicion. Surgical resection is recommended if there is a 20% increase in size, in addition to at least a 5 mm increase in diameter over this period. Both adrenocortical cancers and metastases usually demonstrate rapid growth over months, in contrast to a benign adenoma. Further imaging should be undertaken, again at 6 to 12 months, if there is an increase in size, but not at the threshold for surgical intervention. For younger patients, MRI surveillance, rather than CT, is preferred due to lower radiation exposure. In elderly patients follow up with imaging, even with nodules over 4 cm might be favored over surgery, in the presence of multiple comorbidities. Patients are treated on an individual basis but it is acknowledged that many clinicians and patients would not feel comfortable following up a tumor over 4 cm on imaging, even if radiologically benign, in a young patient and surgery is often the preferred option.

Repeat hormonal testing is not advised in patients without evidence of hormone oversecretion on their initial assessment. It should only be considered if patients develop new clinical signs of adrenal hormone hypersecretion or worsening of comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, or osteoporosis.

The risk of patients with ACS progressing to overt Cushing's syndrome is negligible; however, ACS is associated with numerous comorbidities. If patients with ACS do not undergo surgery initially, they should be annually reassessed for cortisol hypersecretion and potential worsening of comorbidities. If there is clinical or biochemical progression then patients can be re-evaluated for surgery.

Imaging

Non-contrast, or unenhanced, CT is the preferred initial imaging modality for the evaluation of adrenal incidentalomas. CT allows assessment of tissue density or tissue attenuation and is essential to assess the likelihood of malignancy in adrenal lesions. An adrenal mass is considered benign if it appears homogeneous and lipid-rich, with a density of ≤ 10 HU on an unenhanced CT scan. While standard contrast-enhanced CT is not suitable for distinguishing benign from malignant adrenal tumors, CT with delayed washout is more helpful. An adrenal protocol CT includes an unenhanced sequence followed by intravenous contrast administration with repeat imaging at 60–75 s (venous phase) and again at 15 min (delayed phase). Injected intravenous contrast washes out of benign lesions more rapidly than malignant lesions. Specifically, benign adenomas demonstrate an absolute percentage washout > 60% at 15 min delay, which is therefore used as a key diagnostic cut-off.

The 2023 ESE/European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours (ESNAT) guidelines recommend that the initial step is differentiating benign from malignant adrenal incidentalomas using a non-contrast CT. If non-contrast CT is consistent with a benign adrenal incidentaloma, i.e. homogenous in appearance and HU ≤ 10, no further imaging is required. This marks a significant shift from prior recommendations.

Tumor size is a key characteristic that determines management, due to the correlation between tumor size and risk of malignancy. In 2002, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) published a consensus recommendation on adrenal incidentalomas, which classified adrenal tumors measuring < 4 cm as having a low risk of malignancy, those between 4 and 6 cm as indeterminate, and tumors ≥ 6 cm as having a high risk of malignancy. Multiple international society guidelines continue to use a cut-off size of 4 cm to determine management. For indeterminate nodules 1–4 cm in size on CT, either immediate additional imaging (adrenal protocol CT or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) or interval imaging in 6–12 months is recommended due to a slightly increased risk of malignancy. Nodules ≥ 4 cm with indeterminate imaging characteristics are typically recommended for surgical resection.

### Washed up: the end of an era for adrenal incidentaloma CT [^112d58eQ]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

For over 20 years, the two key tenets of adrenal incidentaloma (AI) evaluation have been the upper threshold of 10 Hounsfield units (HU) on noncontrast CT (ncCT) to delineate benignity, and the utilisation of adrenal washout CT (AWCT) to evaluate those above this cutoff. In light of growing recent evidence that challenges these two traditional principles, as well as re-evaluation of the data that led to their acceptance, we conclude that neither of these mainstays of adrenal CT remains relevant in modern AI diagnostic workup. With an appropriate definition of an incidentaloma and endocrine assessment for the majority of adrenal lesions, our analysis establishes that the use of AWCT should be ceased in the assessment of AIs, and that a 20 HU attenuation threshold for lesions < 4 cm should replace the traditional 10 HU threshold to exclude malignancy in this patient population. We therefore propose new recommendations for the management of AIs based primarily on CT attenuation and lesion size on ncCT.

Critical relevance statement

Increasing the CT attenuation threshold to 20 HU for lesions < 4 cm and eliminating washout CT for true adrenal incidentalomas, together with recommendations for endocrine assessment, will significantly decrease the over-investigation of overwhelmingly benign adrenal lesions, whilst confidently excluding malignancy.

Key Points

True incidentalomas exclude current or prior extra-adrenal malignancy and clinically suspected adrenal disease.
Adrenal washout CT was never proven in the malignancy-sparse true incidentaloma population.
Hormonal correlation in parallel with < 20 HU and < 4 cm thresholds of homogeneous lesions on noncontrast CT excludes malignancy.

Policy makers

Our results are relevant for policy makers in two ways: to inform new guidelines about the management of organ specific incidentalomas, and to update existing guidelines. We report the outcomes of incidentalomas across 12 different organs (table 2), as well as the meta-analysed prevalence of malignancy (table 4). Guidelines exist in the United States and Europe for the management of incidentalomas for five organs (pituitary, adrenal, ovary, kidney, and thyroid). Guidelines concerning pituitary and adrenal incidentalomas offer recommendations for clinicians requesting imaging, whereas the remaining three guidelines (ovary, renal, and thyroid) target radiologists and their recommendations assume a level of radiological expertise.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American Association of Endocrine Surgeons 2009 guideline on the management of adrenal incidentalomastargets non-radiologist clinicians and recommends: "Patients with an adrenal incidentaloma should undergo evaluation clinically, biochemically, and radiographically for signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism, aldosteronism (if hypertensive), the presence of a pheochromocytoma, or a malignant tumour". This recommendation appears congruent with our results; our data suggest that around 12% of patients with adrenal incidentalomas will have subclinical Cushing's syndrome (also known as low level autonomous cortisol secretion). However, the same guideline recommends: "Patients with adrenal incidentalomas who do not fulfil the criteria for surgical resection need to have radiographic re-evaluation at 3 to 6 months and then annually for 1 to 2 years". This recommendation is incongruent with our data: we found that less than 1% of adrenal incidentalomas are malignant. The more recent 2016 European Society of Endocrinology recommendationsare more closely aligned with our results, but are also somewhat conservative: "We recommend that all adrenal incidentalomas undergo an imaging procedure to determine if the mass is homogeneous and lipid rich and therefore benign. For this purpose, we primarily recommend the use of non-contrast computed tomography. We suggest that if the non-contrast computed tomography is consistent with a benign adrenal mass (Hounsfield units ≤ 10) that is homogeneous and smaller than 4 cm, no further imaging is required".

Essential Points

Adrenal incidentaloma (AI) is a common endocrine diagnosis affecting ~2% of the general population, but over 7% of those over 70 years. It is rare in subjects below 40 years of age
~2% of patients with AI have adrenocortical cancer
Up to 10% of patients with AI have autonomous secretion of adrenal hormones
The initial investigation of choice is an unenhanced computed tomography scan of both adrenal glands
Pheochromocytoma and autonomous cortisol secretion should be excluded in every case and aldosteronism in patients with underlying hypertension and/or hypokalemia
Most patients with AI can be discharged once malignancy and hormone hypersecretion have been excluded
A causative link between cortisol hypersecretion and age-related comorbidities should be firmly established before recommending surgical excision

The use of diagnostic imaging has increased dramatically over the last 3 decades, driven by several factors, including technological advancement in imaging modalities, growing awareness of preventive care, the rising number of diagnostic imaging centers, and increasing prevalence of chronic disease driven in large part by an aging population. According to estimates from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in 2016, the United States performed 245 computed tomography (CT) scans per 1000 population compared with a mean of 151 per 1000 population across 11 other high-income countries. For magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) the figures were 118 per 1000 population in the US and 82 per 1000 in other countries. Therefore, approximately 80 million CT scans are performed each year in the US, and in the UK over 5 million CT scans were performed in 2018. Improvements in imaging modalities and their increasing use have led to the increased discovery of unexpected pathological findings. One of the most common unexpected findings revealed by CT, MRI, or ultrasonography is an incidental adrenal mass or incidentaloma. An adrenal incidentaloma (AI) is defined as a clinically unapparent adrenal mass greater than 1 cm in diameter detected during imaging performed for reasons other than for suspected adrenal disease. The term "incidentaloma" was coined in 1982 by Geelhoed and Druy, who recognized that with the advent of improved resolution of radiological techniques clinicians were faced with the unfamiliar dilemma of early diagnosis of an asymptomatic adrenal mass. This strict definition, recognized by the European Society of Endocrinology and European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ESE/ENSAT), excludes adrenal lesions discovered during the screening of patients with hereditary syndromes or extra-adrenal tumors. Current guidelines do not recommend that incidentally discovered adrenal lesions with a diameter < 1 cm undergo further investigation unless clinically indicated.

### Likelihood ratio of computed tomography characteristics for diagnosis of malignancy in adrenal incidentaloma: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Qh6f4]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Adrenal incidentaloma, a clinically silent adrenal mass, detected inadvertently during diagnostic tests or treatment for causes other than adrenal disease, was first described more than 20 years ago. During recent years, widespread application of noninvasive and sensitive imaging techniques has led to an increased detection of incidentalomas. These adrenal masses occur in 0.35–9% of all abdominal computerized tomography (CT) scans that increases to as much as 10% in the elderly peaking in fifth and seventh decades. In autopsies or cases of prior malignancy the prevalence of previously undetected adrenal tumors increases again.

36–94% of these masses are benign cortical adenomas, and even in patients with a known carcinoma of any histology only 19–75% of the masses are metastatic. However, because of high mortality rate of malignant lesions with less than 50 percent 5-year overall survival for adrenal cortical carcinoma, it is needed to rule out these lesions. The prevalence of adrenal carcinoma reaches to 3–17 per million in general population, however, adrenal incidentaloma has a chance of 1.2–12% to be malignant.

The first step in the evaluation of an adrenal mass is to classify it as a hormonally active or a nonfunctional mass. In the second step the mass should be verified for the risk of malignancy. Typical characteristics of benign adenomas on CT include smooth contour, sharp margin and small size, while typical features of carcinoma are heterogeneity, tumor calcification and large size. The problem is that significant overlap with malignant lesions limits the usefulness of size as a criterion. The nature of incidentally found adrenal masses is more questionable when the size is 3–6 cm. It is important to keep in mind that with present strategies, the diagnosis process is not cost-effective with more than necessary rate of operation and the need for a better guideline is repeated in the literature.

The aim of this study was to answer what are the Likelihood Ratios (LRs) of different characteristics of adrenal masses in CT scan as the method of choice to diagnose malignancy in patients with adrenal incidentaloma. Subsequently we purposed to suggest an evidence based flowchart for evaluation of malignancy of the adrenal mass by CT scan helping us to choose the best time for operation.

Importance

Adrenalectomy is the definitive treatment for multiple adrenal abnormalities. Advances in technology and genomics and an improved understanding of adrenal pathophysiology have altered operative techniques and indications.

Objective

To develop evidence-based recommendations to enhance the appropriate, safe, and effective approaches to adrenalectomy.

Evidence Review

A multidisciplinary panel identified and investigated 7 categories of relevant clinical concern to practicing surgeons. Questions were structured in the framework Population, Intervention/Exposure, Comparison, and Outcome, and a guided review of medical literature from PubMed and/or Embase from 1980 to 2021 was performed. Recommendations were developed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology and were discussed until consensus, and patient advocacy representation was included.

Findings

Patients with an adrenal incidentaloma 1 cm or larger should undergo biochemical testing and further imaging characterization. Adrenal protocol computed tomography (CT) should be used to stratify malignancy risk and concern for pheochromocytoma. Routine scheduled follow-up of a nonfunctional adrenal nodule with benign imaging characteristics and unenhanced CT with Hounsfield units less than 10 is not suggested. When unilateral disease is present, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is recommended for patients with primary aldosteronism or autonomous cortisol secretion. Patients with clinical and radiographic findings consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma should be treated at high-volume multidisciplinary centers to optimize outcomes, including, when possible, a complete R0 resection without tumor disruption, which may require en bloc radical resection. Selective or nonselective α blockade can be used to safely prepare patients for surgical resection of paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma. Empirical perioperative glucocorticoid replacement therapy is indicated for patients with overt Cushing syndrome, but for patients with mild autonomous cortisol secretion, postoperative day 1 morning cortisol or cosyntropin stimulation testing can be used to determine the need for glucocorticoid replacement therapy. When patient and tumor variables are appropriate, we recommend minimally invasive adrenalectomy over open adrenalectomy because of improved perioperative morbidity. Minimally invasive adrenalectomy can be achieved either via a retroperitoneal or transperitoneal approach depending on surgeon expertise, as well as tumor and patient characteristics.

Conclusions and Relevance

Twenty-six clinically relevant and evidence-based recommendations are provided to assist surgeons with perioperative adrenal care.

### Approach to the patient with adrenal incidentaloma [^116qkURQ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Adrenal tumors are commonly discovered incidentally on cross-sectional abdominal imaging performed for reasons other than adrenal mass. Incidence of adrenal tumors increased 10-fold in the past 2 decades, with most diagnosed in older adults. In any patient with a newly discovered adrenal mass, determining whether the adrenal mass is malignant and whether it is hormonally active is equally important to guide the best management. Malignancy is diagnosed in 5% to 8% of patients with adrenal tumors, with a higher risk in young patients, if history of extra-adrenal malignancy, in those with large adrenal tumors with indeterminate imaging characteristics, and in bilateral adrenal tumors. Although overt hormone excess is uncommon in adrenal incidentalomas, mild autonomous cortisol secretion can be diagnosed in up to 30% to 50% of patients. Because autonomous cortisol secretion is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and metabolic abnormalities, all patients with adrenal incidentalomas require work up with dexamethasone suppression test. Management of adrenal tumors varies based on etiology, associated comorbidities, and patient's preference. This article reviews the current evidence on the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with adrenal mass and focuses on management of the most common etiologies of adrenal incidentalomas.

Where should the focus of future adrenal incidentaloma research be?

Whilst we believe there is sufficient data to support our recommendations thus far, we acknowledge other aspects of AI workup presently lack strong evidence. We therefore encourage further research into these areas to assist in refining an algorithmic approach to AI management.

Further attenuation and size subcategorisation

Further stratification of subgroups within and beyond the stated 20 HU and 4 cm thresholds (e.g. combinations of 10–20 HU, 20–40 HU; 1–2 cm, 2–4 cm, 4–6 cm, > 6 cm) may enable reduced imaging for additional benign lesions. Some evidence suggests a more cautious approach may be appropriate for all lesions > 40 HU on ncCT given the relative infrequency of adenomas in this range; however, this data was obtained primarily in the context of PCC determination. Additionally, some studies indicate lesions > 6 cm have a significantly increased risk of malignancy, independent of attenuation. Conversely, there is early data that AIs below a size threshold of 1.5 cm may not require cortisol testing; however, larger validation studies are required.

Post-contrast CT detected adrenal incidentalomas

For AIs first detected on post-contrast CT with indeterminate imaging features, ncCT may be performed. However, given the established low ~0.1% risk of malignancy of true AIs < 4 cm of any attenuation, it may be possible that ncCT could be delayed 6–12 months in this subgroup to simultaneously allow growth assessment. Additionally, further research may identify subgroups where ncCT may not be required at all.

Stability and growth

Current guidelines indicate a variable range of 6–12-month stability as evidence of benignity, and there is currently only limited data assessing adenoma versus ACC growth rates. Further research into both these areas is therefore warranted.

Spectral CT attenuation

Historic studies have been based on conventional 120 kVp imaging data; however, attenuation values derived from spectral CT, including virtual noncontrast measurements, may differ. With the expected proliferation of photon-counting CT, it will be important to establish how spectral CT attenuation measurements can be used in AL assessment.

Heterogeneous lesions and morphology

A recent study indicated that attenuation measurement in heterogeneous lesions has poor diagnostic performance. Furthermore, heterogeneity and other morphologic features in some studies have shown high specificity but poor sensitivity for indicating malignancy. Further investigation into the management of heterogeneous nodules is therefore warranted, noting recent disappointing results also for MRI in differentiating adenomas and metastases by heterogeneity and T2-weighted signal.

### Management of the clinically inapparent adrenal mass… [^114VG2mk]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

The adrenal glands are located on top of the kidneys and secrete hormones that regulate metabolism, salt and water balance, and stress responses. Most adrenal masses are found incidentally on autopsy and are benign, but a small number can be malignant. When adrenal masses are discovered incidentally during diagnostic studies for other clinical conditions, they are commonly termed "incidentalomas. "When an adrenal mass is discovered, management depends on determining whether the lesion is nonfunctioning or hormonally active and whether it is benign or malignant. Grumbach and associates reported on a National Institutes of Health conference on the management of clinically inapparent adrenal masses. Evaluation of the patient with a clinically inapparent adrenal mass revealed by an imaging study includes a complete history and physical examination, biochemical evaluation for hormone excess and, possibly, further radiologic imaging studies.

An overnight dexamethasone suppression test is useful to detect subclinical hypercortisolism, an entity of unknown clinical significance. A plasma free-metanephrine determination can detect or rule out pheochromocytoma. If the patient has hypertension, a serum potassium level and a plasma aldosterone concentration–plasma renin activity ratio can identify primary aldosteronism. Imaging studies can be helpful in differentiating benign from malignant lesions. On computed tomography, almost all lesions smaller than 4 cm with smooth borders are benign. Lesions between 4 and 6 cm that are hormonally inactive can be monitored. In contrast, lesions greater than 6 cm in size are more likely to be malignant, and surgery should be considered. Fine-needle aspiration may be useful in equivocal situations, but only after pheochromocytoma has been excluded. If an incidentaloma is nonfunctioning, variables that affect management include the size, imaging characteristics, and growth rate of the lesion.

Excision is generally recommended for lesions greater than 6 cm in size, lesions with imaging characteristics indicative of malignancy, and lesions with a rapid growth rate. Follow-up for patients with adrenal incidentalomas includes monitoring tumor size by computed tomography and repeat hormonal evaluation. Resection of an adrenal mass may be done by open or laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. The authors conclude that although more information is needed about the natural history and evaluation of clinically inapparent adrenal masses, most are benign and do not require intense long-term clinical follow-up.

### Management of incidental adrenal masses: a white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^111PrJUK]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The ACR Incidental Findings Committee presents recommendations for managing adrenal masses that are incidentally detected on CT or MRI. These recommendations represent an update to the adrenal component of the JACR 2010 white paper on managing incidental findings in the adrenal glands, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The Adrenal Subcommittee, constituted by abdominal radiologists and an endocrine surgeon, developed this algorithm. The algorithm draws from published evidence coupled with expert subspecialist opinion and was finalized by a process of iterative consensus. Algorithm branches categorize incidental adrenal masses on the basis of patient characteristics and imaging features. For each specified combination, the algorithm concludes with characterization of benignity or indolence (sufficient to discontinue follow-up) and/or a subsequent management recommendation. The algorithm addresses many, but not all, possible pathologies and clinical scenarios. Our goal is to improve the quality of patient care by providing guidance on how to manage incidentally detected adrenal masses.

With increased detection comes an increased demand for evidence-based clinical recommendations to appropriately guide health care personnel in the management of AIs. Multiple authors have demonstrated the benign nature of the majority of small adrenal masses. The AACE and AAES published guidelines a decade ago highlighting their recommendations for workup and management of such lesions. In short, they recommend clinical, biochemical, and radiologic evaluation of patients with signs of hypercortisolism, hyperaldosteronism (if hypertensive), pheochromocytoma, or malignancy. Adrenalectomy is recommended after hormonal evaluation in patients with a mass ≥ 4 cm or with malignant features on CT scan. Adrenalectomy is also recommended in smaller, less suspicious tumors in the presence of hormonal abnormalities as evidenced by aldosterone concentration/renin activity, plasma-free metanephrines and normetanephrines, and overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test. Patients in whom adrenalectomy is not recommended (< 4 cm homogenous lesions with regular borders and < 10 HU on non-contrast CT) should follow surveillance guidelines, which are discussed below.

Discussion

Continued innovation in imaging modalities has enhanced sensitivity in identifying abnormalities of the adrenal glands. The prevalence of adrenal adenomas in the general population is estimated at 3–7%, with the overwhelming majority of those discovered incidentally demonstrating benign pathology. However, because the risk of primary adrenocortical carcinoma is reported to be as high as 4.7% in patients with incidentally discovered adrenal masses, characterization and appropriate treatment remain crucial. The prevalence of clinically unapparent adrenal masses at autopsy is reported at nearly 2.1%. Detection is increasing with the advent of modern imaging technology. Estimates of incidence range from 0.1% for general health ultrasound screening to 0.42% in patients evaluated for non-endocrine symptoms to 4.3% in patients previously diagnosed with cancer. This prevalence also varies with age, at < 1% for patients younger than 30 years of age and increasing to 7% in patients 70 years of age or older. Overall, incidentally identified adrenal masses occur in up to 9% of CT scans, justifying the need for accurate guidelines to direct their management.

Advancements in imaging also allow for better characterization of adrenal masses prior to biopsy or surgical resection. Technological developments have improved the anatomic resolution, sensitivity, and specificity of cross-sectional imaging modalities, particularly MRI and contrasted CT (recommended modalities in the setting of AI), over the last 15–20 years. This is fueled by the superiority of these modalities over their conventional counterparts in the accurate detection of disease. Similarly, advancements have led to an increase in data generated with more cross-sectional images per scan. Improved cross-sectional imaging allows for detection of intralesional fat, water and blood enabling characterization of benign adrenal masses, such as adenomas, angiomyolipomas, cysts, granulomas and hemorrhage. Nieman et al. emphasize the importance of washout in delayed-phase CT scan due to the high prevalence of benign histology in masses with washout > 50%. When inconclusive, or if concerning features are noted, it may be appropriate to establish a tissue diagnosis by performing adrenal biopsy or perform definitive surgical management for potentially malignant lesions. Accurate characterization is imperative due to the potential for metastases to the adrenal gland, which may preclude surgical or radiation therapy to another primary site.

### Diagnostic dilemmas: a multi-institutional retrospective analysis of adrenal incidentaloma pathology based on radiographic size [^117WKxqZ]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Along with a conservative approach to management comes a need to clarify ongoing surveillance imaging and laboratory evaluation intervals. This is due to a 17%, 29%, 47% risk of AIs converting to functional status and a 6%, 14%, 29% risk of increasing in size at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Current guidelines vary, with most suggesting follow-up guided by clinical judgment and the presumed cause of the mass based on initial workup. National Institute of Health (NIH) data suggests that for masses that are benign-appearing (< 10 HU; washout > 50%), small (< 3 cm), and completely non-functioning, imaging and biochemical reevaluation at 1–2 years (or more) is appropriate, with subsequent follow-up only if the clinical picture changes; the risk of malignancy or subsequent hyperfunction is almost nonexistent though reported conversion to ACC exists in recent literature. For indeterminate lesions, repeat evaluation for growth after 3–12 months is appropriate. Subsequent testing should occur earlier for lesions with increasing size, and later for those with no change. The AAES extends the criteria for "small" AIs to include those < 4 cm and they better outline surveillance recommendations to include radiographic reevaluation at 3 to 6 months, then annually for 1–2 years. Similarly, they suggest hormonal evaluation annually for up to 5 years. Repeat screening for hyperaldosteronism is not perceived to be beneficial, but most authors recommend screening for catecholamine and cortisol excess for at least four years due to the similar appearance of pheochromocytomas to lipid-poor adenomas on CT scan. This is one instance in which clinical judgment can be used to guide surveillance as most pheochromocytomas grow over time suggesting that further imaging may not be indicated in the setting of a stable mass.

Follow-up imaging

European guidelines suggest no further imaging for patients with adrenal lesions with benign characteristics < 4 cm in diameter. This is further supported by a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of nonfunctioning adrenal lesions where a mean tumor growth of 2 mm occurred over a median of 52.8 months, and clinically significant tumor enlargement (≥ 10 mm) occurred in only 2.5% of patients, and none developed adrenal cancer.

Data from a large Italian cohort study reported a 4 cm size cut-off had the highest sensitivity (93%) but low specificity (24%) for prediction of malignancy. For this reason, larger lesions with clear benign features warrant interval reassessment with imaging after 6 to 12 months to exclude significant growth (> 20% increase in size with at least 5 mm absolute increase in diameter) which would prompt surgical resection. Less marked interim lesion growth warrants reassessment with a further scan after 6 to 12 months.

Ideally, every patient with an AI should be managed by an expert MDT, incorporating an endocrinologist, radiologist, pathologist, and a surgeon, with significant expertise in adrenal tumors. However, this is a challenging aspiration given the increasing prevalence of AI. Therefore the ESE/ENSAT guideline identifies certain patients who are most likely to benefit from MDT discussion. This includes conditions where one of the following criteria is met; imaging is not consistent with a benign lesion; there is evidence of hormone excess (including ACS); there is evidence of significant tumor growth during follow-up imaging; and where adrenal surgery is considered.

### Adrenal lesions found incidentally: how to improve clinical and cost-effectiveness [^114DHhYz]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Background

The significant variability in the approach to treating patients with adrenal incidentalomas stems from the fact that there were no UK NHS-compatible guidelines for managing the condition. Guidance has limited utility, as highlighted in a NHS report confirming that adrenal incidentalomas are a common clinical dilemma and the majority of affected patients are inappropriately investigated.

A recent literature review (using search terms including 'adrenal incidentaloma management' and 'adrenal incidentaloma guidance') indicated that US/European guidelines have been largely based on retrospective, limited and often conflicting data relating to thresholds and timelines for planning investigations.NHS management plans are not driven by insurers or fee-for-service payments (unlike US/European-based systems), limiting the relevance of these guidelines to the UK.

A study from a UK district general hospital identified 75 patients with adrenal incidentalomas in 2010. The majority (80%) received no biochemical investigation or follow-up, with only 13 (17%) referred for specialist review and two further patients undergoing additional evaluation in primary care. A further UK study, focusing on biochemical investigations, accepted that, for patients with adrenal incidentaloma, ' Their best management strategy is unknown'. The medical literature emphasises international acknowledgement that these tumours pose a management dilemma, but there is no NHS-compatible system to ensure appropriate management.

Regarding specific circumstances for adrenal incidentaloma, more specifically with respect to patients with extra-adrenal malignancy, ENSAT/ESE 2023 guidelines recommend to consider performing an adrenal biopsy only if all of the following criteria are met:

- hormonally inactive lesion (particularly pheochromocytoma has been excluded)

- inconclusive characterization of the lesion as benign by imaging

- histology will alter the clinical management.

### American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for adrenalectomy: executive summary [^111hxQ7X]. JAMA Surgery (2022). High credibility.

American Association of Endocrine Surgeons — adrenal incidentaloma evaluation and surveillance are specified with strong recommendations and growth-based management guidance: We recommend that all patients with an adrenal incidentaloma 1 cm or larger undergo biochemical testing for autonomous cortisol secretion; patients with hypokalemia or hypertension also require biochemical evaluation for primary aldosteronism, and patients with adrenal imaging findings that have noncontrast CT with HU greater than 10 should undergo evaluation for pheochromocytoma (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.). We recommend that a primary adrenal malignancy be considered in patients with an adrenal incidentaloma larger 4 cm and/or HU greater than 20 on noncontrast CT and in any patient younger than 18 years, and we recommend that patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy be recognized to be at increased risk for adrenal metastases (Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.). Most nonfunctional adrenal nodules with benign imaging characteristics remain stable in size, but up to 10% of adrenal incidentalomas will grow 1 cm or more over 2 to 5 years of surveillance; surgical resection may be considered for nodules that are larger than 2 cm at initial presentation and grow more than 1 cm by 12 months, while smaller nodules or those with less growth may undergo repeated short-interval imaging at 6 to 12 months. The risk context provided notes 3% in patients without a history of malignancy and up to 8% in patients with a history of extra-adrenal malignancy.

### Managing incidental findings on abdominal CT: white paper of the ACR incidental findings committee [^116kHB53]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

As multidetector CT has come to play a more central role in medical care and as CT image quality has improved, there has been an increase in the frequency of detecting "incidental findings", defined as findings that are unrelated to the clinical indication for the imaging examination performed. These "incidentalomas", as they are also called, often confound physicians and patients with how to manage them. Although it is known that most incidental findings are likely benign and often have little or no clinical significance, the inclination to evaluate them is often driven by physician and patient unwillingness to accept uncertainty, even given the rare possibility of an important diagnosis. The evaluation and surveillance of incidental findings have also been cited as among the causes for the increased utilization of cross-sectional imaging. Indeed, incidental findings may be serious, and hence, when and how to evaluate them are unclear. The workup of incidentalomas has varied widely by physician and region, and some standardization is desirable in light of the current need to limit costs and reduce risk to patients. Subjecting a patient with an incidentaloma to unnecessary testing and treatment can result in a potentially injurious and expensive cascade of tests and procedures. With the participation of other radiologic organizations listed herein, the ACR formed the Incidental Findings Committee to derive a practical and medically appropriate approach to managing incidental findings on CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. The committee has used a consensus method based on repeated reviews and revisions of this document and a collective review and interpretation of relevant literature. This white paper provides guidance developed by this committee for addressing incidental findings in the kidneys, liver, adrenal glands, and pancreas.

### Incidental adrenal masses: adherence to guidelines and methods to improve initial follow-up: a systematic review [^115TCF3C]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Incidental adrenal masses (IAMs) are detected in approximately 1%-2% of abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans. Recent estimates suggest that more than 70-million relevant CT scans are performed annually in the United States; thus, IAMs represent a significant clinical entity. Most clinical guidelines recommend an initial follow-up evaluation that includes imaging and biochemical testing after index IAM detection.

Methods

Systematic review of literature in the PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases to determine whether guidelines regarding IAM evaluation are followed and to identify effective management strategies. Our initial search was in January 2018 and updated in November, 2019.

Results

31 studies met inclusion criteria. In most institutions, only a minority of patients with IAMs undergo initial follow-up imaging (median 34%, IQR 20%-50%) or biochemical testing (median 18%, IQR 15%-28%). 2 interventions shown to improve IAM evaluation are IAM-specific recommendations in radiology reports and dedicated multi-disciplinary teams. Interventions focused solely on alerting the ordering clinician or primary care provider to the presence of an IAM have not demonstrated effectiveness. Patients who are referred to an endocrinologist are more likely to have a complete IAM evaluation, but few are referred.

Discussion

Most patients with an IAM do not have an initial evaluation. The radiology report has been identified as a key component in determining whether IAMs are evaluated appropriately. Care teams dedicated to management of incidental radiographic findings also improve IAM follow-up. Although the evidence base is sparse, these interventions may be a starting point for further inquiry into optimizing care in this common clinical scenario.
