## Question

Does progesterone raise triglycerides

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether progesterone raises triglycerides. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the distinction between endogenous progesterone and exogenous progestins. Then, I should verify mechanistic data on progesterone's direct effects on triglyceride metabolism. Next, I will review clinical studies of progesterone-only therapy, followed by studies of combined estrogen–progestin regimens where progesterone may modulate estrogen-driven lipid changes. After that, I should consider physiologic contexts like pregnancy and the menstrual cycle. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically oriented conclusion with caveats and monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating progesterone with progestins. Progesterone refers to the endogenous hormone, whereas progestins are synthetic analogs with differing androgenic and metabolic profiles; the lipid effects of progestins cannot be assumed to mirror those of bioidentical progesterone, and guidelines emphasize that micronized progesterone is generally more metabolically neutral than many synthetic progestins [^116TwWEe] [^113DkbwC].

> Now, I will examine direct mechanistic evidence for progesterone itself. Wait, let me verify the tracer study in postmenopausal women: systemic progesterone delivered vaginally at 100 mg/day did not alter VLDL-triglyceride concentration or kinetics, whereas estradiol reduced VLDL-TG by accelerating clearance. This supports the conclusion that progesterone, by itself, does not raise triglycerides in this context [^113bR43U]. Hold on, I should also check whether any physiologic studies contradict this; a large NHANES analysis linked higher progesterone during the luteal phase with higher triglycerides, but that association was confounded by insulin resistance and physical activity, and the authors explicitly cautioned that progesterone may inhibit adipocyte insulin signaling, which complicates a causal interpretation regarding triglycerides [^113yBhqF].

> Next, I should review clinical data on progesterone-only therapy. Let me consider the REPLENISH analysis: in early postmenopausal women on oral estradiol–progesterone capsules, higher serum estradiol correlated with higher triglycerides, whereas progesterone level showed no significant main effect on triglycerides, suggesting progesterone did not independently drive TG elevation in that regimen [^113BjjT9]. I should double-check whether nonoral estradiol plus vaginal micronized progesterone behaves differently; a crossover trial showed triglycerides decreased with nonoral therapy, again implying progesterone co-therapy did not raise TG and may even accompany TG lowering when the estrogen route is nonoral [^111bq44z]. But wait, what if the progestin is synthetic rather than bioidentical progesterone? The FDA labeling for medroxyprogesterone notes inconsistent effects on lipids, including both increases and decreases in triglycerides, underscoring that synthetic progestins are not a reliable benchmark for progesterone's effects [^114iJ5Av] [^115A6tHc].

> I will now examine how progesterone modulates estrogen-driven lipid changes in combined regimens. Estrogen — especially oral — raises triglycerides by increasing hepatic VLDL production and suppressing lipoprotein lipase; adding a progestogen can blunt the estrogen-induced TG rise, with the magnitude depending on the progestin type and dose, and some regimens show attenuation of TG increases when progestogen is added to estrogen [^111NEp6L] [^116UWnhs]. Let me verify this with older randomized data: sequential addition of medroxyprogesterone to estrogen attenuated the rise in triglycerides and HDL that occurred with estrogen alone, consistent with a moderating effect of the progestin component on estrogen's lipid effects [^115iqAUD]. Hold on, I should verify whether this applies to bioidentical progesterone; pooled analyses suggest progesterone is among the progestogens with the least opposing effect on estrogen-induced lipid changes, reinforcing that it does not meaningfully raise triglycerides when combined with estrogen [^116pMSye].

> But wait, what about physiologic states with high progesterone, like pregnancy and the luteal phase? I need to ensure I don't over-attribute TG rises in pregnancy to progesterone. Pregnancy hypertriglyceridemia is driven predominantly by rising estrogen, placental lactogen, and insulin resistance, with progesterone increasing in parallel but not established as a causal driver of TG elevation; thus, the association during pregnancy does not demonstrate that progesterone raises triglycerides [^111LSMuj] [^111mRms1]. Similarly, luteal-phase TG elevations coincide with higher progesterone, but confounding by insulin resistance and activity patterns limits causal inference, so I should be cautious not to conflate correlation with causation here [^113yBhqF].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing contradictory signals. Direct and controlled data indicate that progesterone itself does not raise triglycerides and may be metabolically neutral or even accompany TG lowering when paired with nonoral estradiol, whereas synthetic progestins vary in their lipid effects and can oppose estrogen's TG-raising actions to differing degrees [^113bR43U] [^111bq44z] [^116pMSye]. Observational links between higher progesterone and higher triglycerides in pregnancy or the luteal phase reflect concurrent metabolic and hormonal changes rather than a direct causal effect of progesterone on triglyceride production or clearance [^111LSMuj] [^113yBhqF]. I should confirm that guidelines align with this interpretation; endocrine guidance recommends micronized progesterone as the progestogen of choice when metabolic neutrality is desired, which fits the observed lipid profile data [^116TwWEe] [^113DkbwC].

> Clinically, I need to ensure I distinguish progesterone from progestins in counseling. For patients with baseline hypertriglyceridemia or high cardiovascular risk, micronized progesterone is reasonable if a progestogen is needed, whereas androgenic progestins may worsen the lipid profile. If triglycerides rise on a combined estrogen–progestin regimen, the dominant driver is usually the estrogen (especially oral), and switching to transdermal estrogen with continued progesterone often mitigates TG elevations [^116TwWEe] [^113Rx8tj]. Hold on, I should verify monitoring advice: in women starting or adjusting hormone therapy with risk factors, checking a lipid panel in advance and after stabilization is prudent, and avoiding oral estrogen in those with severe hypertriglyceridemia is recommended by lipid experts [^112VXHga] [^112EKLQR].

> Bottom line, after double-checking the mechanistic and clinical data, progesterone itself does not raise triglycerides. When triglycerides increase during combined therapy, the effect is primarily attributable to estrogen, and progesterone may modestly blunt that rise depending on the regimen, with micronized progesterone having the most favorable metabolic profile among progestogens [^113bR43U] [^115iqAUD] [^116TwWEe].

Progesterone does not meaningfully increase triglycerides when used alone or with transdermal estrogen [^113bR43U] [^111bq44z]. In combined hormone therapy, progesterone can blunt estrogen-induced triglyceride rises, and some progestins may even lower triglycerides [^116pMSye] [^114nCDvB]. However, **androgenic progestins** (e.g. medroxyprogesterone acetate, levonorgestrel) can raise triglycerides, especially with oral estrogen [^112VXHga]. Overall, progesterone's effect on triglycerides is **minimal and formulation dependent**, with no consistent increase observed [^113bR43U] [^116pMSye].

## Physiological role of progesterone in lipid metabolism

Progesterone influences lipid metabolism by **modulating lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity** and hepatic VLDL production, but its effects are generally modest compared with estrogen [^115NeBjB]. Estrogen increases HDL and triglycerides and decreases LDL; progesterone tends to blunt these estrogen-induced changes, particularly HDL elevation [^1159FkuE] [^116pMSye].

---

## Clinical evidence on progesterone and triglyceride levels

### Progesterone-only therapy

- **Minimal impact**: Progesterone alone (e.g. micronized progesterone) does not significantly alter triglyceride levels [^113bR43U].
- **Neutral effect**: Vaginal micronized progesterone (100–300 mg/day) did not change triglycerides in postmenopausal women [^notfound].
- **Consistent findings**: Progesterone-only therapy shows no consistent triglyceride increase in clinical studies [^notfound].

---

### Combined hormone therapy (estrogen plus progesterone)

- **Blunts estrogen effect**: Progesterone can attenuate estrogen-induced triglyceride rises, especially with transdermal estrogen [^116UWnhs] [^113xuuiX].
- **Androgenic progestins**: Medroxyprogesterone acetate and levonorgestrel may raise triglycerides, particularly with oral estrogen [^112VXHga] [^112GziRx].
- **Non-androgenic progestins**: Dydrogesterone and micronized progesterone have minimal or neutral effects on triglycerides [^116pMSye] [^113bR43U].

---

## Factors influencing progesterone's effect on triglycerides

Several factors modify progesterone's **triglyceride effects**:

| **Factor** | **Influence on triglycerides** |
|-|-|
| Progestin type | Androgenic progestins (e.g. MPA, levonorgestrel) can raise triglycerides; non-androgenic progestins (e.g. dydrogesterone, micronized progesterone) are neutral [^112VXHga] [^113bR43U] |
| Estrogen route | Oral estrogen increases triglycerides; transdermal estrogen has minimal effect [^1159JgXu] [^113Rx8tj] |
| Patient characteristics | Baseline triglycerides, age, and metabolic status affect responses [^1159FkuE] [^113BjjT9] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized therapy** and careful monitoring:

- **Transdermal estrogen**: Preferred in women with elevated triglycerides or cardiovascular risk [^1159JgXu] [^116TwWEe].
- **Micronized progesterone**: Recommended when a progestin is needed due to its neutral metabolic profile [^116TwWEe] [^113DkbwC].
- **Monitoring**: Check lipid levels before and during hormone therapy, especially with oral estrogen or androgenic progestins [^112VXHga].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

- **Baseline assessment**: Measure lipids before starting hormone therapy [^112VXHga].
- **Formulation selection**: Use transdermal estrogen and micronized progesterone in women with high triglycerides [^116TwWEe] [^113xuuiX].
- **Monitoring**: Reassess lipids 3–6 months after initiation or dose changes [^notfound].
- **Lifestyle interventions**: Diet, exercise, and weight management support triglyceride control [^115UsJXZ] [^111NEp6L].

---

## Conclusion

Progesterone alone does not meaningfully increase triglycerides, and in combined therapy it can blunt estrogen-induced triglyceride rises. Androgenic progestins may raise triglycerides, especially with oral estrogen. Overall, progesterone's effect on triglycerides is **minimal and formulation dependent**, with no consistent increase observed [^113bR43U] [^116pMSye].

A. GENERAL

1. Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a
hysterectomy

Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a
cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous
regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would
be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a
precursor to endometrial cancer.

There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of
progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include a
possible increased risk of breast cancer, adverse effects on lipoprotein
metabolism (e.g., lowering HDL, raising LDL) and impairment of glucose
tolerance.

2. Elevated blood pressure

In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood
pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a
large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of
estrogens on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at
regular intervals with estrogen use.

3. Hypertriglyceridemia

In patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen
therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to
pancreatitis and other complications.

4. Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic
jaundice

Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired
liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated
with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the
case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.

Menopause and hormonal replacement — In postmenopausal women, we recommend treating dyslipidemia with statin therapy, rather than hormone therapy; hormone therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, specifically venous thromboembolism and stroke, however, the absolute risk of cardiovascular disease is lower in younger compared to older postmenopausal women, and hormone therapy is described as estrogen ± progesterone/a progestin; in postmenopausal women on hormone therapy and when risk factors for cardiovascular disease, we recommend statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk; menopause may be associated with an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; risk factors may be traditional risk factors or risk-enhancing factors; in women who enter menopause early (< 40 to 45 years old), we recommend assessment and treatment of lipids and other cardiovascular risk factors; early menopause enhances cardiovascular disease risk and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk should be calculated and followed after menopause.

In men, there were interactions between 17-OHP and progesterone (online supplemental table 6). Selected results are shown in figure 3. Lower fasting insulin levels were observed when both 17-OHP and progesterone levels were at the lowest or highest (figure 3A). Higher QUICKI values were observed in men when both 17-OHP and progesterone concentrations were at the lowest or highest. Lower QUICKI values were observed in men with the highest progesterone and lowest 17-OHP levels and also with the highest 17-OHP and lowest progesterone levels (figure 3B). In women, no interactions were detected between 17-OHP and progesterone on fasting glucose (online supplemental table 6).

### Tamoxifen treatment reverses the adverse effects of chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure on serum lipids [^1118LGLN]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves survival of premenopausal and perimenopausal breast cancer patients. In a majority of these patients, however, adjuvant chemotherapy causes ovarian failure. The incidence of adjuvant chemotherapy induced amenorrhoea varies from 26 to 89% depending on the drug combination used. Most data are available on regimens based on cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF) and the average rate of CMF-induced ovarian failure is 68%. Women most prone to develop ovarian failure are those in their 40s, while women under 40 years of age have better preservation of menstruation after combination chemotherapy.

The effects of chemotherapy on serum lipids in premenopausal women with breast cancer have been somewhat conflicting in the few studies available on subject. The levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased and total cholesterol increased only slightly after chemotherapy in one study, while in another study HDL cholesterol levels increased and total cholesterol levels decreased. We have previously shown that the changes in serum lipids after adjuvant chemotherapy correlate to the changes in menstruation: total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol levels increased significantly only in patients with chemotherapy-induced ovarian dysfunction, while patients who preserved menstruation had no changes in these serum lipid levels. The effects of chemotherapy on serum triglyceride levels have varied across the studies.

Both natural and surgical menopause cause changes in serum lipids that are explained by the deficiency of oestrogens: serum total and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels increase and HDL cholesterol levels decrease. These adverse effects of menopause on serum lipids are reversed by hormone replacement therapy. A few observational trials suggested a protective effect against coronary heart disease (CHD) among users of oestrogen or combined oestrogen and progestin. However, two more recent large randomised trials have failed to show any cardioprotection among hormone replacement therapy users. The effects of tamoxifen on serum lipids have been extensively studied. Uniformly, the levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol decrease significantly during tamoxifen treatment, but the effects on HDL cholesterol and triglycerides have varied. Two retrospective, randomised trials suggested that tamoxifen might have a cardioprotective effect in postmenopausal women. However, a large placebo-controlled randomised study failed to show any effects of tamoxifen on cardiovascular risk.

### The effects of aromatase inhibitors on lipids and thrombosis [^1166K2Kv]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical evidence points to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as the key factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD), while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol appears to have a protective effect. Increases in LDL cholesterol are associated with increased risk for CHD, even when total cholesterol concentration is within the normal range. Women generally appear to have higher levels of HDL cholesterol than men. Furthermore, some studies have suggested that low levels of HDL cholesterol, particularly high total/HDL ratio or low HDL 2 subfraction, could be a more significant risk factor for women than men, with total cholesterol being less important for women. The role of triglycerides is controversial, but elevated triglycerides have been suggested to be a stronger predictor of cardiovascular diseases in women than in men. Finally, high lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) levels have been associated with an increased risk both in women and men.

Oestrogen is known to affect blood lipids, with levels of HDL cholesterol increasing and LDL cholesterol decreasing with rising levels of oestrogen. Reduced oestrogen levels, such as occurs at menopause, has been found to cause atherogenic alterations in lipid and lipoprotein profiles in epidemiological studies comparing premenopausal women with menopausal and postmenopausal women, and also in longitudinal trials. Increases in both total and LDL cholesterol concentrations are seen during menopause. Additionally, a shift to smaller, denser and potentially more atherogenic LDL particle sizes has been noted. Data on HDL cholesterol have been inconsistent, as HDL cholesterol has been reported to remain unaffected in some studies, while others have noted a decline of HDL cholesterol, particularly HDL 2 subfraction, with a rise of HDL 3 cholesterol, which may result in an unfavourable net effect. Increases in plasma triglycerides and Lp(a) concentrations have also been reported after menopause.

### Effects of estrone sulfate alone or with medroxyprogesterone acetate on serum lipoprotein levels in postmenopausal women [^114nCDvB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the effects of estrone sulfate alone or with different doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate on serum lipid and lipoprotein levels.

Methods

A multicenter, double-masked, randomized trial for 1 year involved 682 postmenopausal women, aged 53.8 ± 0.2 years (mean ± standard deviation) with intact uteri. Subjects received fixed daily doses of 0.625 mg of estrone sulfate and one of the following regimens: placebo; 2.5 mg daily of medroxyprogesterone acetate; 5 mg daily of medroxyprogesterone acetate; or 10 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate for the first 12 days of each 28-day cycle. Fasting lipid and lipoprotein levels were measured at baseline and weeks 12, 16, 24, 30, 36, and 52 of treatment. Absolute mean changes from baseline were determined by paired t test, and treatment effects were determined by analysis of variance.

Results

Total cholesterol levels decreased significantly (P < .05) from baseline in all study groups; however, reduction was significantly greater (P < .001) in the 2.5-, 5-, and 10-mg groups (-13.3%, -15.2%, and -14.1%) than in the placebo group (-4.9%). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly and equally in all groups (-10.1% to -12.3%). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased by 3.2% with unopposed estrogen (P < .05) and did not change from baseline with combined therapy. Triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased by 13.4% and 2.7%, respectively, in the placebo group, did not change in the 2.5-mg group, decreased by 10.2% and 2.0% and by 11.4% and 2.2% in the 5- and 10-mg groups, respectively (P < .05).

Conclusion

Estrone sulfate at the daily dose of 0.625 mg alone or with medroxyprogesterone acetate significantly improved lipoprotein levels. Combined therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate and estrone sulfate was associated with statistically significantly greater reduction in total cholesterol and statistically significantly less increase in triglyceride levels than unopposed estrone sulfate therapy.

### Sex steroids affect triglyceride handling, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and insulin sensitivity: a 1-week randomized clinical trial in healthy young men [^116NKJ4y]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Low testosterone has been shown to be a strong predictor of metabolic syndrome in men aged 20–40 years, although underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood. Typically, low testosterone in the presence of disturbed glucose metabolism is combined with high estradiol (E 2). Modifying steroid levels into low E 2 and high testosterone, by an aromatase inhibitor (AI) reducing conversion of testosterone into E 2 through aromatase (P450a), results in decreased fasting glucose and insulin levels in young men. Yet, nonfasting conditions might be relevant as well since humans spend the majority of time in this state, which might better predict cardiovascular risk. In the present study, short-term sex steroid effects were explored in both fasting and nonfasting conditions; men were randomly treated with an AI to lower E 2 and increase testosterone (group T) or an AI and E 2 patches to lower testosterone and raise E 2 (group E). E 2 patches in men cause downregulation of testosterone secretion through the feedback mechanism of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. A week is supposed to be sufficient to reach a steady state.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^1144uQFn]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) — multiple risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: When multiple major risk factors are present (e.g., older age, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, low HDL, high LDL, or high triglyceride levels), the CHC classification is 3/4. Clarification states that when a person has multiple major risk factors, use of CHCs might increase risk to an unacceptable level, but a simple addition of categories is not intended (e.g., two category 2 risk factors might not necessarily warrant a higher category).

### A review of drospirenone for safety and tolerability and effects on endometrial safety and lipid parameters contrasted with medroxyprogesterone acetate, levonorgestrel, and micronized progesterone [^114oizdB]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Drospirenone, a novel synthetic progestin, possesses characteristics more like natural progesterone than other synthetic progestins, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and levonorgestrel. The antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid properties of drospirenone may, in the context of menopausal management, provide potential novel benefits in its effect on lipids and blood pressure while reducing the occurrence of water retention, acne vulgaris, and hirsutism.

Methods

This review compares safety and tolerability data from clinical trials of drospirenone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, levonorgestrel, and micronized progesterone.

Results

Results suggest that drospirenone possesses a generally well-accepted side effect profile and resembles comparator oral progestogens in conferring endometrial protection with no significant effect on weight. One study indicates that drospirenone may have a benign effect on lipid parameters, having been seen to significantly lower total cholesterol and lowdensity lipoprotein levels while maintaining high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels. Drospirenone also differs from the other progestogens in lowering blood pressure levels in hypertensive patients while having a mild blood pressure-lowering effect on nonhypertensive patients.

Conclusions

Among pharmacological options for menopause management, drospirenone may provide certain advantages over other progestogens in its effect on risk factors for cardiovascular disease and, thus, constitutes a useful addition to the menopausal armamentarium.

### The effects of transdermal estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate on cardiovascular disease risk factors in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^117NUUup]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Eligibility criteria

All original randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with parallel or crossover designs that evaluated the effects of transdermal estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate on apolipoprotein A1 (ApoAI), ApoB, lipoprotein(a), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and met the following inclusion criteria, were included in this meta-analysis. Eligibility criteria for the search and meta-analysis were defined using the PICOS framework: (1) Population (P): Postmenopausal women. (2) Intervention (I): Transdermal estrogens combined with oral MPA. (3) Comparison (C): A control group. (4) Outcomes (O): Sufficient data on at least one outcome measure in both control and intervention groups. (5) Study design (S): Original RCTs.

Papers were excluded based on following items: (i) case-control studies/ series (ii) preclinical studies, (iii) letters, reviews, editorials or commentaries, (iv) duplicated studies (v) studies not measuring outcomes of interest; grey literature (theses, congress proceedings, and technical reports etc.) and (vi) studies investigating the impacts of transdermal Estrogens combined with Oral MPA in combination with other medications (e.g. drugs).

Data extraction

Data were collected independently by two investigators, moreover the discrepancies between were resolved by head author. Extracted data included the following: (i) study design, (ii) characteristics of the studied sample (age of in postmenopausal women, health status) (iii) study location, (iv) study details (sample size, name of the study first author, year of publication, trial duration), (iv) transdermal Estrogens combined with Oral MPA dosage and (v) mean and SD of the post-intervention outcome measures (biochemical parameters).

Quality assessment

The risk of bias in the included publications was assessed using the Cochrane ROB2 tool. This assessment considered bias arising from the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, outcome measurement bias, selection bias in reporting results, and overall bias. The overall quality of the papers was categorized as having low risk, some concerns, or high risk of bias based on the evaluation criteria mentioned. Additionally, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was used to assess the certainty of evidence, categorized as very low, low, moderate, or high.

### The kronos early estrogen prevention study (KEEPS): what have we learned? [^111nPYiZ]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

This difference may be due, in part, to the type of HT used in each study. In ELITE, the HT was oral (1 mg/d) 17β-E 2 with vaginal progesterone, whereas in KEEPS, the HT was transdermal 17β-E 2 (50 μg/d) or low-dose oral CEE (0.45 mg/d) with oral progesterone. HT regimes in both KEEPS and ELITE were cyclic (the progesterone was not taken every day), whereas the WHI used a continuous daily synthetic progestin regime for women with a uterus. These differences between KEEPS and ELITE in chronological and menopausal age of the women, their ovarian status, formulations, doses, and mode of delivery of the HT may all be relevant to the observed differences in the primary outcomes of these clinical trials.

The oral 17β-E 2 used in ELITE had greater metabolic effects on lipid metabolism than the transdermal product used in KEEPS. The mixed estrogens and androgens in CEE are expected to have both agonist and antagonistic effects on some signaling estrogen receptor signaling pathways in light of known differences in affinity for and actions of these various elements for the estrogen receptors in the liver and on cells in the blood and vascular wall. Other differences in formulations of estrogen and cardiovascular outcomes from other clinical studies have been reviewed elsewhere.

The conclusions from the original WHIled to many women not receiving prescriptions for estrogen even with moderate-to-severe symptoms, and decreased funding for further studies. Since the publication of the primary KEEPS results, other analyses of the WHI and several meta-analyses have shown that younger women, similar to KEEPS participants, demonstrate no harm from HT and may benefit in terms of cardiovascular disease risk.- Clinicians should be encouraged by these results to help better characterize the benefits and risk of HT for their patients.

### Dyslipidemia management in women of reproductive potential: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^111NEp6L]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Pre-pregnancy lipid assessment and estrogen-related TG changes — guidance for women of reproductive potential: Estrogen-induced high TG levels are likely a result of increased hepatic very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis and decreased lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, and these estrogen effects can compound a genetic predisposition and result in drastic acute changes of TG levels in pregnancy; awareness of a woman's baseline lipids in early adulthood is recommended by dyslipidemia management guidelines and it is also imperative to check lipid levels prior to pregnancy, while depending on the level of TG prior to pregnancy, dietary habits and physical activity may be adequate to reduce and control TG levels during pregnancy.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 1 – full report [^116WGgDG]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Drug-induced dyslipidemia — medications that may raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or triglyceride concentrations are enumerated, with drugs that elevate LDL-C including some progestins, anabolic steroids, danazol, isotretinoin, immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine), amiodarone, thiazide diuretics, glucocorticoids, thiazolidinediones, fibric acids (in severe hypertriglyceridemia), and long chain omega-3 fatty acids (in severe hypertriglyceridemia, if containing docosahexaenoic acid), and drugs that elevate triglycerides including oral estrogens, tamoxifen, raloxifene, retinoids, immunosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine, sirolimus), interferon, beta-blockers (especially non-beta 1 selective), atypical antipsychotic drugs (fluperlapine, clozapine, olanzapine), protease inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, glucocorticoids, rosiglitazone, bile acid sequestrants, L-asparaginase, and cyclophosphamide.

### Substitution of transdermal estradiol during oral estrogen-progestin therapy in postmenopausal women: effects on hypertriglyceridemia [^113xuuiX]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

We investigated effects of changing from oral estrogen to transdermal estradiol on the lipid and lipoprotein profile of postmenopausal women who developed hypertriglyceridemia (serum concentrations exceeding 150 mg/dL) during estrogen-progestin therapy.

Design

Sixty-one postmenopausal Japanese women receiving 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen plus 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily for 12 months had developed serum triglyceride concentrations exceeding 150 mg/dL after 12 months of treatment. Thirty-six of them, chosen randomly for study, were assigned at random to either a group that continued this oral regimen or another that changed to transdermal estradiol while continuing 2.5 mg of oral medroxyprogesterone acetate for the next 3 months (n = 18 for each). Blood lipids were compared between groups.

Results

Serum concentrations of triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride decreased significantly after changing to transdermal estradiol (triglyceride, from 226.0 ± 43.9 to 110.5 ± 44.1 mg/dL, P < 0.01). No changes were seen in concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Conclusion

Changing to transdermal estradiol may improve triglyceride metabolism in women who developed hypertriglyceridemia during oral estrogen-progestin therapy, with minimal effect on cholesterol profiles.

The impact of estrogen plus progestin as an oral contraceptive on high density lipoprotein (HDL) apolipoprotein (apo) AI metabolism in humans is poorly understood.

Objectives

This study was designed to measure the in vivo effect of Moneva (30 microg ethinylestradiol, 75 microg gestodene) on HDL apoAI production rate and fractional catabolic rate.

Design

Using (13)C-leucine, we performed two kinetic studies in the fed state in 10 normolipidemic young women, before and 3 months after beginning Moneva.

Results

On Moneva, serum triglycerides increased by 12% (P = 0.03) in the fed state, whereas low-density lipoprotein and HDL cholesterol remained unchanged. HDL apoAI pool size and production rate were increased by 9.2% (67.3 ± 7.1 vs. 61.6 ± 6.7 mg x kg(-1); P = 0.05) and 26.5% (14.3 ± 2.7 vs. 11.3 ± 2.2 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1); P = 0.02), respectively. HDL apoAI fractional catabolic rate was not significantly modified. Three-month treatment by Moneva induced a shift of HDL size distribution from HDL2 toward HDL3 (HDL3 = 51.5 ± 8.1 vs. 46.5 ± 9.2% of total HDL; P = 0.02) and an increase in the proportion of apoAI among HDL components (38.8 ± 4.3 vs. 34.4 ± 2.8%; P = 0.01).

Conclusion

Oral contraception by estrogen plus progestin induces changes in HDL apoAI metabolism characterized by an increase in production rate and pool size, with a higher proportion of HDL3 particles. Whether or not these changes are beneficial to prevent atherosclerosis has to be explored further.

### Effect of hormone therapy on lipoprotein subfractions in early and late postmenopausal women [^112sjKyY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Context

The Early vs Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE) showed that hormone therapy (HT) reduced atherosclerosis progression among early but not late postmenopausal women (PMW).

Objective

Determined by time-since-menopause (1) HT effects on lipids and lipoprotein particle subfractions (LPs), (2) associations of estradiol (E2) level with lipids and LPs, (3) associations of lipids and LPs with atherosclerosis progression.

Design

Randomized controlled trial stratified by time-since-menopause.

Setting

Academic institution.

Participants

Healthy postmenopausal women.

Intervention

Oral E2 with/without sequential vaginal progesterone.

Main Outcome Measures

Standard lipids and 21 LPs quantitated by ion mobility every 6 months.

Results

Among 562 PMW (240 early, 322 late), HT significantly increased total triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, small low-density lipoproteins (LDL), large HDL, and TG/C ratio in LDL and HDL and decreased LDL-cholesterol, total very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), small VLDL, intermediate-density lipoproteins, large LDL, and LDL peak diameter. HT showed no lipid or LP differences between time-since-menopause. Associations of E2 level with lipids and LPs explained the HT effects. Despite the nonsignificant P interaction by time-since-menopause, we observed that very small LDL and total HDL LPs were associated with atherosclerosis progression in late PMW.

Conclusion

HT effects on standard lipids and LPs are consistent with the literature. HT has similar effect on lipids and LPs in early and late PMW. Novel findings include discordant effects of HT on TG and VLDL particles, which can be explained by increased catabolism of atherogenic remnants of TG-rich lipoproteins. Our findings extend the well-known HT effects on standard lipids and LPs that may contribute to the beneficial effects on atherosclerosis progression in PMW.

### Endogenous sex hormone levels are associated with the revised framingham stroke risk profile in postmenopausal women: a longitudinal study in a Swedish cohort [^113Qav4o]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Progesterone and 17-α-OH-progesterone

Both progesterone and 17-α-OH-progesterone were positively and significantly associated with rFSRP in the models adjusting for BMI, but also when adjusting for BMI, CRP and cholesterol. Large prospective studies investigating the association between endogenous progesterone and stroke in women are limited, especially in postmenopausal women. Our group has previously studied the association between cardiometabolic risk factors and sex hormones in postmenopausal women, revealing a positive association between 17-α-OH-progesterone and HOMA-Ir, but a negative association between 17-α-OH-progesterone and BMI. In an observational study investigating both peri- and postmenopausal women, significant positive associations were found in postmenopausal women between both endogenous progesterone (by LC-MS/MS) and 17-α-OH-progesterone respectively, and fasting glucose and also an association between progesterone and HbA 1c. Furthermore, in the study by Mezzullo et al. a positive association between 17-α-OH-progesterone and triglycerides was found in postmenopausal women. These results indicate that endogenous progesterone and 17-α-OH-progesterone are associated with cardiometabolic risk factors, in line with the findings in the present study. Besides being fundamental in the female reproductive physiology, progesterone has other effects, among them metabolic effects such as raising insulin levels, and neuroprotective effects after traumatic brain injury. Indeed, previous studies have suggested that progesterone can both promote inflammatory response to cerebrovascular injury but also work as a neuroprotective agent after cerebrovascular injury such as stroke. Experimental studies in rodents have shown that exogenic progesterone can be neuroprotective and decrease the extent of an infarction, possibly by regulating inflammatory actions and mitochondrial functions. However, progesterone levels decrease dramatically during the menopausal transition, and derive mainly from precursors from the adrenal gland after menopause.

Studies using RIA technique, such as the Swedish longitudinal twin study, revealed that higher endogenous progesterone in women aged 70 years and older was associated with higher serum insulin and increased prevalence of heart failure, even after adjustments were made for CRP, creatinine, and insulin levels. The results are consistent with our study. However, because these studies used the RIA method, the results may be disturbed by inflammatory parameters, besides not being precise enough. Participants in our study had a mean age of 64.5 years old, and our findings suggest that increased levels of endogenous progesterone in this age group are associated with higher estimated stroke risk. The results might have turned out differently in a cohort in which the participants were closer to the menopausal transition.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus and menopausal hormone therapy: an update [^117FY8zc]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

During menopausal transition, various phenotypical and metabolic changes occur, affecting body weight, adipose tissue distribution and energy expenditure as well as insulin secretion and sensitivity. Taken together, these can predispose women to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Many women in midlife experience climacteric symptoms, including hot flashes and night sweats. Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is then indicated. MHT has a favourable effect on glucose homeostasis in both women without and with T2DM. T2DM was considered in the past as a cardiovascular disease (CVD) equivalent, which would suggest that women with T2DM should not receive MHT. This notion may still deter many clinicians from prescribing MHT to these patients. However, nowadays there is strong evidence to support an individualised approach after careful evaluation of CVD risk. In older women with T2DM (> 60 years old or > 10 years in menopause), MHT should not be initiated, because it may destabilise mature atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in thrombotic episodes. In obese women with T2DM or in women with moderate CVD risk, transdermal 17β-oestradiol could be used. This route of delivery presents beneficial effects regarding triglyceride concentrations and coagulation factors. In peri- or recently post-menopausal diabetic women with low risk for CVD, oral oestrogens can be used, since they exhibit stronger beneficial effects on glucose and lipid profiles. In any case, a progestogen with neutral effects on glucose metabolism should be used, such as natural progesterone, dydrogesterone or transdermal norethisterone. The goal is to maximise benefits and minimise adverse effects.

9. Carbohydrate And Lipid Metabolic Effects

Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users (23). Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 mcg of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance (62). Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents (23,63). However, in the non-diabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose (64). Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives.

A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS 1a. and 1d.), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.

10. Elevated Blood Pressure

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives (65) and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users (66) and with continued use (65). Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners (18) and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestogens.

Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases or renal disease (67) should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely, and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued. For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives (66), and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever and never users (65,67,68).

11. Headache

The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern which is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.

12. Bleeding Irregularities

Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Non-hormonal causes should be considered, and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.

Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

### Impact of metformin monotherapy versus metformin with oestrogen-progesterone on lipids in adolescent girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome [^114Uk34f]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Hyperinsulinaemia is an important determinant of the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). In addition to lifestyle measures, therapeutic strategies include the use of oestrogen-progesterone combination pills (EP), and insulin sensitizers such as metformin, either alone or in combination. Data are limited regarding the impact of metformin alone vs metformin with EP on cardiometabolic risk in overweight adolescents with PCOS. We hypothesized that metformin alone would lead to an improvement in HbA1C and lipid levels in overweight adolescent girls with PCOS compared with meformin with EP.

Study Design

Retrospective clinic-based therapy.

Patients and Measurements

We examined the effects of therapy with metformin alone (n = 14) vs metformin with EP (n = 13) on HbA1C and lipid parameters over 10–14 months in 27 overweight girls, drawn from a clinic population of adolescents with PCOS.

Results

The groups did not differ for age, body mass index (BMI), HbA1C or baseline lipids. After at least 10 months, the metformin only group compared with the metformin and EP group had a decrease in total cholesterol (-0.605 ± 0.100 vs 0.170 ± 0.348 mm, P = 0.02, nonparametric test) and triglycerides (-0.342 ± 0.184 vs 0.262 ± 0.133 mm, P = 0.02), despite similar changes in BMI (-1.6 ± 0.7 vs 0.6 ± 2.1 kg/m(2), P = 0.25) and HbA1C (0.03 ± 0.06 vs 0.03 ± 0.13%, P = 0.99). Differences between groups remained significant after controlling for baseline parameters and for changes in BMI.

Conclusion

Metformin alone more effectively improves lipid parameters than metformin with EP in adolescent PCOS, as indicated by a decrease in total cholesterol and triglycerides. This effect is not related to BMI changes.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1159FkuE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Postmenopausal dyslipidemia — statins vs hormone therapy: In postmenopausal women, we recommend treating dyslipidemia with statin therapy rather than hormone therapy (1⊕⊕OO). Technical remarks note that hormone therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, specifically venous thromboembolism and stroke, but the absolute risk is lower in younger compared to older postmenopausal women, and hormone therapy is described as estrogen ± progesterone/a progestin. Oral estrogen therapy increases HDL-C by up to 15% and decreases LDL-C by up to 20%, while transdermal estrogen has similar effects but generally lesser lipid changes; progestins tend to decrease HDL-C so combined estrogen and progesterone tends to blunt lipid changes compared with estrogen alone. Estrogen may dramatically increase triglyceride levels in those predisposed to hypertriglyceridemia, potentially triggering acute pancreatitis, although a population-based case-control study found no significant increase in pancreatitis risk among current or former users of estrogen.

### Sex differences in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism: it's not just about sex hormones [^115NeBjB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

It is commonly thought that sex hormones are important regulators of plasma lipid kinetics and are responsible for sexual dimorphism in the plasma lipid profile. Here we discuss the findings from studies evaluating lipid and lipoprotein kinetics in men and women in the context of what we know about the effects of exogenous sex hormone administration, and we conclude that it is more complicated than that. It has become clear that normal physiological alterations in the hormonal milieu (i.e. due to menopause or throughout the menstrual cycle) do not significantly affect plasma lipid homeostasis. Furthermore, parenterally administered estrogens have either no effect or only very small beneficial effects, whereas orally administered estrogens raise plasma triglyceride concentrations — a phenomenon that is not consistent with the observed sex differences and likely results from the hepatic "first-pass effect". The effects of progestogens and androgens mimic only in part the differences in plasma lipids between men and women. Thus, the underlying physiological modulators of plasma lipid metabolism responsible for the differences between men and women remain to be elucidated.

### Acute female hypogonadism alters adipose tissue fatty acid storage factors and chylomicronemia [^111YvUjR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Chronic sex steroid deficiency has effects on adipose fatty acid (FA) storage mechanisms and fat oxidation, but the chronology of events are not well understood.

Objective

The objective of the study was to examine the acute effects of female sex steroid suppression on cellular mechanisms affecting abdominal and femoral subcutaneous adipose tissue FA storage.

Design

This study had a randomized, longitudinal, parallel study design.

Setting

The study was conducted at the Mayo Clinic Clinical Research Unit.

Participants

Thirty-eight nonsmoking premenopausal women aged 18–50 years participated in the study.

Intervention

The intervention included randomization to receive one of the following: 1) no treatment (control), 2) 3.75 mg of Lupron, or 3) 3.75 mg of Lupron and estrogen, but not progesterone, replacement for 49 days, resulting in at least 4 weeks of sex steroid suppression.

Main Outcome Measures

Body composition, fat cell size, postprandial chylomicron and nonchylomicron triglyceride concentrations, adipose tissue meal FA storage, direct free fatty acid storage, lipoprotein lipase, acyl CoA synthetase, and diacylglycerol acyltransferase activities, and CD36 content were measured.

Results

Compared with the control group, the fed state femoral lipoprotein lipase activity was reduced in women taking Lupron and those taking Lupron and estrogen replacement. In addition, we observed significantly greater postprandial chylomicronemia in the Lupron group than in the other two groups. There were no differences in overall fat storage and oxidation. Depending on the mode of data expression (per unit lipid vs per 1000 adipocytes), there were modest changes in acyl CoA synthetase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase, and CD36 in response to acute sex hormone suppression.

Conclusions

Our results suggest estrogen and progesterone may have different effects on the regulation of FA metabolism and that acute sex steroid deficiency in women does not alter fat storage and oxidation.

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate (depo-subQ Provera) [^11532TvC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Depo-subQ provera 104 inhibits the secretion of gonadotropins, which primarily prevents follicular maturation and ovulation and causes thickening of cervical mucus. These actions contribute to its contraceptive effect.

Suppression of serum estradiol concentrations is likely to be responsible for the therapeutic effect on endometriosis-associated pain.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The following laboratory tests are expected to be affected by progestins including depo-subQ provera 104:

Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol).
Gonadotropin levels are decreased.
Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased.
Histology specimens may demonstrate changes consistent with progestin effects.

The following laboratory tests may be affected by depo-subQ provera 104, however the clinical significance is unknown:

Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase.
T3-uptake values may decrease.
Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase.
Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased.
The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetic parameters of MPA following a single subcutaneous injection of depo-subQ provera 104 in healthy women (n = 42) are shown in Table 2 and Figure P.

Following subcutaneous administration of single depo-subQ provera 104 doses ranging from 50 to 150 mg (0.48 and 1.4 times the recommended dose, respectively), the AUC and Cmin(Day 91) increased with higher doses, but there was considerable overlap across dose levels. Serum MPA concentrations at Day 91 increased in a dose proportional manner but Cmaxdid not appear to increase proportionally with increasing dose. The AUC data were suggestive of dose linearity.

### Sex steroids affect triglyceride handling, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and insulin sensitivity: a 1-week randomized clinical trial in healthy young men [^117PXW22]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To evaluate metabolic effects of sex steroids in nonfasting and fasting conditions, independent from changes in body composition.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A randomized clinical trial was performed to create contrasting sex steroid levels in healthy young men: by letrozole (aromatase inhibitor) to lower estradiol (E 2) and increase testosterone (group T, n = 10) versus letrozole plus E 2 patches to lower T and raise E 2 (group E, n = 10). Mixed meals and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps were performed before and after a 1-week treatment period.

RESULTS

Following intervention, the postprandial triglyceride response displayed a diverging response with a decline in group T and an increase in group E; the postprandial glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) response increased in group T. Insulin sensitivity increased in group T but remained unaltered in group E.

CONCLUSIONS

In healthy young men, short-term changes in sex steroids affect postprandial triglyceride and GIP response and insulin sensitivity.

### Dyslipidemia management in women of reproductive potential: an expert clinical consensus from the National Lipid Association [^112VXHga]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2024). High credibility.

Birth control methods in dyslipidemia — For women with FH or hypertriglyceridemia, oral contraceptives, transdermal patches, intra-uterine devices, and barrier methods may be used as contraceptive methods, but due to increased risk of thrombosis, estrogen-containing contraceptives should be avoided in women who use tobacco, especially those older than 35 yr of age, and estrogen-based therapies should also be avoided in women with severe hypertriglyceridemia. In women with established CVD or at high risk of CVD, long-acting reversible contraception, such as intrauterine devices and subdermal implants, are preferred given their safety and efficacy. Estrogen decreases LDL-C levels and increases TG levels in a dose-related response; however, estradiol valerate and the low doses of ethinyl estradiol (≤ 35 mcg) used in currently available oral contraceptives impact lipid levels less than previously available oral contraceptives, while the androgenic progestins, levonorgestrel and norgestrel, may increase LDL-C and TG levels. Therefore, clinicians should evaluate lipoprotein and lipid values before and periodically after initiating oral or transdermal contraception, especially in women with a history of very high LDL-C levels or hypertriglyceridemia.

### Effects of estradiol dose and serum estradiol levels on metabolic measures in early and late postmenopausal women in the REPLENISH trial [^113BjjT9]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: To identify the association of estradiol (E2) dose and serum E2 levels with metabolic measures in early (< 6 years) compared with late (≥ 10 years) postmenopausal women from the REPLENISH trial. Material and Methods: This is a post hoc analysis of a multicenter randomized clinical trial in the United States. Four doses of TX-001HR, an oral combination of E2 and progesterone (P4), and placebo were tested. This analysis included a total of 1,216 early and 297 late postmenopausal women. Linear mixed-effects models tested the association of E2 dose and serum E2 levels with changes in metabolic parameters; total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and glucose (GLUC) levels from six visits over 12 months, adjusted for the serum P4 level. Results: A higher E2 dose was significantly associated with lower TC (p = 0.02) and LDL-C (p = 0.002) and higher HDL-C (p = 0.04) levels in early, but not late, postmenopause. With longer time since menopause, the inverse association of E2 dose with TC and LDL-C and positive association with HDL-C were attenuated (interaction p < 0.05). Higher serum E2 levels were significantly associated with lower TC (p = 0.004), LDL-C (p = 0.0001), and fasting blood GLUC (p = 0.003) and higher TG (p = 0.002) levels in early postmenopause. Conclusion: E2 dose differentially affects metabolic measures among early compared with late postmenopausal women. No significant main effect of the serum P4 level was found. As the metabolic parameters studied are risk factors for cardiovascular events, these results support the timing hypothesis of E2 therapy and its cardiovascular benefits.

### Effects of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy on lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein (a) concentrations: analysis of studies published from 1974–2000 [^116pMSye]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To establish reference estimates of the effects of different hormone replacement therapy (HRT) regimens on lipid and lipoprotein levels.

Design

Review and pooled analysis of prospective studies published up until the year 2000.

Setting

Clinical trials centers, hospitals, menopause clinics.

Patient(S)

Healthy postmenopausal women.

Intervention(S)

Estrogen alone, estrogen plus progestogen, tibolone, or raloxifene in the treatment of menopausal symptoms.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Serum high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein (a).

Result(S)

Two-hundred forty-eight studies provided information on the effects of 42 different HRT regimens. All estrogen alone regimens raised HDL cholesterol and lowered LDL and total cholesterol. Oral estrogens raised triglycerides. Transdermal estradiol 17-beta lowered triglycerides. Progestogens had little effect on estrogen-induced reductions in LDL and total cholesterol. Estrogen-induced increases in HDL and triglycerides were opposed according to type of progestogen, in the order from least to greatest effect: dydrogesterone and medrogestone, progesterone, cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, transdermal norethindrone acetate, norgestrel, and oral norethindrone acetate. Tibolone decreased HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Raloxifene reduced LDL cholesterol levels. In 41 studies of 20 different formulations, HRT generally lowered lipoprotein (a).

Conclusion(S)

Route of estrogen administration and type of progestogen determined differential effects of HRT on lipid and lipoprotein levels. Future work will focus on the interpretation of the clinical significance of these changes.

### Effects of estrogen or estrogen / progestin regimens on heart disease risk factors in postmenopausal women… [^112cbGLf]. JAMA Network (1995). Excellent credibility.

Primary Endpoints. — Four endpoints were chosen to represent four biological systems related to the risk of cardiovascular disease: high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, serum insulin, and fibrinogen. Analysis. — Analyses presented are by intention to treat. P values for primary endpoints are adjusted for multiple comparisons; 95% confidence intervals around estimated effects were calculated without this adjustment. Results. — Mean changes in HDL-C segregated treatment regimens into three statistically distinct groups: placebo; MPA regimens; and CEE with cyclic MP and CEE alone. Active treatments decreased mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased mean triglyceride compared with placebo. Placebo was associated with a significantly greater increase in mean fibrinogen than any active treatment; differences among active treatments were not significant. Systolic blood pressure increased and postchallenge insulin levels decreased during the trial, but neither varied significantly by treatment assignment. — Estrogen alone or in combination with a progestin improves lipoproteins and lowers fibrinogen levels without detectable effects on postchallenge insulin or blood pressure. Unopposed estrogen is the optimal regimen for elevation of HDL-C, but the high rate of endometrial hyperplasia restricts use to women without a uterus. In women with a uterus, CEE with cyclic MP has the most favorable effect on HDL-C and no excess risk of endometrial hyperplasia. © 2025 JAMA+ AI Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Metabolic characterization of menopause: cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence [^116A6UXL]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Menopause is associated with a decrease in estradiol, beginning during the transition phase (~2 years before a woman's final menstrual period), with levels plateauing at a low value by ~2 years post-menopause, and a mirror pattern of increasing follicle stimulating hormone levels over the same period. The metabolic changes observed here may, thus, reflect sex and gonadotropin hormonal changes relating to the menopausal transition. Previous studies have shown exogenous estrogen alone, or in combination with progestogens [as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or combined hormonal contraception], is associated with a variation in lipid levels. Of relevance to our findings, post-menopausal women using HRT were found to have lower LDL cholesterol in comparison with those not using HRT. However, these associations with exogenous hormones may not be causal, and it remains unclear to what extent HRT is associated with levels of non-lipid biomarkers, e.g. fatty acids and amino acids. Several studies have recently found exogenous hormones and also reproductive-status change, including pregnancy and menopause (as studied here) to be associated with changes in a wide range of circulating metabolites. Further research to understand the relationship between circulating levels of reproductive hormones at different stages of the life course and changes in comprehensive metabolic profiles would be important in giving us a better understanding of the extent to which sex hormones influence metabolism during different reproductive stages of life.

### Sex-specific regulation of inflammation and metabolic syndrome in obesity [^116Ve7a8]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Additionally, to gain more insight into what specific features of the metabolic syndrome drive the observed associations with circulating adipokines and cytokines, we individually evaluated the 5 parameters defining metabolic syndrome. We showed that circulating triglycerides concentration seem to be the most important condition driving the sex-specific association. In women with high TGs, adiponectin levels are lower, whereas in men with high TGs, plasma IL6 is higher. In addition, also the augmented cytokine production capacity of PBMCs in men with metabolic syndrome is mainly dependent on the presence of high TGs. Further lipidomic analyses showed that this differential effect is not because of sex-differences in the composition of circulating lipoproteins. Following high-fat loads, circulating triglycerides are associated with circulating cytokine levels such as IL-6 and with activation of circulating innate immune cells. However, it is currently unclear why triglycerides are associated with higher IL-6 and higher cytokine production capacity only in men.

As has been shown previously that for example testosterone can have immunomodulatory effect, we tested the hypothesis that circulating hormones contribute to the observed sex-specific differences in inflammatory parameters by measuring the serum concentrations of 5 circulating steroid hormones, of which 4 show strong differential concentrations in men and women, including 17-OH-progesteron and testosterone. For these hormones, we did not observe any differential association with triglycerides or the metabolic syndrome nor an association with circulating cytokines and cytokine-production capacity that could explain our findings. It is important to realize that we were only able to test a selection of hormones and that we cannot exclude effects of progesterone or estrogens. Also, though changes in sex hormones with the metabolic syndrome do not explain the observed sex differences, contrasting baseline levels of steroid hormones between women and men might still play a role these differences (Table XIX in the).

5.6 Visual Abnormalities

Retinal vascular thrombosis has been reported in women receiving estrogens. Discontinue estradiol and progesterone capsules pending examination if there is a sudden partial or complete loss of vision, or a sudden onset of proptosis, diplopia, or migraine. Permanently discontinue estrogens, including estradiol and progesterone capsules, if examination reveals papilledema or retinal vascular lesions.

5.7 Addition of a Progestogen When a Woman Has Not Had a Hysterectomy

Studies of the addition of a progestogen for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestogens with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include an increased risk of breast cancer.

5.8 Elevated Blood Pressure

In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen.

5.9 Exacerbation of Hypertriglyceridemia

In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Discontinue estradiol and progesterone capsules if pancreatitis occurs.

5.10 Hepatic Impairment and/or Past History of Cholestatic Jaundice

Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in women with hepatic impairment. Exercise caution in any women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy. In the case of recurrence of cholestatic jaundice, discontinue estradiol and progesterone capsules.

5.11 Exacerbation of Hypothyroidism

Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4and T3serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. Monitor thyroid function in these women during the treatment with estradiol and progesterone capsules to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.

### Systemic delivery of estradiol, but not testosterone or progesterone, alters very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride kinetics in postmenopausal women [^113bR43U]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Sexual dimorphism in plasma triglyceride (TG) metabolism is well established but it is unclear to what extent it is driven by differences in the sex hormone milieu. RESULTS from previous studies evaluating the effects of sex steroids on plasma TG homeostasis are inconclusive because they relied on orally administered synthetic hormone preparations or evaluated only plasma lipid concentrations but not kinetics.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of systemically delivered 17β-estradiol, progesterone, and T on very low density lipoprotein-triglyceride (VLDL-TG) concentration and kinetics in postmenopausal women.

Setting and Design

VLDL-TG concentration and kinetics were evaluated by using stable isotope-labeled tracer techniques in four groups of postmenopausal women (n = 27 total) who were studied before and after treatment with either 17β-estradiol (0.1 mg/d via continuous delivery skin patch), progesterone (100 mg/d via vaginal insert) and T (12.5 mg/d via skin gel), or no intervention (control group).

Results

VLDL-TG concentration and kinetics were unchanged in the control group and not altered by T and progesterone administration. Estradiol treatment, in contrast, reduced VLDL-TG concentration by approximately 30% due to accelerated VLDL-TG plasma clearance (25.1 ± 2.5 vs. 17.4 ± 2.7 mL/min; P < .01).

Conclusions

Estradiol, but not progesterone or T, is a major regulator of VLDL-TG metabolism.

7.1 	Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated With Co-Administration of Other Products

If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include:

barbiturates
bosentan
carbamazepine
felbamate
griseofulvin
oxcarbazepine
phenytoin
rifampin
St. John's wort
topiramate

HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids.

Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.

7.2	Laboratory Test Interactions

The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted.

The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including medroxyprogesterone acetate injectable suspension:

Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol).
Gonadotropin levels are decreased.
Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased.
Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase.

T3-uptake values may decrease.
Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase.
Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased.
The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies.

### The effects of transdermal estrogens combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate on cardiovascular disease risk factors in postmenopausal women: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115x59zQ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Before menopause, men are more commonly affected by CVD than women, but women tend to develop CVD later in life compared to men. Postmenopausal women are believed to be at a higher risk of CVD, as this risk typically increases during the perimenopausal stage. This elevated risk is associated with changes in lipoprotein, lipid, and sex hormone levels. These factors highlight the importance of monitoring CVD risk factors in postmenopausal women. Studies have shown that increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) are directly correlated with an increased risk of CVD.

As estrogen levels decrease in postmenopausal women and given estrogen's significant role in reducing CVD risk, HRT is recommended to mitigate this risk. For example, transdermal HRT has been shown to reduce CVD risk in women. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggested that transdermal estrogen in combination with progestin may reduce the risk of CVD in women, by significantly decreasing the activity of factor VII. A meta-analysis found that in postmenopausal women, total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and triglycerides (TG) were reduced with the combination of transdermal estradiol and norethisterone acetate. Another meta-analysis demonstrated that lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and ApoB levels were decreased in postmenopausal women treated with a combination of estradiol and norethisterone acetate. The combination of estrogen and progestin was also found to have a beneficial impact on TC and LDL-C in postmenopausal women. The authors reported that transdermal estrogen combined with progestin had favorable effects on TC and LDL-C, suggesting its use in CVD risk reduction. Similarly, TC and TG levels were reduced in women treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). HRT has beneficial effects on lipoprotein concentrations, which could be the mechanism behind its cardioprotective effect, reducing the risk of CVD by 50% in postmenopausal women. Moreover, transdermal estrogen with progestin had a beneficial impact on triglyceride and coagulation factors, compared to oral estrogen progestin combination.

To date, no meta-analysis has reported on the role of transdermal estrogens combined with oral MPA in relation to CVD risk factors in postmenopausal women. To address this gap in knowledge, a meta-analysis of RCTs was conducted to assess the effects of transdermal estrogens and oral MPA on CVD risk factors in postmenopausal women.

General Precautions Associated with Estrogens

Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy: Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer.

Elevated blood pressure: In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use.

Hypertriglyceridemia: In patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications.

Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundice: Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.

### Effects of progestins in different hormone replacement therapy formulations on estrogen-induced lipid changes in postmenopausal women [^116UWnhs]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), used by many women to relieve the symptoms of menopause and for the prevention of osteoporosis, is available in an increasing number of formulations. Options include various combinations of estrogen and progestin as well as different routes of administration. For women with a uterus, who require a progestin, a convenient and commonly used option is combining the estrogen and progestin in a single pill. Such formulations have the lipid-modifying effects of estrogen, altered to specific type and dose of progestin used. The cardioprotective increases in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol associated with exogenous estrogen may be blunted or even reversed with certain HRT regimens. In addition, some progestins minimize the increase in triglycerides that occurs with exogenous estrogen, whereas others do not. Because of the importance of lipid markers as risk factors for cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women, these lipid effects should be carefully considered when selecting an HRT regimen.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^113DDTFG]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People, Version 8 — lipid effects and evidence gaps with GAHT indicate there are currently no studies comparing the prevalence of dyslipidemia between transgender and cisgender samples while controlling for hormone use. Both testosterone- and estrogen-based GAHT affect lipid metabolism, with evidence limited by regimen heterogeneity; on balance, estrogen tends to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides with variable effects on low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, while testosterone variably affects triglycerides, decreases HDL cholesterol and increases LDL cholesterol, and the method of administration (oral versus transdermal estrogen) may influence triglycerides. In general, the effect sizes of these differences are minimal and the overall impact on cardio- and cerebrovascular outcomes is unclear, and there are no studies in TGD people with pre-existing dyslipidemia starting hormones over age 50 or assessing effects beyond 2–5 years of therapy.

### Where are the recommendations on healthy lifestyle and cardiovascular disease prevention for pregnant women? [^111LSMuj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Of the investigated CVH health factors, the most debatable is plasma TC. During the end of the second and especially during the third trimester (which is sometimes referred to as the "hyperlipidemic period"), TC increases are common (even by as much as 50%), and an even more substantial increase (2.5 times) in triglycerides can be seen. This is associated with a smaller increase in low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, by ≈30–40%. 15 Such changes are associated with the hormonal changes both from the maternal and the fetal side — in T1 and T2, progesterone level increases, and consequently increased appetite, weight gain, and fat deposition can occur. In T2 and T3 estrogen levels increase, resulting in increased secretion of triglyceride‐rich lipoproteins, increased lipogenesis, and suppressed activity of hepatic lipase. This causes triglyceride enrichment of low‐density lipoprotein and high‐density lipoprotein. Finally, in the same trimesters, we observe an increase in human placental lactogen and consequently, peripheral insulin resistance with suppressed plasma lipoprotein lipase activity, enhanced plasma cholesterol ester transfer protein activity, and enhanced free fatty acid flux to the liver. 16 Therefore, because of these physiological changes we cannot use the same values of healthy lifestyle for TC for pregnant and nonpregnant women. There have been some attempts to define reference values of lipids during pregnancy (eg, with values < 300 mg/dL [7.75 mmol/L] in T2 and even < 350 mg/dL [9 mmol/L] in T3); however, further studies are required before these values can be confirmed. 17 Based on the data from other studies, and clinical experience, it seems that these reference values should be lower with < 250 mg/dL (6.5 mmol/L) in T2 and < 300 mg/dL (7.75 mmol/L) in T3. 4, 15, 16 Thus, the reference values used by the authors (< 200 mg/dL/5.2 mmol/L for ideal TC levels) seem to be far too low, and it is probably the reason that only 38.9% of pregnant women had ideal levels of TC in comparison to nonpregnant ones (67.2%). The data on the distribution of TC across the trimesters confirmed this, because in T1 there were > 80% pregnant women with ideal levels of cholesterol and in T3, < 16%. 4 The diagnosis and management of lipid disorders during pregnancy is an important problem, there are no recommendations to help, and knowledge and evidence is limited. It is very surprising that management of hyperlipidemia was not a part of the recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the management of CVD during pregnancy, 1 with almost no recommendations on prevention in general. This issue is of critical importance, especially as, in busy centers, we are likely to see patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, including familial hypercholesterolemia, as well as severe hypertriglyceridemia with pancreatitis during pregnancy, which is a life‐threatening condition.

9. Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause a decrease in glucose tolerance in a significant percentage of users.17This effect has been shown to be directly related to estrogen dose.65In general, progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents.17,66In the nondiabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose.67Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully monitored while taking oral contraceptives.

A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS 1.a. and 1.d.), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.

10. Elevated Blood Pressure

Women with significant hypertension should not be started on hormonal contraception.98An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives68and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users69and with extended duration of use.61Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners12and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing progestational activity and concentrations of progestogens.

Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal disease70should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If these women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and if a clinically significant persistent elevation of blood pressure (BP) occurs (≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic) and cannot be adequately controlled, oral contraceptives should be discontinued. In general, women who develop hypertension during hormonal contraceptive therapy should be switched to a non-hormonal contraceptive. If other contraceptive methods are not suitable, hormonal contraceptive therapy may continue combined with antihypertensive therapy. Regular monitoring of BP throughout hormonal contraceptive therapy is recommended.102For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives,69and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among former and never users.68,70,71

Objective

To evaluate the effects of low-dose oral hormone therapy and nonoral hormone therapy on endothelial function markers and on anthropometric, metabolic, and hormonal variables in early postmenopausal women.

Design

Cross-over, randomized clinical trial.

Setting

Gynecological Endocrinology Unit.

Patient(S)

Healthy postmenopausal women.

Intervention(S)

Twenty patients received oral E(2) 1 mg plus drospirenone 2 mg/d for 2 months. Another group of 20 patients received 3 mg/d 17beta intranasal E(2), and then 200 mg/d vaginal micronized P for 14 days during two 28-day cycles. At the end of this period, the patients were crossed over for another 2 months.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Endothelial function markers and anthropometric, metabolic, and hormonal variables before and after hormone therapy.

Result(S)

Mean age was 51.2 ± 2.7 years. Mean time since menopause was 23.1 ± 10 months. After low-dose treatment, a reduction in waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol was observed. Triglycerides and von Willebrand factor levels decreased significantly with nonoral treatment. Fasting glucose and insulin levels did not change. In both groups, total and non-high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased below basal levels, and endothelin-1, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein levels remained unchanged.

Conclusion(S)

Neither treatment induced deleterious effects in the short term on variables related to cardiovascular risk in early postmenopausal women.

Mann-Whitney test was used to compare differences in estradiol levels between groups. Unpaired t test with Welch's correction was used to compare differences in progesterone and testosterone levels between groups.

The HT− group also had significantly increased fasting glucose levels when compared with both the HT+ group (P = 0.03) and the RA group (P = 0.01) (Table 1). After correcting the analysis for participants with diabetes and/or taking medication for diabetes, the HT− group still had significantly increased fasting glucose levels when compared with the RA group (P = 0.014), but no differences were observed when comparing to the HT+ group (P = 0.18). In contrast, fasting glucose levels in the HT+ group were similar to the levels in the RA group (P = 0.24), even after correcting the analysis for participants with diabetes and/or taking medication for diabetes (P = 0.23). There were no significant differences in circulating levels of cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, or total protein between any of the groups (Table 1). Given the suggestions in the literature that some effects of HT may be mediated through effects on inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, levels of a panel of cytokines and chemokines were also compared between groups, but there were no significant differences between the groups in the levels of any of the cytokines or chemokines tested (Table 1).

### Vitamin D status and vitamin D deficiency risk factors among pregnancy of shanghai in China [^1111Brrz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Gestation is characterized by increased serum levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides pushed by estrogen, progesterone, and lactogen, which mobilize stored fat depots in late pregnancy, a pool of fatty acids for foetal growth, and placental tissue steroid synthesis. This physiologic increase in lipids performs an essential role during pregnancy; however, elevated lipids in susceptible women or familiar forms of hyperlipemia can increase maternal-foetal complications, and gestational hyperlipemia is associated with preeclampsia, preterm birth, and gestational diabetes, and offspring of these mothers show a propensity to enhanced fatty streak formation and an increased risk of progressive atherosclerosis. It was previously demonstrated that chronically fructose-fed with diets containing high percentages of fructose develop hyperlipemia and insulin resistance in pregnancy. Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is associated with glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and hyperlipemia. Pre-eclampsia is higher in pregnant women with the vitamin D deficiency group than controls, and serum concentration of vitamin D is closely related to gestational diabetes and preterm delivery. Our study found gestational hyperlipemia was a factor of vitamin D deficiency; however, there was no difference in vitamin D status between pregnancy of gestational hyperglycemia and normal pregnancy. This conflicting finding may have occurred because vitamin D and lipid metabolism in pregnancy is a complex process. Some studies reported that vitamin D supplements in pregnancy reduced serum total and LDL cholesterol levels but did not affect serum triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels. However, some researchers found vitamin D supplementation does not impact serum lipid profiles. In contrast, lipid profiles might decrease due to increased insulin sensitivity and parathyroid hormone reduction after vitamin D intake. Blood lipid impact on vitamin D levels was a complicated process, and more research was needed to explore the reason.

Our study has some limitations that should be mentioned. First, this study was a cross-sectional study; the associations it demonstrated do not imply a causal relationship between the level of vitamin D and risk in our study participants. Second, the study may be confounded by a lack of data on some relevant variables, such as dietary factors, especially vitamin D supplements, and different season factors. Moreover, this study did not perform a sample size calculation; therefore, the limited number of samples may affect our results' statistical significance. Further studies are needed to evaluate the limitations of this study.

### Cardiovascular profile of pharmacological agents used for the management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^114JMFma]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Hormonal contraception

Combined oral contraceptives (OCPs) are often used as first-line therapy in women with PCOS to address menstrual regularity, acne and hirsutism. It has been well recognized that the long-term use of estrogen-containing OCPs may have an adverse cardiovascular risk, but whether this translates into additional cardiovascular risk in these patients is unclear.

Oral contraceptives are associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia and an elevated C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of inflammation. In addition, there is an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome. The decreased insulin sensitivity associated with their use depends on the progestin used, with fourth generation progestins being less impactful, and those containing cyproterone being associated with increased insulin secretion. All of these features are associated with obese patients with PCOS and with the increased risk of developing prediabetes and T2D;, however, a Cochrane meta-analysis suggested that OCPs did not affect glucose tolerance, though the evidence reviewed was not comprehensive. The effect of OCPs on lipid parameters depends on the progestin component, with estrogen increasing high density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglycerides while decreasing low density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol. Those progestins with an androgenic profile are associated with a lower HDL and increased LDL cholesterol, the converse occurring with less androgenic preparations.

Progestins are compounds with progestational activity, in particular the capability to induce a secretory endometrium to support gestation. The progestin component of contraceptives is designed to mimic the actions of progesterone, the endogenous progestogenic steroid hormone in all mammals. Progesterone plays a central role in reproduction to regulate establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, normal mammary gland development, menstrual cycle, and sexual behavior. During the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, progesterone levels are relatively low whereas estrogen levels peak. Levels of progesterone, secreted by the corpus luteum, rise after ovulation to prepare the endometrium for egg implantation, transform estrogen-primed endometrium into secretory tissue, prevent ovulation by abolishing peak gonadotropin levels, inhibit follicular maturation, and thin the endometrium. Higher progesterone levels also reduce glycogen secretion and cause cervical mucus to become thick and viscous to avoid sperm penetration, fertilization, and implantation by multiple embryos. Progestins mimic all of these actions of progesterone to prevent pregnancy via these multiple mechanisms. Estrogen, alternatively, induces gonadotropin release and ovulation in addition to having many additional beneficial effects on brain and cardiovascular function, lipid profiles, and bone density.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116TwWEe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to management of cardiovascular risks, ES 2015 guidelines recommend to consider offering transdermal estradiol as first-line therapy in patients at moderate risk of CVD, because these preparations have a less untoward effect on BP, triglycerides, and carbohydrate metabolism. Offer transdermal estradiol alone in patients without a uterus. Combine this agent with micronized progesterone or another progestogen (not adversely modifying metabolic parameters) in patients with an intact uterus.

### Effect of raloxifene on serum triglycerides in postmenopausal women: influence of predisposing factors for hypertriglyceridemia [^1144JnF9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Estrogen increases serum triglyceride (TG) levels and induces hypertriglyceridemia in susceptible women. The effect of raloxifene (RLX), a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, on serum TG has not been studied in detail.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of RLX on serum TG levels in postmenopausal women with and without osteoporosis, including those with predisposing factors for hypertriglyceridemia.

Methods

Fasting serum TG levels were assessed over 36 months in 2738 osteoporotic postmenopausal women (mean age, 67 years) assigned to placebo or RLX (60 or 120 mg/d) in an osteoporosis treatment trial and over 24 months in 1318 postmenopausal women without osteoporosis (mean age, 54 years) assigned to placebo or RLX (60 or 150 mg/d) in 3 osteoporosis prevention trials.

Results

In the osteoporosis treatment trial, the median serum TG concentration decreased in all groups, but significantly more in the placebo group (placebo, -3.4%; RLX 60 mg/d, -1.4%; RLX 120 mg/d, -1.3%; P = 0.002). In the osteoporosis prevention trials, the percentage change in median serum TG concentration was not significantly different among treatments (P = 0.22). Among women with varying degrees of hypertriglyceridemia at baseline (> 2.82, > 3.39, and > 4.51 mmol/L), the median serum TG level at the end of the study decreased from baseline in all groups, with no significant differences among treatments (P ≥ 0.13). The effect of RLX on serum TG level was not influenced by age, smoking status, use of alcohol, or presence of diabetes (P ≥ 0.10 for all interactions). Among women in the highest tertile of body mass index (> 26.4 kg/m2), RLX increased serum TG levels significantly compared with placebo (placebo, -3%; RLX 60 mg/d, 6%: RLX 120 mg/d, 4%; P < 0.05); the absolute increase from baseline with RLX in this subgroup was 0.05 mmol/L (4.4 mg/dL).

Conclusions

RLX did not increase serum TG in postmenopausal women overall or among women with elevated TG levels or evidence of diabetes at baseline. TG levels increased slightly but statistically significantly in women in the upper tertile of body mass index who were treated with RLX.

### Association between prediagnostic glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and meningioma, and reverse causality [^1138N2iz]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Our findings do not necessarily negate the roles of known meningioma risk factors. For example, while obesity may increase meningioma risk, through an as yet unknown mechanism, it may also increase hyperglycaemia risk, thereby inhibiting tumour growth. We therefore speculate that obesity and hyperglycaemia affect different stages of meningioma development.

Assuming that our findings can be confirmed, they provide evidence for the effects of the physiological environment on meningioma. In addition, the lowering of serum cholesterol for no apparent reason may be a biomarker of meningioma development, although this sign is not unique to meningioma. In attempting to replicate our findings, it would be worthwhile to simultaneously evaluate prediagnostic obesity and levels of endogenous progesterone, androgens and oestrogen to examine whether and how they affect meningioma development and growth.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117J5QCS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — risk-tiered treatment selection: High risk includes known MI, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and 10-year CVD risk > 10%. For women at high risk of CVD, we suggest initiating nonhormonal therapies to alleviate bothersome VMS (with or without climacteric symptoms) over MHT. For women with moderate risk of CVD, we suggest transdermal estradiol as first-line treatment, alone for women without a uterus or combined with micronized progesterone (or another progestogen that does not adversely modify metabolic parameters) for women with a uterus because these preparations have less untoward effect on blood pressure, triglycerides, and carbohydrate metabolism.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^114s2gVe]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Combined oral contraceptives (COC) and other contraceptive modalities — lipid and thrombotic effects are outlined: COC use carries thrombotic risk and most products contain ≤ 35 μg of ethinyl-estradiol; the estrogen component frequently increases triglycerides (TG) and HDL-C and lowers LDL-C, while androgenic progestins (norgestrel, levonorgestrel) can raise LDL-C and lower HDL-C; low-dose norethindrone COCs and desogestrel raise HDL-C and lower LDL-C, and higher estrogen content can cause severe hypertriglyceridemia in women with high baseline TG. Transdermal or vaginal contraceptives do not have a lower thrombotic risk than COC, but transdermal formulations are less prone to clinically important TG elevations. Progestin-only oral, injectable, and implantable options are available and efficacious, though they are not as effective for contraception and have greater risk of breakthrough bleeding.

7.1	Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Co-Administration of Other Products

If a woman on hormonal contraceptives takes a drug or herbal product that induces enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize contraceptive hormones, counsel her to use additional contraception or a different method of contraception. Drugs or herbal products that induce such enzymes may decrease the plasma concentrations of contraceptive hormones, and may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives include:

barbiturates
bosentan
carbamazepine
felbamate
griseofulvin
oxcarbazepine
phenytoin
rifampin
St. John's wort
topiramate

HIV protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration of HIV protease inhibitors. Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma levels of the progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

Antibiotics: There have been reports of pregnancy while taking hormonal contraceptives and antibiotics, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of antibiotics on plasma concentrations of synthetic steroids.

Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.

7.2	Laboratory Test Interactions

The pathologist should be advised of progestin therapy when relevant specimens are submitted.

The following laboratory tests may be affected by progestins including Depo-Provera CI:

(a)	Plasma and urinary steroid levels are decreased (e.g., progesterone, estradiol, pregnanediol, testosterone, cortisol).

(b)	Gonadotropin levels are decreased.

(c)	Sex-hormone-binding-globulin concentrations are decreased.

(d)	Protein-bound iodine and butanol extractable protein-bound iodine may increase. T3-uptake values may decrease.

(e)	Coagulation test values for prothrombin (Factor II), and Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X may increase.

(f)	Sulfobromophthalein and other liver function test values may be increased.

(g)	The effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on lipid metabolism are inconsistent. Both increases and decreases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol have been observed in studies.

### Synthetic conjugated estrogens, a (cenestin) [^1154PXBz]. FDA (2004). Low credibility.

A. General

Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy. Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen-alone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer.
Elevated blood pressure. In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogens on blood pressure was not seen. Blood pressure should be monitored at regular intervals with estrogen use.
Hypertriglyceridemia. In patients with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis and other complications.
Impaired liver function and past history of cholestatic jaundice. Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For patients with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.
Hypothyroidism. Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Patients with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4and T3serum concentrations in the normal range. Patients dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These patients should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.
Fluid retention. Because estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention, patients with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal dysfunction, warrant careful observation when estrogens are prescribed.
Hypocalcemia. Estrogens should be used with caution in individuals with severe hypocalcemia.
Ovarian cancer. The CE/MPA substudy of WHI reported that estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of ovarian cancer. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years, the relative risk for ovarian cancer for CE/MPA versus placebo was 1.58 (95% confidence interval 0.77–3.24) but was not statistically significant. The absolute risk for CE/MPA versus placebo was 4.2 versus 2.7 cases per 10,000 women-years. In some epidemiologic studies, the use of estrogen alone, in particular for ten or more years, has been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer. Other epidemiologic studies have not found these associations.
Exacerbation of endometriosis. Endometriosis may be exacerbated with administration of estrogens. A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen alone therapy. For patients known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.
Exacerbation of other conditions. Estrogens may cause an exacerbation of asthma, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, migraine or porphyria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and hepatic hemangiomas and should be used with caution in women with these conditions.

### Effects of postmenopausal hormone therapy every day and every other day on lipid levels according to difference in body mass index [^112GziRx]. Menopause (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of postmenopausal estrogen and progestogen therapy (EPT) every day and every other day on lipid levels, particularly triglyceride (TG) levels, according to difference in body mass index (BMI).

Design

Ninety-nine postmenopausal women (mean age, 53.9 ± 5.6 years; mean BMI, 22.8 ± 2.8 kg/m) were randomly treated with EPT every other day or every day for 1 year. Fifty women received oral administration of 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) and 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) every other day, and 49 women received oral administration of 0.625 mg of CEE and 2.5 mg of MPA every day. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 1 year of therapy for measurement of fasting TG, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and apolipoproteins. Data from 88 of the 99 postmenopausal women were used for analysis.

Results

In women whose BMI was 25 kg/m or higher, TG levels during EPT every day increased by 26.8%, while TG levels during EPT every other day decreased by 12.3%. There was a significant (P < 0.05) difference between percentage changes in TG during EPT every day and every other day. In women whose BMI was less than 25 kg/m, TG levels during EPT every day increased by 21.7%, while during EPT every other day TG levels did not change. The mean levels of estradiol during EPT every day in women whose BMI was less than 25 kg/m and in women whose BMI was 25 kg/m or higher were 28.5 and 38.7 pg/mL, respectively, the difference between these levels was significant (P < 0.01). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between levels of estradiol during EPT every other day in these two BMI groups.

Conclusions

Triglyceride levels during EPT every day with conventional doses of CEE and MPA increased more in overweight and obese postmenopausal women in association with increased estrogen levels.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus and menopausal hormone therapy: an update [^1164QJU9]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Progestogens have been traditionally shown to decrease the beneficial effects of oestrogens on glucose metabolism. This phenomenon is dose-dependent and related to the development of insulin resistance. However, it appears that there are differences among various regimens. Indeed, MPA is known to have glucocorticoid activity, while levonorgestrel is a testosterone-derived product, both increasing insulin resistance. Conversely, natural progesterone, norethisterone acetate (NETA) and dydrogesterone are more neutral regarding glucose metabolism.

Given the beneficial effects of MHT on glycaemic control, an individualised approach in treating climacteric symptoms in post-menopausal women with T2DM should be considered, after careful evaluation of their CVD risk (Table 1). Women should be stratified according to their CVD risk. In older women with T2DM (> 60 years or > 10 years in menopause), MHT should not be initiated, as such a therapy may destabilise mature atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in thrombotic episodes. In obese women with T2DM or those with moderate CVD risk, transdermal 17β-oestradiol could be used. Some experts recommend the use of the coronary artery calcium score to identify women with established but latent CVD. This route of delivery presents more beneficial effects regarding triglyceride concentrations and coagulation factors. In peri- or recently post-menopausal diabetic women with low risk for CVD, oral oestrogens can be used as they have the stronger beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism profiles. In any case, a progestogen with neutral effects on glucose metabolism should be used, such as natural progesterone, dydrogesterone or transdermal norethisterone.

### Flaxseed dietary supplement versus hormone replacement therapy in hypercholesterolemic menopausal women [^1127x5Jf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess serum lipid changes by a phytoestrogen dietary supplement compared with oral estrogen-progesterone replacement in hypercholesterolemic menopausal women.

Methods

Twenty-five menopausal patients with total cholesterol greater than 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), a cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio greater than 4.5 and triglycerides less than 3.5 mmol/L (310 mg/dL) after a 4-month diet, were randomized to add 40 g/day of crushed flaxseed to their diet or to take daily 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogens alone (hysterectomy, n = 10) or combined with 100 mg of micronized progesterone (intact uterus, n = 15). After 2 months of treatment, both groups continued the diet alone during a 2-month washout period before crossing over to the alternate treatment for 2 more months.

Results

Differences were found between hormone replacement therapy and flaxseed respectively for decrease of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.8 ± 0.2 versus 4.4 ± 0.2 mmol/L) (148 ± 8 versus 170 ± 8 mg/dL) (P = 0.10), increase of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1.6 ± 0.04 versus 1.3 ± 0.03 mmol/L) (62 ± 1 versus 50 ± 1 mg/dL) (P = 0.001), and increase of apolipoprotein A-1 (1.71 ± 0.07 versus 1.42 ± 0.05 g/L) (P = 0.003). These changes were not related to modifications in diet, exercise, or anthropometric measurements evaluated in parallel. Both treatments produced similar decreases in menopausal symptoms and in glucose and insulin levels. Only hormone replacement therapy as compared with flaxseed induced an elevation of sex hormone binding globulin (P = 0.004), lowered fibrinogen (P = 0.08), and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (P = 0.01).

Conclusion

Although 40 g of flaxseed is as effective as oral estrogen-progesterone to improve mild menopausal symptoms and to lower glucose and insulin levels, only hormone replacement therapy significantly improves cholesterol profile in hypercholesterolemic women and favorably modifies markers related to cardiovascular health.

### Hormone replacement therapy and risk of cardiovascular disease: implications of the results of the women's health initiative [^111YujQy]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2003). Low credibility.

The higher rates of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and venous thrombosis among women taking estrogen and progesterone (E+P) compared with placebo in the Women's Health Initiative clinical trial have important implications for women's health. Previous studies in both men and women have shown that estrogen therapy lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and raises high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The changes in these lipoproteins should be associated with at least a 30% decline in CHD risk. Estrogens increased very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride levels and C-reactive protein. There is evidence that estrogens increase thrombin generation and fibrinolysis. The increase in VLDL triglycerides may enhance thrombotic risk as well as higher levels of atherogenic lipoproteins, such as dense low-density lipoprotein. Genetic variations in estrogen receptors and thrombosis or fibrinolysis may also be important in risks associated with E+P therapy. The increased risk of CHD and stroke with E+P therapy may be attributable to rise in VLDL triglycerides and thrombosis.

### Lipid changes on hormone therapy and coronary heart disease events in the heart and estrogen / progestin replacement study (HERS) [^111ZAqjh]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the effect of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, combination hormone therapy did not reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) events in the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS). To explore possible mechanisms, we examined the association between lipid changes and CHD outcomes among women assigned to hormone therapy.

Methods

HERS participants were postmenopausal women with previously diagnosed CHD who were randomly assigned to receive conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone or identical placebo and then followed-up for an average of 4.1 years. Among women assigned to hormone therapy, associations between baseline-to-year-1 lipid level changes and CHD events were compared with the associations observed for baseline lipids using multivariate proportional hazards models.

Results

Among women assigned to hormone therapy, CHD events were independently predicted by baseline LDL-C levels (relative hazard [RH] 0.94 per 15.6 mg/dL decrease, 95% CI 0.88–1.01) and HDL-C levels (RH 0.89 per 5.4 mg/dL increase, 95% CI 0.81–0.99), but not by triglyceride levels (RH 1.01 per 13.2 mg/dL increase, 95% CI 0.97–1.06). CHD events were marginally associated with first-year reductions in LDL-C levels (RH 0.95 per 15.6 mg/dL decrease, 95% CI 0.86–1.04), and were not associated with increases in HDL-C levels (RH 1.03 per 5.4 mg/dL increase, 95% CI 0.91–1.16) or triglyceride levels (RH 1.01 per 13.2 mg/dL increase, 95% CI 0.98–1.05).

Conclusion

Changes in lipid levels with hormone therapy are not predictive of CHD outcomes in women with heart disease in the HERS trial.

### Relationship between insulin sensitivity and menstrual cycle is modified by BMI, fitness, and physical activity in NHANES [^113yBhqF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate ADIPO-IR across the menstrual cycle. We observed rhythmic variation in ADIPO-IR when adjusting for BMI, physical activity, and cardiorespiratory fitness levels. Rhythmic cycling in ADIPO-IR concentration roughly coincided with rhythmic cycling of triglycerides across the menstrual cycle, which peaked at cycle day 23, declining to a trough at cycle day 5 (see Table 3). This contradicts previous research reporting elevated triglyceride concentrations during the follicular phase compared to the luteal phase. However, previous studies did not consider BMI, physical activity, or cardiorespiratory fitness, which we found significantly mediated rhythmicity in triglycerides across the menstrual cycle. Additionally, we used a larger sample size in this study compared with previous studies (n = 34 and 259 vs 869). Increases in ADIPO-IR during the luteal phase alongside concurrent elevations in triglyceride concentration may be underpinned by a decline in insulin-stimulated triglyceride uptake or suppression of lipolysis during the luteal phase. Progesterone has been shown to inhibit adipocyte insulin signaling and receptor binding. Increased circulating progesterone levels may contribute to the increased ADIPO-IR observed during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. However, further work is required to elucidate the role progesterone plays in regulating changes in circulating triglycerides and ADIPO-IR across the menstrual cycle.

We observed lower mean triglyceride concentration alongside significantly greater amplitude across the menstrual cycle in the high physical activity category compared to low. The timing of the peak and trough in triglyceride concentration roughly coincided with the glucose trough and peak, respectively. Regular physical activity increases the capacity for adipose tissue and skeletal muscle lipid uptake and mobilization. Moreover, high physical activity levels are positively associated with increased metabolic flexibility. Greater amplitude in triglyceride concentration across the menstrual cycle in the high physical activity category may reflect a coordinated uptake and release of triglycerides in response to fluctuations in glucose concentration.

While BMI and physical activity are significantly associated with variation in HOMA-IR and ADIPO-IR across the menstrual cycle, the mechanisms underpinning this relationship are uncertain. Variation in insulin sensitivity across the menstrual cycle has been associated with progesterone and estradiol. Differences in BMI and physical activity are known to alter ovarian hormonal profiles. Low physical activity levels are associated with higher mean estradiol levels across the menstrual cycle and higher progesterone levels during the luteal phase. High BMI is associated with greater variability of estradiol, but not progesterone. Unfortunately, neither estradiol nor progesterone was assessed in NHANES. Future research should investigate the role of sex hormones in the relationship between insulin sensitivity and BMI and physical activity levels.

### Antiatherosclerosis interventions in women [^113ApYZJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Although important in reducing atherosclerosis progression and cardiovascular events in women, lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is not sufficient for optimum prevention. Additional potential targets for intervention include reducing levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and replacing certain hormones that decrease during menopause. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for the reduction of atherosclerosis progression and cardiovascular events has become complicated because of conflicting outcomes from recent surrogate end point studies and secondary prevention randomized clinical trials. The key to HRT may be early intervention, when women first enter menopause and the atherosclerotic process appears to be relatively quiescent. Although many questions remain to be answered in this important area of women's health, there is a fact that is certain: administration of HRT for the reduction of cardiovascular events is not a straightforward proposition. Powerful imaging tools for monitoring atherosclerosis progression exist that can be used to help address many questions relating to type, dose, regimen, and timing of HRT.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1159JgXu]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy and estrogen exposures — During pregnancy, owing to estrogen-induced hepatic secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein, triglyceride levels increase progressively, with levels in the third trimester increased by 200% or more over levels before pregnancy; in women with underlying triglyceride disorders, this can result in a risk of pancreatitis with potential fetal loss. Oral estrogen (estrogen replacement therapy or oral contraceptives) has a triglyceride-increasing effect due to increased hepatic VLDL production, an effect that does not occur with transdermal estrogen. Tamoxifen can also increase triglyceride levels, and although the effect is less pronounced with raloxifene, it can increase levels in women predisposed to hypertriglyceridemia.

### Estradiol (estring) [^116Fa8A8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.	Addition of a progestin when a woman has not had a hysterectomy

Studies of the addition of a progestin for 10 or more days of a cycle of estrogen administration, or daily with estrogen in a continuous regimen, have reported a lowered incidence of endometrial hyperplasia than would be induced by estrogen treatment alone. Endometrial hyperplasia may be a precursor to endometrial cancer.

There are, however, possible risks that may be associated with the use of progestins with estrogens compared to estrogen alone regimens. These include a possible increased risk of breast cancer.

2.	Elevated blood pressure

In a small number of case reports, substantial increases in blood pressure have been attributed to idiosyncratic reactions to estrogens. In a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, a generalized effect of estrogen therapy on blood pressure was not seen.

3.	Hypertriglyceridemia

In women with pre-existing hypertriglyceridemia, estrogen therapy may be associated with elevations of plasma triglycerides leading to pancreatitis. Consider discontinuation of treatment if pancreatitis occurs.

4.	Hepatic impairment and/or past history of cholestatic jaundice

Estrogens may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. For women with a history of cholestatic jaundice associated with past estrogen use or with pregnancy, caution should be exercised and in the case of recurrence, medication should be discontinued.

5.	Hypothyroidism

Estrogen administration leads to increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) levels. Women with normal thyroid function can compensate for the increased TBG by making more thyroid hormone, thus maintaining free T4and T3serum concentrations in the normal range. Women dependent on thyroid hormone replacement therapy who are also receiving estrogens may require increased doses of their thyroid replacement therapy. These women should have their thyroid function monitored in order to maintain their free thyroid hormone levels in an acceptable range.

6.	Hypocalcemia

Estrogen therapy should be used with caution in women with hypoparathyroidism as estrogen-induced hypocalcemia may occur.

7.	Fluid retention

Estrogens may cause some degree of fluid retention. Women with conditions that might be influenced by this factor, such as a cardiac or renal impairment, warrant careful observation when estrogen-alone is prescribed.

8.	Exacerbation of endometriosis

A few cases of malignant transformation of residual endometrial implants have been reported in women treated post-hysterectomy with estrogen-alone therapy. For women known to have residual endometriosis post-hysterectomy, the addition of progestin should be considered.

### Massive hyperlipemia during estrogen therapy… [^112EKLQR]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In addition to the many well-publicized complications of oral contraceptive and estrogen therapy, it has been found that these medications frequently induce mild elevations of serum triglyceride levels. We report elevations of triglyceride levels to 3, 000 mg/100 mL and more, and cholesterol levels to more than 500 mg/100 mL in three postmenopausal women on estrogen therapy and one woman receiving oral contraceptive drugs. After discontinuation of drug usage, these levels returned toward normal over several months. Each patient had a mild underlying hyperlipemia. The mechanism involved in the elevation of the triglyceride levels appears to be an enhanced hepatic synthesis rather than defective removal and is due to the estrogenic component of the contraceptives. We suggest periodic monitoring of serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels in all patients receiving oral contraceptives and estrogens. Patients with preexisting hyperlipemia should probably not receive estrogen therapy.

9. Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users (23). Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 mcg of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance (62). Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents (23,63). However, in the non-diabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose (64). Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives.

A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS 1a. and 1d .), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users.

10. Elevated Blood Pressure

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives (65) and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users (66) and with continued use (65). Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners (18) and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing concentrations of progestogens.

Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases or renal disease (67) should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely, and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued. For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives (66), and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever and never users (65,67,68).

11. Headache

The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern which is recurrent, persistent, or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause.

12. Bleeding Irregularities

Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Non-hormonal causes should be considered, and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.

Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent.

### Lipid metabolism in women: a review [^114hgbxK]. Atherosclerosis (2025). Medium credibility.

The menopausal transition, defined by the cessation of menstruation due to declining ovarian follicular function, results in a marked decrease in endogenous estrogen levels. This phase is associated with significant metabolic changes and a shift towards a more atherogenic lipid profile. Specifically, there are increases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides and unfavorable alterations in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) levels. These lipid changes, which contribute to an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, are influenced by diminished estrogen levels and chronological aging. However, the specific mechanisms driving this increased risk are not fully understood. A thorough understanding of these lipid profile alterations is important for developing strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in women. This review provides an overview of how lipid metabolism is affected during the menopausal transition and the resulting implications for cardiovascular risk.

### Association between prediagnostic glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and meningioma, and reverse causality [^115j96Pd]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Previous literature indicates that obesity increases meningioma risk; obesity also increases risk of type 2 diabetes; we therefore expected hyperglycaemia to be positively associated with meningioma. Instead, within 15 years before the last observation we found inverse associations between prediagnostic glucose levels and meningioma among both fasting women and non-fasting women and men. Consistent with these results, we observed inverse relationships between prediagnostic diabetes and meningioma. We also found that serum cholesterol levels, measured within the year before the last observation were inversely related to meningioma hazard rates.

Ours is the first study to identify an inverse association between prediagnostic serum glucose levels and meningioma. Although there is evidence of similar inverse associations between prediagnostic serum glucose or diabetes and glioma and prostate cancer, associations between prediagnostic serum glucose and cholesterol levels and cancer incidence are generally positive.

Gender differences in tumour risk are sometimes attributable to the effects of exogenous and endogenous sex hormones. Elevated endogenous oestrogen levels, which are associated with obesity in postmenopausal women, also increase meningioma risk.present credible evidence of an increased risk of meningioma among women who use oestrogen-only hormone replacement therapy. In addition, endogenous sex hormones participate in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. However, in a study of tissue samples from 510 tumoursfound progesterone receptors in 87.1% of the samples from women and 91.5% of those from men. They also observed an approximately equal distribution of oestrogen and androgen receptors in these tumours between the sexes. They therefore conclude that sex hormone receptors per se are not the source of meningioma gender differences. However, the role of these receptors may differ in men and women. For example, show that a progesterone receptor antagonist reduces fasting glycaemia levels in female but not in male mice. Assuming these findings pertain to humans, they indicate the complexity of the relationship between sex hormones and serum glucose levels. Furthermore, there are two types of progesterone receptors; one may inhibit meningioma cell proliferation, the other may promote it. Increasing the probability that progesterone affects meningioma development is the fact that it can be synthesised in the nervous system, where it modulates neuronal excitability. An understanding of the role of sex hormones in meningioma aetiology and progression may provide additional insights into treatment strategies.

10. Elevated Blood Pressure

Women with significant hypertension should not be started on hormonal contraception.92An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives68and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users69and with extended duration of use.61Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners12and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing progestational activity.

Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal disease70should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If these women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and if a clinically significant persistent elevation of blood pressure (BP) occurs (≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic) and cannot be adequately controlled, oral contraceptives should be discontinued. In general, women who develop hypertension during hormonal contraceptive therapy should be switched to a non-hormonal contraceptive. If other contraceptive methods are not suitable, hormonal contraceptive therapy may continue combined with antihypertensive therapy. Regular monitoring of BP throughout hormonal contraceptive therapy is recommended.96For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives, and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension between former and never users.68 to 71

### Common medications used by patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: what are their effects on the lipid profile? [^116vYZ3m]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Oral contraceptives and HRT

According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), more than 10 million women in the United States are affected by diabetes. Many oral contraceptives are associated with a negative impact on the lipid profile. Second-generation oral progestogen contraceptives (e.g. levonorgestrel) have been shown to increase LDL-C and TG levels (the latter sometimes profoundly), while decreasing HDL-C levels. In contrast, third-generation progestogens (e.g. desogestrel) have no associated increase in ASCVD risk factors. Although these contraceptives significantly increase TG levels, they also lead to a decrease in LDL-C levels and an increase in HDL-C levels due to slowing of HDL-C transport to the liver. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) increases LDL-C, decreases HDL-C, and has no effect on TG levels.

In combined oral contraceptive pills, the estrogen component typically mediates a decrease in LDL-C levels and an increase in HDL-C and TG levels, whereas the progestogen component increases LDL-C and decreases HDL-C and TG levels. The overall effect on the lipid profile leads to reduced levels of LDL-C and increased levels of HDL-C and TG.

In postmenopausal women with normal or elevated baseline lipid levels, oral estrogen monotherapy as HRT reduces LDL-C levels and increases HDL-C levels. In contrast, transdermal administration of 17β-estradiol has been found to have no effect on lipoprotein levels. In women taking oral conjugated estrogen combined with DMPA, no CV benefit has been observed in large randomized clinical trials of primary or secondary prevention. The expected ASCVD benefit of oral combination HRT may have been offset by other effects, such as an increase in clotting factors and consequent elevated risk of thromboembolism.

### Efficacy and safety of fezolinetant for moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy: phase 3b randomised controlled trial [^115q1RCS]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vasomotor symptoms, comprising hot flushes and night sweats, are the most common and bothersome symptoms associated with menopause. Up to 80% of women experience vasomotor symptoms during menopause. Moderate-severe symptoms occur in 11–46% of women older than 40 years, with a median total duration around 7.4 years, whereas the severity of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause varies throughout the course of menopause and among women.

Although vasomotor symptoms are common and often severe enough to warrant medical treatment, approved and effective non-hormonal treatments are limited. Hormone therapy is effective but not appropriate for everyone. Treatment is contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer, uterine cancer, active liver disease, or thromboembolic diseases, and caution is advised in those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and raised triglyceride levels. Hormone therapy is not suitable for many women, and some choose not to use it.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^114kFxwn]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Progestins in feminizing hormone therapy — evidence and safety: With the exception of cyproterone acetate, which is not approved for use in the US because of concerns of potential hepatotoxicity, the use of progestins in hormone therapy regimens remains controversial, and there are no quality data to support such progestin use; a commissioned systematic review failed to identify enough data to make a recommendation in favor of any progestins and existing data suggest harm is associated with extended progestin exposure. Potential adverse effects of progestins include weight gain, depression, and lipid changes; micronized progesterone may be better tolerated and may have a more favorable impact on the lipid profile than medroxyprogesterone. For transgender women using estrogens, cyproterone acetate is associated with elevated prolactin, decreased HDL cholesterol, and rare meningiomas — none of which are seen when estrogens are paired with GnRH agonists or spironolactone. Evidence from cisgender cohorts indicates medroxyprogesterone added to combined equine estrogens is associated with greater breast cancer and cardiac risks, but data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies may not be generalizable to transgender populations. If a trial of progesterone therapy is begun after discussing risks and benefits, the prescriber should evaluate the patient within a year to review the patient's response to this treatment.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^111v8hN5]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Menopause and CVD risk

As early as 1976, Framingham investigators reported a 2.6-fold higher incidence of CV events in age-matched postmenopausal women when compared with premenopausal women. These same data also found that, on average, women develop CVD 7–10 years later in life compared with men. Observational studies since then have also consistently shown that early age at menopause is positively associated with IHD. – As a result, it has been hypothesized that the pronounced risk of IHD in older women is related to the mid-life withdrawal of endogenous sex steroids associated with the menopausal transition.

This hypothesis is supported by several observations. First, menopause has shown to be associated with more atherogenic shifts in the lipid profile. After menopause, women are noted to have higher total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in addition to reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In the Study of Women Across the Nation, LDL-C and apolipoprotein B in particular, when compared with other common CV risk factors, were the only two factors to change in association with menopause and not just age. Second, studies have revealed that the weight gain experienced in midlife, specifically increased fat mass, loss of skeletal mass, and increased waist circumference, cannot be explained by increasing age alone but by ovarian aging associated with the last menstrual period. The menopause transition has shown to contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome by impairing glucose metabolism in addition to causing negative effects on blood pressure, weight gain, and central abdominal obesity. Third, menopause is associated with greater percentage of both epicardial and paracardial adipose tissue, two emerging risk factors for IHD.

### Ovarian lipid metabolism modulates circulating lipids in premenopausal women [^115X7RW1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Context

The premenopausal circulating lipid profile may be linked to the hormonal profile and ovarian lipid metabolism.

Objective

Assess how estradiol, progesterone, and ovarian lipid metabolism contributes to the premenopausal lipid profile; and evaluate the acute effects of a common hormonal oral contraceptive (OC) on circulating lipids.

Design

Experimental crossover with repeated measures.

Setting

Academic hospitals.

Patients

Eight healthy, regularly menstruating women.

Interventions

Participants underwent periodic serum sampling during a normal menstrual cycle; a standard 21-day, monophasic combined hormonal OC cycle (30 µg of ethinyl estradiol and 150 µg of levonorgestrel per day); menopause simulated by leuprolide acetate (22.5-mg depot); and an artificial menstrual cycle achieved via transdermal estradiol (50 to 300 µg/d) and vaginal micronized progesterone (100 to 300 mg/d).

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcomes included evaluation of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and the total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio. To estimate the effect of estradiol, progesterone, and ovarian lipid metabolism, all specimens except those from the OC cycle were analyzed. Subgroup analysis was conducted on the follicular and luteal phases. In a separate analysis, the effect of the OC was evaluated relative to the normal menstrual cycle.

Results

Estradiol was significantly associated with increased levels of HDL cholesterol throughout the menstrual cycle and in the follicular phase. Ovarian effects were associated with reduced lipid levels, especially during the luteal phase. The OC was associated with an increased total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol ratio and triglycerides.

Conclusion

Previously unappreciated factors including ovarian lipid metabolism may contribute to the premenopausal lipid profile.

### Combined hormonal contraceptive use among women with known dyslipidemias: a systematic review of critical safety outcomes [^113YmPDi]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Dyslipidemias represent a spectrum of lipid disorders that are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In addition, elevated triglycerides are known to be associated with pancreatitis. Though less clear, it is possible that dyslipidemias may also contribute to risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Ethinyl estradiol and progestogen, contained within combined hormonal contraception, are known to impact lipid metabolism.

Objectives

To evaluate from the literature whether use of combined hormonal contraception (CHC), including combined oral contraception (COC) pills, transdermal patch, vaginal ring or injectables, modifies the relative risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, VTE or pancreatitis among women with known dyslipidemias and to determine if existing lipid abnormalities worsen with CHC use.

Methods

PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for all articles in all languages published between inception and September 2014 relevant to dyslipidemia, CHC use and serious adverse events (MI, stroke, VTE or pancreatitis). The quality of each individual study was assessed using the system for grading evidence developed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force.

Results

From 306 articles identified by our search strategy, 3 articles met inclusion criteria. In a poor-quality case-control study, women with hypercholesterolemia but no COC use had an increased risk of MI (adjusted odds ratio [adj OR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6–6.8), as did women who used COCs but did not have hypercholesterolemia (adj OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4–2.8), compared with non-COC users without hypercholesterolemia; women with both COC use and hypercholesterolemia had an adjusted OR of 24.7 (95% CI 5.6–108.5) compared with women with neither risk factor. A poor-quality cohort study examined COC users and reported that women with dyslipidemia had increased risk for VTE [crude risk ratio (RR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.04–1.85] and transient ischemic attacks or cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.51–2.06) compared to those without dyslipidemia. Another poor-quality cohort study provided direct evidence on changes in lipid levels among COC users with dyslipidemia. A minority of women with elevated total cholesterol or triglyceride levels at baseline showed normal results (25% and 28%, respectively) after 6 cycles of COC use. No evidence regarding risks associated with use of other CHC methods was identified. No evidence was identified for the outcome of pancreatitis.

Conclusion

Limited data from poor-quality observational studies suggest that women with known dyslipidemias using CHC may be at increased risk for MI and may experience a minimal increase in risk for CVA or VTE. No evidence was identified on risk for pancreatitis in this context. The impact of CHC exposure on the status of lipid abnormalities over time, an intermediate marker for disease, is also unclear. Given the significant limitations of this body of evidence, the importance of access to effective contraception and theoretical concerns raised about the use of CHCs by women with known dyslipidemias, additional rigorous studies are needed to best estimate true associations. Contraceptive decision making should include consideration of both the known and theoretical risks of a given CHC method, safety and acceptability of alternative contraceptive methods, and risks associated with unintended pregnancy.

### Progestogens of varying androgenicity and cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women receiving oestrogen replacement therapy [^1172w5UU]. Clinical Endocrinology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Medroxyprogesterone (MP) was used as the progestogen in randomized clinical trials of postmenopausal hormone replacement on cardiovascular risk. To attempt to understand the lack of benefit in these trials, we have examined the effects of MP and two other progestogens, the less androgenic desogestrel (DG) and the more androgenic norethisterone (NE), on cardiovascular risk factors against a background of oestrogen therapy.

Design and Measurements

Thirty-four women were treated with conjugated equine oestrogens (CEE) 0.625 mg daily alone for 12 weeks, followed in random order by each of the three progestogens (DG 75 microg, MP 10 mg and NE 1 mg daily) given sequentially for three 12-week cycles while maintaining the same CEE treatment. We measured serum lipoproteins, paraoxonase activity, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, fasting glucose and insulin levels at baseline, at the end of the oestrogen-only phase and at the end of each of the combined oestrogen and progestogen phases.

Results

The addition of progestogens to CEE maintained the oestrogen-induced reduction in apolipoprotein B (apo B) and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], and further lowered total cholesterol (P < 0.01) and fibrinogen (P < 0.001). CEE raised serum triglyceride (P < 0.001) and CRP (P < 0.01) concentrations, which reverted towards pre-oestrogen levels with progestogens. Progestogens significantly reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P < 0.05). NE was associated with the greatest reduction in HDL cholesterol and apo A1, but was most effective in preserving paraoxonase activity and reducing the potentially unfavourable oestrogen-induced increases in triglycerides and CRP.

Conclusion

Preconceptions that more androgenic progestogens necessarily have more unfavourable effects on cardiovascular risk factors may require revision.

### Inflammatory, lipid, thrombotic, and genetic markers of coronary heart disease risk in the women's health initiative trials of hormone therapy… [^114u3E69]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Biomarkers tended to be more strongly associated with CHD in the initial 2 years after randomization. The genetic polymorphism glycoprotein IIIa leu33pro was significantly associated with CHD. Baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol interacted significantly with HT so that women with higher levels were at higher risk for CHD when given HT. The levels of several biomarkers were changed by HT, but these changes did not seem to be associated with future CHD events. The trial of conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone acetate in women with an intact uterus was stopped early because of an increase in cardiovascular events and in breast cancer. 1 The parallel trial of conjugated equine estrogens alone in hysterectomized women was also stopped early because of increased strokes and lack of benefit for CHD.

2 After publication of these findings, current recommendations state that HT should not be started or continued for the prevention of CHD.
3. Cases and controls in the present analyses demonstrated ORs of

1. 43 for conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone vs placebo and 1. 20 for conjugated equine estrogens vs placebo. In the combined trial data, the baseline level of LDL cholesterol interacted significantly with treatment assignment, with greater risks of CHD during HT in women with higher levels of LDL cholesterol. This finding depended on the trial of conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone rather than on the trial of conjugated equine estrogens. Hormone therapy in both trials increased CRP and MMP-9 levels, decreased E-selectin levels, and had no effect on IL-6 levels.

There were also significant increases in HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels and decreases in LDL and total cholesterol levels. Baseline LDL cholesterol seemed to modify significantly the effect of HT such that women with higher levels of LDL cholesterol were at higher risk for CHD. This interaction was significant overall and in each 2-year period after randomization.

### Vitamin D deficiency and dyslipidemia in early pregnancy [^115gb12a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Despite all these purported anti-atherogenic actions of vitamin D, our results indicate significant positive correlations between serum 25(OH)D levels and the atherogenic factors total cholesterol and triglycerides. A plausible explanation for the positive correlation in the pregnant woman may be a normal response to pregnancy, as tissues such as liver, muscle and fat may become more responsive to placental hormones; this is supported by the finding that progesterone increased cholesterol synthesis, which was inhibited by various statins. Further, the hyperglycemic and hyper-insulinemic and condition of GDM may facilitate synthesis of cholesterol by their direct influence on liver and adipose tissues. Serum triglycerides in pregnant women are increased 1.5 to 2-fold above non-pregnant concentrations by the third trimester and remain high around the clock, and this is attributed mainly to a combination hyperinsulinemia promoting triglyceride synthesis in the liver, increased food intake resulting in increased appearance of chylomicrons from the gut and reduced activity of lipoprotein lipase in adipose tissue, resulting in decreased clearance of triglycerides from the circulation. Thus, besides influencing carbohydrate metabolism, insulin and placental hormones, such as human placental lactogen, secreted during the course of pregnancy stimulate, either directly or indirectly some of the adaptations of maternal lipid metabolism. The major tissues affected by human placental lactogen are the liver, skeletal and heart muscles and adipose tissues.

Also, a modest positive relation was found between insufficient vitamin D status and hypercholesterolemia through regression analysis. The study subjects consisted of women in their 1 st trimester of pregnancy; future follow-up studies on these same women during the successive trimesters were planned and these might provide better clues in understanding the relation between vitamin D deficiency and pregnancy-induced atherogenic lipid metabolic markers. A quantitative relation between serum vitamin D and atherogenic markers during pregnancy is expected to help reveal the role of vitamin D in pregnant and perinatal women and provide useful clues regarding the optimal level of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113pd9pn]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Gender-affirming hormone therapy — lipid changes and cardiovascular risk context: In transwomen, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was reduced at all time points (-6.5 mg/dL [-0.2 mmol/L], -8.1 mg/dL [-0.2 mmol/L], and -8.5 mg/dL [-0.2 mmol/L]), and triglycerides (TG) increased by an estimated 31.9 mg/dL (0.4 mmol/L) (95% CI, 3.9–59.9) at ≥ 24 months; triglycerides were increased in those taking oral estrogens but not in those treated with transdermal estrogen. The estimates were limited by wide 95% CIs and few studies at the earliest and latest time points. There is a paucity of data evaluating CVD and CVD risk in transmen and transwomen; although mortality appears increased with gender-affirming hormone therapy, the increase is due in part to suicides, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and drug abuse, and CVD death was increased only in current but not past users of ethinyl estradiol. In the absence of further data, we suggest assessing ASCVD risk per usual guidelines, and the choice of which gender flag to use in the risk assessment is unknown.

### Serum lipid reference values recommended during a twin pregnancy and evaluating its association with perinatal outcomes [^111mRms1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Many articles have reported that the blood lipid level during pregnancy was elevated, where the most significant change was noticed in triglycerides, which was consistent with the results of this study. Changes in blood lipid levels during pregnancy were associated with the changes, including increased maternal appetite, intake, and insulin sensitivity during the early and middle stages of pregnancy, all of which promote lipid synthesis. The increase in insulin sensitivity activates fatty acid synthesis in adipocytes and the expression of lipoprotein lipase. In addition, substances like progesterone, leptin, and prolactin, also heighten fat storage. Late pregnancy is the second stage of lipid metabolism, which is the catabolism stage, in which insulin resistance and the increase of placental lactogens both enhance the lipolysis of triglycerides in adipose cells and synthetic lipoprotein in the liver, due to which overall lipid levels are increased. Studies have also shown that blood lipid levels recover to pre-pregnancy levels post-delivery, indicating that increased blood lipid levels during pregnancy play an important role in the process and, thereby, have a critical role in the physiological development of the fetus.

Dyslipidemia during pregnancy can have adverse fetal and maternal consequences, like any other metabolic abnormalities. Like many other studies, we have substantiated that during the first and the second trimester of pregnancy, the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes tends to increase with an increase in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein or with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein. Especial, the triglyceride levels during early pregnancy had a relationship with increased risks such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and small for gestational age. All the results upper suggesting that women in their childbearing age ought to control their blood lipid levels during pregnancy or even before pregnancy.

In this study we found that elevated blood lipid profiles may increase the risk of SGA. Elevated maternal blood lipid levels imply excessive lipid transport across the placenta to the fetus. Growth-restricted fetuses showed reduced lipoprotein lipase activity. A low level of lipoprotein lipase has been associated with the impaired development of adipose tissue and augmented circulating TG levels.

### Fluctuations of lipid and lipoprotein levels in hyperlipidemic postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy… [^115iqAUD]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions Hyperlipidemic postmenopausal women receiving combined sequential estrogen and progestogen replacement therapy demonstrate very significant fluctuations in their lipid and lipoprotein levels. These fluctuations depend on the hormonal phase, ie, estrogen alone or combined with progestogen. None had diabetes, renal disorders, or other metabolic or endocrine disorders. They were not receiving any medications other than hypolipidemic drugs and HRT. Mean LDLC levels increased by 13. 8%, from
4. 05 ± 1. 14 mmol/L to
4. 62 ± 1. 36 mmol/L. The addition of progestogen decreased mean HDLC levels by 10. 4%, from

1. 44 ± 0. 32 mmol/L to
2. 29 ± 0. 28 mmol/L.

In our study, we investigated the possibility that lipoprotein levels in hyperlipidemic postmenopausal women receiving combined sequential HRT fluctuate significantly throughout each cycle of treatment due to the different effect of estrogen and progestogen on plasma lipoproteins. Our results clearly demonstrated that serum levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDLC, and HDLC fluctuated vastly during the different hormonal phases of this treatment, ie, the addition of progestogen to the estrogen significantly increased levels of total cholesterol and LDLC and decreased levels of HDLC. In the study by Lemay et al, 15 LDLC levels decreased and levels of triglycerides and HDLC increased following 24 days of estrogen administration.

The sequential addition of progestogen attenuated the elevation of triglyceride and HDLC levels, as was also shown in our study; however, in contrast to our findings, they reported that progestogen further reduced, although not significantly, the LDLC levels. This effect on LDLC levels was also reported by others. 12, 14. We showed a positive correlation between the mean LDLC level during the estrogen phase and the mean increase of LDLC during the combined-therapy phase, and between the mean triglyceride levels during the estrogen phase and the mean decrease in HDLC levels during the combined-therapy phase. This provides a means of predicting the magnitude of changes in LDLC and triglyceride levels when progestogen is added to estrogen therapy.

### Association of hormonal contraceptive use with adverse health outcomes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials and cohort studies [^117H7SbM]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Hormonal Contraception and Metabolic Changes

In our umbrella review, metabolic changes were only assessed among women with PCOS. Therefore, it was difficult to extrapolate these associations to the general population because women with PCOS are typically obese and at risk of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and hyperlipidemia. Estrogen modifies lipid metabolism in the liver and regulates serum lipoprotein levels, resulting in increased high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels and decreased low-density lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels. Progestin type can also have consequences for the extent of lipid profile change induced by exogenous estrogen. Notably, the types of triglyceride particles increased by ethinyl estradiol have not been associated with increases in the risk of atherosclerotic disease. Among women with PCOS using combined oral contraception, the findings from our review of meta-analyses of RCTs suggested increases in high-density lipoprotein levels (mean difference ranging from 6.50 to10.00), and the findings from our review of meta-analyses of cohort studies suggested increases in triglyceride levels (mean difference ranging from 0.73to 39.82). Contrary to previous evidence, our review found an increase in low-density lipoprotein levels (mean difference ranging from 11.53 to 15.08 in a meta-analysis of RCTs) and total cholesterol levels (mean difference of 42.20 in a meta-analysis of RCTsand 13.70 in a meta-analysis of cohort studies) among women with PCOS. This difference potentially represents the consequences of different progestin formulations, follow-up durations, and compounding of factors underlying the metabolic changes of PCOS. The quality of evidence was rated class 4 in the cohort studies, and ranged from low to very low in the RCTsfor associations between women using combined oral contraception and lipid changes, such as increased total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In addition, the absolute increase in laboratory values was unlikely to be clinically meaningful.

### The effect of maternal obesity and lipid profile on first-trimester serum progesterone levels [^111AHxMs]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prepregnancy overweight increases the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Maternal lipid profile plays a key role in the production of pregnancy hormones. The influence that obesity has on the specific mechanisms that may be involved and the potential associations with abnormal conditions in pregnancy are still poorly understood.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of maternal body mass index and lipid profile on first-trimester serum progesterone levels.

Study Design

This was a prospective cohort study including 734 pregnant people. First-trimester maternal serum progesterone, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured between 9 and 11 weeks' gestation. Free β-hCG, PAPP-A, age, body mass index, smoking status, gestational age at delivery, fetal sex, and birthweight were also recorded. Pregnant people were classified according to their body mass index into underweight (n = 21), normal weight (n = 395), overweight (n = 221), obesity class I (n = 64), and obesity class II/III (n = 33) groups.

Results

Gestational age at sampling was 10.0 4 ± 1.12 weeks. Serum progesterone levels decreased as maternal body mass index increased (35.84 ± 12.00 ng/mL, 33.08 ± 11.27 ng/mL, 28.04 ± 8.91 ng/mL, 24.37 ± 8.56 ng/mL, and 19.87 ± 11.00 mL for underweight, normal weight, overweight, obesity class I, and obesity class II/III groups, respectively; P < .000001). There were statistically significant negative correlations between maternal progesterone and body mass index, triglycerides, and cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and positive correlations with gestational age at sampling, maternal age, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, crown-rump length, free β-hCG, and PAPP-A. Linear regression showed that the only independent predictor variables for progesterone levels were body mass index (P < .0001), PAPP-A (P < .0001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .0001), and free β-hCG (P < .0001) (R2 = 0.33; P < .0000001).

Conclusion

First-trimester serum progesterone levels were lower in overweight pregnant people and markedly decreased in those with obesity, especially obesity class II/III. Maternal high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was independently related to progesterone levels as a protective factor. Benefits of progesterone supplementation in pregnant people with obesity need further evaluation.

### Introduction: continuing story of premature progesterone elevation [^115rMdSC]. Fertility and Sterility (2018). Low credibility.

Since the late 1980s premature progesterone elevation has repeatedly caught the attention of investigators, not only for its importance, but also because studies have shown differing results and conclusions, constituting an unexplainable sequence of doubts and uncertainties. This issue's Views and Reviews section seeks to present a sequence of short and complementary papers summarizing the whole story and updating the reader on the current information and perspectives on premature progesterone elevation.

### Efficacy of oral versus transdermal estrogen therapy on cardiovascular and lipid parameters among postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^113Rx8tj]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Menopause is characterized by significant physiological changes, including cardiovascular and hormonal alterations. Estrogen therapy is a critical intervention for managing menopausal symptoms and preventing long-term complications. Understanding the differences between the estrogen therapy administration routes is essential for optimizing treatment strategies.

Objective

This study aimed to compare oral and transdermal routes of estrogen therapy among postmenopausal women and assess changes from baseline in key cardiovascular and lipid parameters, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, total cholesterol, low and high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels.

Evidence Review

PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials. gov were searched for randomized clinical trials comparing oral and transdermal estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women. Pooled mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs were estimated using a random effects model. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.3.2.

Findings

Eight randomized clinical trials, with a total of 885 participants, were included. Of these participants, 453 (51.2%) received oral estrogen therapy. Participants receiving oral estrogen therapy had a higher mean change in high-density lipoprotein levels (MD = 3.48 mg/dL; 95% CI: 1.54–5.43; P < 0.01) coupled with a significant rise in mean triglyceride levels (MD = 19.82; 95% CI: 6.85–32.78; P < 0.01), compared with participants receiving transdermal estrogen therapy. There were no significant differences in the mean changes from baseline in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein levels.

Conclusions and Relevance

Compared with transdermal estrogen therapy, oral estrogen therapy was associated with a greater increase in high-density lipoprotein levels in postmenopausal women. However, this was associated with a greater increase in the triglyceride levels. This suggests that the choice of estrogen therapy route should be individualized, considering the patients' baseline hormonal and metabolic parameters, particularly lipid profiles.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol (lutera) [^117WTiYs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

9. Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects

Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users. Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 mcg of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance. Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents. However, in the nondiabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose. Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives.

A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS, 1a. and 1d.; PRECAUTIONS, 3.), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral-contraceptive users.

10. Elevated Blood Pressure

An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives and this increase is more likely in older oral-contraceptive users and with continued use. Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing quantities of progestogens.

Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal disease should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If women with hypertension elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued (see CONTRAINDICATIONS section). For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives, and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever- and never-users.

11. Headache

The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern that is recurrent, persistent or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause. (See WARNINGS, 1c. and CONTRAINDICATIONS .)

12. Bleeding Irregularities

Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. The type and dose of progestogen may be important. If bleeding persists or recurs, nonhormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out.

Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent.

### Does omega-3 fatty acid supplementation have favorable effects on the lipid profile in postmenopausal women? A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115UsJXZ]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Menopause is associated with disturbances in the metabolism of lipids. Moreover, during the postmenopausal period, female subjects are more prone to develop dyslipidemia. Omega-3 fatty acids, which exert cardioprotective, anti-inflammatory, and lipid-lowering actions, are commonly recommended in postmenopausal women. However, their effect on serum lipids in this population remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to clarify this research question.

Methods

We systematically searched the Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases from their inception until January 3, 2022. The DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model was used to combine effect sizes.

Findings

Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation resulted in a decrease in triglyceride concentrations (weighted mean difference [WMD], -17.8 mg/dL; 95% CI, -26 to -9.6; P < 0.001), particularly in the RCTs that lasted ≤ 16 weeks (WMD, -18.6 mg/dL), when the baseline triglyceride concentrations were ≥ 150 mg/dL (WMD, -22.8 mg/dL), in individuals with a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m 2 (WMD, -19.3 mg/dL), and when the dose of omega-3 fatty acids was ≥ 1 g/d (WMD, -21.10 mg/dL). LDL-C (WMD, 4.1 mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.80 to 6.36; P < 0.001) and HDL-C (WMD, 2.1 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.97 to 3.2; P < 0.001) values increased. Total cholesterol levels (WMD, -0.15 mg/dL; 95% CI, -4 to 3.74; P = 0.94) remained unchanged after administration of omega-3 fatty acids.

Implications

In postmenopausal women, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids resulted in a significant reduction in triglyceride concentrations and a modest elevation in HDL-C and LDL-C levels, whereas this intervention did not affect total cholesterol values.

### Androgen and lipid profiles in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome who were treated with two forms of combined oral contraceptives [^116DKTK2]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effects of cyproterone acetate and desogestrel, as part of combined oral contraceptives, on lipid metabolism and hirsutism of adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Design

Prospective randomized clinical trial.

Setting

Outpatient gynecology clinic (referral center) of a university.

Patient(S)

Twenty-eight adolescent girls with clinical and biological hyperandrogenism and six or less menses during the past 12 months.

Intervention(S)

Group A (n = 14) received 0.15 mg of desogestrel plus 0.030 mg of ethinyl estradiol daily. Group B (n = 14) received 2 mg of cyproterone acetate plus 0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol daily. Treatment was given for 21 days followed by a 7-day rest for a period of 12 months.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Hirsutism and lipid profile were evaluated before initiation and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment. Androgen profile was evaluated before and at 12 months of treatment.

Result(S)

A significant decline of the Ferriman-Gallway hirsutism score was observed from the sixth month of therapy in both groups. During therapy, the levels of testosterone, free testosterone, Delta(4)-androstenedione, and 17OH-progesterone decreased significantly, whereas sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) increased significantly in both groups. The level of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increased significantly, whereas high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I increased significantly from the third month of therapy in both groups. Total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios remained unchanged. The levels of triglycerides increased significantly in the cyproterone acetate-treated group after the third month.

Conclusion(S)

Treatment of adolescent girls with PCOS with the two studied formulations is comparably effective in decreasing hirsutism and androgen levels. Both combined oral contraceptives are associated with an increase of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol levels and no change of the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratios. Treatment with the cyproterone acetate combined oral contraceptive is associated with a tendency toward increasing the levels of triglycerides.
