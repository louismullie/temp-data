Salmonella

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Salmonella infections, covering classification, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical syndromes, diagnostics, treatment, special populations, complications, prevention, and a practical algorithm, with explicit self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental classification and why it drives management. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and burden to frame risk. Next, I will review pathophysiology to connect symptoms with mechanisms. After that, I need to delineate clinical syndromes and their distinguishing features. Then, I should confirm diagnostic strategies, including when to culture and when not to rely on serology. Next, I will examine treatment principles for nontyphoidal versus typhoidal disease, including duration and resistance. I will then consider special populations such as HIV, pediatrics, older adults, and pregnancy. I should also review complications and when to image or intervene. Finally, I will synthesize prevention and a pragmatic clinical algorithm, and close with a concise summary that ties these threads together.

> Let me first confirm the classification because everything downstream depends on it. Salmonella enterica is divided into typhoidal serovars (Typhi and Paratyphi A/B/C), which are human-restricted and cause systemic enteric fever, and nontyphoidal serovars (for example, Typhimurium, Enteritidis), which typically cause self-limited gastroenteritis but can be invasive in vulnerable hosts, with mortality up to 30% in untreated typhoid and substantial case fatality in invasive nontyphoidal disease in high-burden settings [^113nnopJ] [^116g7VN7] [^112LQ23g].

> I need to check the epidemiology to calibrate pretest probabilities. Globally, typhoid remains endemic where water, sanitation, and hygiene are inadequate, with an estimated 10.9 million cases and 116,800 deaths in 2017, while invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella (iNTS) causes roughly 535,000 illnesses and 77,500 deaths annually, concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia; in the U.S., about 1.35 million Salmonella infections occur yearly, with underdiagnosis common and travel-linked cases frequent for typhoid [^116TAGmK] [^11515gHs] [^111GsuTZ] [^111TEVvW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about transmission without verifying routes. Typhoidal disease spreads via the fecal-oral route through contaminated water and food, whereas nontyphoidal disease is classically foodborne but also spreads through animal contact and environmental contamination; outbreaks have been linked to produce, poultry, eggs, nut butters, and even pet reptiles and backyard poultry, underscoring diverse reservoirs and pathways [^113nnopJ] [^111GsuTZ] [^111kDqQy] [^114boWeq].

> Next, I should review pathophysiology to connect symptoms with mechanisms. After ingestion, Salmonella invades the intestinal epithelium, triggers inflammation, and in typhoidal disease disseminates via macrophages to lymphatics and the reticuloendothelial system, producing a characteristic stepwise fever and systemic toxicity; in contrast, nontyphoidal disease is typically confined to the gut but can breach mucosa in susceptible hosts, explaining invasive complications and prolonged carriage in some cases [^113nnopJ] [^116KZRtX].

> Let me consider the clinical syndromes carefully. Nontyphoidal gastroenteritis typically presents 6–72 hours after exposure with diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, resolving in 4–7 days; invasive nontyphoidal disease often presents as a febrile systemic illness with or without diarrhea and carries high mortality in endemic settings; typhoid and paratyphoid present with insidious fever, malaise, headache, and relative bradycardia, with diarrhea variably present and complications including ileal perforation and hemorrhage in the second week if untreated [^111GsuTZ] [^115d51kU] [^113nnopJ].

> I should double-check diagnostics because missteps here lead to overtreatment or missed invasive disease. For suspected enteric fever or invasive salmonellosis, obtain blood cultures before antibiotics, recognizing sensitivity is about 40–80% for blood and 80–95% for bone marrow; avoid serologic tests due to poor performance, and use stool cultures when gastroenteritis is suspected, especially in immunocompromised hosts where bacteremia risk is high; in older adults with sustained fever or bacteremia, consider imaging for endovascular complications [^116RBnVD] [^111NRyKo] [^115o5vQm] [^111u8tng].

> Now, treatment for nontyphoidal gastroenteritis in immunocompetent hosts requires careful verification. I initially thought antibiotics might shorten illness by about a day, but wait, let me verify the highest-quality evidence; the Cochrane review shows no clinically meaningful benefit and increased carriage with antibiotics, so routine antibiotics are not recommended for uncomplicated cases, with exceptions for high-risk groups such as infants under 3 months, adults over 50 with atherosclerosis, immunocompromised patients, and those with significant joint disease; when antibiotics are indicated, fluoroquinolones or ceftriaxone are reasonable choices guided by susceptibilities [^116z77NH] [^116Qoiew] [^112hV4Jn].

> For typhoidal disease, I need to ensure I align with resistance-aware regimens. First-line therapy includes ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin, with azithromycin as an alternative, but I should confirm regional resistance patterns because fluoroquinolone resistance is common in South Asia and ceftriaxone resistance is reported in Pakistan; duration is typically 7–14 days, with longer courses for severe or complicated disease, and delays in appropriate therapy increase complications and mortality [^113nnopJ] [^113yctgB] [^113RoD7v].

> Special populations demand tailored plans, so let me review HIV-specific guidance. People with HIV have a 20–100 fold increased risk of Salmonella bacteremia and up to sevenfold higher mortality, so all such patients should receive antibiotics; for gastroenteritis without bacteremia, treat 7–14 days if CD4 ≥ 200 cells/mm³ and 2–6 weeks if CD4 < 200 cells/mm³; for bacteremia, treat 14 days minimum if CD4 ≥ 200 cells/mm³ and 2–6 weeks if CD4 < 200 cells/mm³, with ciprofloxacin preferred and ceftriaxone reasonable when invasive disease is suspected; consider secondary prophylaxis for recurrent bacteremia or severe recurrent gastroenteresis, and discontinue when viral suppression is sustained and CD4 > 200 cells/mm³ [^113imG9f] [^1177JeHp] [^113b4sg3] [^111WErmR].

> I should confirm pediatric nuances. Children with Salmonella gastroenteritis generally follow the same no-routine-antibiotics principle unless high risk, but osteoarticular infections, more common in those with hemoglobinopathies, often require prolonged therapy of 4–6 weeks; neonates and infants under 3 months merit antibiotics due to higher invasion risk, and arthrocentesis with early orthopedic involvement is important for septic arthritis [^115AhZc6] [^112aXex3] [^112hV4Jn].

> Older adults are another group where I need to ensure vigilance. Illness severity and hospitalization rates rise with age, and classic symptoms may be blunted, so a lower threshold for blood cultures, imaging for vascular complications, and antibiotic therapy is prudent; sustained fever or bacteremia despite therapy should prompt evaluation for endovascular infection, particularly mycotic aneurysm or aortitis [^1112EN9i] [^111u8tng].

> Pregnancy is a context where I should verify safety. Typhoid in pregnancy increases risks of miscarriage and preterm labor, so prompt treatment with ceftriaxone is preferred; fluoroquinolones are generally avoided in pregnancy, and azithromycin may be considered when appropriate [^notfound].

> Complications and their management require a careful, organ-system approach. Intestinal perforation or hemorrhage in typhoid necessitates surgical consultation and prolonged antibiotics; endovascular infections may require weeks of therapy and sometimes surgical repair; osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and abscesses need source control and extended antibiotics; meningitis and other CNS involvement are rare but severe and require aggressive, pathogen-directed therapy; imaging is indicated for suspected aortitis, mycotic aneurysm, or uncontrolled foci in older adults with invasive disease [^113nnopJ] [^114xQq7H] [^111u8tng].

> Prevention is multifaceted, so I should confirm key pillars. Vaccination against typhoid is recommended for travelers to endemic regions, household contacts of carriers, and laboratory workers, with Vi-conjugate vaccines offering improved immunogenicity; safe water, sanitation, and hygiene are foundational; food safety practices and avoiding high-risk foods reduce nontyphoidal risk; in travelers' diarrhea, avoid rifaximin if invasive diarrhea is suspected because it lacks activity against invasive pathogens [^114LJj5V] [^113nnopJ] [^1151PBXi].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical algorithm and sanity-check each branch. In a patient with acute diarrhea and no high-risk features, prioritize supportive care and avoid antibiotics; if high-risk features are present or if fever and systemic toxicity suggest invasive disease, obtain blood and stool cultures and start empiric therapy with a fluoroquinolone or ceftriaxone while awaiting susceptibilities; if enteric fever is suspected, obtain pre-antibiotic blood cultures and treat with ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin guided by local resistance; tailor duration to immune status, presence of bacteremia, and complications; monitor for recurrence in HIV and consider secondary prophylaxis until immune reconstitution [^116Qoiew] [^113nnopJ] [^1177JeHp].

> In summary, I need to ensure the core message is explicit and evidence-aligned. Nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis in immunocompetent hosts is usually self-limited and should not be treated with routine antibiotics, whereas typhoidal disease and invasive nontyphoidal disease require prompt, pathogen- and resistance-informed therapy; host factors, especially HIV, age, and pregnancy, shift thresholds for diagnostics, treatment, and monitoring, and prevention hinges on vaccination, WASH, and food safety [^116z77NH] [^113nnopJ] [^1177JeHp].

---

Salmonella is a **Gram-negative rod** that causes gastroenteritis, enteric fever, and invasive infections, with transmission via contaminated food or water [^111GsuTZ] or animal contact [^112gm5d7]. Most cases are self-limited, but **antibiotics are indicated** for severe illness, immunocompromised patients, or invasive disease [^116Qoiew]; ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone are first-line, guided by susceptibilities [^112hV4Jn]. Diagnosis relies on stool or blood cultures [^116RBnVD]; rapid molecular tests are increasingly used [^111bY12L]. Prevention centers on safe food handling, hand hygiene, and vaccination for travelers to endemic regions [^114LJj5V] [^114boWeq].

---

## Microbiology and classification

Salmonella is a **Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rod** in the Enterobacteriaceae family. Serovars are classified as typhoidal (**S. Typhi, S. Paratyphi A/B/C**) — human-restricted and causing enteric fever [^113nnopJ] — or nontyphoidal (e.g. S. Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis), which cause gastroenteritis and invasive disease in immunocompromised hosts [^112ru5aS].

---

## Epidemiology

- **Global burden**: ~1.35 million U.S. infections annually; ~450 deaths [^111GsuTZ].
- **High-risk groups**: children < 5 years, older adults, immunocompromised, travelers to endemic areas [^111GsuTZ] [^114boWeq].
- **Transmission**: contaminated food/water, animal contact (poultry, reptiles, pets) [^111GsuTZ] [^112gm5d7].

---

## Clinical manifestations

| **Clinical syndrome** | **Common features** | **Severity** |
|-|-|-|
| Gastroenteritis | Diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting | Usually self-limited |
| Enteric fever (Typhoid/Paratyphoid) | Prolonged fever, malaise, headache, rose spots, relative bradycardia, abdominal pain | Moderate-severe |
| Invasive disease | Bacteremia, sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, mycotic aneurysm | Severe |

---

## Diagnosis

- **Stool culture**: gold standard for gastroenteritis [^notfound].
- **Blood culture**: for enteric fever and invasive disease; sensitivity ~40–80% [^111NRyKo].
- **Bone marrow culture**: highest yield (~80–95%) for enteric fever [^111NRyKo].
- **Molecular tests**: rapid PCR increasingly used [^111bY12L].
- **Serology**: not recommended due to poor accuracy [^116RBnVD].

---

## Treatment

- **Uncomplicated gastroenteritis**: supportive care; antibiotics generally not indicated due to risk of prolonged carriage [^116z77NH] [^116Qoiew].
- **Severe illness or high-risk patients**: antibiotics indicated (immunocompromised, infants, elderly, invasive disease) [^112hV4Jn].
- **First-line agents**: ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone; alternatives include azithromycin, TMP-SMX, or carbapenems based on susceptibilities [^112hV4Jn].
- **Duration**: 7–14 days for gastroenteritis; 10–14 days for enteric fever; 2–6 weeks for invasive disease or immunocompromised patients [^1177JeHp].

---

## Prevention

- **Food safety**: cook meats/eggs thoroughly; avoid raw/undercooked foods; safe water [^114boWeq].
- **Hand hygiene**: frequent handwashing, especially after animal contact [^114boWeq].
- **Vaccination**: recommended for travelers to endemic regions; two vaccines available (oral live attenuated, injectable Vi polysaccharide) [^114LJj5V].
- **Public health**: surveillance, outbreak investigation, antibiotic stewardship [^111GsuTZ].

---

## Antibiotic resistance

Multidrug resistance (MDR) is common in **S. Typhi**, including resistance to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins [^113nnopJ]. Resistance in nontyphoidal Salmonella is rising, particularly to fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins [^114Kk3cp]. Resistance complicates management and increases mortality, especially in invasive disease [^113Tqet7].

---

## Complications

Complications include **intestinal perforation and hemorrhage** in enteric fever [^116LoQET], as well as bacteremia, sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and mycotic aneurysm in invasive disease [^111u8tng]. Chronic carriage can occur, particularly with S. Typhi [^112D8aD3].

---

## Public health implications

Salmonella remains a **major global public health concern** due to its high burden, antibiotic resistance, and potential for outbreaks [^11515gHs]. Effective control requires coordinated efforts in surveillance, prevention, and treatment [^11515gHs].

---

Salmonella causes a spectrum of illness from self-limited gastroenteritis to severe invasive disease; **management is guided by severity and host risk**, with prevention through food safety, hygiene, and vaccination.

### Spectrum of imaging findings in Salmonella infections [^116vbyXV]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Radiologic findings in Salmonella infections are not well described. In most patients, Salmonella infections produce mild and self-limiting clinical manifestations and therefore are treated empirically with antibiotics. Radiologic investigations are usually performed for patients with severe clinical manifestations or complications and for patients with unusual findings.

Conclusion

This pictorial essay illustrates various imaging findings in culture-proven cases of Salmonella infection, described broadly as common and uncommon manifestations.

### Antimicrobials for treating symptomatic non-typhoidal Salmonella infection [^116z77NH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) commonly causes diarrhoea, and is usually self-limiting, although sometimes people become ill with sepsis and dehydration. Routine antibiotic use for this infection could result in persistent colonization and the spread of resistant bacterial strains.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of giving antibiotics to people with NTS diarrhoea.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register (up to August 2012), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CENTRAL) published in The Cochrane Library (up to Issue 8 2012); and MEDLINE, African Index Medicus, CINAHL, EMBASE, LILACS, and the Science Citation Index, all up to 6 August 2012. We also searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) for both completed and on going trials and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antibiotic treatment for diarrhoea caused by NTS species with placebo or no antibiotic treatment. We selected trials that included people of all ages who were symptomatic for NTS infection. Examples of symptoms included fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea. We excluded trials where the outcomes were not reported separately for the NTS subgroup of patients. Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria prior to study inclusion.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data on pre-specified outcomes and independently assessed the risk of bias of included studies. The primary outcome was the presence of diarrhoea between two to four days after treatment. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methods.

Main Results

Twelve trials involving 767 participants were included. No differences were detected between the antibiotic and placebo/no treatment arms for people with diarrhoea at two to four days after treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 7.21; one trial, 46 participants; very low quality evidence). No difference was detected for the presence of diarrhoea at five to seven days after treatment (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; two trials, 192 participants; very low quality evidence), clinical failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.25; seven trials, 440 participants; very low quality evidence). The mean difference for diarrhoea was 0 days (95% CI -0.54 to 0.54; 202 participants, four studies; low quality evidence); for fever was 0.27 days (95% CI -0.11 to 0.65; 107 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence); and for duration of illness was 0 days (95% CI -0.68 to 0.68; 116 participants, two studies; very low quality evidence). Quinolone antibiotic treatment resulted in a significantly higher number of negative stool cultures for NTS during the first week of treatment (microbiological failure: RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.56; 166 participants, four trials). Antibiotic treatment meant passage of the same Salmonella serovar one month after treatment was almost twice as likely (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.98; 112 participants, three trials), which was statistically significant. Non-severe adverse drug reactions were more common among the patients who received antibiotic treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence of benefit for antibiotics in NTS diarrhoea in otherwise healthy people. We are uncertain of the effects in very young people, very old people, and in people with severe and extraintestinal disease. A slightly higher number of adverse events were noted in people who received antibiotic treatment for NTS.

### Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like? [^116TAGmK]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Typhoid fever is one of the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illness in the developing world, with an estimated 10.9million new cases and 116.8 thousand deaths in 2017. Typhoid point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests are widely used but have poor sensitivity and specificity, resulting in antibiotic overuse that has led to the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains. With recent advances in typhoid surveillance and detection, this is the ideal time to produce a target product profile (TPP) that guides product development and ensure that a next-generation test meets the needs of users in the resource-limited settings where typhoid is endemic.

Methods

A structured literature review was conducted to develop a draft TPP for a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test with minimal and optimal desired characteristics for 36 test parameters. The TPP was refined using feedback collected from a Delphi survey of key stakeholders in clinical medicine, microbiology, diagnostics and public and global health.

Results

A next-generation typhoid diagnostic test should improve patient management through the diagnosis and treatment of infection with acute Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi or Paratyphi with a sensitivity ≥ 90%and specificity ≥ 95%. The test would ideally be used at the lowest level of the healthcare system in settings without a reliable power or water supply and provide results in < 15min at a cost of < US$1.00.

Conclusion

This report outlines the first comprehensive TPP for typhoid fever and is intended to guide the development of a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test. An accurate POC test will reduce the morbidity and mortality of typhoid fever through rapid diagnosis and treatment and will have the greatest impact in reducing antimicrobial resistance if it is combined with diagnostics for other causes of acute febrile illness in a treatment algorithm.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^113CLKCu]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV-related nontyphoidal Salmonella — treatment duration by immune status and severity: For patients with CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 who have mild gastroenteritis without bacteremia, 7 to 14 days of treatment is recommended (BIII), while for the same patients with bacteremia, 14 days is appropriate provided clearance is documented, with longer treatment if bacteremia persists or infection is complicated (BIII). For advanced HIV disease (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3) with Salmonella infection, a minimum of 2 weeks with extension up to 6 weeks of antibiotics in severe disease or bacteremia is often recommended (BIII).

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^116Qoiew]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute severe inflammatory diarrhea in adults — several RCTs of empiric antimicrobial treatment have demonstrated an average of 1 day shorter symptoms compared with placebo, but these data are considered low quality; the largest treatment effect was seen in salmonellosis followed by campylobacteriosis, yet antimicrobial treatment also was accompanied by increased prolonged Salmonella shedding and occasional shedding of quinolone-resistant Campylobacter; the benefit of antimicrobial treatment of proven Campylobacter infection is small and antimicrobial agents are not recommended for most cases of proven Salmonella diarrhea; given that most inflammatory infectious diarrhea episodes are self-limited and the treatment benefit is modest, in most cases the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits, with exceptions in severe infections and in immunocompromised hosts.

### Salmonellosis as a differential diagnosis [^112sfqLY]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

With a low incidence of Salmonella infection, salmonellosis is an uncommon problem in Scotland. It occurs in both immune-compromised and immune-competent patients. We present two cases of salmonellosis in immune-competent patients who had had a history of gastroenteritis. Diagnosis was delayed in one patient; however, both patients received appropriate treatment and made good recovery following their respective illnesses. Apart from acting as a reminder to consider salmonellosis as a differential diagnosis when managing patients with infective process, the cases also highlight the importance of concise history taking, and the importance of cultures-and-sensitivities in managing infectious cases.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (treatment of nontyphoidal salmonellosis), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that the role of long-term secondary prophylaxis in patients with recurrent bacteremia or gastroenteritis is not well established. Weigh the benefits against the risks of long-term antibiotic exposure
. Use the same antibiotic choices for secondary prophylaxis as for primary treatment, depending on the sensitivity of the salmonella isolate. Recognize that HIV suppression with antiretroviral therapy is expected to reduce the risk of recurrent illnesses. Recognize that recurrence may indicate the development of antimicrobial resistance during therapy.

Continue treatment for a longer duration if bacteremia persists or if the infection is complicated (such as metastatic foci of infection are present). Continue treatment for 2–6 weeks if the CD4 count is < 200 cells/mm³.

### Advances in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of invasive Salmonella infections [^112E32oX]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica serotypes are among the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illnesses in the developing world. In this review, we discuss new advances in understanding of the burden, diagnostic approaches, treatment and vaccines for invasive Salmonella infections.

Recent Findings

Recent estimates of the global burden of typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella not only affirm the importance of these infections but also highlight the paucity of systematic incidence data from many regions. New data from Africa indicate that typhoidal Salmonella may be more common than previously considered. Novel diagnostic techniques for Salmonella include new serologic, molecular and metabolomic approaches, but blood culture - although slow and insensitive - remains the primary means of establishing a diagnosis. Antibiotic resistance, particularly to fluoroquinolones, continues to emerge and threatens to undermine treatment success for these infections. New vaccines for typhoid, including conjugate vaccines with longer duration of immunity than prior vaccines, represent a promising tool for prevention of enteric fever.

Summary

Invasive Salmonella infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing antibiotic resistance in Salmonella is concerning, and empiric oral options are being rapidly eroded. Where new effective antimicrobials are lacking, developments in vaccines offer hope for reducing the burden of Salmonella infections globally.

### What is beyond Salmonella gastroenteritis? A case of acute pancreatitis complicating Salmonella infection in a child: a case report and literature review [^114ckcP7]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The patient's clinical response was excellent. Whether the patient's improvement was due to antibiotics or supportive management for AP is unknown. Thus, whether Salmonella can lead to clinically evident pancreatitis remains unclear, and further studies must be done to answer this question. In this case, abdominal CT was the diagnostic imaging method of choice and it is a superior test compared to abdominal US that might have solved the confusion, but unfortunately, it was not done, as the family refused any further imaging.

In conclusion, although AP is a rare complication of Salmonella infection in the pediatric population, general pediatricians should entertain, the possibility of AP when patient presents with severe abdominal pain mimicking the characteristics of the pain associated with AP. Early screening and intervention will lead to better outcomes by decreasing the mortality and morbidity rates associated with Salmonella infection.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (treatment of nontyphoidal salmonellosis), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to complete a 7–14-day treatment for gastroenteritis without bacteremia if the CD4 count is ≥ 200 cells/mm³. Continue treatment for a minimum of 2 weeks if the CD4 count is < 200 cells/mm³, potentially extending up to 6 weeks in cases of severe disease or bacteremia.

Infectious diarrhea — clearance for child care/work after Salmonella and STEC: For Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, 3 negative stool cultures obtained at least 24 hours apart, at least 48 hours after cessation of antimicrobial therapy, and not earlier than 1 month after symptom onset may be required for readmission, and if any stool culture yields Salmonella Typhi, obtain monthly stool cultures during the subsequent 12 months until at least 3 consecutive stool cultures are without growth of Salmonella Typhi; negative stool culture results typically are not required for return with nontyphoidal Salmonella, while for STEC, children are excluded from child care until diarrhea resolves and 2 stool cultures negative for the organism typically are required for readmission.

Special considerations for starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) — ART initiation should follow standard guidelines, and the presence of a diarrheal illness is relevant only for a patient's ability to ingest and absorb ART. If recurrent enteric infections are documented or Salmonella bacteremia occurs, prompt initiation of ART should be considered regardless of CD4 count; the presence of an enteric infection should not delay ART initiation (BIII).

Treating salmonellosis — duration and secondary prophylaxis: For gastroenteritis without bacteremia, if CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3: 7–14 days (BIII); if CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 particularly if primary illness was severe: 2–6 weeks (BIII). For gastroenteritis with bacteremia, if CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3: 14 days; longer duration if bacteremia persists or if the infection is complicated (BIII); if CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3: 2–6 weeks (BIII). The role of long-term, secondary prophylaxis for patients with recurrent bacteremia or gastroenteritis is not well established and clinicians must weigh the benefit against the risks of long-term antibiotic exposure (BIII). Suppression of HIV replication with antiretroviral therapy (ART) is expected to decrease the risk of recurrent illnesses, and clinicians should be aware that recurrence may represent development of antimicrobial resistance during therapy. Some experts recommend secondary prophylaxis for patients with recurrent bacteremia, or patients with recurrent gastroenteritis (with or without bacteremia) with CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3 and severe diarrhea (CIII). When to stop secondary prophylaxis is listed as after resolution of Salmonella infection and response to ART with sustained viral suppression and CD4 count > 200 cells/mm3 (CII).

Salmonella spp — All HIV-infected patients with salmonellosis should be treated (AIII), and HIV infection increases the risk of Salmonella bacteremia 20- to 100-fold and mortality as much as 7-fold compared with that in patients who are not HIV-infected. The initial treatment of choice for Salmonella infection is a fluoroquinolone (AIII); ciprofloxacin is the preferred agent (AIII), while other fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin would likely be effective but have not been well evaluated (BIII), and alternatives depending on susceptibility include TMP-SMX or expanded-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone or cefotaxime (BIII). For patients with CD4 counts ≥ 200 cells/mm3 who have mild gastroenteritis without bacteremia, 7 to 14 days is reasonable and, if bacteremia is present, 14 days is appropriate provided clearance is documented; for advanced HIV disease (CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3), 2 to 6 weeks of antibiotics is often recommended (CIII), and some patients with Salmonella bacteremia may remain febrile for 5 to 7 days despite effective therapy. After treatment, patients should be monitored clinically for recurrence (BIII); secondary prophylaxis should be considered for recurrent Salmonella bacteremia (BIII) and might also be considered for recurrent gastroenteritis and in those with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 with severe diarrhea (BIII). Recurrent Salmonella bacteremia constitutes an AIDS-defining illness, suppression of HIV replication with ART appears to decrease the risk of recurrent illness, and in those with sustained viral suppression and CD4 counts > 200 cells/mm3, secondary prophylaxis can probably be stopped (CII).

### Salmonella meningitis in an immunocompetent adult [^112jjAk5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Non-enteric salmonella infections in immunocompetent adults are exceedingly rare in the United States, and meningitis is one of the least common extra-intestinal sites. In addition, it is very unusual for a patient with bacterial meningitis to present with classic meningitis signs and symptoms of > 72 h duration. The objective of this work is to describe a rare case of salmonella meningitis in an immunocompetent adult and, in the context of previously published case reports, describe the frequently atypical clinical course of salmonella meningitis along with the potential pitfalls encountered during its evaluation and treatment. An otherwise healthy 45-year-old man presented to our Emergency Department with frontal headache, fever, and stiff neck of 7 days duration. He was alert and oriented in triage, where he was noted to be afebrile, mildly tachycardic, with a normal blood pressure and respiratory rate; shortly after triage he developed a high fever, severe tachycardia, hypotension, and a change in mental status. He was resuscitated according to our severe sepsis protocol and treated empirically for bacterial meningitis. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures grew group D Salmonella berta. An evaluation for underlying immunodeficiency was unrevealing. The patient was discharged home on hospital day 7 in good condition. Salmonella meningitis can present with an indolent course and can mimic, in many misleading ways, the less serious diagnosis of aseptic meningitis. This case highlights the need for an unbiased clinical assessment, aggressive management of critical illness, and point-for-point correspondence between clinical data and assigned diagnosis.

### Complications and mortality of non-typhoidal Salmonella invasive disease: a global systematic review and meta-analysis [^111CSxXW]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

In conclusion, we showed that a considerable proportion of patients with non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease have related complications and death. Prompt diagnosis and management, including consideration of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease in the empirical management of severe febrile illness and sepsis in endemic areas, is warranted to improve clinical outcomes. The findings of our systematic review are available to further refine burden of disease estimates for non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease, the results of which inform investments in the development and deployment of vaccine and non-vaccine interventions to prevent non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease. Standardisation of definitions and reporting of complications would reduce the risk of bias of future reviews. Additional high-quality research relevant to non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease burden, including CFR, duration of illness and complications, disability weights, the effect of antimicrobial resistance on outcomes, and host risk factors, especially in regions with scarce data, are needed to better inform investments and decisions on vaccine development and deployment, as well as non-vaccine interventions.

Salmonellosis in adults and adolescents with HIV — preferred therapy and treatment duration: All people with HIV and salmonellosis should receive antimicrobial treatment due to an increase of bacteremia (by 20-fold to 100-fold) and mortality (by up to sevenfold) compared with individuals without HIV (AIII). For invasive disease (suspected or confirmed), ceftriaxone IV 1–2 g every 24 hours pending susceptibilities (BIII). For nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis (with or without bacteremia) (if susceptible), ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO (or 400 mg IV) every 12 hours (AIII). Duration for gastroenteritis without bacteremia is: if CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/mm3, 7–14 days (BIII); if CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3, minimum of 2 weeks (may extend to up to 6 weeks if with severe disease) (BIII). For gastroenteritis with bacteremia: if CD4 count ≥ 200/mm3, 14 days or longer duration if bacteremia persists or if the infection is complicated (e.g., if metastatic foci of infection are present) (BIII); if CD4 count < 200 cells/mm3, 2–6 weeks (BIII).

### Characteristics of Campylobacter and Salmonella infections and acute gastroenteritis in older adults in Australia, Canada, and the United States [^1112EN9i]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The early detection of enteric infections in older adults is challenging because typical signs and symptoms of disease may be less common, absent, or overlooked. Understanding illness characteristics of enteric infections among older adults could improve the timeliness and accuracy of clinical diagnoses, thereby improving patient outcomes and increasing cases reported to surveillance.

Methods

Here, we describe illness characteristics (percentage reporting bloody diarrhea, fever, vomiting, abdominal pain; percentage hospitalized; duration of hospitalization; and duration of illness) among older adults (≥ 65 years) with acute gastroenteritis and culture-confirmed Campylobacter and nontyphoidal Salmonella infections in Australia, Canada, and the United States and compare these characteristics with those among younger people (< 5 years, 5–24 years, and 25–64 years).

Results

A significant negative correlation was found between all symptoms and increasing age group, except for bloody diarrhea in cases of acute gastroenteritis. Adults aged ≥ 85 years reported bloody diarrhea in only 9% of nontyphoidal Salmonella and 4% of Campylobacter infections compared with 59% and 55% among children aged < 5 years. Conversely, a greater percentage of older adults (≥ 65) than younger persons (< 5, 5–24, 25–64) reported being hospitalized, with an increasing linear relationship in age groups 65 years and older.

Conclusions

Although older adults are more likely to have severe illness and be hospitalized, we found that the proportion of persons reporting symptoms typically associated with enteric infections decreases with age. These findings have implications for clinical recognition and treatment of gastrointestinal illness, as well as for public health research.

### Nontyphoidal salmonellosis [^114Kk3cp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Nontyphoidal Salmonella are important foodborne pathogens that cause gastroenteritis, bacteremia, and subsequent focal infection. These hardy bacteria are especially problematic in a wide variety of immunocompromised individuals, including (but not limited to) patients with malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus, or diabetes, and those receiving corticosteroid therapy or treatment with other immunotherapy agents. Endovascular infection and deep bone or visceral abscesses are important complications that may be difficult to treat. The site of infection and the individual's immune status influence treatment choices. The harbingers of resistance of nontyphoidal Salmonella to both fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins have been reported recently, and such resistance is likely to be a therapeutic problem in the future. The current report presents a brief overview of the problems and trends associated with salmonellosis that are of interest to the infectious diseases clinician.

Salmonellosis — alternative therapy and supportive measures: For nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis (with or without bacteremia) (if susceptible), alternatives include levofloxacin 750 mg PO (or IV) every 24 hours (BIII), moxifloxacin 400 mg PO (or IV) every 24 hours (BIII), TMP-SMX (160 mg/800 mg) PO (or IV) every 12 hours (BIII), or ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV every 24 hours (BIII). Oral or IV rehydration if indicated (AIII), and antimotility agents should be avoided (BIII). The role of long-term secondary prophylaxis in patients with recurrent Salmonella bacteremia is not well established; must weigh the benefits against the risks of long-term antibiotic exposure (BIII). Effective ART may reduce the frequency, severity, and recurrence of salmonella infections.

### CVID enteropathy associated with chronic norovirus infection: background, clinical features, and therapeutic aspects [^114SArro]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

Giardia sp. norovirus, Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. are predominant etiological agents of infectious gastroenteritis in individuals with CVID. Symptoms are typically nonspecific and vary from self‐limiting to chronic or refractory gastrointestinal discomfort, diarrhoea, and weight loss. A favourable correlation exists between Giardia, Salmonella, and Campylobacter infections in CVID patients exhibiting undetectable serum IgA levels, which is expected considering the recognized function of IgA in mucosal immunity. Norovirus and cytomegalovirus infections seldom possess clinical relevance in immunocompetent individuals; nonetheless, their sequelae might be severe in cases of CVID.

Norovirus gastroenteritis is a predominant cause of gastroenteritis globally. Its prevalence has been determined to be 7% among CVID patients. Norovirus impacts 19% of the global population; however, it has been detected in up to 100% of individuals with CVID enteropathy. Chronic norovirus infections have been recognized as a cause of CVID enteropathy. Consequently, individuals with CVID and concomitant norovirus infections must be actively followed for symptom remission, and alternate treatments should be contemplated if infections persist.

However, currently, there is no established conventional therapy for chronic norovirus infection resulting in CVID enteropathy. In the absence of systematic comprehensive studies, we must depend solely on case reports. We recently diagnosed and successfully treated a patient with CVID‐associated enteropathy related to chronic norovirus infection, which constitutes the central focus of this review. Our objective is to provide a concise overview of this distinct form of primary immunodeficiency, drawing on the current — albeit still incomplete — body of knowledge.

Follow-up evaluations after laboratory-confirmed pathogen-specific diarrhea — Follow-up testing is not recommended in most people for case management following resolution of diarrhea (strong, moderate), although serial stool specimens using culture-dependent methods for Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi, STEC, Shigella, nontyphoidal Salmonella, and other bacterial pathogens are recommended in certain situations by local health authorities following cessation of diarrhea to enable return to child care, employment, or group social activities (strong, moderate), and practitioners should collaborate with local public health authorities to adhere to return policies (strong, high). A clinical and laboratory reevaluation may be indicated in people who do not respond to an initial course of therapy and should include consideration of noninfectious conditions including lactose intolerance (weak, low). Noninfectious conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), should be considered in people with symptoms lasting 14 or more days and unidentified sources (strong, moderate). Reassessment of fluid and electrolyte balance, nutritional status, and optimal dose and duration of antimicrobial therapy is recommended in people with persistent symptoms (strong, high).

### Global burden of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease, 2010 (1) [^111UnFA7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

In the absence of a standard CFR for iNTS, we relied on expert opinion to estimate the most likely value. Our estimate of deaths from iNTS disease was high compared with the estimated number of deaths associated with HIV, malaria, and protein energy malnutrition. It is likely that many iNTS-associated deaths are currently counted as deaths resulting from these underlying conditions. This high estimate might have been biased by expert opinions from hospital-based studies and experiences, especially in established research programs that have better diagnostics and appropriate antimicrobial drug treatments and a higher level of care than in other settings.

Despite these limitations, we provide a baseline estimate of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease burden globally, which is urgently needed to set the scientific and policy agenda. We hope that our estimate will be refined in the future by incorporating new population-based surveillance data, improved estimates of the CFR, and more sophisticated approaches to extrapolation and modeling. We have demonstrated that iNTS disease is a major cause of illness and death globally, particularly in Africa. Improved understanding of the epidemiology of iNTS is needed to underpin effective efforts for prevention, control, and improved patient management.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bacterial enteric infections in HIV — culture-based diagnosis and when to obtain blood cultures. The diagnosis of Gram-negative bacterial enteric infection is established through cultures of stool and blood, and stool cultures are required to obtain antibiotic sensitivity testing for isolated enteric pathogens; stool cultures are preferred over or in addition to molecular diagnostics in HIV-infected patients. Because incidence of bacteremia associated with Salmonella gastroenteritis is high in HIV-infected individuals, blood cultures should be obtained from any patient with diarrhea and fever, and for shigellosis, blood cultures may be helpful but are less likely to be positive than in salmonellosis. Patients may also have non-jejuni non-coli Campylobacter species and enteropathic Helicobacter spp.; blood culture systems will typically grow these bacteria, but they are unlikely to be identified on routine stool cultures because growing these fastidious organisms requires special stool culture conditions.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^1136Zghu]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This IPD systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA-IPD Statement, and Cochrane instructions for IPD-MA. Considering the priority of the results for decision-making, and taking into account expected new evidence from a large ongoing trial in the topic, we conduct this review as a living systematic review. For the living systematic review we will repeat the search every 12 months. Updates of the meta-analysis will be conducted when new evidence that is likely to influence the results will be identified.

We included RCTs comparing short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia, as defined in individual trials. We included only trials evaluating patients with Gram-negative bacteremia as their target population. Trials evaluating various infection types (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infection), and reporting bacteremic patients as a sub-group were not included. We excluded trials addressing source of bacteremia requiring prolonged treatment (endocarditis/endovascular infections; necrotizing fasciitis; osteomyelitis; abdominal abscesses and other unresolved abdominal sources requiring source control (surgery/drainage); central nervous system infections; empyema; any uncontrolled focus of infection (undrained abscess/deep seated intra-abdominal infection, undrained moderate to severe hydronephrosis). We also excluded patients with intracellular pathogens including Salmonella spp. and Brucella spp.

Interventions tested were antibiotics with in vitro activity against the pathogen for ≤ 7 vs > 7 days. Any choice and route of administration of antibiotics (oral or intravenous) were eligible for inclusion. Any source of bacteremia not requiring prolonged treatment (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, etc.) and any place of acquisition (community or hospital) were eligible for inclusion.

Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day all-cause mortality; relapse of bacteremia; length of hospital stay; readmissions; local suppurative and distant complications; restarting of Gram-negative-directed antibiotic therapy; emergence of resistance to study antibiotics; functional capacity and time to return to baseline capacity; new clinically or microbiologically documented infection; and adverse events: any diarrhea, C. difficile associated diarrhea, acute kidney injury, and rash (for secondary outcomes definitions, see Appendix).

HIV-related nontyphoidal Salmonella — recurrence monitoring and secondary prophylaxis: People with HIV and Salmonella bacteremia should be monitored clinically for recurrence after treatment (BIII), with rates of invasive Salmonella illnesses increasing with age in each age group beyond infancy. Recurrence may present as bacteremia or as anatomically localized infection. Secondary prophylaxis should be considered for recurrent Salmonella bacteremia (BIII), might be considered for recurrent gastroenteritis (with or without bacteremia), and in those with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 with severe diarrhea (BIII); its value has not been established and must be weighed against long-term antibiotic risks. Recurrent Salmonella bacteremia constitutes an AIDS-defining illness, and HIV suppression with ART appears to decrease recurrent illness risk. In patients with sustained viral suppression and CD4 counts > 200 cells/mm3, secondary prophylaxis likely can be discontinued (CII); recurrence may indicate development of antimicrobial resistance during therapy.

### Enteric (typhoid and paratyphoid) fever [^113nnopJ]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Enteric fever, caused by the human-restricted bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (typhoid) and Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi A, B, and C (paratyphoid), affects persons residing in, or travelling from, areas lacking safe water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure. Transmission is by the faecal-oral route. A gradual fever onset over 3–7 days with malaise, headache, and myalgia is typical. Symptoms can be altered by previous antimicrobial use. Life-threatening complications can arise in the second week of untreated illness. Differentiation from other febrile illnesses is challenging. Blood or bone marrow culture remain reference standard diagnostic methods, despite the low sensitivity of blood culture. Azithromycin, ciprofloxacin (excepting cases originating in south Asia due to drug resistance), or ceftriaxone are recommended treatment options for both typhoid and paratyphoid; however, choice should be guided by local resistance patterns. Ciprofloxacin-resistant and ceftriaxone-resistant typhoid is common in Pakistan. Three vaccine types are available for prevention of typhoid disease, including the newer, more effective typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccines. Vaccination as well as water, sanitation, and hygiene measures are cornerstones of prevention.

Clinical features of invasive disease in sub-Saharan Africa

The clinical presentation of invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease in Africa is typically febrile systemic illness, resembling enteric fever; diarrhoea is often absent and other clinical features are diverse and non-specific (figure 2). A study of bacteraemia in adults in Malawinoted that a combination of high fever and splenomegaly suggested invasive disease, but that diagnosis cannot reliably be made without microbiological tests. In young children especially, a problematic clinical overlap exists with the presentations of pneumonia and malaria, and paediatric guidelines for empirical diagnosis and treatment in low-income settings fail to identify or treat invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease. Patients with invasive disease frequently present with apparent focal infection, particularly of the lower respiratory tract, which is commonly attributable to co-infection with other pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Even microbiologically confirmed invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease treated with appropriate antimicrobial drugs has a case fatality of 22–47% in African adults and children.

Clinical features of invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease in adults and children in Africa

Risk factors for invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease in children include HIV infection; malnutrition; and malaria, especially severe malarial anaemia, acute severe malaria, and recent malaria. Sickle-cell anaemia is also an important risk factor in African children. Invasive non-typhoidal salmonella predates HIV as an important clinical disease in children in Africa, and, although HIV is independently associated with the illness in febrile paediatric admissions (odds ratio 2·6), only roughly 20% of African children who get non-typhoidal salmonella disease are infected with HIV. The main risk factor in adults is undoubtedly advanced HIV infection. Case series typically show 95% of adult cases to be in people infected with HIV, of whom 80% have a CD4 T-lymphocyte count of fewer than 200 cells per μL. In adults infected with HIV, before the antiretroviral therapy era 20–40% of survivors had recurrence, even after appropriate antimicrobial drugs; despite retreatment, up to 25% of patients had several recurrences. Genomic typing of index and recurrence strains suggests that recrudescence is more common than reinfection as a cause of recurrences.

### The global burden of non-typhoidal Salmonella invasive disease: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2017 [^11515gHs]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Improved access to ART in the past decade has probably helped to reduce the burden of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease among those living with HIV, and continued support of ART programmes is essential for sustained progress on this front. Still, our estimates suggest that most non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease cases are not attributable to HIV infection, and reducing the burden of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease requires continued efforts to reduce acute malnutrition, prevent and treat malaria, improve access to safe water and sanitation, improve hygiene and food handling practices, and improve diagnostic techniques. Although better data and methods allowed us to improve upon previous estimates of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease burden, data limitations remain a crucial challenge. Efforts to reduce the burden of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease will hinge on the quality of evidence driving decision making. More population-based studies from selected countries and regions, particularly in Latin America, are essential, as are studies on non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease risk factors, including HIV, malaria, acute malnutrition, and sickle-cell disease.

Our results have important implications for clinical practice and public health policy. Given the high case fatality of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease, especially among elderly people and those living with HIV, clinicians in high-burden areas need to be aware of the scale of the problem and respond with timely and appropriate treatment. The paucity of data and uncertainties about the epidemiology of the disease highlight the urgent need for better screening and surveillance efforts to capture the true burden of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease and to better inform policy makers. Despite these challenges, non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease is clearly a major cause of death and disability that is likely to be responsible for a similar number of deaths and DALYs to salmonella enterocolitis. The inadequate attention paid to non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease suggests that it remains an under-recognised cause of global morbidity and mortality.

### The current status of enteric fever diagnostics and implications for disease control [^116LoQET]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Enteric (typhoid) fever is a clinical syndrome caused by ingestion of the gram-negative bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) or Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi (S. Paratyphi) A, B, or C. Despite the availability of good antimicrobial treatment regimens and new-generation conjugate vaccines for preventing S. Typhi infection (TCVs), enteric fever continues to cause a significant degree of morbidity and mortality worldwide; current estimates suggest approximately 13.5–26.9 million new cases of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A (the focus of this review) each year. The uncertainty around these estimates is, in part, due to the limitations in availability and performance of current diagnostic tools.

Enteric fever is associated with a broad spectrum of clinical disease, ranging from asymptomatic to severe symptoms, such as fever, malaise, headache, and complications of ileal ulceration including perforation and profuse hemorrhage. Furthermore, some individuals who are exposed to S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi A will go on to become long-term carriers, where the organisms are retained in the gallbladder and occasionally at other sites including the kidney. Why different individuals present with differing clinical symptoms is not understood, but laboratory models and human challenge with virulent organisms have revealed a highly complex natural history of infection resulting from the co-evolution of bacteria with humans. The result is that both S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A are exquisitely adapted to transit almost effortlessly throughout the human body, triggering a cascade of events that result in symptomatic disease in some, and long-term asymptomatic carriage in others. Consequently, diagnosing enteric fever remains an enigma, with symptomatic infections mimicking various aspects of many other infectious diseases. These factors are especially relevant in settings with the limited resources found in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where differential diagnostic tests (many of which have their own inherent limitations) for febrile disease are often not available, and diagnosis is performed purely on the clinical judgment of an attending healthcare worker.

Salmonella osteomyelitis in children is an uncommon condition, typically associated with hemoglobinopathies or other underlying disorders. Only few cases have been reported in children without predisposing factors. We describe 4 cases of Salmonella osteomyelitis in otherwise healthy children. Since treatment duration is expected to be prolonged, the practice of direct inoculation of aspirates into blood culture bottles appears to be essential for diagnosis and targeted therapy.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Bacterial enteric infections — Salmonellosis in HIV-infected patients: All HIV-infected patients with salmonellosis should receive antimicrobial treatment due to an increase of bacteremia (by 20–100 fold) and mortality (by up to 7-fold) compared to HIV-negative individuals (AIII). Preferred therapy is ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO (or 400 mg IV) q12h, if susceptible (AIII). Duration of therapy for gastroenteritis without bacteremia is: if CD4 count ≥ 200 cells/µL, 7–14 days (BIII); if CD4 count < 200 cells/µL, 2–6 weeks (BIII). For gastroenteritis with bacteremia: if CD4 count ≥ 200/µL, 14 days or longer if bacteremia persists or if the infection is complicated (BIII); if CD4 count < 200 cells/µL, 2–6 weeks (BIII). Alternative therapy options are levofloxacin 750 mg (PO or IV) q24h (BIII), moxifloxacin 400 mg (PO or IV) q24h (BIII), TMP 160 mg-SMX 800 mg (PO or IV) q12h (BIII), ceftriaxone 1 g IV q24h (BIII), or cefotaxime 1 g IV q8h (BIII). Secondary prophylaxis should be considered for patients with recurrent Salmonella gastroenteritis ± bacteremia (CIII) or patients with CD4 < 200 cells/µL with severe diarrhea (CIII). Other comments include oral or IV rehydration if indicated (AIII), antimotility agents should be avoided (BIII), the role of long-term secondary prophylaxis in recurrent Salmonella bacteremia is not well established and must weigh benefit against risks of long-term antibiotic exposure (BIII), and effective ART may reduce the frequency, severity, and recurrence of salmonella infections.

Antibiotic regimens may be combined with loperamide, 4mg first dose, and then 2mg dose after each loose stool, not to exceed 16mg in a 24-h period; if symptoms are not resolved after 24h, complete a 3-day course of antibiotics. Use empirically as first line in Southeast Asia and India to cover fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter or in other geographical areas if Campylobacter or resistant ETEC are suspected; preferred regimen for dysentery or febrile diarrhea applies to azithromycin; and do not use rifaximin if clinical suspicion for Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, or other causes of invasive diarrhea.

### Limited impact of Salmonella stress and persisters on antibiotic clearance [^116uSxm4]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Main

Effective antimicrobial therapy is crucial for control of bacterial infections. Antimicrobial resistance can impede treatment success, but eradication failures occur even in the absence of resistance. These failures are often attributed to host stresses that trigger bacterial drug toleranceand/or subsets of bacteria, such as persisters, that are refractory to killing. Supporting evidence comes mostly from laboratory conditions, and the relevance under physiological conditions remains unclear. Here we determined the quantitative effect of bacterial stresses and heterogeneity on antimicrobial efficacy in a mouse model of invasive salmonellosis, a difficult-to-treat infection that affects around 15 million patients and causes around 200,000 deaths annually. Our mouse model replicates treatment failures observed in humansand exposes Salmonella to diverse stresses, leading to the formation of heterogeneous bacterial subsets with divergent properties and fates. Thus, the model is suitable for assessing the effects of host stresses and bacterial heterogeneity on antimicrobial clearance in a clinically relevant context.

IDSA infectious diarrhea — fever or bloody diarrhea and enteric fever: People with fever or bloody diarrhea should be evaluated for enteropathogens for which antimicrobial agents may confer clinical benefit including Salmonella enterica subspecies, Shigella, and Campylobacter (strong, low). Enteric fever should be considered when a febrile person (with or without diarrhea) has a history of travel to areas in which causative agents are endemic, has consumed foods prepared by people with recent endemic exposure, or has had laboratory exposure to Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhi and Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Paratyphi (strong, moderate). In typhoid and paratyphoid fever, diarrhea is an uncommon feature, typhoid fever outbreaks in the United States are uncommon and usually associated with foodborne transmission from an asymptomatic carrier, and a travel history is frequent, reported in 68% of patients with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and 50% with Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^1155v631]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — procedural management and surgical considerations: When the initial procedure is performed by a non-orthopedist and the fluid appears purulent or initial testing suggests bacterial infection, orthopedic consultation for arthroscopy or arthrotomy should be considered, and aspiration via arthrocentesis may decrease the urgency for initial surgical intervention; some children improve sufficiently after initial aspiration that subsequent surgical intervention may not be necessary. In a Spain cohort of knee ABA, age < 3 years and CRP < 20 mg/L were predictive of successful outcome with aspiration alone. Clinicians should consider adjacent osteomyelitis, and when present, joint drainage may need to be accompanied by procedures to debride adjacent bone and soft tissue. Comparative data include a Malawi trial that randomized 61 children with shoulder ABA to aspiration versus arthrotomy and found no difference in outcomes, though non-typhoidal Salmonella species accounted for 80% of positive joint fluid cultures, limiting generalizability. Arthroscopic drainage is described as safe and effective across multiple joints, and in an Australian study of pediatric knee ABA was associated with fewer repeat irrigations and shorter time to range of motion and weight bearing compared with open treatment. Historically, arthrotomy has been recommended for hips and shoulders, with a South African series reporting uncomplicated recovery when antibiotics plus arthrotomy occurred within 5 days of symptom onset, but significant and permanent hip damage when arthrotomy was delayed.

Sexually transmitted disease evaluation in proctitis or colitis presentations — maintain vigilance and consider targeted diagnostics.

### Typhoid fever [^117AtLJJ]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Control of typhoid fever relies on clinical information, diagnosis, and an understanding for the epidemiology of the disease. Despite the breadth of work done so far, much is not known about the biology of this human-adapted bacterial pathogen and the complexity of the disease in endemic areas, especially those in Africa. The main barriers to control are vaccines that are not immunogenic in very young children and the development of multidrug resistance, which threatens efficacy of antimicrobial chemotherapy. Clinicians, microbiologists, and epidemiologists worldwide need to be familiar with shifting trends in enteric fever. This knowledge is crucial, both to control the disease and to manage cases. Additionally, salmonella serovars that cause human infection can change over time and location. In areas of Asia, multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S Typhi) has been the main cause of enteric fever, but now S Typhi is being displaced by infections with drug-resistant S enterica serovar Paratyphi A. New conjugate vaccines are imminent and new treatments have been promised, but the engagement of local medical and public health institutions in endemic areas is needed to allow surveillance and to implement control measures.

### Occurrence of typhoid fever complications and their relation to duration of illness preceding hospitalization: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^113RoD7v]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Data Analysis

The main objective of this meta-analysis was to estimate a pooled prevalence of typhoid fever complications and, secondarily, to evaluate the effect of delaying appropriate antimicrobial therapy and age on the prevalence and risk of complications. The number of typhoid fever cases reported with complications and all culture-confirmed (blood, bone marrow, and/or stool culture) typhoid fever cases reported by each author were used in the meta-analysis. Any unfavorable evolution of the disease reported as a complication in a patient with typhoid fever in the publications included for analysis was considered a complication; as a consequence, the list of complications generated for this review is entirely driven by what each author reported. The different types of complications listed by each article are included in the Supplementary Material. Prevalence for each type of complication reported was estimated using as a numerator the sum of the frequencies for the specific complication and as the denominator the sum of all typhoid fever cases reported by the studies that measure the specific complication.

Description of individual-level data on antimicrobial susceptibility of the Salmonella Typhi isolates and timing from disease onset to initiation of therapy needed to evaluate whether a patient received appropriate antimicrobial therapy was not available in the literature reviewed. The average days from disease onset to hospitalization (DDA) reported by the studies included in the meta-analysis was used as a surrogate to assess the effect of delaying appropriate antimicrobial therapy on the prevalence and risk of complications.

The literature describes that complications usually develop by the second to fourth week of illness among typhoid fever patients not receiving appropriate diagnosis and/or treatment. However, a specific cutoff point to assess the effect of DDA on complications was not identified in the literature review. With the objective to identify a specific cutoff point, a preliminary analysis with the available information from six relevant (low or medium RoB studies reporting illness duration at hospitalization) articles was performed, focusing on the period from 2–4 weeks of illness duration. The results displayed differences in the prevalence of complications between studies with patients reporting an average of ≥ 10 days of disease onset at hospitalization and studies with patients reporting < 10 days. The same result was observed after adding other articles with high RoB to the preliminary analysis. As a consequence, the 10-day cutoff point was applied to the subgroup analysis (Figure 2). The application of meta-regression to assess the effect of DDA on complications was not possible due to the few number of articles identified for this secondary analysis.

HIV-related nontyphoidal Salmonella — antimicrobial selection and resistance: The treatment of choice for susceptible nontyphoidal Salmonella spp. infection is a fluoroquinolone (AIII), with ciprofloxacin the preferred agent (AIII); other fluoroquinolones — such as levofloxacin and moxifloxacin — are recommended as alternatives to ciprofloxacin (BIII). Depending on susceptibility, alternatives include TMP-SMX or expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone (BIII). Fluoroquinolone resistance appears to be increasing, with CDC data showing genetic markers among 19% of 20,831 isolates in 2023, and the Panel recommends ceftriaxone over ciprofloxacin if invasive disease is suspected or confirmed, at least until susceptibilities return (BIII).

### A systematised review and evidence synthesis on the broader societal impact of vaccines against Salmonella [^112ru5aS]. NPJ Vaccines (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The bacteria species Salmonella is classified into two groups: typhoidal (consisting of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A, B and C) and non-typhoidal. Typhoidal Salmonella and some non-typhoidal Salmonella serotypes can cause invasive disease. In high-income settings, non-typhoidal Salmonella usually causes a self-limiting diarrhoeal disease in healthy individuals. By contrast, in sub-Saharan Africa, due to a high prevalence of comorbidities within the population such as malnutrition, HIV, sickle cell disease and malaria, invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) with a high case-fatality risk is common. Often, iNTS presents as fever alone making it difficult to diagnose without blood culture, which is a limited resource in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The 2017 Global Burden of Disease study estimated 535,000 iNTS cases and 77,500 deaths, with the majority of cases believed to occur in sub-Saharan Africa, followed by south Asia. Antibiotic resistance in iNTS is a growing problem, with multidrug resistance common in sub-Saharan Africa and sometimes accounting for the majority of detected cases.

Bacterial enteric infections — epidemiology in HIV-infected adults — feature rates at least 10-fold higher than in the general population that decline with antiretroviral therapy, with risk varying by CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count and being greatest in individuals with clinical AIDS or < 200 CD4 cells/mm^3; the bacteria most frequently isolated by culture in the United States are Salmonella (particularly Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhimurium and Enteritidis), Shigella, and Campylobacter; diarrheagenic Escherichia coli may contribute but their role is poorly understood because diagnosis remains a research-only test; Clostridium difficile-associated infection (CDI) is common and low CD4 count (< 50 cells/mm^3) is an independent disease risk factor, and because incidence of community-onset CDI is increasing health care providers should also consider CDI in the evaluation of outpatient diarrheal illnesses in HIV-infected individuals; data on Helicobacter pylori do not suggest excess risk; probable sources include ingestion of contaminated food or water, with increased risk from sexual activity with potential for direct or indirect fecal-oral exposure and from HIV-associated alterations in mucosal immunity or intestinal integrity and treatment with acid-suppressive agents.

### Treatment response in enteric fever in an era of increasing antimicrobial resistance: an individual patient data analysis of 2092 participants enrolled into 4 randomized, controlled trials in Nepal [^115pYKdV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Enteric (typhoid) fever is a systemic infection caused by the Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A, B, and C. Enteric fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in low-income regions and was responsible for an estimated 12.2 million disability-adjusted life-years and > 190 000 deaths globally in 2010. The fatality rate of enteric fever is low (< 1%) but is higher when antimicrobial therapy is delayed or unavailable. Therefore, antimicrobials are essential for the clinical management of enteric fever. Chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and cotrimoxazole were first-line treatments for enteric fever until the early 1990s when the increasing incidence of multidrug-resistant (MDR; defined as resistance to these 3 antimicrobial drugs) S. Typhi organisms led to the use of fluoroquinolones. Yet, organisms with reduced susceptibility against fluoroquinolones became a problem in Asia soon after their introduction. Recent phylogeographic analyses that document an ongoing epidemic of a global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) S. Typhi lineage suggest that the potential for regional or global dispersal of a lineage exhibits resistance to fluoroquinolones is now a real threat. In the absence of effective and accessible vaccines and lack of sanitation improvements, development of tailored antimicrobial therapy recommendations is critical to reduce morbidity and prevent disease transmission.

In Kathmandu, Nepal, S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A are the most commonly isolated organisms from the blood of febrile adults and children. Over the last decade we conducted 4 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate enteric fever treatment in this endemic region. Our aim in this study was to use the largest collection of individual patient data assembled to date from enteric fever treatment trials to evaluate the effect of treatment drug on differences in clinical outcome between S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A infections and those with blood culture-negative enteric fever. We further sought to compare the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles over time between S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A isolates and to investigate their impact on outcome. An in-depth understanding of trends and clinical implications of AMR enteric fever should guide policymakers and clinicians in decisions regarding treatment in an era of rapidly diminishing therapeutic options.

Recommended antimicrobial agents by pathogen — bacterial enteric infections: Campylobacter — first choice azithromycin; alternative ciprofloxacin. Clostridium difficile — first choice oral vancomycin; alternative fidaxomicin, with the comment that "Fidaxomicin not currently recommended for people < 18 years of age" and that metronidazole remains acceptable for nonsevere Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in children and as a second-line agent for adults with nonsevere CDI. Nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica — antimicrobial therapy is usually not indicated for uncomplicated infection; therapy should be considered for groups at increased risk for invasive infection (neonates up to 3 months old; persons > 50 years old with suspected atherosclerosis; persons with immunosuppression, cardiac disease, or significant joint disease). Salmonella enterica Typhi or Paratyphi — first choice ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin; alternatives include ampicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) or azithromycin. Shigella — first choice azithromycin or ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone; alternatives include TMP-SMX or ampicillin if susceptible, and clinicians should avoid prescribing fluoroquinolones if the ciprofloxacin MIC is 0.12 µg/ml or higher even if the laboratory report identifies the isolate as susceptible. Most clinical laboratories do not test for azithromycin susceptibility.

### Rapid diagnostic tests for typhoid and paratyphoid (enteric) fever [^111NRyKo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

RDTs have the potential to be useful to clinicians working in resource‐limited settings in LMICs. Differentiating the common causes of the febrile patient by clinical criteria is challenging without the laboratory support for blood films, serology, or blood cultures (Bhutta 2006). A diagnostic test in such a setting must be cheap, simple to perform, and able to quickly deliver a result. Such a test should correctly identify true enteric fever cases among febrile patients, ensuring prompt and specific treatment, allowing the avoidance of broad‐spectrum medication that cover all common causes of fever. In many endemic areas, treatment for enteric fever may be given to all patients with fever (Larsson 2008). The diagnosis of enteric fever by an RDT could reduce unnecessary prescription of antimicrobials, reduce drug expenditure, and limit the development of antimicrobial resistance (Andrews 2015). The role of an enteric fever RDT in practice is to identify those febrile patients who warrant anti‐ Salmonella antibiotic treatment as opposed to conservative management, antimalarial treatment, or treatment for other bacterial infections (Parry 2011).

The reference standard for diagnosing enteric fever has been culture of S. Typhi or Paratyphi A from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or other sterile sites. The mainstay of diagnosis in clinical practice is a positive blood culture, although the test is only positive in 40% to 80% of cases, usually in the first two weeks of the disease (Parry 2002; WHO 2003). This lack of sensitivity is due to the low number of bacteria circulating in the blood, and may also be affected by: prior antimicrobial therapy (Wain 1998); the type of culture medium used; the ratio of blood to broth; stage of illness at the time of presentation; and the duration of incubation (Mogasale 2016). Bone marrow culture gives a higher culture‐positive rate, probably because the concentration of organisms is higher than in the blood, and may remain positive even after antibiotic therapy has been started (Wain 2001). Bone marrow culture is positive in 80% to 95% of patients with enteric fever, including in patients who have been taking antibiotics for several days regardless of the duration of the illness (Parry 2002). Although bone marrow culture is more sensitive, it is difficult to obtain, relatively invasive, and is of little use in public health settings (Wain 2001). Even with sophisticated laboratories, confirming the diagnosis of enteric fever can be difficult with negative blood or bone marrow cultures despite a patient actually having enteric fever (Baker 2010).

### Complications and mortality of non-typhoidal Salmonella invasive disease: a global systematic review and meta-analysis [^116uSnvr]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Implications of all the available evidence

Although the predominance of hospital-based studies is likely to have biased our results towards severe non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease, we identify frequent serious complications and high case fatality ratios that could be averted with prevention measures. Clinicians, especially in African countries, should be aware of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease as a cause of severe febrile illness, and consider non-typhoidal salmonella in empiric antimicrobial therapy choices. Investments in clinical microbiology facilities to identify non-typhoidal salmonella and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles would aid in diagnosis and management decisions, with the potential to improve outcomes. Additionally, the development and deployment of an effective and safe bivalent or multivalent non-typhoidal salmonella vaccine has the potential to avert substantial illness and death.

There are more than 2500 recognised serovars of Salmonella enterica. However, two serovars, Typhimurium and Enteritidis, have been identified as the most common causes of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease in humans. To confirm the diagnosis of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease, and to obtain isolates for serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the culture of blood, cerebrospinal fluid, bone marrow, or another normally sterile site is required. Unfortunately, microbiology services are often not available in low-resource areas. Additionally, antimicrobial resistance among non-typhoidal salmonella is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. Multidrug resistance and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone, has emerged among non-typhoidal salmonella that will exacerbate already poor outcomes for patients. The development and deployment of an efficacious and safe vaccine, which is a major aim of the, would be valuable to prevent non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease, which is becoming increasingly difficult to treat.

Previous systematic reviews of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease have been limited by geographical locationor restricted to describing antimicrobial resistance among isolates. Contemporary, global estimates of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease morbidity and mortality are needed to inform decisions on future vaccine development and non-vaccine intervention efforts. We therefore aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of complications and the CFR in patients with non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease.

The pathogenesis of this disease depends on the ingested inoculum size of S typhi, the virulence of the strain, the host's immune response and previous exposure, and local protective factors. Numerous extra-intestinal complications can occur with S typhi infection, including the involvement of the central nervous system (3–35%), cardiovascular system (1–5%), pulmonary system (1–86%), bone and joints (≤ 1%), hepatobiliary system (1–26%), genitourinary system (< 1%), and others. Due to an increase in multidrug-resistant S typhi, fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins have been increasingly used for typhoid fever and its complications. We describe the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and treatment of extra-intestinal S typhi infections.

### Management and outcomes of Salmonella gastroenteritis in the era of rapid molecular testing [^111bY12L]. Hospital Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Molecular diagnostics provide a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of gastroenteritis compared with a stool culture. In this study, we seek to describe the changes in medical management and outcomes of children with Salmonella gastroenteritis as our hospital system adopted molecular diagnostics.

Methods

This study is a retrospective chart review of children < 18 years of age diagnosed with nontyphoidal Salmonella gastroenteritis between 2008 and 2018 at a large pediatric health care system in the southeastern United States. Those with immunocompromising conditions and hemoglobinopathies were excluded. Patients diagnosed via molecular testing were compared with those diagnosed solely by stool culture for aspects of management including admission rates, blood culture obtainment, and antibiotic administration.

Results

Of 965 eligible patients with Salmonella gastroenteritis, 264 (27%) had a stool molecular test and 701 (73%) only had a stool culture performed. Groups were similar in age and presentation. Those diagnosed by molecular methods had higher hospitalization rates (69% vs 50%, P < .001), more blood cultures obtained (54% vs 44%, P < .01), and received more antibiotics (49% vs 34%, P < .001) despite statistically similar rates of bacteremia (11% vs 19%, P = .05).

Conclusions

The rapid diagnosis of Salmonella gastroenteritis by molecular methods was associated with increased hospital admission rates, blood culture obtainment, and antibiotic use. This suggests possible overmedicalization of uncomplicated Salmonella gastroenteritis, and clinicians should remain cognizant of the possibility of providing low-value care for uncomplicated disease.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Salmonella typhi is the etiological agent of typhoid fever, an acute, febrile enteric disease. Typhoid fever continues to be an important disease in many parts of the world. Travelers entering infected areas are at risk of contracting typhoid fever following the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Typhoid fever is considered to be endemic in most areas of Central and South America, the African continent, the Near East and the Middle East, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent (3). There are approximately 500 cases of typhoid fever per year diagnosed

in the United States (4). In 62% of these patients (data from 1975–1984) the disease was acquired outside of the United States while in 38% of the patients the disease was acquired within the United States (5). Of 340 cases acquired in the United States between 1977 and 1979, 23% of the cases were associated with typhoid carriers, 24% were due to food outbreaks, 23% were associated with the ingestion of contaminated food or water, 6% due to household contact with an infected person and 4% following exposure to S. typhi in a laboratory setting (6).

The majority of typhoid cases respond favorably to antibiotic therapy. However, the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains has greatly complicated therapy and cases of typhoid fever that are treated with ineffective drugs can be fatal (7). Approximately 2–4% of acute typhoid cases result in the development of a chronic carrier state (8). These non-symptomatic carriers are the natural reservoir for S. typhi and can serve to maintain the disease in its endemic state or to directly infect individuals (3).

Antibiotic self-treatment risks in traveler's diarrhea — Antibacterial drugs appear to complicate enteric disease caused by Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli, although in adults with E. coli O157:H7 a meta-analysis did not show an association with hemolytic uremic syndrome. For non-typhoidal Salmonella, antibiotic therapy does not appear to reduce the length of illness and increases the period of stool detection. Self-treatment increased colonization by resistant Enterobacteriaceae: travel alone carried a 21% rate of colonization, whereas fluoroquinolone treatment increased extended spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonization to 80% of those who self-medicated with a fluoroquinolone. C. difficile colitis has been reported after ciprofloxacin, but this does not appear to be a common adverse outcome associated with treated TD.

We report the first pediatric case of enteric fever caused by Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A. Mixed infections are infrequently reported, potentially because detection of two different Salmonella serotypes in blood cultures is technically challenging. We suggest laboratory strategies to aid in the recognition of mixed infections.

### Refractoryinfection resulting in nephrectomy [^116SydtG]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infections, though commonly associated with gastroenteritis, can demonstrate focal non-gastrointestinal organ involvement. We present the case of a mid-30s woman who presented with long-standing left flank pain and was subsequently diagnosed with refractory Salmonella pyelonephritis in the setting of nephrolithiasis, severe hydronephrosis and parenchymal thinning suggestive of renal atrophy despite normal serum creatinine and a normal appearing contralateral kidney. Despite several guideline-based antibiotic courses, we failed to clear her multidrug-resistant Salmonella species bacteriuria. We then established percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) drainage but still were unable to clear her infection, and it was noted PCN output dropped below 30cc per day suggesting a non-functional renal unit. This patient was successfully managed with minimally invasive laparoscopic robotic-assisted left nephrectomy which finally cleared her bacteriuria. This case illustrates challenges in the management of refractory atypical Salmonella infections and highlights the rare indication of nephrectomy in such cases.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's specialised register (November 2007), Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL, issue 4, 2007), Medline (1966 to November 2007), Embase (1974 to November 2007), and LILACS (1982 to November 2007) using text words and medical subject headings (MeSH) "typhoid fever", "enteric fever", "paratyphoid fever", " Salmonella Typhi", " Salmonella Paratyphi" combined with the Cochrane Collaboration's search strategy. A complete list of search terms used is available. We identified relevant trials in all languages, searched selected conference proceedings, authors' files, reference lists, and the meta-Register of Controlled Trials (mRCT), and contacted experts for relevant ongoing or unpublished trials.

One reviewer screened titles and abstracts, and potentially relevant trials were further evaluated independently by two reviewers using pre-designed eligibility forms. Trials were included if they were randomised and compared fluoroquinolone with another antibiotic in enteric fever confirmed with blood or bone marrow culture.

Data abstraction and methodological assessment

Two reviewers independently extracted data using piloted data extraction forms, compared data, and resolved disagreements. Primary outcomes (measured at time points described by investigators) were clinical failure (presence of symptoms or development of complications necessitating change in or prolongation of antibiotic therapy), microbiological failure (positive culture from blood, bone marrow, or any sterile anatomical site), and relapse (recurrence of symptoms with a positive culture from blood, bone marrow, or any sterile anatomical site). Secondary outcomes included fever clearance time (time taken in hours from the start of therapy to defervescence, as defined by authors), convalescent faecal carriage (positive faecal culture detected at any time after end of treatment up to one year of follow-up), cost of therapy, length of hospitalisation, complications, and adverse events. We contacted study authors for additional data or to clarify data.

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies published between 2000 and 2011 about risk factors for, and epidemiology, pathogenesis, and treatment of, invasive salmonellae. Our search terms were "salmonella" in combination with "typhi", "nontyphoidal", or "Africa". We did not limit our search by language. We mainly selected articles published in the past 10 years, but did not exclude important older reports. We also searched the reference lists of articles identified by this search strategy. Selection criteria included a judgment about importance of studies and their relevance for the well informed general clinician. We cite review articles where they provided comprehensive overviews beyond the scope of our Review.

### One species, different diseases: the unique molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of typhoidal Salmonella infections [^116g7VN7]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Salmonella enterica is one of the most widespread bacterial pathogens found worldwide, resulting in approximately 100 million infections and over 200 000 deaths per year. Salmonella isolates, termed 'serovars', can largely be classified as either nontyphoidal or typhoidal Salmonella, which differ in regard to disease manifestation and host tropism. Nontyphoidal Salmonella causes gastroenteritis in many hosts, while typhoidal Salmonella is human-restricted and causes typhoid fever, a systemic disease with a mortality rate of up to 30% without treatment. There has been considerable interest in understanding how different Salmonella serovars cause different diseases, but the molecular details that underlie these infections have not yet been fully characterized, especially in the case of typhoidal Salmonella. In this review, we highlight the current state of research into understanding the pathogenesis of both nontyphoidal and typhoidal Salmonella, with a specific interest in serovar-specific traits that allow human-adapted strains of Salmonella to cause enteric fever. Overall, a more detailed molecular understanding of how different Salmonella isolates infect humans will provide critical insights into how we can eradicate these dangerous enteric pathogens.

In the last decade there has been increasing awareness of the virulence and changing epidemiology of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile). While the vast majority of clinical cases of C. difficile are associated with antimicrobial or nosocomial exposure, this syndrome has been well described in the absence of antibiotic use. We present an unusual case of fatal, non-antibiotic associated C. difficile colitis following Salmonella serotype Saintpaul gastroenteritis in a previously healthy young person. We review the typical risk factors for C. difficile colitis and fulminant disease. We also review the epidemiology of community-acquired C. difficile-associated disease (CA-CDAD) and highlight Salmonella infection as a potential risk factor for development of CA-CDAD.

### Clinical review of nontyphoid Salmonella infections from 1991 to 1999 in a Danish county [^113iF1gd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

To determine outcomes of nontyphoid Salmonella infections, we reviewed all 3328 cases of infection registered in a large Danish county from 1991 to 1999. The hospitalization rate was 27% among patients < 5 years old, 22% among patients 5–59 years old, and 54% among patients ≥ 60 years old; complications were present in 7% and extraintestinal disease in 4% of patients. We conclude that nontyphoid Salmonella infections may frequently cause severe disease even among patients without predisposing conditions.

### ▾ rifaximin for the treatment of travellers' diarrhoea? [^114gLMGh]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Travellers' diarrhoea (TD) is one of the most common illnesses to occur in people who travel overseas, and usually results from consumption of food or water contaminated with bacteria.(1–4) Between 2004 and 2008 just over 24,000 laboratory confirmed gastrointestinal infections were reported in those who had recently travelled abroad from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Over half the infections were caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella species (spp). As most infections are never formally diagnosed, this is believed to be a huge underestimate of the burden of TD.(4) ▾Rifaximin is a rifamycin antibacterial agent that has recently been licensed in the UK for the treatment of TD in adults. The summary of product characteristics (SPC) notes that rifaximin "may shorten the duration of diarrhoea when this is associated with non-invasive strains of E.coli".(5) Here we discuss the evidence for rifaximin and how it fits in with current management strategies.

### Excess mortality associated with antimicrobial drug-resistant Salmonella typhimurium [^113Tqet7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Discussion

Since the 1990s, the frequency of antimicrobial drug resistance in zoonotic Salmonella and the number of drugs to which the strains are resistant has increased, primarily as a consequence of antimicrobial use in food production (,–). The recent development of fluoroquinolone resistance is of particular concern. At present, a fluoroquinolone is the drug of first choice for extraintestinal and serious intestinal Salmonella infections in adults, and resistance to this drug may potentially reduce the efficacy of early empirical treatment. The health impact of antimicrobial drug resistance in zoonotic Salmonella needs to be determined. We used data from registries created for other purposes to avoid bias and were able to explore long-term death rates and adjust the data for comorbidity.

The comorbidity index was based on discharge diagnoses from patients admitted to hospitals in Denmark and to a lesser degree on data from outpatient clinics but did not include data from general practitioners. Any patient with a coexisting disease severe enough to alter the outcome of a Salmonella infection is likely to have had contact with a hospital or an outpatient clinic within the 10-year period before infection. The backbone for the construction of the comorbidity index was the National Discharge Registry. A validation of this registry showed that there was agreement between the registry and hospital records of 75% to 90%, using 3-digit level International Classification of Diseases diagnoses.

### Determinants of persistent Salmonella infections [^116KZRtX]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Persistent bacterial infections constitute an enormous challenge for public health. Amongst infections with other bacteria, infections with typhoidal and nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica serovars can result in long-term infections of the human and animal host. Persistent infections that are asymptomatic are difficult to identify and thus can serve as a silent reservoir for transmission. Symptomatic persistent infections are often difficult to treat as they harbor a combination of antibiotic-tolerant and antibiotic-resistant bacteria and boost the spread of genetic antibiotic resistance. In the last couple of years, the field has made some major progress in understanding the role of persisters, their reservoirs as well as their interplay with host factors in persistent Salmonella infections.

### Evaluation of the clinical and microbiological response to Salmonella paratyphi A infection in the first paratyphoid human challenge model [^114dxpkZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Forty healthy adult participants were enrolled into the study between 20 May and 20 November 2014 (Table 1; Supplementary Figure 2). Twenty participants were challenged with S. Paratyphi A at a target dose of 1–5 × 10 3 CFU (group 1). A second group of 20 participants was challenged at a target dose of 0.5–1.0 × 10 3 CFU (group 2).

Table 1.
Participant Demographic Characteristics

Paratyphoid infection was diagnosed in 50% (20/40) of all participants challenged. The primary study objective was achieved in challenge group 1, where 12 of 20 participants met the prespecified diagnostic criteria for paratyphoid fever (attack rate, 60%; 95% confidence interval, 36%–81%) (Figure 1). Eleven participants (11/12 [92%]) in this group were diagnosed following a positive blood culture for S. Paratyphi A and 1 participant was diagnosed based on temperature criteria with subsequent blood culture confirmation. Median time from challenge to initiation of treatment was 6.4 days (range, 5.9–8.3 days) (Table 2).

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^116RBnVD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Enteric fever and bacteremia diagnostic testing — routine aerobic blood culture is recommended as the routine practical conventional diagnostic and for the initial diagnostic assessment in people with suspected enteric fever or invasive salmonellosis, and blood culture should be performed in all people with signs of septicemia and when enteric fever is suspected. For the diagnosis of enteric fever, aerobic blood culture has a sensitivity of approximately 50% compared with the more invasive bone marrow culture. As the median magnitude of bacteremia in enteric fever and invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica disease are low at 0.3 and 1.0 colony-forming units/mL of blood, respectively, larger volumes of blood need to be obtained to maximize detection. Two to three 20-mL blood cultures are adequate for detection of bacteremia in adults, and lower volumes may be sufficient for detection in infants and children who have higher magnitudes of bacteremia than adults. Blood cultures may be drawn simultaneously and should be collected prior to administration of antimicrobial agents to maximize sensitivity, and continuously monitored blood culture systems may shorten the time to detection and improve sensitivity compared with manual blood culture methods. Due to poor performance characteristics, serologic tests should not be used for diagnosis of enteric fever.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We systematically searched Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and PubMed with no restrictions on language, study location, date, or participant demographics using the search terms non-typhoidal salmonella, mortality, morbidity, died, fatal, and complications. We included peer-reviewed, research articles published from database inception up to May 21, 2020, reporting the complications and mortality of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease. Case reports, case-series, policy reports, commentaries, editorials, and conference abstracts were excluded. Available reviews on non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease-related complications and mortality were scarce. Those identified used geographically restricted search strategies, or focused on specific domains, such as antimicrobial resistance. It was estimated that non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease caused approximately 535 000 illnesses and 775 00 deaths in 2017. Complications of non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease, such as focal abscesses, meningitis, osteomyelitis, lung infections, and septic arthritis, can be severe, debilitating, and life-threatening.

Added value of this study

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we update and expand on previous work to present contemporary global estimates of the proportion of patients with non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease who develop complications, and pooled estimates of case-fatality ratios for culture-confirmed, non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease globally, by UN region, UN subregion, and stratified by age, when possible. Since January, 2015, an additional 22 eligible studies were published on non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease mortality, adding substantial new data on this disease that had not been collated previously. Our comprehensive review and analysis is the first to provide contemporary information on the complications and mortality associated with non-typhoidal salmonella invasive disease globally, including in regions without up-to-date, robust national surveillance data.

### Preventing foodborne illness… [^114boWeq]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Salmonella are a group of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal illness and fever called salmonellosis. Salmonella can be spread by food handlers who do not wash their hands and/or the surfaces and tools they use between food preparation steps, and when people eat raw or undercooked foods. Salmonella can also spread from animals to people. People who have direct contact with certain animals, including poultry and reptiles, can spread the bacteria from the animals to food if they do not practice proper hand washing hygiene before handling food. Pets can also spread the bacteria within the home environment if they eat food contaminated with Salmonella. Symptoms Most people infected with Salmonella will begin to develop symptoms 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness, salmonellosis, usually lasts four to seven days and most people recover without treatment. Most people with salmonellosis develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps.

More severe cases of salmonellosis may include a high fever, aches, headaches, lethargy, a rash, blood in the urine or stool, and in some cases may become fatal. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that approximately 450 persons in the United States die each year from acute salmonellosis. Due to the range in severity of illness, people should consult their healthcare provider if they suspect that they have developed symptoms that resemble a Salmonella infection. At-Risk Groups Children younger than five, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to have severe salmonellosis infections.

### About Salmonella infection… [^111GsuTZ]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points Salmonellaare bacteria that can make people sick
- People can get infected with Salmonellaafter swallowing the bacteria.
- CDC estimates Salmonellacause about 1. 35 million infections in the United States every year.
- Contaminated food is the source for most of these illnesses. Overview Salmonella are bacteria that can make people sick with an illness called salmonellosis. People can get infected after swallowing Salmonella. Salmonella live in the intestines of people and animals. People can get infected with Salmonella in many ways, including
- Eating contaminated food
- Drinking or having contact with contaminated water
- Touching animals, animal poop, and the places animals live and roam. People at risk Anyone can get a Salmonella infection. But some groups of people have an increased chance of infection, and some people may become seriously ill.

These groups include:

- Children who are younger than 5 years
- Adults who are 50 years and older with underlying medical problems, such as heart disease
- Adults who are 65 and older
- People who have a weakened immune system
- International travelers. Spotlight on chicken Salmonellainfection. In fact, more than 1 in every 25 packages of chicken at the grocery store is contaminated with Salmonella. Salmonella cause more infections than you might suspect. CDC estimates that only 1 in every 30 Salmonella infections is diagnosed. Why. Most people with food poisoning do not go to a doctor or have a patient sample submitted for laboratory testing. So, we never learn which germ made them sick. Antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella infections are becoming more common. Antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella happens when the bacteria develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them.

That means the bacteria are not killed and continue to grow. Resistance to antibiotics is increasing in Salmonella, which can limit treatment options for people with severe infections. One way to slow down the development of antimicrobial resistance is by appropriate use of antibiotics in people and animals.

### How people get infected… [^112gm5d7]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Salmonella infection. If people handle contaminated pet food or a contaminated utensil and then touch their mouth, they can accidentally ingest the bacteria. Pet food that contains raw or uncooked meat is more likely than processed pet food to test positive for Salmonella. Many animals, especially cattle, chickens, rodents, reptiles, and amphibians, can naturally carry. Salmonellosis in People Salmonella infection most often causes gastroenteritis, which can range from mild to severe. Symptoms in people start within 6 hours to 6 days after ingesting the bacteria and include:

- Fever;
- Diarrhea;
- Nausea;
- Vomiting; and
- Stomach pain. Most people recover from salmonellosis in 4 to 7 days without treatment. In some cases, the diarrhea may be so severe that the person needs to be hospitalized. In a person with severe diarrhea, the bacteria may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other places in the body.

If this happens, the disease can be fatal unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics. Children under 5, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems have a higher risk of getting salmonellosis and are more likely to have severe symptoms. Salmonella in their stool and saliva and then spread the bacteria to the home environment and to people and other pets in the household. For example, cats can spread Salmonella through shared litter boxes or when roaming throughout the house, such as on kitchen countertops. Some ways dogs can spread the bacteria is when they give people kisses or have stool accidents inside the home. Pet waste from both sick and healthy pets can be a source of infection for people. Salmonellain their stool for days to months.
- Sudden and severe — horses have a severely decreased activity level, fever, and loss of appetite. These signs come on suddenly.

Diarrhea develops 6 to 24 hours after the fever. The diarrhea is fluid and foul smelling, and horses can become dehydrated quickly. There may be signs of stomach pain, straining, or severe colic. Horses may develop a blood infection and clotting problems. The disease progresses quickly, and if untreated, this form of salmonellosis is often fatal.
