## Question

How is hypermagnesemia diagnosed and treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how hypermagnesemia is diagnosed and treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining hypermagnesemia and its normal reference range. Then, I should verify the key etiologies and risk factors. Next, I will review the clinical presentation and severity thresholds. After that, I need to outline the diagnostic approach, including labs, ECG, and when to consider ionized magnesium. Then, I will detail immediate stabilization, source control, and definitive therapies, including calcium antagonism, diuresis, and dialysis. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring, and prevention, and close with a concise decision algorithm and key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the definition and normal range so I don't anchor on an incorrect threshold. Hypermagnesemia is generally defined as a serum magnesium concentration above 1.1 mmol/L, with the typical reference interval approximately 0.7–1.05 mmol/L, though some sources cite 0.7–0.95 mmol/L, so I should double-check the lab's reference range before concluding severity [^112ME9V3] [^114oXETc].

> I need to check the etiologies next, because identifying the cause guides both urgency and therapy. The most common cause is renal failure due to impaired excretion, but iatrogenic sources such as magnesium-containing antacids, laxatives like magnesium oxide, and parenteral magnesium sulfate are frequent contributors, and tumor lysis syndrome can acutely raise magnesium; critically ill patients may also show redistribution phenomena that complicate interpretation, so I should confirm exposure history carefully [^112ME9V3] [^1124WaaS] [^114rgJ9g] [^111BSWuX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about symptoms without correlating to levels. Mild elevations may be asymptomatic, but as magnesium rises, neuromuscular effects progress from weakness and drowsiness to flaccid paralysis and respiratory depression, while cardiovascular effects include hypotension, bradycardia, conduction delays, and potentially cardiopulmonary arrest. Severe hypermagnesemia has been reported with levels exceeding 3.9 mmol/L in case series, so I should correlate symptoms with the measured concentration and the ECG [^112ME9V3] [^1124WaaS] [^112tZQmt].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach. I will now examine the laboratory strategy: obtain a stat serum total magnesium, assess renal function with creatinine and eGFR, and check calcium, potassium, and phosphate because coexisting electrolyte disturbances are common. An ECG is essential to detect conduction abnormalities or life-threatening arrhythmias, and in complex cases, especially in critical illness or dialysis, ionized magnesium may better reflect the physiologically active fraction than total magnesium, so I should consider requesting iMg when available [^111BSWuX] [^112K8ztA].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate stabilization steps before discussing source control. For any symptomatic patient or those with ECG changes, intravenous calcium is first-line to antagonize magnesium at the cell membrane; typical dosing uses calcium gluconate 10% 10–20 mL IV over 10 minutes or calcium chloride 10% 5–10 mL IV over 5 minutes, and doses can be repeated as needed to stabilize cardiopulmonary function while preparing definitive therapy [^112ME9V3] [^115Gqbhv].

> I should confirm source control next, because ongoing absorption will perpetuate toxicity. Immediately stop all exogenous magnesium sources including antacids, supplements, and magnesium-containing enemas or laxatives; if there is suspected ongoing gastrointestinal absorption from retained tablets, consider gastrointestinal decontamination strategies such as whole-bowel irrigation to reduce continued release and absorption, as illustrated in case reports of retained magnesium oxide causing rebound hypermagnesemia despite dialysis [^114rgJ9g] [^1124WaaS].

> Let me consider enhancing renal elimination when kidney function permits. In patients with preserved renal function, aggressive isotonic saline with loop diuretics can increase magnesium excretion; however, I need to ensure close monitoring for volume status and electrolyte shifts, and I should remember that diuresis can worsen calcium losses, potentially aggravating neuromuscular effects, so calcium replacement may be needed if hypocalcemia emerges [^112ME9V3] [^112f6Hmn].

> For refractory cases or renal failure, I should double-check that dialysis is indicated. Hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy rapidly and effectively removes magnesium and is the definitive therapy for severe hypermagnesemia, particularly when levels exceed about 3.0 mmol/L, there is life-threatening arrhythmia or respiratory depression, or when diuresis is ineffective or contraindicated; case reports document rapid correction and neurologic recovery after dialysis initiation [^112ME9V3] [^1124WaaS] [^1115WP51].

> But wait, what if the patient is a neonate or has CKD not yet on dialysis? I need to ensure I tailor therapy. Neonates and infants have immature renal function and are at higher risk of hypermagnesemia from parenteral nutrition or maternal magnesium exposure, warranting close monitoring and conservative management with calcium and supportive care; in advanced CKD, hypermagnesemia is common due to impaired excretion, so prevention via dietary counseling and medication review is key, and dialysis prescription should account for magnesium balance [^114Dj2c2] [^1168eDC6] [^115uU22d].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and safety endpoints. During active treatment, reassess magnesium, calcium, potassium, and renal function every 2–4 hours initially, then space out as levels stabilize. Continuous cardiac and respiratory monitoring is prudent in severe cases, and I should document improvement in neuromuscular strength and hemodynamics as magnesium falls, recognizing that disappearance of deep tendon reflexes signals dangerous levels and mandates immediate intervention [^114YjNjQ].

> Hold on, I should verify prevention strategies to avoid recurrence. In patients at risk, such as those with CKD, older adults, or those receiving magnesium-containing medications, counsel on avoiding over-the-counter magnesium antacids and laxatives, review all prescriptions and supplements for hidden magnesium sources, and in dialysis patients, individualize dialysate magnesium to maintain serum magnesium within the physiologic range, balancing risks of hypo- versus hypermagnesemia [^112ME9V3] [^115uU22d] [^114bckNs].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision flow to ensure nothing is missing. Suspect hypermagnesemia in at-risk patients with weakness, hypotension, or bradycardia. Confirm with a serum magnesium and ECG. Stabilize with IV calcium if symptomatic. Stop magnesium sources and consider GI decontamination if relevant. Enhance elimination with saline and loop diuretics if kidneys allow. And proceed to urgent dialysis for severe toxicity or renal failure, reassessing frequently and preventing recurrence through education and medication reconciliation [^112ME9V3] [^1124WaaS] [^114rgJ9g].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key principles are explicit: hypermagnesemia is defined as serum magnesium above 1.1 mmol/L, most often from renal failure or iatrogenic exposure. Diagnosis hinges on timely labs, ECG, and selective use of ionized magnesium. Immediate IV calcium reverses cardiopulmonary toxicity. Source control and enhanced renal elimination are essential. And dialysis is the definitive therapy for severe or refractory cases, with prevention centered on medication review and patient education [^112ME9V3] [^112K8ztA] [^114YjNjQ] [^1124WaaS].

Hypermagnesemia is defined as a serum magnesium level > 1.1 mmol/L [^112ME9V3] and is most often due to renal impairment or excess magnesium intake [^112ME9V3]. Diagnosis relies on **serum magnesium testing** with renal function assessment and ECG to detect cardiotoxicity [^114oXETc]. Immediate management includes stopping magnesium sources, giving **IV calcium** for cardiotoxicity [^114YjNjQ], and using loop diuretics with IV fluids if renal function is preserved [^112ME9V3]. Hemodialysis is indicated for severe cases, especially with renal failure or life-threatening arrhythmias [^1124WaaS]. Monitor magnesium, calcium, renal function, and ECG closely, and prevent recurrence by avoiding magnesium-containing drugs in at-risk patients [^112ME9V3].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Clinical presentation

Clinical features correlate with severity: **mild hypermagnesemia (1.1–1.5 mmol/L)** may be asymptomatic or cause nausea, vomiting, and flushing, whereas **moderate hypermagnesemia (1.5–2.5 mmol/L)** presents with muscle weakness, drowsiness, and hypotension. Severe hypermagnesemia (> 2.5 mmol/L) causes **respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, and coma** [^112ME9V3].

---

### Laboratory diagnosis

- **Serum magnesium measurement**: Confirm hypermagnesemia; normal range is 0.7–1.1 mmol/L [^112ME9V3].

- **Renal function tests**: Assess eGFR/creatinine; renal impairment is the most common cause [^112ME9V3].

- **Electrolyte panel**: Evaluate calcium, potassium, and phosphate for coexisting disturbances [^notfound].

- **ECG**: Identify conduction delays, bradycardia, or arrhythmias [^111JYqZK].

---

### Differential diagnosis

The differential includes **iatrogenic causes** such as magnesium-containing antacids, laxatives, enemas, and parenteral magnesium [^1124WaaS]; **renal failure** from chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury [^112ME9V3]; and **endocrine disorders** such as adrenal insufficiency or hypothyroidism.

---

## Management strategies

### General principles

General principles include **immediate cessation** of all magnesium-containing medications and supplements, and **supportive care** with continuous cardiac monitoring, oxygen, and mechanical ventilation if needed [^112ME9V3].

---

### Specific treatments

| **Severity** | **Treatment** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild (1.1–1.5 mmol/L) | Stop magnesium sources and observe | Asymptomatic or mild symptoms |
| Moderate (1.5–2.5 mmol/L) | IV calcium gluconate (1–2 g) and loop diuretics with IV fluids | Symptomatic or ECG changes |
| Severe (> 2.5 mmol/L) | - Immediate hemodialysis <br/> - IV calcium gluconate <br/> - Mechanical ventilation if needed | - Life-threatening arrhythmias <br/> - Respiratory depression <br/> - Renal failure |

---

### Dialysis indications

Dialysis is indicated for **severe hypermagnesemia** with life-threatening arrhythmias, respiratory depression, or coma, and for **renal failure** when diuretics are ineffective or contraindicated [^112ME9V3].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring and follow-up should include **frequent serum magnesium and calcium checks** during acute management, continuous ECG monitoring for arrhythmias, and renal function assessment to guide ongoing therapy and dialysis decisions [^112ME9V3].

---

## Prevention

Prevention focuses on **patient education** to avoid over-the-counter magnesium-containing products in patients with renal impairment and on **regular monitoring** of magnesium levels in patients on magnesium therapy or with renal impairment [^11792QQw].

---

Hypermagnesemia is diagnosed by serum magnesium testing with renal function and ECG assessment, and managed by stopping magnesium sources, giving IV calcium for cardiotoxicity, using diuretics if renal function allows, and performing dialysis for severe cases. Close monitoring and prevention are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Hypomagnesemia

The overlooked hypomagnesemia

Mild magnesium deficiency is often overlooked, but when the condition intensifies, it can trigger neuromuscular, cardiac, and nervous system dysfunction. Because the symptoms of hypomagnesemia overlap with those of various other diseases, magnesium deficiency is frequently misidentified as a secondary consequence rather than a primary health issue. HTN and magnesium deficiency often coexist as comorbidities. Accurately assessing the prevalence of hypomagnesemia, designing and implementing potential interventions using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, and developing novel predictive analytics tools and laboratory medicine methods are crucial for improving the management of chronic diseases such as hypertension.

Magnesium intake is generally below the recommended health standards. Metabolic balance data suggest that the actual requirement for a 100 kg adult should reach 335 mg/day, yet 74% of overweight/obese patients and 45.2% of adults have insufficient intake. Coupled with dietary patterns that are difficult to meet these needs, magnesium deficiency has become a significant public health concern. It is estimated that approximately 10% to 30% of the population suffers from subclinical magnesium deficiency. Even individuals with seemingly normal serum magnesium concentrations may still be magnesium deficient, and this condition is more severe among those with hypertension. The traditional cutoff of 0.75 mmol/L may not adequately reflect true magnesium nutritional status. Studies have shown that when plasma magnesium concentrations are maintained at or above 0.85 mmol/L, the risk ratios for elevated metabolic syndrome and blood pressure (BP) indicators are significantly lower than 1, indicating a negative correlation between higher plasma magnesium concentrations and these metabolic abnormalities. Further research has found that for patients already diagnosed with metabolic syndrome but with normal blood magnesium levels, oral magnesium supplementation can also lead to a decrease in physiological indicators such as blood pressure, further confirming the important role of magnesium in regulating human metabolism and cardiovascular health.

Therefore, it has been suggested to raise the lower limit of the reference range for serum magnesium from 0.75 mmol/L to 0.85 mmol/L to more accurately reflect the body's magnesium requirements and potential magnesium deficiency states. This adjustment not only helps to increase clinicians' and the public's awareness of magnesium nutritional status but also provides a scientific basis for developing more effective magnesium supplementation strategies, thereby further reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease. However, the implementation of this recommendation requires more clinical research and data support to ensure its accuracy and feasibility.

Diabetes-induced hypomagnesemia

One of the most common causes of hypomagnesemia is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Countless observational cohort studies have established an inverse association between T2DM and serum Mg 2+ levels as well as Mg 2+ intake. The incidence rate of hypomagnesemia in diabetes patients ranges from 10% to 45%. T2DM patients often present with hypermagnesuria, indicating disturbed renal Mg 2+ handling as the underlying cause of hypomagnesemia. Clinical trials investigating the effect of Mg 2+ supplementation show conflicting results. Some studies show a minor improvements of fasting plasma glucose levels, HOMA-IR and triglyceride levels in the blood, while other did not observe a beneficial effect of Mg 2+ supplementation on these factors in T2DM patients. It has also been shown that Mg 2+ can be bound to free fatty acids (FFA), which makes Mg 2+ undetectable with tests used for normal magnesium assessment. This results in the question of whether Mg 2+ levels are decreased in T2DM patients or if the Mg 2+ present, is bound to FFA. Another potential parameter in the inconclusive results could be the difficulty to obtain a substantial increase in serum Mg 2+ levels via oral supplementation. If there is no substantial increase, then it is difficult to make conclusive statements about the effects of Mg 2+ on T2DM. However, the relationship between T2DM and Mg 2+ remains to be further investigated, and in particular aspects such as the influence of magnesium binding to FFA and increase in serum Mg 2+ levels are of interest.

### Diuretics in patients with chronic kidney disease [^111Wa9xM]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Diuretic drugs act on electrolyte transporters in the kidney to induce diuresis and are often used in chronic kidney disease (CKD), given that nephron loss creates a deficit in the ability to excrete dietary sodium, which promotes an increase in plasma volume. This rise in plasma volume is exacerbated by CKD-induced systemic and intra-renal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, which further limits urinary sodium excretion. In the absence of a compensatory decrease in systemic vascular resistance, increases in plasma volume induced by sodium retention can manifest as a rise in systemic arterial blood pressure. Management of sodium and volume overload in patients with CKD is therefore typically based on restriction of dietary sodium intake and the use of diuretic agents to enhance urinary sodium excretion. Thiazide and thiazide-type diuretics are foundational therapies for the management of hypertension, whereas loop diuretics are often needed for volume overload, which might also require combination therapies. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have an important role in the management of diuretic-resistant volume overload or treatment-resistant hypertension. Additionally, diuretics can be used for the diagnosis of kidney diseases and in the management of hyperkalaemia or hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia.

### Serum magnesium, mortality and disease progression in chronic kidney disease [^113ocM43]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conversely, the relationship between hypermagnesemia and mortality is not clearly established, whereas some studies suggest that hypermagnesemia confers a survival advantage in CKD patients, while others report an increase in mortality. An observational retrospective study of chronic hemodialysis patients suggested a survival advantage with slightly elevated serum magnesium levels, however, found that patients with significantly elevated magnesium levels ≥ 3.1 had higher mortality. It is hypothesized that this may be due to over suppression of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) with significant hypermagnesemia, and that iPTH < 50 pg/ml is associated with higher cardiovascular mortality. This study did not include non-dialysis CKD patients, however. Other observational studies found that ESRD patients with arterial calcification, mitral annular calcification, and carotid intima-media thickness had lower serum magnesium levels on average, and therefore suggest that hypermagnesemia may play a protective role in this setting, however these studies did not examine survival. However, other studies contradict those findings and show an association between hypermagnesemia and morbidity and mortality, notably in critically ill patients. Indeed, hypermagnesemia can lead to hypotension, cardiac conduction abnormalities, neuromuscular blockade and respiratory depression. Our findings are in line with the latter set of studies whereas hypermagnesemia was associated with a higher prevalence of all-cause mortality. But there were no statistically significant differences in specific causes of death for patients with hypermagnesemia.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^114CwAdv]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hypotonic hyponatraemia (serum sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L with low osmolality) is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalised adult patients. The diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia may be complex, costly, and controversial. Hyponatraemia has diverse aetiologies and is additionally defined clinically by its duration, "acute" (< 48 hours) versus "chronic" (> 48 hours), and by the presence or absence of symptoms. Management can be challenging particularly in the emergency setting where different treatment options may help or indeed harm individual patients. It is perhaps surprising that management of this electrolyte disorder has a limited evidence base in part due to the paucity of high quality randomised controlled trials. Multiple clinical practice and consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia have been published by local, national, and international organisations. These guidelines represent genuine efforts to address the diagnostic challenges and controversies in its management, particularly in relation to the rate of correction for the serum sodium concentration. The systematic review by Nagler et al. reviewing the quality of recent published guidelines and consensus statements for diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia, has highlighted important variations in both their development and recommendations.

### Hypermagnesemia in a constipated female [^114rgJ9g]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hypermagnesemia is a rare condition that is usually iatrogenic. Magnesium oxide (MgO) ingestion by constipated patients with prolonged colonic retention contributes to hypermagnesemia. Treatment of hypermagnesemia includes discontinuation of the magnesium use, gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination, and removal of magnesium from the serum by dialysis. Calcium acts as an antagonist in hypermagnesemia.

Case Report

A 72-year-old woman presented with constipation and MgO ingestion. The patient was brought to our department due to altered mental status and progressive general weakness. Laboratory tests showed a magnesium level of 6.2 mEq/L. Bradycardia and hypotension developed with rebound hypermagnesemia after incomplete dialysis. Abdomen computed tomography showed hyperdense MgO tablets retained in the colon. A magnesium-free laxative was used for GI decontamination. Despite the use of high-dose inotropics and an elevated trigger for transcutaneous pacing, the cardiac performance improved minimally. Although our patient responded to calcium administration with hemodynamic improvement, prolonged hypotension and decreased perfusion led to hypoxic encephalopathy.

Conclusion

This report demonstrates that MgO tablets retained in the GI tract without adequate decontamination result in continuous absorption and rebound of hypermagnesemia. This report also addresses the importance of GI decontamination in the treatment of hypermagnesemia.

### Dispelling myths and misconceptions about the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^111gKdBN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia represents a widespread and potentially lethal condition that affects millions of people across their lives. Despite the prevalence and severity of the condition, there are no consensus guidelines on the treatment of hyperkalemia or even a standard definition. Herein, we provide a succinct review of what we believe to be the most significant misconceptions encountered in the emergency care of hyperkalemia, examine current available literature, and discuss practical points on several modalities of hyperkalemia treatment. Additionally, we review the pathophysiology of the electrocardiographic effects of hyperkalemia and how intravenous calcium preparations can antagonize these effects. We conclude each section with recommendations to aid emergency physicians in making safe and efficacious choices for the treatment of acute hyperkalemia.

Strategies to avoid 'deprescribing' in hyperkalemia

RASi and MR antagonists might be legitimately withheld due to well-justified fears of hyperkalemia in patients with significant risk factors or in patients who prioritize avoidance of hyperkalemia (or other factors such as tablet burden) over any potential prognostic benefit. On the other hand, they may be withheld because of an exaggerated fear of hyperkalemia on the part of the physician or patient. To our knowledge, there have been no robust studies that have succeeded in exploring the underlying reasons for this gap in a large population.

Several potential strategies could be used to minimize 'deprescribing' and thus realize the potential benefit of RASis and MRAs in target patient groups. First, we could ensure that prescribing decisions are made in the context of accurate data regarding the presence — or risk — of hyperkalemia in any individual patient. Large datasets have been used to construct hyperkalemia 'risk scores'. Emerging technologies (such as wearable and needle-free potassium sensors) providing real-time [K +] e data could allow RASis/MRAs to be omitted only on hyperkalemic days rather than being permanently discontinued in high-risk patients.

Second, novel alternative drugs, such as non-steroidal MR antagonists, may confer less risk of hyperkalemia than conventional agents. These are being tested in clinical trials.

Third, one should not forget tried-and-trusted methods for lowering potassium levels. Effective dietary advice and dietetic input can play a vital role in limiting hyperkalemia. Administration of loop and thiazide diuretics can be a useful strategy in selected patients.

Finally, hyperkalemia could be avoided by the co-prescription of tolerable potassium binders (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate). This strategy was successful in preventing RASi deprescribing in a small RCT. So far, these novel agents appear to be a valuable addition to our therapeutic armoury. However, we should be relatively cautious about the introduction into widespread clinical practice and remain vigilant for side effects that may emerge during post-marketing surveillance. In clinical trials, patiromer was associated with adverse reactions including hypomagnesemia and gastrointestinal upset and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate was associated with hypokalemia and oedema.

### Gitelman syndrome: consensus and guidance from a kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) controversies conference [^113mScTR]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Gitelman syndrome (GS) is a rare, salt-losing tubulopathy characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. The disease is recessively inherited, caused by inactivating mutations in the SLC12A3 gene that encodes the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride cotransporter (NCC). GS is usually detected during adolescence or adulthood, either fortuitously or in association with mild or nonspecific symptoms or both. The disease is characterized by high phenotypic variability and a significant reduction in the quality of life, and it may be associated with severe manifestations. GS is usually managed by a liberal salt intake together with oral magnesium and potassium supplements. A general problem in rare diseases is the lack of high quality evidence to inform diagnosis, prognosis, and management. We report here on the current state of knowledge related to the diagnostic evaluation, follow-up, management, and treatment of GS; identify knowledge gaps; and propose a research agenda to substantiate a number of issues related to GS. This expert consensus statement aims to establish an initial framework to enable clinical auditing and thus improve quality control of care.

### The impact of low serum and dialysate magnesium levels on clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients: a literature review [^114bckNs]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Magnesium and its role in bone metabolism

Magnesium is also an active player in bone metabolism, as it can block the calcium-sensing receptor independently of ionized serum calcium; low sMg levels thus activate the calcium-sensing receptor and trigger parathyroid hormone (PTH) release. Concern has been raised that hypermagnesemia may contribute to adynamic bone disease and increase fracture risk, and therefore should be avoided. However, in a study by Sakaguchi et al. on HD patients using data from the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy-Renal Data Registry, mild hypermagnesemia was not associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. On the contrary, lower sMg levels were significantly associated with an increased risk of hip fracture.

Magnesium deficiency may also promote hypokalemia due to its role in potassium transport across cell membranes, making hypokalemia refractory to treatment if left uncorrected. Conversely, correction of hypomagnesemia may be sufficient to resolve hypokalemia in most patients affected by both.

The impact of dialysate magnesium concentration on magnesium balance

After the initiation of dialysis, the choice of dMg concentration becomes an important factor in determining sMg levels in PD patients. Depending on the gradient between sMg and dMg levels, magnesium may either be removed from the plasma (leading to hypomagnesemia), maintained at steady state, or absorbed. Lower dMg concentrations have also been associated with a higher incidence of hypomagnesemia in HD populations.

In a retrospective study of Li et al. with 115 PD patients, the mean 24-hour peritoneal magnesium clearance was approximately 40 mg when employing a dMg concentration of 0.25 mmol/L, and this clearance correlated with sMg concentration in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, peritoneal magnesium clearance was negatively associated with residual kidney function but positively correlated with nutritional status and daily peritoneal protein loss. Clearance was also higher in patients with high peritoneal transport characteristics and in those treated with continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) compared to automated PD (APD).

When prescribing PD fluids and regimens, the focus is often on glucose concentrations, the number of exchanges, dwell times, clearances, and dialysate calcium concentrations. Magnesium concentrations are rarely considered. However, magnesium levels are key to determining long-term sMg levels and their clinical consequences, as highlighted above. Currently, PD solutions with 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mmol/L magnesium concentrations are available in both European and US markets, with 0.25 mmol/L being the most commonly used.

### Subclinical magnesium deficiency: a principal driver of cardiovascular disease and a public health crisis [^111mwBNb]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

While a normal serum magnesium is considered to be 0.7–1 mmol/L, the optimal serum magnesium concentration has been proposed to be > 0.80 mmol/L. Chronic latent magnesium deficiency has been defined as '… a serum magnesium concentration of between 0.75 and 0.849 mmol/L (within the reference interval), with a positive magnesium load test indicating magnesium deficiency'.

In summary

'Abnormalities of serum Mg may be the most underdiagnosed serum electrolyte abnormality in clinical practice today. The incidence appears to range from 12.5% to 20% on routine determination'.

Table 8
Normal serum values of total calcium in children

A decrease in serum albumin results in a higher proportion of total calcium existing in the ionized form. In instances of low albumin levels, despite a potential decrease in total calcium levels, the ionized calcium level may remain within the normal range. Additionally, calcium counteracts the actions of magnesium and potassium at the cell membrane. This ability allows it to be highly effective in addressing the consequences of both hypermagnesemia and hyperkalemia.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia, and a rational approach to its management.

Methods

This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include search of MEDLINE, and bibliographic search of current textbooks and journal articles.

Results and Conclusions

A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Is magnesium level significant in prognosis of geriatric patients admitted to the emergency department? [^111oG9Lx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

This study aims to evaluate the impact of serum magnesium (Mg) level on hospitalization and 28-day mortality in a nonspecific geriatric patient population.

Method

This single-center retrospective and observational clinical study involved patients aged over 70 years who presented to the emergency department for any complaint. Those whose Mg levels were not assessed and those who presented due to trauma, treated in another hospital before coming to our hospital, presented in cardiopulmonary arrest, refused treatment and/or left the hospital without permission, and were referred to another hospital were excluded from this study. The patients were classified as having hypomagnesemia (≤ 1.7 mg/dL Mg), normomagnesemia (1.7–2.2 mg/dL), and hypermagnesemia (≥ 2.2 mg/dL). We assessed whether patients between these groups could provide data on hospitalization, discharge, and 28-day mortality.

Results

The average age of the included patients was 77.11 ± 7.91 years. Of the patients, 1032 (55.3%) were female. The incidence rates of hypomagnesemia, normomagnesemia, and hypermagnesemia significantly differed between the hospitalized and discharged patients (p < 0.01). In older patients, hypermagnesemia was associated with hospitalization. Moreover, a significant difference in Mg levels at 28 days was observed between the deceased patients and survivors (p < 0.001); hypermagnesemia was significantly more common among the deceased patients. The results of the univariate and multivariate regression analyses showed that hypermagnesemia was a significant factor for discharge at 28 days (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

While hypomagnesemia is more manageable than hypermagnesemia, the latter is an important predictor of hospitalization and 28-day mortality in individuals over 70 years old.

### Diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia: AGREEing the guidelines [^112gWaK5]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Improving both the accuracy of diagnosis and the appropriate management of hyponatraemia are important goals given the morbidity and mortality associated with this common electrolyte disorder. A greater consistency in future clinical practice guidelines would represent a significant educational achievement and, crucially, would help clinicians to pick the best options for patients with hyponatraemia.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1145dcRq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)–associated hypomagnesemia monitoring — meta-analyses have reached differing conclusions, with some concluding that "long-term PPI use is significantly associated with hypomagnesemia" while others found "the risk of PPI-induced hypomagnesemia was unclear because of significant heterogeneity among studies". AGA guidance states that long-term PPI users "should not routinely screen or monitor serum magnesium levels", whereas the FDA "suggests that health care providers should consider monitoring magnesium levels before initiation of PPI treatment and then periodically"; the authors add that "presently there are insufficient data to make a meaningful recommendation regarding the need for monitoring of magnesium levels in patients on chronic PPI therapy".

Conclusion

In conclusion, hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia were both associated with increased mortality, demonstrating a U-shaped association between serum magnesium levels and mortality. Hypomagnesemia was associated specifically associated with increased non-cardiovascular, non-malignancy related death while hypermagnesemia did not demonstrate any cause specific mortality association. Magnesium levels are not associated with a difference in rate of eGFR decline in CKD patients.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Long QT syndrome (LQTS) — prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is presented as an algorithm that labels "QT prolonging drugs/ hypokalemia/ hypomagnesemia (Class III: Harm)" and for patients with "QTc ≥ 470 ms and/or symptomatic" provides "Beta blocker (Class I)", with escalation for "Persistent symptoms and/or other high-risk features†" to "Treatment intensification, additional medications, left cardiac sympathetic denervation and/or an ICD (Class I)", while "Asymptomatic and QTc ≥ 500 ms" maps to "Treatment intensification, additional medications, left cardiac sympathetic denervation and/or an ICD (Class IIb)". High-risk patients with LQTS include those with "QTc ≥ 500 ms, genotypes LQT2 and LQT3, females with genotype LQT2, < 40 years of age, onset of symptoms at < 10 years of age, and patients with recurrent syncope", and "ICD candidacy as determined by functional status, life expectancy, or patient preference".

Medication-induced arrhythmias — management directives: For sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA) potentially due to digoxin toxicity, administration of digoxin antibodies is recommended. In patients with recurrent torsades de pointes associated with acquired QT prolongation and bradycardia not suppressed with intravenous magnesium, increasing the heart rate with atrial or ventricular pacing or isoproterenol are recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For patients with QT prolongation due to a medication, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or other acquired factor and recurrent torsades de pointes, administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate is recommended to suppress the arrhythmia. For torsades de pointes with acquired QT prolongation, potassium repletion to 4.0 mmol/L or more and magnesium repletion to normal values are beneficial. In patients taking sodium channel blockers who present with elevated defibrillation or pacing thresholds, discontinuing the presumed responsible medication or reprogramming the device can be useful to restore effective device therapy. In congenital or acquired long QT syndrome, QT-prolonging medications are potentially harmful.

Hypermagnesemia

Hypermagnesemia is characterized by a serum magnesium concentration exceeding 1.1 mmol/L with renal failure being the most common cause. Other etiologies are associated with excessive oral or parenteral magnesium intake in cases of post-magnesium infusion for hypomagnesemia and parenteral nutrition. Additional causes can include tumor lysis syndrome and magnesium containing medication such as antacids and magnesium supplements. Neurological manifestations of hypermagnesemia encompass paralysis, drowsiness, ataxia, muscle weakness, and confusion. A moderate increase in magnesium levels can lead to vasodilation, however severe hypermagnesemia may result in hypotension. Excessively elevated serum magnesium levels can manifest as lowered levels of consciousness, hypoventilation, cardiac arrhythmias, bradycardia, and ultimately cardiopulmonary arrest. Addressing hypermagnesemia involves using calcium administration to counteract elevated magnesium levels in the bloodstream as it can remove magnesium from serum. Additionally, it is crucial to identify and decrease the sources of magnesium intake. In severe cases, cardiorespiratory support may be required until magnesium levels are under control. The administration of intravenous calcium, such as calcium gluconate (100 mg/kg/dose, max. 3 g) or calcium chloride (20 mg/kg/dose, max. 1 g), is recommended. This dosage can be repeated as necessary to correct life-threatening arrhythmias. For severe cases of hypermagnesemia, dialysis is the preferred treatment. In situations where renal and cardiovascular functions are normal, intravenous saline diuresis involving the administration of normal saline and furosemide can enhance renal magnesium excretion until dialysis is feasible. However, it is important to note that diuresis may enhance the excretion of calcium which can lead to hypocalcemia and exacerbation of the signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia.

### Electrolytes disturbances in cancer patients [^114p2cgT]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperkalaemia and hypermagnesemia are electrolytes disturbances that can arise in cancer patients in relation to unique causes that are related to the cancer itself or its treatment and can lead to delay or interruption of cancer therapy. This article summarizes these main causes, the proposed pathophysiology and the recommended management for these disturbances.

Recent Findings

There have been many cancer drugs approved in the field of oncology over the past several years and a subset of these drugs have been associated with electrolytes disturbances. This includes, for example, immune checkpoint inhibitor related hyperkalemia, fibroblast growth factor 23 inhibitor associated hyperphosphatemia and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor associated hypomagnesemia and hypocalcaemia.

Summary

This article provides an updated review of certain electrolytes disturbance in cancer patients and allows clinicians to have a greater awareness and knowledge of these electrolyte abnormalities in efforts to early recognition and timely management.

The majority of disorders that cause renal potassium wasting present with abnormalities in adrenal hormone secretion. While these findings frequently lead patients to seek endocrine evaluation, clinicians often struggle to accurately diagnose these conditions, delaying treatment and adversely impacting patient care. At the same time, growing insight into the genetic and molecular basis of these disorders continues to improve their diagnosis and management. In this review, we outline a practical integrated approach to the evaluation of renal hypokalemia syndromes that are seen in endocrine practice while highlighting recent advances in understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology behind them.

### Magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose) [^114YjNjQ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium.

For Treatment of Overdose

Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful.

Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.

### Serum magnesium, mortality and disease progression in chronic kidney disease [^111f9DuA]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are few studies that examine the effects of hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia on CKD progression. One study found that hypomagnesemia was associated with an annual eGFR decline of 9.6% when baseline serum magnesium level was 1 mg/dL below the population mean, 3.5% annual eGFR decline if the serum magnesium level was 1 mg/dL above the population mean, and 6.6% eGFR decline for the population mean, however the effect of magnesium lost significance after adjustment for covariates. Proposed mechanisms for why hypomagnesemia may be responsible for accelerated eGFR decline include potentiating hyperaldosteronism, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, which may lead to further kidney injury. In our study, we compared the slope or rate of decline in eGFR between CKD patients with hypomagnesemia, normal magnesium levels, and hypermagnesemia and found that the association between magnesium group and slope of eGFR was not statistically significant in either the unadjusted (P = 0.14) or adjusted (P = 0.10) models, suggesting that different magnesium levels are not associated with a different rate of eGFR decline in CKD patients. However, we do note that the group with low magnesium levels had a slightly more negative slope than the normal group, but the effect was not statistically significant.

Strengths of our analysis include a large patient population with CKD stages 3–4, with data over several years, including a diverse patient population. However, retrospective analyses are prone to residual confounding. While we were able to control for multiple confounding variables that affect mortality, we were unable to adjust for patients on a calcimimetic, as well as for iPTH and phosphorous levels due to insufficient data. Additionally, we recognize that the patients who had their magnesium levels measured were different from those who did not and we realize this could bias our results. For example, serum magnesium appeared to be measured frequently in patients with malignancy and that could be driven by the known hypomagnesemic effects of several anti-cancer drugs. Unfortunately, we did not have data related to the use of cancer drugs, so we could not investigate this finding further. Finally, our patients have been followed in a single health care system, and therefore the data may not be generalizable.

### Tailoring treatment of hyperkalemia [^112Sp5EZ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that may be rapidly life-threatening because of its cardiac toxicity. Hyperkalemia risk factors are numerous and often combined in the same patient. Most of the strategies to control serum potassium level in the short term have been used for decades. However, evidence for their efficacy and safety remains low. Treatment of hyperkalemia remains challenging, poorly codified, with a risk of overtreatment, including short-term side effects, and with the priority of avoiding unnecessary hospital stays or chronic medication changes. Recently, new oral treatments have been proposed for non-life-threatening hyperkalemia, with encouraging results. Their role in the therapeutic arsenal remains uncertain. Finally, a growing body of evidence suggests that hyperkalemia might negatively impact outcomes in the long term in patients with chronic heart failure or kidney failure through underdosing or withholding of cardiovascular medication (e.g. renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors). Recognition of efficacy and potential side effects of treatment may help in tailoring treatments to the patient's status and conditions. In this review we discuss how treatment of hyperkalemia could be tailored to the patient's conditions and status, both on the short and mid term.

5.8 Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism

Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, and in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.

For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of pantoprazole sodium and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the PPI.

5.9 Tumorigenicity

Due to the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for prolonged administration of pantoprazole sodium. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and caused rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

5.10 Fundic Gland Polyps

PPI use is associated with an increased risk of fundic gland polyps that increases with long-term use, especially beyond one year. Most PPI users who developed fundic gland polyps were asymptomatic and fundic gland polyps were identified incidentally on endoscopy. Use the shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated.

5.11 Interference with Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors

Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Healthcare providers should temporarily stop pantoprazole sodium treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Altogether, we hypothesize that in patients who develop hypomagnesemia (and hypermagnesemia?) shortly after ICU admission, magnesium shifts into or out of the cell under the influence of factors involved with critical illness. Hypomagnesemia may thus only be a marker of ICU induced stress. This novel perspective raises an important question regarding the appropriateness of magnesium suppletion in this population and warrants further examination, for instance through prospective interventional studies.

### Magnesium: an overlooked electrolyte [^112tZQmt]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hypermagnesemia is rare and usually iatrogenic. Due to decreased renal function, older patients are generally more susceptible to hypermagnesemia than are younger patients. Because it is not one of the commonly assessed electrolytes in the blood work panel of patients, high levels are usually missed.

Case Report

An elderly gentleman with history of leukemia presented with complaints of shortness of breath and extreme weakness while walking. He was diagnosed with severe hypermagnesemia, but unfortunately succumbed to cardiorespiratory arrest. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Thorough history taking is crucial in evaluating weakness in elderly patients because the differential diagnosis is vast. Prompt consultation for emergent dialysis is critical to avoiding unfavorable outcomes due to electrolyte abnormalities.

### The impact of low serum and dialysate magnesium levels on clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients: a literature review [^113NW9H9]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Historically, concerns about hypermagnesemia led to the reduction of dialysate magnesium (dMg) concentrations to below 0.75 mmol/L, effectively minimizing related adverse events. However, findings in recent years indicate that hypomagnesemia, defined as serum magnesium (sMg) levels below 0.7 mmol/L, has become more prevalent and a greater concern among dialysis patients, and has been associated with severe clinical outcomes, including vascular calcification and elevated mortality rates. Despite its significance, hypomagnesemia is often overlooked in clinical practice. This review highlights the critical importance of sMg levels in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), particularly focusing on hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia. While causality has not been definitively established, evidence from the literature suggests that sMg levels should be monitored regularly and that increasing dMg concentrations from 0.25 to 0.5 or 0.75 mmol/L may help prevent hypomagnesemia, alongside nutritional management. Considering the impact of dMg on serum magnesium levels, and acknowledging the variability in reported outcomes, careful selection and individualization of dMg concentrations have the potential to impact clinical outcomes in PD patients.

### Magnesium disorders: core curriculum 2024 [^115nV6Wy]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Magnesium is ubiquitous in nature. It sits at the origin of the food chain, occupying the center of chlorophyl in plants. In humans, magnesium is critical to diverse molecular and catalytic processes, including energy transfer and maintenance of the genome. Despite its abundance, hypomagnesemia is common and often goes undiagnosed. This is in spite of epidemiologic data linking low magnesium with chronic diseases including diabetes mellitus. Clinically significant hypermagnesemia is encountered less frequently, but the presentation may be dramatic. Advances in molecular biology and the elucidation of the genetic causes of magnesium disorders have enhanced our understanding of their pathophysiology. Treatment approaches are also changing. The repurposing of newer medications, such as sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, offers new therapeutic options. In this review we integrate knowledge in this rapidly evolving field to provide clinicians and trainees with a resource for approaching common clinical scenarios involving magnesium disorders.

### Magnesium and dialysis: the neglected cation [^115uU22d]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Disorders of magnesium homeostasis are very common in dialysis patients but have received scant attention. In this review, we address measurement of plasma magnesium, magnesium balance and the factors that affect magnesium flux during dialysis, the prevalence of hypo- and hypermagnesemia in dialysis patients, and the potential clinical significance of hypo- and hypermagnesemia in dialysis patients. Many factors can affect plasma magnesium concentration, including diet, nutritional status (including plasma albumin level), medications (such as proton pump inhibitors), and dialysis prescription. Further interventional studies to determine the effect of normalization of plasma magnesium concentration on clinical outcomes are needed. At the present time, we recommend that predialysis plasma magnesium be measured on a regular basis, with the dialysate magnesium concentration adjusted to maintain plasma magnesium concentration within the normal range.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte disturbances — potassium and magnesium management in ventricular arrhythmias: Potassium (and magnesium) salts are useful in treating ventricular arrhythmias secondary to hypokalemia (or hypomagnesemia) resulting from diuretic use in patients with structurally normal hearts (Level of Evidence: B). Class IIa guidance states it is reasonable to maintain serum potassium levels above 4.0 mM/L in any patient with documented life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and a structurally normal heart (Level of Evidence: C) and to maintain serum potassium levels above 4.0 mM/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) (Level of Evidence: B). Magnesium salts can be beneficial in the management of ventricular tachycardia (VT) secondary to digoxin toxicity in patients with structurally normal hearts (Level of Evidence: B). Supporting context notes that hypokalemia (less than 3.5 mM) and hypomagnesemia are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD), hypomagnesemia is classically associated with polymorphic VT or torsades de pointes and may respond to intravenous magnesium, and significant hypokalemia can prolong the QT interval.

### Inherited disorders of renal hypomagnesaemia [^115YPmtc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

The kidney plays a key role in the maintenance of normal magnesium balance. The distal tubule of the kidney, namely the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule, is crucial for the regulation of serum magnesium levels and body magnesium content. The identification of molecular defects related to rare inherited magnesium losing disorders has contributed greatly to a better understanding of the process of renal magnesium handling. Since the number of genetic defects related to magnesium metabolism is still increasing, it might be expected that our knowledge on magnesium physiology will further improve. This knowledge will hopefully lead to therapeutic strategies that enable specific therapies for patients suffering from the symptoms and possible sequelae of chronic magnesium depletion.

### Association of hypermagnesemia and blood pressure in the critically ill [^113o8Rem]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although magnesium is important in the biology of blood pressure regulation, little clinical data exist on the association of hypermagnesemia and blood pressure.

Method

We examined the association of hypermagnesemia and SBP in a cross-sectional study of 10521 ICU patients from a single tertiary care medical center, 6% of whom had a serum magnesium above 2.6mg/dl at time of admission.

Results

In a multivariable analysis, hypermagnesemia was associated with SBP 6.2mmHg lower [95% confidence interval (CI) -8.2, -4.2, P < 0.001] than in patients with admission values of serum magnesium 2.6mg/dl or less. Each mg/dl increase in serum magnesium was associated with a decrease in SBP of 4.3mmHg (95% CI -5.5, -3.1, P < 0.001). In addition, hypermagnesemic patients had a 2.48-fold greater likelihood (95% CI 2.06, 3.00, P < 0.001) of receiving intravenous vasopressors during the first 24h of ICU care, independent of admission SBP.

Conclusion

Our findings add support to the biologic importance of magnesium regulation in blood pressure control.

### Hypomagnesaemia [^1122P5ox]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Magnesium plays an important role in the body as a cofactor for DNA and protein synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, neuromuscular excitability, enzyme activity and regulation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion.1 The regulation of plasma magnesium concentration is balanced by intestinal absorption and renal excretion. Hypomagnesaemia (variously defined but taken here as plasma magnesium < 0.7 mmol/L) may result from inadequate magnesium intake, increased gastrointestinal or renal loss or redistribution from extracellular to intracellular space. In addition, hypomagnesaemia has been associated with the use of a number of drugs and, in 2012, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) drew attention to the risk associated with prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).2 Here we review the causes and management of hypomagnesaemia.

### Evaluation of hypomagnesemia: lessons from disorders of tubular transport [^111GMS12]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Hypomagnesemia is a highly prevalent clinical condition affecting a large number of hospitalized patients. A decrease in systemic magnesium concentration may lead to impaired function of both neurologic and cardiovascular systems. The kidney has a pivotal role in magnesium handling by adjusting the urinary excretion of this ion in order to maintain systemic concentrations within a narrow range. As such, the cause of hypomagnesemia can be related to increments in the renal excretion of this cation. Many hypomagnesemic disorders also have characteristic changes in the renal reabsorptive capacity for other electrolytes, leading to symptoms that sometimes obscure the clinical presentation. For instance, changes in serum calcium concentration or its urinary excretion can aid in determining the underlying cause. Moreover, hypokalemia due to renal potassium losses often is associated with hypomagnesemia. Genetic defects in pathways controlling renal electrolyte transport impose the hypomagnesemic condition by facilitating renal losses. The discovery of the causative genes has greatly increased our understanding of how magnesium is transported by the kidney. Such knowledge is integral for the continued improvement of patient care with respect to bettering therapies and diagnosis.

The overall incidence of hypomagnesaemia in one study was noted to be between 5% and 8% of the overall population, and in young women (aged 18–22) the incidence was approximately 20%. One of the largest studies, a cross-sectional study in an unselected population of more than 16 000 subjects in Germany, found a prevalence of hypomagnesaemia (magnesium levels below 0.76 mmol/L) of 14.5%. Over 15% of hospitalised elderly patients have been found with low serum magnesium levels. Another study noted: 'At ICU admission 52.5% had total hypomagnesemia and 13.5% total hypermagnesemia; with respect to the Mg(2+) 9.7% showed ionized hypomagnesemia and 23.6% ionized hypermagnesemia. Patients who developed ionized hypermagnesemia had higher mortality than patients without ionized hypermagnesemia development (P = 0.04)'. And it has been noted that 'Hypomagnesemia detected at the time of admission of acutely ill medical patients is associated with an increased mortality rate for both ward and medical ICU patients'. Magnesium depletion is present in about half of all ICU patients. More than 50% of those hospitalised with either of the following conditions are likely to be magnesium-deficient based on an intravenous retention > 20%: hypertension, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular event, gastrointestinal issues or alcoholism.

Based on 183 peer-reviewed studies published from 1990 to 2008, one group of authors concluded: 'The perception that 'normal' serum magnesium excludes deficiency is common among clinicians. This perception is probably enforced by the common laboratory practice of highlighting only abnormal results. A health warning is therefore warranted regarding potential misuse of 'normal' serum magnesium because restoration of magnesium stores in deficient patients is simple, tolerable, inexpensive and can be clinically beneficial'

One study found that 10 out of 11 apparently healthy women were magnesium-deficient based on the oral magnesium load test. The authors concluded: 'The results showed there are more frequent deficiencies of magnesium in organisms than it is generally assumed'. Another study showed that 37.6% of patients with type 2 diabetes and 10.9% of age-matched and sex-matched healthy controls have low plasma magnesium levels.

### Rethinking hypomagnesemia: diagnostic thresholds and metabolic implications in critical illness [^114Bpcww]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Importantly, such redistribution may represent an adaptive rather than purely pathological response. This concept aligns with prior evidence suggesting that magnesium redistribution occurs as part of the acute metabolic stress response, enhancing glycolytic efficiency and ATP buffering during energy crisis, supporting short-term survival. However, prolonged or excessive intracellular sequestration could limit extracellular magnesium availability for cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and endothelial stability. This duality highlights the challenge of interpreting early hypomagnesemia and the need for dynamic rather than static assessment of magnesium status.

This mechanistic model generates testable hypotheses. The nadir of plasma Mg 2+ may follow peaks in catecholamines and glycolytic markers such as pyruvate, consistent with stress-related metabolic flux. Expression or phosphorylation of TRPM7 or related transporters might rise early in critical illness, and pharmacologic attenuation of adrenergic signaling could blunt the decline in ionized magnesium independent of supplementation. Parallel measurements of intracellular and plasma magnesium could confirm this inverse relationship.

While this framework helps explain the rapid fall in ionized magnesium, a second question concerns how hypomagnesemia is defined and interpreted in clinical practice. Zwart et al. emphasized redistribution rather than depletion, yet this interpretation should be viewed with caution when guiding therapy. Even when serum magnesium appears "normal", functional magnesium deficiency may remain undetected because conventional diagnostic thresholds are set too low. Historically, current lower limits of 0.70–0.75 mmol/L for total magnesium were established from population averages rather than outcome-based analyses and included symptomatic individuals. As a result, these cutoffs were never validated against physiologic endpoints such as neuromuscular excitability or energy metabolism, leading to systematic underrecognition of deficiency. In a re-analysis of 3,894 symptomatic patients, Liebscher demonstrated that if a cutoff of 0.70 mmol/L is used, about 90% of truly deficient individuals are misclassified as normal, and even at 0.75 mmol/L, half remain undiagnosed. These data indicate that magnesium deficiency can be clinically relevant well within the so-called normal range. A higher interpretive threshold may therefore better identify patients who would benefit from supplementation. Clinicians should integrate biochemical findings with the clinical context rather than waiting for serum magnesium to drop below arbitrary limits before initiating therapy. A normal total or ionized magnesium concentration does not guarantee physiologic sufficiency, as functional depletion may precede measurable declines in plasma levels and contribute to cardiovascular instability, neuromuscular irritability, and metabolic dysfunction. Recognizing this limitation could prevent undertreatment of a reversible condition.

### Association between hypomagnesemia and coagulopathy in sepsis: a retrospective observational study [^112TXTwR]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypomagnesemia reportedly has significant associations with poor clinical outcomes such as increased mortality and septic shock in patients with sepsis. Although the mechanism underlying these outcomes mostly remains unclear, some experimental data suggest that magnesium deficiency could potentiate coagulation activation in sepsis. However, in sepsis, the association between serum magnesium levels and coagulopathy, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), remains unknown. Thus, we aimed to investigate the relationship between serum magnesium levels and coagulation status and the association between hypomagnesemia and DIC in patients with sepsis.

Methods

This retrospective observational study was conducted at the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital from June 2011 to December 2017. Patients older than 19 years who met the Sepsis-3 definition were included. We categorized patients into three groups according to their serum magnesium levels: hypomagnesemia (< 1.6 mg/dL), normal serum magnesium level (1.6–2.4 mg/dL), and hypermagnesemia (> 2.4 mg/dL). We investigated the association between serum magnesium levels and overt DIC at the time of ICU admission according to the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.

Results

Among 753 patients included in this study, 181 had DIC, 105 had hypomagnesemia, 552 had normal serum magnesium levels, and 96 had hypermagnesemia. Patients with hypomagnesemia had a more activated coagulation status indicated by lower platelet counts, lower fibrinogen levels, higher prothrombin time-international normalized ratios, higher thrombin-antithrombin complex, and more frequent DIC than those with normal serum magnesium levels and hypermagnesemia (DIC: 41.9% vs. 20.6% vs. 24.0%, P < 0.001). The coagulation status in patients with hypomagnesemia was more augmented toward suppressed fibrinolysis than that in patients with normal serum magnesium levels and hypermagnesemia. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that hypomagnesemia was independently associated with DIC (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.00–2.84; P = 0.048) after adjusting for several confounding variables.

Conclusions

Patients with hypomagnesemia had a significantly activated coagulation status and suppressed fibrinolysis. Hypomagnesemia was independently associated with DIC in patients with sepsis. Therefore, the treatment of hypomagnesemia may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of coagulopathy in sepsis.

### The impact of low serum and dialysate magnesium levels on clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients: a literature review [^112K8ztA]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

With the widespread use of lower dMg concentrations, hypermagnesemia has become less frequent, while hypomagnesemia has emerged as a more common problem, especially when dMg concentrations are not carefully selected. Despite evidence linking low sMg to poor clinical outcomes, magnesium concentrations are rarely considered when prescribing PD solutions. Moreover, awareness of the importance of low sMg levels among clinicians, compared to higher sMg levels, is not as high.

This review explores the impact of dMg concentration on sMg levels in PD patients and highlights the clinical consequences of both hypo- and hypermagnesemia.

The relevance of serum magnesium levels in CKD

During the progression of CKD, an increase in the fractional excretion of magnesium acts as a compensatory mechanism to help maintain normal sMg levels. However, as kidney function declines to a creatinine clearance of less than 10 mL/min, sMg levels often cannot be maintained within the normal range of 0.7 to 1.05 mmol/L (1.7 to 2.6 mg/dL; slightly different cut-off points have been used in the literature). This is reflected in the common occurrence of hypermagnesemia in pre-dialysis CKD, unless counterbalanced by factors that decrease sMg, such as comorbidities, malnutrition, or medications like proton pump inhibitors or diuretics. In addition to an increased risk of hypermagnesemia, approximately 15% of patients with pre-dialysis CKD have been shown to suffer from hypomagnesemia. Low magnesium levels are commonly reported in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, proteinuria, or cystic fibrosis.

Ionized magnesium (iMg) is the physiologically active part of total magnesium, accounting for 55–70%, while the rest is either protein-bound (20–30%) or complexed with other ions (5–15%). In dialysis patients, the ionized fraction of total magnesium is reduced compared to healthy controls. iMg is also the fraction of sMg accessible by dialysis and determines the gradient between dialysate and plasma. In clinical practice, total sMg levels are typically measured, which may lead to an overestimation of hypermagnesemia and could mask or underreport hypomagnesemia. In a Japanese population of 118 hemodialysis (HD) patients, hypermagnesemia was much less frequent when based on iMg measurements (13% of patients) compared to total magnesium levels (69%).

### Serum magnesium, mortality and disease progression in chronic kidney disease [^112bZWJz]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular electrolyte and plays a significant role in essentially every biologic function within the cell. It is important for bone and mineral metabolism, as well as for regulating vascular tone and heart rhythm. Magnesium does not appear to be controlled by any hormonal systems. Rather, the regulation of magnesium balance is dependent on intestinal absorption and renal excretion. Given the essential role of the kidneys in maintaining magnesium homeostasis, abnormalities in magnesium levels, including hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia, are not uncommon in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Hypomagnesemia in CKD is usually the result of medication use such as diuretics, calcineurin inhibitors or proton pump inhibitors but it can also be caused by associated conditions like diabetes or volume expansion. Hypomagnesemia has been investigated in non-CKD, CKD, and end stage renal disease (ESRD) patient populations and has been found to be associated with increased mortality, notably increased cardiovascular mortality. Hypomagnesemia has also been linked to a worsening rate of decline in eGFR, though this has not been clearly established.

Hypermagnesemia in CKD is the result of decreased Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). Since urinary excretion is the primary magnesium regulatory system, plasma magnesium levels rise as renal function decreases. The relationship between hypermagnesemia and mortality is not as clear. Some studies suggest that mild elevations in serum magnesium levels are associated with a survival advantage. There are no studies examining the associations between hypermagnesemia and CKD progression.

Our study examines the association between serum magnesium levels, all-cause mortality and progression of CKD in a large cohort of CKD patients.

The therapy should proceed for more than one month, and then continue with a dose that holds the serum value not lower than 0.9 mmol/L magnesium'. The authors noted that using a cut-off of 0.75 mmol/L for magnesium deficiency misses 50% of those with true magnesium deficiency.

### Rethinking hypomagnesemia: diagnostic thresholds and metabolic implications in critical illness [^111qkvnm]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Taken together, these observations suggest that magnesium deficiency may not simply accompany metabolic failure but may actively contribute to it. Recognizing magnesium repletion as a fundamental element of metabolic support could help bridge the gap between biochemical correction and physiological recovery. A broader understanding of magnesium physiology, encompassing redistribution, diagnostic thresholds, and metabolic function, may facilitate earlier recognition and guide more context-sensitive supplementation. Timely magnesium replacement, even in patients with low-normal concentrations, could help restore mitochondrial efficiency, stabilize lactate dynamics, and support recovery from critical illness. A renewed focus on magnesium may therefore offer a simple and physiologically grounded opportunity worthy of further investigation to improve outcomes in the critically ill.

### Metabolic alkalosis pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment: core curriculum 2022 [^111EuLrC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Some important causes of metabolic alkalosis with variable volume status include hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, refeeding syndrome, alkali loading in individuals with reduced GFR, and nonreabsorbable anions such as penicillin and carbenicillin.

Patients suspected of having primary aldosteronism require measurements of renin and aldosterone at baseline and, if necessary, following the saline suppression test. The diagnosis of Bartter, Gitelman, cystic fibrosis, and Pendred syndromes necessitates genetic testing. Diagnosing congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11β- or 17α-hydroxylase deficiency requires specific tests measuring the blood concentration of 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, renin, and aldosterone, as well as cortisol and its 17-hydroxylated precursors.

Returning to case 2, thiazide overuse can produce hypercalcemia due to increased calcium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, but will also cause other electrolyte disturbances such as profound hypokalemia and hyponatremia, which are not observed in this patient. Further, the magnitude of hypercalcemia by thiazides is not expected to exceed levels above 14 mg/dL. Thus, option (a) is not the correct answer to Question 3.

Because the patient's PTH level is borderline low, primary hyperparathyroidism as a cause of hypercalcemia is unlikely. Further, a majority of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism develop nongap metabolic acidosis due to the direct inhibitory effects of PTH on proximal tubule function, hence option (b) is not correct. In hypercalcemia caused by granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, vitamin D levels are significantly increased, which is not the case in this patient; thus, option (c) is not correct. Because the PTH-related peptide levels are undetectable, option (e) is incorrect.

The patient's findings of hypercalcemia (PTH-independent), metabolic alkalosis, and decreased kidney function are most likely caused by calcium alkali (milk alkali) syndrome. This condition is triggered by the ingestion of calcium along with an absorbable alkali. The disease was initially described in patients treated for peptic ulcer disease who used milk and sodium bicarbonate for symptomatic relief, but the current dominant etiology is associated with the use of over-the-counter calcium-containing medications for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis or heartburn. Because of the change in the causative agents over the years, several scholars have suggested changing the name to calcium-alkali syndrome to accurately reflect the current pathogenesis of this disorder. Thus, the correct answer to Question 3 is (d).

### How should hypomagnesaemia be investigated and treated? [^111VUBdM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Hypomagnesaemia is relatively common, with an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 2.5% to 15%. It may result from inadequate magnesium intake, increased gastrointestinal or renal loss or redistribution from extracellular to intracellular space. Drug-induced hypomagnesaemia, particularly related to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, is being increasingly recognized. Most patients with hypomagnesaemia are asymptomatic; symptomatic magnesium depletion is often associated with multiple other biochemical abnormalities, including hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia and metabolic acidosis. Manifestations of symptomatic hypomagnesaemia most often involve neuromuscular, cardiovascular and metabolic features. Patients with symptomatic hypomagnesaemia should be treated with intravenous magnesium, reserving oral replacement for asymptomatic patients.

### Serum magnesium, mortality and disease progression in chronic kidney disease [^1133yo5L]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnesium disorders are commonly encountered in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are typically a consequence of decreased kidney function or frequently prescribed medications such as diuretics and proton pump inhibitors. While hypomagnesemia has been linked with increased mortality, the association between elevated magnesium levels and mortality is not clearly defined. Additionally, associations between magnesium disorders, type of death, and CKD progression have not been reported. Therefore, we studied the associations between magnesium levels, CKD progression, mortality, and cause specific deaths in patients with CKD.

Methods

Using the Cleveland Clinic CKD registry, we identified 10,568 patients with estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) between 15 and 59ml/min/1.73m 2 in this range for a minimum of 3months with a measured magnesium level. We categorized subjects into 3 groups based on these magnesium levels (≤ 1.7, 1.7–2.6 and > 2.6mg/dl) and applied cox regression modeling and competing risk models to identify associations with overall and cause-specific mortality. We also evaluated the association between magnesium level and slope of eGFR using mixed models.

Results

During a median follow-up of 3.7years, 4656 (44%) patients died. After adjusting for relevant covariates, a magnesium level < 1.7mg/dl (vs. 1.7–2.6mg/dl) was associated with higher overall mortality (HR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.24), and with higher sub-distribution hazards for non-cardiovascular non-malignancy mortality (HR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.49). Magnesium levels > 2.6mg/dl (vs. 1.7–2.6mg/dl) was associated with a higher risk of all-cause death only (HR = 1.23, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.48). We found similar results when evaluating magnesium as a continuous measure. There were no significant differences in the slope of eGFR across all three magnesium groups (p = 0.10).

Conclusions

In patients with CKD stage 3 and 4, hypomagnesemia was associated with higher all-cause and non-cardiovascular non-malignancy mortality. Hypermagnesemia was associated with higher all-cause mortality. Neither hypo nor hypermagnesemia were associated with an increased risk of CKD progression.

### Management of a severe case of gitelman syndrome with poor response to standard treatment [^1142Nuz5]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Gitelman syndrome is an autosomal recessive distal renal tubular disorder caused by defective sodium chloride transporters. Biochemically, it presents with hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesaemia and hypocalciuria. It is usually managed with oral potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics. We report a case of a 28-year-old woman whose condition worsened during pregnancy; she became resistant to standard management after delivery of her second child. She was managed in a specialist metabolic clinic through a comprehensive approach including perseverance with oral potassium supplement, weekly intravenous potassium and magnesium infusion, correction of vitamin D level and the offering of appropriate dietary advice; this controlled the patient's symptoms and prevented repeated hospital admissions. In this case report, we illustrate a patient's presentation and diagnosis with Gitelman syndrome, discuss triggers of exacerbation, review the relevant literature in terms of differential diagnoses and provide practical advice on the management of difficult cases in a specialist clinic.

### Epsom salt ingestion leading to severe hypermagnesemia necessitating dialysis [^1124WaaS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypermagnesemia is an often overlooked electrolyte abnormality that has a myriad of presenting symptoms. It has been observed after both accidental and intentional ingestions of magnesium-containing compounds, and as in the case presented, Epsom salts, which are primarily magnesium sulfate.

Case Report

A 56-year-old man presented to the emergency department reporting weakness after an ingestion of Epsom salts used as a laxative and was found to be bradycardic and hypotensive. He subsequently developed altered mental status and respiratory depression necessitating intubation. His magnesium level was found to be > 3.91 mmol/L (> 9.5 mg/dL). He was given multiple doses of calcium gluconate and generous i.v. fluids with furosemide, with minimal improvement. However, his magnesium level corrected rapidly after initiation of dialysis, and 3 days later he was discharged home in good condition with normal neurologic function. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Keeping a high level of suspicion for, and quickly recognizing, hypermagnesemia allows for prompt initiation of treatment, which can avoid significant hemodynamic or respiratory compromise. Mainstays of treatment are i.v. calcium and i.v. fluids. Loop diuretics may be given as an adjunct as well. Dialysis should be considered in cases of severe hypermagnesemia because it results in rapid correction of magnesium levels.

### Paradigm shift in hypomagnesemia: a prospective observational study of ionized magnesium in the ICU [^111BSWuX]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with an ionized hypomagnesemia all showed low concentrations of urine magnesium. The mean amount of magnesium in the 24 h urine samples collected on the first day after diagnosis was 1.2 mmol. Compared to the median suppletion of over 2 g of MgSO4 (~ 8mmol of Mg) in the same period, this is also low.

PTH levels were elevated in these patients with mean levels of 20 pmol/L and calcitriol was decreased, mean 36 pmol/L.

Fig. 1
(a) mean ionized magnesium levels in time. (b) mean ionized magnesium levels for subset with ionized hypomagnesemia

Our study shows that a low total magnesium does not necessarily implicate the presence of true ionized hypomagnesemia, but a normal total magnesium level typically rules out ionized hypomagnesemia. This is in contrast with the only other general ICU-study that we know of that measured ionized magnesium. This raises pertinent questions regarding the clinical significance of total magnesium measurements on the ICU, especially considering the prevalent practice of magnesium suppletion and the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the clinical relevance and etiology of hypomagnesemia.

The number of patients with hypermagnesemia was also remarkably high. Possible explanations could be that the upper limit of normal may be unsuitable for ICU patients, or it could be caused by cellular shift of magnesium.

Our findings shed light on the early onset and fast recovery of ionized hypomagnesemia, even without suppletion. This is the case for both ionized and total hypomagnesemia, which means that this effect cannot be caused by a significant redistribution of magnesium in plasma. We also showed that ICU induced hypomagnesemia is not caused by increased urinary magnesium loss. As magnesium changed so rapidly, it is also not likely to be caused by exchange in the bone surface pool, which takes several days. Together, these results suggest that ICU induced hypomagnesemia is based on a cellular shift of magnesium and not on a true total body magnesium deficit. What exactly causes this cellular magnesium shift is not clear yet. What we do know is that cellular magnesium transport is influenced by different hormones such as catecholamines and factors that influence cellular ATP content and production. This transport is fast, and cells can extrude up to 15% of their total cellular magnesium content within a few minutes after stimulation.

The intravenous magnesium load test has been given as 0.2 mmol/kg MgSO 4 over 4 hours(or around 340 mg of magnesium for a 70 kg person). One procedure has given magnesium sulfate MgSO 4 (0.2 mmol/kg body weight) in 250 mL of 5% dextrose in water at 09:00 over 4 hours. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were then collected starting from the initiation of the infusion to determine 24-hour urinary magnesium excretion. Baseline 24-hour urinary magnesium excretion was then subtracted from postinfusion 24-hour urinary magnesium excretion. The magnesium retention was then calculated by the total amount of magnesium infused − (postinfusion 24-hour urinary magnesium − baseline 24-hour urinary magnesium) × 100/total amount of magnesium infused.

Hypomagnesemia can occur as a result of insufficient magnesium intake, increased gastrointestinal or renal loss, or redistribution from extracellular to intracellular compartments. A number of drugs are known to cause hypomagnesemia, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). We report the case of a patient with symptomatic hypomagnesemia due to short bowel syndrome and PPI therapy. Investigations revealed low 24-hour urinary magnesium excretion and secondary hypocalcemia. PPI treatment was withdrawn and the patient was managed with intravenous and oral magnesium and calcium replacement. This teaching case provides an evidence-based discussion of the treatment of hypomagnesemia.

Discussion

In rhabdomyolysis, electrolyte abnormalities occur as a result of cellular component release associated with induced AKI. Electrolyte abnormalities that occur due to rhabdomyolysis are hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.

AKI in rhabdomyolysis is often associated with excessive potassium levels and correlates with the volume of muscle destruction. Baseline levels of potassium and all pertinent electrolytes should be evaluated when the possibility of rhabdomyolysis development is present. Hyperkalemia that occurs in rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI occurs early in the course of the disease process and should be monitored closely. Potassium levels should be serially evaluated. Patients with high potassium levels (> 6 mmol/L) should have cardiac monitoring. ECG should be obtained and assessed for manifestations of severe hyperkalemia (QRS widening, small p waves, and severe arrhythmias). Hypocalcemia aggravates the electrical effects of hyperkalemia and should be aggressively treated with calcium chloride or calcium gluconate in this scenario. Elevated potassium levels should be treated with insulin and glucose infusions. Consider administration of a β-2 adrenergic agent such as albuterol via aerosol inhalation. Lastly, consider potassium removal via cation exchange resin or dialysis as indicated.

Similar to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia occurs as a result of phosphate release from damaged muscle cells. High levels of phosphate may be problematic because phosphate binds to calcium and this complex deposits in the soft tissues. Additionally, by inhibiting 1α-hydroxylase, hyperphosphatemia inhibits calcitriol formation and thus limits formation of the active form of vitamin D. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia should be done with caution since treatment involves administration of a calcium chelator which can increase precipitation of calcium phosphate in injured muscle. Early hyperphosphatemia typically decreases as phosphate is excreted in the urine.

Hypocalcemia occurs early in rhabdomyolysis due to calcium entry into damaged cells and calcium phosphate deposition in necrotic muscle. Early hypocalcemia treatment in rhabdomyolysis should be avoided unless patients are symptomatic or severe hyperkalemia is present. Correction of hypocalcemia with calcium chloride or gluconate should be avoided since calcium deposition may occur in injured muscle. During the recovery phase, serum calcium levels return to normal and may rebound, causing hypercalcemia due to release of calcium from injured muscle and mild secondary hyperparathyroidism secondary to AKI.

Hypermagnesemia seen with rhabdomyolysis is infrequent but when it occurs is typically in association with AKI and should be treated accordingly with hemodialysis.

What is the role of RRT in rhabdomyolysis?

### An unusual yet "Mg"nificent indication for hemodialysis [^1115WP51]. Seminars in Dialysis (2016). Low credibility.

Hypermagnesemia is an uncommon electrolyte abnormality, due to the fact that magnesium toxicity is only seen in the setting of a massive exposure to exogenous magnesium, often in the setting of renal insufficiency. Here, we report a case of severe hypermagnesemia that resulted in complete paralysis that was secondary to Renacidin administration, a rarely used agent used for intra-renal pelvic or intra-vesicular instillation dissolution of struvite stones. The patient also had concurrent acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient's magnesium was as high as 16.7 mg/dL, and he initially received hemodialysis followed by continuous venovenous hemodialysis. These therapies resulted in a rapid reduction in magnesium levels and eventual resolution of the muscular weakness. The case discussion highlights several key aspects of magnesium homeostasis, the limited mechanistic understanding of Renacidin-induced hypermagnesemia, and the role of renal replacement therapies in the treatment of hypermagnesemia.

### Clinical implications of disordered magnesium homeostasis in chronic renal failure and dialysis [^1168eDC6]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Magnesium (Mg) is the fourth most abundant cation in the body, mainly located within bone and skeletal muscle. The normal total plasma Mg concentration varies in a narrow range, with approximately 60% present as free Mg ions, the biologically active form. The kidney plays a principal role in Mg balance. Approximately 70–80% of plasma Mg is ultrafilterable, and under normal circumstances, 95% of the filtered load of Mg is reabsorbed. As chronic renal failure (CRF) progresses, urinary Mg excretion may be insufficient to balance intestinal Mg absorption and dietary Mg intake becomes a major determinant of serum and total body Mg levels. Until severe reductions in glomerular filtration rate (< 30 ml/min), serum Mg levels are usually normal; with lower rates of renal function, serum Mg is increased. Concerning dialysis patients, dialysate Mg plays a critical role in maintaining Mg homeostasis, with serum Mg being largely dependent on the concentration of the ion in the dialysis solution. Magnesium has been implicated in diverse consequences, both beneficial and deleterious, in patients with CRF and dialysis. Potential harmful effects of elevated Mg include altered nerve conduction velocity, increased pruritus, and alterations to osseous metabolism and parathyroid gland function (mineralization defects, contribution to osteomalacic renal osteodystrophy, and adynamic bone disease). Hypermagnesemia also may retard vascular calcification. Low Mg levels have been associated with impairment of myocardial contractility, intradialytic hemodynamic instability, and hypotension. In addition, low Mg has been also linked to carotid intima-media thickness, a marker of atherosclerotic vascular disease and a predictor of vascular events.

### Safety of a triple-chamber bag parenteral nutrition in children ages up to 24 months: an observational study [^114Dj2c2]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This is the first observational study to measure serum magnesium levels during treatment with the G16%E formulation of pediatric 3CB PN in real-world clinical practice. Changes in mean serum magnesium levels during pediatric 3CB PN were small and not clinically relevant. AEs of hypermagnesemia were infrequent and generally mild, and were reported at a similar incidence to other electrolyte imbalances. There were no AEs of hypomagnesemia. One AE of hypermagnesemia in a neonate was considered moderate because of a suspected association with muscular weakness. The patient had hypotonia before treatment and was receiving concomitant amikacin, which may potentiate neuromuscular weakness. One of the patients with mild hypermagnesemia was born preterm but was enrolled after 37 weeks postmenstrual age, meeting the inclusion criteria. Prematurity is associated with higher serum magnesium levels. This was the only study participant born preterm.

All 4 hypermagnesemia AEs occurred in infants < 1 month of age, suggesting this age group may be at higher risk of hypermagnesemia, and thus need close electrolyte monitoring during PN. The kidney is an important regulator of magnesium homeostasis, and postnatal renal immaturity increases the risk of hypermagnesemia. Clinical symptoms may not manifest unless hypermagnesemia is severe and may not be identified in critically ill children.

The treatment regimens in this observational, noninterventional study represent real-world clinical practice across a range of neonatal and pediatric intensive care, pediatric gastroenterological, and pediatric surgical environments. The patient population reflected the full age range for which the pediatric 3CB product is approved, and the variety of diagnoses, which can necessitate PN. The treating physicians were able to adjust the 3CB PN to meet individual patient needs, through dilution, nutrient additions, or the optional lipid component, and make PN dosing adjustments as clinically appropriate. Although treatment duration within the study was limited to 15 days, this reflects the short-term use typical of intensive care situations.

5.24	Hypomagnesemia and Mineral Metabolism

Hypomagnesemia, symptomatic and asymptomatic, has been reported rarely in patients treated with PPIs for at least three months, in most cases after a year of therapy. Serious adverse events include tetany, arrhythmias, and seizures. Hypomagnesemia may lead to hypocalcemia and/or hypokalemia and may exacerbate underlying hypocalcemia in at-risk patients. In most patients, treatment of hypomagnesemia required magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI.

For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take PPIs with medications such as digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals may consider monitoring magnesium levels prior to initiation of PPI treatment and periodically [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Consider monitoring magnesium and calcium levels prior to initiation of VIMOVO and periodically while on treatment in patients with a preexisting risk of hypocalcemia (e.g., hypoparathyroidism). Supplement with magnesium and/or calcium, as necessary. If hypocalcemia is refractory to treatment, consider discontinuing the VIMOVO.

5.25	Concomitant Use of St. John's Wort or Rifampin with VIMOVO

Drugs that induce CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 (such as St. John's Wort or rifampin) can substantially decrease esomeprazole concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of VIMOVO with St. John's Wort or rifampin [see Drug Interactions (7)].

5.26	Interactions with Diagnostic Investigations for Neuroendocrine Tumors

Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to drug-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors. Providers should temporarily stop esomeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary [see Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

5.27	Concomitant Use of VIMOVO with Methotrexate

Literature suggests that concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose; see methotrexate prescribing information) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. In high-dose methotrexate administration a temporary withdrawal of the PPI may be considered in some patients [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Effects of canagliflozin on serum magnesium in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a post hoc analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1146nDLv]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Abnormal elevations of serum magnesium have been linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes in certain populations (e.g. heart failure, critically ill, or on hemodialysis). In this analysis, there was a small increase from baseline in the number of patients with hypermagnesemia in the canagliflozin groups at week 26, but no patients had serum magnesium levels above the upper limit of normal (> 1.27 mmol/L). It is important to note that canagliflozin is not indicated for use in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease or who are on dialysis.

The mechanism for the observed effects of canagliflozin on serum magnesium is unclear. It is unlikely that the increases in serum magnesium seen with canagliflozin are attributable to glycemic improvements, as increases in serum magnesium have not been reported with other antihyperglycemic agents, including sitagliptin and glimepiride, in head-to-head studies with canagliflozin (data on file and). A possible explanation is that canagliflozin treatment is associated with improvements in insulin sensitivity (measured by changes in glucosuria-corrected oral glucose insulin sensitivity [OGIS c] index values), which may increase magnesium levels by interrupting the cycle of hypomagnesemia induced by insulin resistance. And while bone storage is involved in magnesium homeostasis, it is unlikely that increased magnesium levels are due to leaching from bone, as bone mineral density remains relatively unchanged with canagliflozin treatment over 2 years. Another consideration is that SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to increase plasma glucagon levels, which may increase magnesium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Finally, the observed increase in serum magnesium may be related to canagliflozin acting on ion channels in the DCT (e.g. TRPM6/TRPM7), which have been found to modulate urinary magnesium excretion.
