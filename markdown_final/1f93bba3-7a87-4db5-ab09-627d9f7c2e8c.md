## Question

What's the concern with serum protein levels below reference range

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of serum protein levels below the reference range, particularly focusing on albumin and related proteins, and how to interpret and manage these findings in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which serum proteins are most clinically relevant and why. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of low albumin, especially the role of inflammation versus nutrition. Next, I will review prognostic implications across diseases and settings. After that, I need to check how to interpret low albumin in clinical decision-making, including when to use albumin infusion. Finally, I will consider special contexts like cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and drug binding, and close with practical takeaways and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the proteins of interest. Serum albumin is the dominant protein in plasma and is the principal marker discussed in the literature on low serum protein levels, with prealbumin (transthyretin) and transferrin often considered alongside it; however, I should verify that these are not interchangeable with total protein or with disease-specific proteins like ceruloplasmin or alpha-1 antitrypsin, which have different diagnostic roles and kinetics [^113ZpQ3Y] [^113u86Pm].

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology of hypoalbuminemia. Wait, let me verify the classic teaching that low albumin equals malnutrition; that is outdated. Contemporary evidence shows hypoalbuminemia primarily reflects inflammation-driven redistribution and increased capillary escape, with a shortened albumin half-life and expanded distribution volume, rather than a direct measure of protein intake or muscle mass; in fact, albumin synthesis may be increased fractionally during inflammation, yet total mass falls due to these kinetic changes [^1158KX7a] [^11788bEW] [^1161Vyws] [^111nSY5Z]. Hold on, I should also confirm that in otherwise healthy individuals, albumin and prealbumin remain normal despite severe caloric restriction until extreme starvation, reinforcing that low levels in illness are not a nutrition marker per se [^112VzfTb] [^1178u2H9].

> Next, I should review prognostic implications across settings. Hypoalbuminemia is a potent, dose-dependent predictor of adverse outcomes; each 10 g/L decrement associates with markedly higher odds of death, morbidity, and resource use in acutely ill cohorts, and this relationship persists after multivariable adjustment, suggesting it captures illness severity beyond simple nutrition indices [^111Nt5EN] [^112uCmJ6]. I will now examine disease-specific data: in chronic heart failure, low albumin independently predicts mortality and hospitalizations, and in hospitalized medical patients at nutrition risk, albumin below 30 g/L signals higher 180-day mortality without helping select who benefits from nutrition support, underscoring its prognostic rather than therapeutic-selection value [^113nVKfU] [^113LpD5g] [^113EH7Pt] [^115oKi5k].

> Let me consider the clinical decision-making implications. I should confirm that albumin is a negative acute-phase reactant; thus, trends in albumin track the inflammatory trajectory and recovery better than absolute values at a single time point, and normalization can lag for weeks after inflammation abates due to its long half-life, which is why serial measurements matter for prognosis and discharge planning rather than for titrating nutrition prescriptions [^114LpzTy] [^115nUe4W]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about albumin infusion; routine albumin administration to "correct" low levels has not shown consistent benefit in general ICU populations, though selected scenarios in cirrhosis (large-volume paracentesis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome) are exceptions where pathophysiology and outcomes data support targeted use, so I need to ensure indications are context-specific [^112uCmJ6] [^116XSSHS] [^115SRTKk].

> I should double-check special contexts where low albumin changes management. In decompensated cirrhosis, both quantitative deficiency and qualitative impairment of albumin (oxidation, glycation) contribute to dysfunction; albumin therapy is beneficial in defined indications but must be individualized to avoid volume overload and other harms, so I need to weigh oncotic and non-oncotic effects against risks in each patient [^111AHoxM] [^115SRTKk] [^116XSSHS]. In nephrotic syndrome and other protein-losing states, albumin loss compounds the inflammatory picture; here, albumin trends still reflect disease activity and treatment response, and calcium interpretation should be corrected for hypoalbuminemia to avoid misclassification of calcium status, which is a practical, immediate implication of low albumin in these patients [^112CjP1i]. For highly protein-bound drugs like phenytoin, low albumin increases the free fraction and risk of toxicity at a given total level, so I should verify whether free drug monitoring is indicated when albumin is low or binding is altered [^11457ZsV].

> Next, I should review how to interpret low albumin alongside other biomarkers. Let me verify that CRP is preferred to support the inflammation criterion in malnutrition frameworks because of its sensitivity and shorter half-life, whereas albumin alone should not be used to diagnose malnutrition; pairing CRP with albumin helps distinguish inflammatory hypoalbuminemia from other causes and avoids misattribution to nutrition alone [^115REQ6Y] [^114LpzTy] [^115nUe4W]. But wait, what if albumin is low and CRP is normal? I need to ensure I consider noninflammatory causes such as protein-losing enteropathy, nephrotic syndrome, or chronic liver disease before concluding nutrition therapy will normalize albumin, since correction will follow treatment of the underlying process rather than refeeding alone [^112pWRHm] [^112Pzbzh].

> I will now examine practical takeaways. First, low albumin is a red flag for severity and risk, not a directive to start albumin infusions or to use albumin to monitor nutrition delivery. Instead, I should treat the cause of inflammation, optimize supportive care, and use albumin trends as a barometer of recovery trajectory over weeks, not days [^112pWRHm] [^115nUe4W]. Second, in perioperative or critical care pathways, persistently low albumin should prompt reassessment of ongoing inflammatory drivers, fluid strategy, and timing of definitive interventions, aligning with "damage control" principles when inflammation is uncontrolled, rather than reflexive albumin administration [^113HqmsY] [^111asfkm]. Third, I need to ensure I do not overinterpret short-term albumin changes; given its long half-life, early inpatient decreases are expected in acute illness, and stabilization or rise over 1–2 weeks is more informative than day-to-day fluctuations [^115nUe4W] [^116CraRq].

> Hold on, I should verify one more nuance about nutrition. While low albumin does not diagnose malnutrition, many hypoalbuminemic patients are indeed malnourished and at nutrition risk. Therefore, I should screen and treat malnutrition using validated tools and clinical judgment, but I should not expect albumin to normalize with nutrition support until inflammation resolves, which is why albumin is not a monitoring parameter for nutrition efficacy despite its prognostic value [^112pWRHm] [^113Am6W5] [^1125fjEn].

> In summary, I need to ensure my message is precise: serum protein levels below the reference range — particularly albumin — primarily reflect inflammatory stress physiology rather than protein intake, carry strong prognostic information across diseases, and should guide vigilance and treatment of underlying illness rather than trigger routine albumin infusion or be used to titrate nutrition support. Interpretation must be contextualized with inflammation markers, disease-specific mechanisms, and serial trends to be clinically meaningful [^1158KX7a] [^111Nt5EN] [^112pWRHm] [^115REQ6Y].

Low serum protein levels, especially **hypoalbuminemia** [^112pWRHm], reflect inflammation, capillary leak, and impaired hepatic synthesis [^1158KX7a] rather than malnutrition alone [^112VzfTb]. They are a **strong, independent predictor of poor outcomes** — including higher mortality, longer hospital stay, and more complications — across critical illness, surgery, and chronic disease [^111Nt5EN] [^112uCmJ6] [^113nVKfU]. Low protein levels reduce oncotic pressure, worsen edema, and impair drug binding and antioxidant defenses [^111AHoxM], which can drive further clinical deterioration [^1123xnwu]. Management should focus on treating the underlying cause, correcting fluid status, and providing nutrition support; routine albumin infusion is not indicated unless there is a specific indication (e.g. large-volume paracentesis, hepatorenal syndrome) [^116XSSHS] [^115SRTKk].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of low serum protein

Several **interconnected mechanisms** underlie low serum protein levels:

- **Inflammation and capillary leak**: Inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, TNF-α) increase vascular permeability, causing albumin to escape into the interstitium and producing relative hypoalbuminemia despite normal or increased synthesis [^111nSY5Z] [^1158KX7a].

- **Reduced hepatic synthesis**: Inflammation reprioritizes hepatic protein synthesis toward acute-phase proteins, decreasing albumin production [^112KYd1q].

- **Increased catabolism and losses**: Protein-losing enteropathies, nephrotic syndrome, and burns increase albumin loss or degradation [^1123xnwu].

- **Hemodilution**: Volume overload or aggressive fluid resuscitation can dilute serum proteins [^112uCmJ6].

---

## Clinical significance and prognostic implications

Low serum protein levels, particularly **hypoalbuminemia**, are strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes:

- **Mortality**: Hypoalbuminemia independently predicts higher mortality across settings, including critical illness, surgery, and chronic diseases (e.g. heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease) [^111Nt5EN] [^113nVKfU] [^1123xnwu].

- **Morbidity**: Low albumin correlates with increased complications, longer ICU/hospital stays, and higher resource utilization [^111Nt5EN] [^112uCmJ6].

- **Functional impairment**: Low albumin reduces oncotic pressure, worsens edema, and impairs drug binding and antioxidant capacity, further compromising clinical status [^111AHoxM] [^1123xnwu].

## Specific clinical scenarios and associated risks

| **Clinical scenario** | **Associated risks and complications** |
|-|-|
| Critical illness (sepsis, trauma, ICU) | - Increased mortality <br/> - Longer ICU stay <br/> - Higher complication rates [^111Nt5EN] [^112uCmJ6] |
| Surgical patients | - Higher postoperative complications <br/> - Infections <br/> - Poor wound healing <br/> - Longer hospital stay [^112Pzbzh] [^113HqmsY] |
| Chronic kidney disease | - Increased mortality <br/> - Inflammation <br/> - Protein-energy wasting [^113z1MRT] [^1124Yo6c] |
| Liver cirrhosis | - Poor prognosis <br/> - Ascites <br/> - Hepatic encephalopathy <br/> - Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [^111AHoxM] [^115SRTKk] |
| Heart failure | - Increased mortality <br/> - Hospitalizations <br/> - Worse functional status [^113nVKfU] [^1123xnwu] |

---

## Clinical management strategies

Management of low serum protein levels centers on **addressing underlying causes**:

- **Treat underlying inflammation or disease**: Control sepsis, inflammation, or chronic disease to reduce capillary leak and restore albumin kinetics [^1158KX7a].

- **Nutritional support**: Provide adequate protein and energy intake to support synthesis and recovery, recognizing that albumin may not normalize until inflammation resolves [^112pWRHm] [^114kHxxy].

- **Correct fluid status**: Manage edema and volume overload to improve effective albumin concentration and reduce dilutional effects [^1123xnwu] [^112uCmJ6].

- **Albumin supplementation**: Reserved for specific indications (e.g. large-volume paracentesis, hepatorenal syndrome, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and not routine use [^116XSSHS] [^115SRTKk].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Interpreting low serum protein levels requires awareness of **confounders**:

- **Inflammation**: Albumin is a negative acute-phase reactant; levels fall with inflammation regardless of nutrition status [^112pWRHm] [^112VzfTb].

- **Fluid status**: Hemodilution or volume shifts can artifactually lower measured protein levels [^112uCmJ6].

- **Liver and renal function**: Impaired synthesis or protein losses can independently lower serum proteins [^1123xnwu].

---

Low serum protein levels, especially **hypoalbuminemia**, are a marker of illness severity and inflammation with strong prognostic value across clinical settings. Management should prioritize treating the underlying cause, correcting fluid status, and providing nutrition support, while avoiding routine albumin infusion unless specifically indicated.

### Usefulness of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to… [^113JRr9q]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein levels may identify patients likely to benefit from lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to ultra-low levels. We find that above-average C-reactive protein with statin therapy predicts failure of carotid intima-media thickness regression in those with currently defined optimal LDL cholesterol (< 100 mg/dl) but not if LDL cholesterol is < 70 mg/dl.

### Understanding and interpreting serum protein electrophoresis [^111W1ktE]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Serum protein electrophoresis is used to identify patients with multiple myeloma and other serum protein disorders. Electrophoresis separates proteins based on their physical properties, and the subsets of these proteins are used in interpreting the results. Plasma protein levels display reasonably predictable changes in response to acute inflammation, malignancy, trauma, necrosis, infarction, burns, and chemical injury. A homogeneous spike-like peak in a focal region of the gamma-globulin zone indicates a monoclonal gammopathy. Monoclonal gammopathies are associated with a clonal process that is malignant or potentially malignant, including multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, solitary plasmacytoma, smoldering multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, plasma cell leukemia, heavy chain disease, and amyloidosis. The quantity of M protein, the results of bone marrow biopsy, and other characteristics can help differentiate multiple myeloma from the other causes of monoclonal gammopathy. In contrast, polyclonal gammopathies may be caused by any reactive or inflammatory process.

### The impact of low-protein diet on residual renal function in dialysis patients: a systematic review and metaanalysis [^114MaYz8]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

In addition, our findings indicate that the addition of keto acids had not significant effect on dialysis patients' residual renal function, who following a low-protein diet through heterogeneity analysis. But in studies of CKD patients, ketone analogues of essential amino acids can trap excess nitrogen residues for essential amino acid production to reduce the formation of endogenous urea. For CKD patients, supplementation with the low-protein diet and ketoacids can effectively ameliorate metabolic disorders, reduce the rate of kidney function decline, and delay the initiation of dialysis without any negative impact on nutritional status. Supplemented with keto acids has no additional benefit may be related to dietary adherence. More relevant clinical studies on dialysis patients are needed to explain this phenomenon.

While a low-protein diet exhibits a positive impact on dialysis patients' residual renal function, prolonged adherence to such a diet may pose certain risks like the change of serum electrolytes, malnutrition and compromised immunity. Our comprehensive study revealed dialysis patients adhering to a low-protein diet exhibited lower serum phosphorus levels and relatively high serum albumin concentrations, indicating a favorable nutritional status. We observed no alterations in serum calcium levels, which aligns with the findings of a meta-analysis involving patients with kidney disease and warrants further interpretation in additional studies. High levels of phosphoric acid associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular disease pose a risk to dialysis patients. Phosphorus intake is closely related to protein and a low-protein diet can slow down serum phosphoric acid levels. While a high serum albumin concentration indicates good nutritional status. This underscores the necessity of meticulously monitoring these patients' nutritional status and promptly adjusting their dietary regimens. It ensures that dialysis patients with a low-protein diet receive adequate nutritional support and minimizes the potential risks associated with long-term dietary restrictions while maximizing the protective benefits for their residual renal function. A low protein diet of 0.6 g/kg/day can reduce the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products and may also prevent negative nitrogen balance, which is reflected in the improvement of albumin and phosphorus levels. At present, it appears that low-protein diets have a certain level of safety, and with personalized diets and long-term monitoring, malnutrition may not occur.

### A proposed nomenclature and diagnostic criteria for protein-energy wasting in acute and chronic kidney disease [^113D6sGc]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The recent research findings concerning syndromes of muscle wasting, malnutrition, and inflammation in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI) have led to a need for new terminology. To address this need, the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM) convened an expert panel to review and develop standard terminologies and definitions related to wasting, cachexia, malnutrition, and inflammation in CKD and AKI. The ISRNM expert panel recommends the term 'protein-energy wasting' for loss of body protein mass and fuel reserves. 'Kidney disease wasting' refers to the occurrence of protein-energy wasting in CKD or AKI regardless of the cause. Cachexia is a severe form of protein-energy wasting that occurs infrequently in kidney disease. Protein-energy wasting is diagnosed if three characteristics are present (low serum levels of albumin, transthyretin, or cholesterol), reduced body mass (low or reduced body or fat mass or weight loss with reduced intake of protein and energy), and reduced muscle mass (muscle wasting or sarcopenia, reduced mid-arm muscle circumference). The kidney disease wasting is divided into two main categories of CKD- and AKI-associated protein-energy wasting. Measures of chronic inflammation or other developing tests can be useful clues for the existence of protein-energy wasting but do not define protein-energy wasting. Clinical staging and potential treatment strategies for protein-energy wasting are to be developed in the future.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^115REQ6Y]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

GLIM malnutrition — inflammation laboratory markers (statement 5) indicate that use of C-reactive protein (CRP) is recommended to support the inflammation criterion, with unanimous panel agreement. CRP has a half-life of 19 h, levels may be reduced in advanced liver disease, increased in end-stage kidney disease, and reduced with immunosuppressive conditions or therapies; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, magnesium supplements, or statins may lower CRP levels. Serum albumin lacks validity for diagnosing malnutrition in inflammatory settings, recovers slowly with a half-life of 3 weeks, yet if albumin is low and CRP elevated, inflammatory activity is highly likely.

### Is preoperative protein-rich nutrition effective on postoperative outcome in non-small cell lung cancer surgery? A prospective randomized study [^115FS6sA]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Although there are a few studies reporting that low nutritional levels is not associated with complications, all these studies show that nutritional status has direct effects on the postoperative complications of lung cancer surgery. Our study was planned based on these studies. In our study, we excluded malnourished patients and patients with low BMIs since we aimed to investigate the effect of surgery on postoperative nutritional status and on prognosis. Our study was structured based on these data, and reduced complication rates and shortened tube drainage times were observed after the preoperative nutrition program. The importance of pre-operative nutrition is emphasized in our study. However, one should note that the effect of an adequate and timely post-operative nutrition on prognosis is unquestionable. In a specific study conducted on this topic, early-stage nutrition within the scope of fast-track rehabilitation program resulted in lesser complications during the post-operative period and these patients were discharged sooner.

As with many cancer types, cachexia and low protein-albumin levels may be observed in lung cancer. A multifactorial process, including increased proinflammatory cytokines, reduced synthesis, increased cleavage, leakage into extravascular space, hypermetabolism and reduced protein intake, is involved in its mechanism. Serum albumin levels are dependent on the rate of synthesis, amount released from the liver cells, extent of distribution and breakdown in the bodily fluids. The daily loss of secreted albumin is 4%. However, various pathological conditions may impact albumin metabolism. Reduction in synthesis secondary to hepatocyte damage, deficiency in amino acid intake, diseases involving acute or chronic inflammation may result in increased loss. In addition, serum albumin levels are also reduced in case of protein malnutrition, nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy, burn, constructive pericarditis, ataxia telangiectasia and tumor-associated mesenteric blockage and mucosal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and hemodilution. As a result, in the case of deficiency of protein, the building block of the body, all body functions will slow down, even stop. Obviously, this triggers development of morbidity and mortality. Although there are studies advocating that complications in malnourished patients are caused by reduced immunity – increased infections and weakness of respiratory muscles, slowed protein metabolism causes a multifactorial effect. However, with respect to malnutrition, the association of hypoalbuminemia and poor prognosis should not be attributed only to malnutrition, and it should be borne in mind that hypoalbuminemia is not observed only in malnourished patients.

### Serum or plasma ferritin concentration as an index of iron deficiency and overload [^1157g8j4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Reference standard indices of iron deficiency and iron overload are generally invasive, expensive, and can be unpleasant or occasionally risky. Ferritin is an iron storage protein and its concentration in the plasma or serum reflects iron stores; low ferritin indicates iron deficiency, while elevated ferritin reflects risk of iron overload. However, ferritin is also an acute-phase protein and its levels are elevated in inflammation and infection. The use of ferritin as a diagnostic test of iron deficiency and overload is a common clinical practice.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ferritin concentrations (serum or plasma) for detecting iron deficiency and risk of iron overload in primary and secondary iron-loading syndromes.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases (10 June 2020): DARE (Cochrane Library) Issue 2 of 4 2015, HTA (Cochrane Library) Issue 4 of 4 2016, CENTRAL (Cochrane Library) Issue 6 of 12 2020, MEDLINE (OVID) 1946 to 9 June 2020, Embase (OVID) 1947 to week 23 2020, CINAHL (Ebsco) 1982 to June 2020, Web of Science (ISI) SCI, SSCI, CPCI-exp & CPCI-SSH to June 2020, POPLINE 16/8/18, Open Grey (10/6/20), TRoPHI (10/6/20), Bibliomap (10/6/20), IBECS (10/6/20), SCIELO (10/6/20), Global Index Medicus (10/6/20) AIM, IMSEAR, WPRIM, IMEMR, LILACS (10/6/20), PAHO (10/6/20), WHOLIS 10/6/20, IndMED (16/8/18) and Native Health Research Database (10/6/20). We also searched two trials registers and contacted relevant organisations for unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included all study designs seeking to evaluate serum or plasma ferritin concentrations measured by any current or previously available quantitative assay as an index of iron status in individuals of any age, sex, clinical and physiological status from any country.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We designed the data extraction form to record results for ferritin concentration as the index test, and bone marrow iron content for iron deficiency and liver iron content for iron overload as the reference standards. Two other authors further extracted and validated the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative cases, and extracted or derived the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for each threshold presented for iron deficiency and iron overload in included studies. We assessed risk of bias and applicability using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. We used GRADE assessment to enable the quality of evidence and hence strength of evidence for our conclusions.

Main Results

Our search was conducted initially in 2014 and updated in 2017, 2018 and 2020 (10 June). We identified 21,217 records and screened 14,244 records after duplicates were removed. We assessed 316 records in full text. We excluded 190 studies (193 records) with reasons and included 108 studies (111 records) in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. There were 11 studies (12 records) that we screened from the last search update and appeared eligible for a future analysis. We decided to enter these as awaiting classification. We stratified the analysis first by participant clinical status: apparently healthy and non-healthy populations. We then stratified by age and pregnancy status as: infants and children, adolescents, pregnant women, and adults. Iron deficiency We included 72 studies (75 records) involving 6059 participants. Apparently healthy populations Five studies screened for iron deficiency in people without apparent illness. In the general adult population, three studies reported sensitivities of 63% to 100% at the optimum cutoff for ferritin, with corresponding specificities of 92% to 98%, but the ferritin cutoffs varied between studies. One study in healthy children reported a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 77%. One study in pregnant women reported a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 100%. Overall confidence in these estimates was very low because of potential bias, indirectness, and sparse and heterogenous evidence. No studies screened for iron overload in apparently healthy people. People presenting for medical care There were 63 studies among adults presenting for medical care (5042 participants). For a sample of 1000 subjects with a 35% prevalence of iron deficiency (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 85% specificity, there would be 315 iron-deficient subjects correctly classified as having iron deficiency and 35 iron-deficient subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron deficiency, leading to a 90% sensitivity. Thresholds proposed by the authors of the included studies ranged between 12 to 200 µg/L. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 50. Among non-healthy adults using a fixed threshold of 30 μg/L (nine studies, 512 participants, low-certainty evidence), the pooled estimate for sensitivity was 79% with a 95% confidence interval of (58%, 91%) and specificity of 98%, with a 95% confidence interval of (91%, 100%). The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 140, a relatively highly informative test. Iron overload We included 36 studies (36 records) involving 1927 participants. All studies concerned non-healthy populations. There were no studies targeting either infants, children, or pregnant women. Among all populations (one threshold for males and females; 36 studies, 1927 participants, very low-certainty evidence): for a sample of 1000 subjects with a 42% prevalence of iron overload (of the included studies in this category) and supposing a 65% specificity, there would be 332 iron-overloaded subjects correctly classified as having iron overload and 85 iron-overloaded subjects incorrectly classified as not having iron overload, leading to a 80% sensitivity. The estimated diagnostic odds ratio was 8.

Authors' Conclusions

At a threshold of 30 micrograms/L, there is low-certainty evidence that blood ferritin concentration is reasonably sensitive and a very specific test for iron deficiency in people presenting for medical care. There is very low certainty that high concentrations of ferritin provide a sensitive test for iron overload in people where this condition is suspected. There is insufficient evidence to know whether ferritin concentration performs similarly when screening asymptomatic people for iron deficiency or overload.

### Serum uromodulin levels reflect severity of clinicopathological findings in early stage IgA nephropathy [^112gEwcN]. American Journal of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uromodulin (UMOD), also known as Tamm-Horsfall protein, is a kidney-specific protein. Recently, low levels of urinary UMOD (uUMOD) have been reported as a risk factor for renal function decline in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). However, the clinical significance of serum UMOD (sUMOD) is not clear. In this study, we clarified the clinical significance of sUMOD in IgAN.

Methods

One hundred eight biopsy-proven IgAN patients were included in this study. The relationships between sUMOD levels and various clinicopathological findings were evaluated.

Results

sUMOD was positively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p < 0.001, r = 0.5) and negatively correlated with creatinine (Cr) (p < 0.0001, r = -0.51) and urinary protein (UP) (p = 0.005, r = -0.33). In the low sUMOD group (< 145 ng/mL), Cr was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) and histopathological changes were severe. The cumulative incidence of a 30% decline in eGFR was 25.6% overall, 0% in histological grade (H-G) I, 33.3% in H-G II, 59.6% in H-G III, and 66.7% in H-G IV. In univariate analyses, prognostic factors for a 30% decline in eGFR were male, high UP, low albumin, low eGFR, and low sUMOD. When comparing the severe histopathological classes (H-G II-IV) and H-G I, low sUMOD was a risk factor for severe histopathological changes. Furthermore, in patients with eGFR > 60 (n = 74), multivariate analyses revealed that low sUMOD independently predicted a 30% decline in eGFR and having severe histopathological changes.

Conclusion

In IgAN, sUMOD levels were associated with renal function. Low sUMOD levels may be a risk factor for worsening renal function, especially in the early stage of IgAN.

### Is the calcium correct? Measuring serum calcium in dialysis patients [^115xN5XX]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Abnormalities in calcium concentration are frequent in patients receiving dialysis therapy. Most cases of both hypo- and hypercalcemia are mild and asymptomatic. There is concern, however, that, on the one hand, hypocalcemia can drive hyperparathyroidism and eventually lead to gland hypertrophy and autonomous function. Hypercalcemia, on the other hand, can be associated with increased extraosseous calcium and phosphate deposition leading to vascular calcification with an attendant mortality and morbidity. Calcium exists in three main forms in the blood: the physiologically active free or ionized fraction (terms often used interchangeably), a protein bound fraction, and a fraction complexed to other anions. Although the ionized calcium can readily be measured using ion-specific electrodes, it is the total calcium that is most commonly measured because of sample handling and cost concerns. As it is the free or ionized form that is biologically active (and therefore of most relevance), a number of adjustment formulae have been derived to "correct" the total calcium for changes in albumin, protein, and complexing ion concentrations. These formulae show good statistical correlation with measured ionized calcium in populations studied as a whole, but are generally poor predictors of true ionized hypo- or hypercalcemia in individual patients. International guideline committees in nephrology recommend frequent assessment of calcium levels in dialysis patients and recommend that these levels be kept within the normal reference range. These guidelines are less clear on which measurement of calcium should be used to guide clinical decision making. This review examines the merits of making any adjustment to the total calcium measurement, and suggests when it is appropriate to measure the ionized or free calcium.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^113HqmsY]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia represents a risk factor for medical treatment. It has long been known that patients in intensive care suffering from shock, infection, or trauma react inadequately to a renewed challenge like surgery. This has also been called the phenomenon of the second hit. 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131 Despite not always appreciating the precise cause of the connection with inflammation, many surgeons know that a low serum albumin level is a bad omen for outcome after surgery. 100, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138 The problem is apparently due to the preexistent inflammatory state, compromising a further adequate inflammatory response after surgery. To improve outcome, treatment should be directed primarily to decrease inflammation by eliminating the inflammatory cause. This is especially relevant when dealing with infection before embarking on a surgical approach. If this is impossible, eg, in the presence of generalized peritonitis or abscesses, acute surgical intervention is required. However, the surgical approach should be adapted, avoiding extensive oncologic surgery or the construction of hazardous intestinal anastomoses, but instead only trying to achieve "damage control". 100, 128, 139 This may include drainage of abscesses or removal of infected, damaged, or ischemic tissues. When this approach is successful, nutrition support becomes effective, promoting fat‐free mass (muscle) and adequate healing after eventual reoperation, for instance, to restore gastrointestinal continuity and to close the abdominal wall. 100, 139 It should be noted that with successful treatment of the cause of the inflammatory response, patients will lose weight due to reduction of edema and to fluid loss, but will regain function. In addition, full recovery and normo‐albuminemia will only be reached after months. A restorative reoperation should be postponed at least 6–12 weeks.

### Serum albumin levels: who needs them? [^117PNnGq]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this critical narrative review is to discuss common indications for ordering serum albumin levels in adult critically ill patients, evaluate the literature supporting these indications, and provide recommendations for the appropriate ordering of serum albumin levels.

Data Sources

PubMed (1966 to August 2020), Cochrane Library, and current clinical practice guidelines were used, and bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched for additional articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Current clinical practice guidelines were the preferred source of recommendations regarding serum albumin levels for guiding albumin administration and for nutritional monitoring. When current comprehensive reviews were available, they served as a baseline information with supplementation by subsequent studies.

Data Synthesis

Serum albumin is a general marker of severity of illness, and hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor patient outcome, but albumin is an acute phase protein, so levels vacillate in critically ill patients in conjunction with illness fluctuations. The most common reasons for ordering serum albumin levels in intensive care unit (ICU) settings are to guide albumin administration, to estimate free phenytoin or calcium levels, for nutritional monitoring, and for severity-of-illness assessment.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Because hypoalbuminemia is common in the ICU setting, inappropriate ordering of serum albumin levels may lead to unnecessary albumin administration or excessive macronutrient administration in nutritional regimens, leading to possible adverse effects and added costs.

Conclusions

With the exception of the need to order serum albumin levels as a component of selected severity-of-illness scoring systems, there is little evidence or justification for routinely ordering levels in critically ill patients.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^115qTVdr]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) — diagnostic accuracy and pretest probability impact: Across 15 studies evaluating serum CRP for detecting moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation, reported single-cutoff performance spanned 1.2–73 mg/L with summary sensitivity 63% (95% CI, 50%–75%) and specificity 77% (95% CI, 67%–84%). In a low pretest probability setting (rectal bleeding score 0 and stool frequency score 0 or 1, 15% prevalence), using elevated CRP (generally > 5 mg/L) yields approximately 5.5% false negatives with normal CRP (< 5 mg/L) and false positives of 19.5%. In an intermediate pretest probability setting (e.g., stool frequency score 2 or 3, 50% prevalence), elevated CRP (> 5 mg/L) has false positives of 11.5%.

### The long-term prognostic value of serum 25 (OH) D, albumin, and LL-37 levels in acute respiratory diseases among older adults [^115zNy2E]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant plasmatic protein and its widely used as indicator of malnutrition. Malnutrition again is associated with poor clinical outcome in many diseases such as cardiovascular disease. Hypoalbuminemia is prognostic factor for mortality among older adults. Low albumin levels are associated with worse recovery after acute pathologies and the inflammatory response of acute pathologies is known to decrease serum albumin level. Therefore, serum albumin level reflects patients inflammatory state and is associated to reduced longevity. Hypoalbuminemia among adults is defined as serum albumin level below 3.5 g/dL but levels under 2.5 g/dL are often considered clinically significant. Serum albumin level during hospital stay has been linked inversely to short term mortality risk. Even more intensive treatment for community acquired pneumonia patients with low serum albumin level have been suggested.

LL-37 is an important human antimicrobial peptide. It is produced from precursor protein from granulocytes. It acts as chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes, dendritic and T‐cells and is released by epithelial cell and leukocytes after infection. It is expressed in epithelia of the human lung where it may have antimicrobial activity at the airway surface. Serum 25(OH)D may have upregulating role of LL-37 in lung epithelium. Its antimicrobial effect is suggested taking place via viral membrane damaging. In vitro, LL-37 have shown antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). An elevation of serum LL-37 concentration has been shown in bacterial pneumonia compared with healthy subjects. There is some evidence that production of LL-37 is preserved among healthy older adults and Guo et al.have reported that LL-37 may have predictive value in 28-day survival among older adults sepsis patients. However, clinical studies concerning the significance of serum LL-37 levels among older adults are scarce.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113wq7gC]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Ceruloplasmin — interpretation for Wilson disease states that this 132-kDa glycoprotein contains six copper atoms per molecule and copper within ceruloplasmin accounts for 90% of circulating copper. Serum ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant and is elevated by acute inflammation and by hyperestrogenemia in pregnancy, estrogen supplementation, and use of some oral contraceptive pills. Physiologically, levels are very low in early infancy to the age of 6 months, peak in early childhood at approximately 30–50 mg/dl, then settle to the adult range. In Wilson disease, serum ceruloplasmin is decreased in most patients, but a value within the normal range does not exclude the diagnosis. A level typically below the laboratory determined lower level of normal (usually approximately 20 mg/dl) has been considered consistent with Wilson disease, and diagnostic if associated with KF rings. Other disorders associated with low ceruloplasmin include nonselective renal protein loss, protein-losing enteropathy, severe chronic liver disease with global hepatic synthetic defect, absolute copper deficiency, after gastric or bariatric surgery, and chronic ingestion of zinc in excess. As a screening or diagnostic test, serum ceruloplasmin has major limitations and may be particularly uninformative diagnostically in children.

Serum albumin and congestion assessment in HF — serum albumin levels should be checked routinely at HF admission, and peripheral edema should be interpreted with caution in the presence of hypoalbuminemia, which has been associated with up to 6-fold higher in-hospital mortality; reduced plasma oncotic pressure from hypoalbuminemia enhances extravascular fluid accumulation, for which overzealous diuresis may deplete intravascular volume and decrease renal function and blood pressure, particularly with nephrotic syndrome or chronic malnutrition.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency targeted testing and augmentation therapy: a Canadian Thoracic Society meta-analysis and clinical practice guideline [^111V5PX1]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency — testing pathway, thresholds, and indications for further testing are specified as follows: A simplified clinical testing pathway relies on 2 tests: measuring serum A1AT protein levels and DNA sequencing of the coding exons of SERPINA1, which should be considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of A1AT deficiency. Clinicians should be cognizant of the limitations of relying solely on measuring A1AT protein serum level, as the serum level of A1AT fluctuates over time during acute inflammation and the test-retest reproducibility of this measurement is weak. To account for variability, a cutoff of < 23 μmol/L (< 1.2 g/L) is previously proposed and described as not mandating further testing, although some authors have suggested a higher threshold considering that levels as high as 1.4 g/L may be reached during episodes of acute inflammation. There are clinical situations where further testing is recommended despite an A1AT protein level > 23 μmol/L (> 1.2 g/L), including early-onset COPD (before 40 years of age), low tobacco exposure (< 10 pack-years), pan lobular emphysema, or a familial history of COPD.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^116XSSHS]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Albumin is the most abundant protein in the human body and is synthetized exclusively by the liver. Therefore, serum albumin levels are reduced in acute and/or chronic liver disease. In cirrhosis, low levels of albumin predict the outcome. In advanced cirrhosis, the quality of albumin is decreased due to high oxidative stress and a proinflammatory state. Therefore, the administration of i.v. albumin would seem to be of pathophysiological relevance and benefit. Yet, the questions that remain are who, when, how much, and how often. While albumin infusion is recommended after large-volume paracentesis, at diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, in acute kidney injury, and in hepatorenal syndrome, the amount and schedule of albumin to be administered require refinement, particularly given complications related to volume overload that have become increasingly apparent. Other indications for albumin such as infections other than spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hyponatremia, HE, prevention of poor outcomes in hospitalized, and in outpatients with cirrhosis are still debated. The results of studies in these settings are either negative, controversial, or inconclusive. This sheds some doubts regarding the use of albumin as a "one size fits all" strategy. The indication and patient selection are crucial and not always intuitive. The amount and frequency also seem to play a role in the success or failure of albumin. This review will critically discuss the evidence and underline areas where there are indications for albumin use and others where evidence is still insufficient and will have to await the development/results of randomized controlled trials.

### Consensus statement: Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition: characteristics recommended for the identification and documentation of adult malnutrition (undernutrition) [^112uozAX]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Adult malnutrition (undernutrition) — diagnostic characteristics and measurement notes — state that "A minimum of 2 of the 6 characteristics above is recommended for diagnosis of either severe or nonsevere malnutrition". For the clinical characteristic "(6) Reduced grip strength", clinicians should "Consult normative standards supplied by the manufacturer of the measurement device"; in the table, nonsevere categories list "NA" and severe categories "Measurably reduced". Height and weight should be measured rather than estimated to determine body mass index (BMI), and usual weight should be obtained to determine the percentage and to interpret the significance of weight loss. The National Center for Health Statistics defines chronic as a disease/condition lasting 3 months or longer. Serum proteins such as serum albumin and prealbumin are not included as defining characteristics of malnutrition because recent evidence analysis shows that serum levels of these proteins do not change in response to changes in nutrient intake. Basic indicators of nutrition status such as body weight, weight change, and appetite may substantively improve with refeeding in the absence of inflammation. Refeeding and/or nutrition support may stabilize but not significantly improve nutrition parameters in the presence of inflammation.

### Nascent to novel methods to evaluate malnutrition and frailty in the surgical patient [^1138ePLb]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Laboratory markers

A position paper from the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) provided guidance on the use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers. Serum albumin has been historically considered a marker of surgical risk. However, the authors highlighted that serum albumin and prealbumin (transthyretin) concentrations are not components of updated malnutrition definitions, nor should they be used as a proxy to measure total body protein or muscle mass. Although serum albumin and prealbumin are not nutrition markers, their assessment could be useful as prognostic markers.

A recent study in medical inpatients at nutrition risk suggested that low concentrations of serum albumin at admission had prognostic implications and indicated higher mortality risk. However, this marker was not helpful in selecting patients for nutrition interventions, nor did a change in serum albumin concentration predict a response to nutrition therapy. As such, whether serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations can be used to monitor the delivery and efficacy of nutrition intervention is unclear, as serum albumin concentration may only improve when other inflammatory markers are stable. Improved serum albumin concentrations in a patient's clinical evaluation may indicate a number of possible scenarios such as improved nutrition status (reduced nutrition risk), reduced inflammation, correction of fluid shifts, transition to anabolism, and changes in energy and protein needs. However, in the short‐term, serum concentrations are more affected by inflammation and fluid balance than by malnutrition or nutrition repletion.

Muscle mass

As mentioned earlier, low muscle mass is prevalent in and significant to the surgical patient. Several tools can be used to assess muscle mass or its related compartments (fat‐free mass, lean soft tissue, terminology fully discussed elsewhere) (Figure 5). Body composition assessment is fundamental for the identification of hidden muscle abnormalities (Figure 6) and, hence, nutrition status. Low muscle mass can occur in spite of adequate, excessive, or stable body weight (ie, weight stability may mask unfavorable shifts in body composition).

### The human BDNF gene: peripheral gene expression and protein levels as biomarkers for psychiatric disorders [^1139na8h]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Consistent findings in clinical samples indicated the presence of low serum BDNF levels in depressed patients as compared with healthy subjects, suggesting that decreased peripheral levels of this gene could represent a 'state' characteristic of depression. This has been supported by several studies, including our study. Bus et al. performed a longitudinal study comparing serum BDNF levels at baseline and after 2 years in a large cohort of patients with persistent (n = 310), remitted (n = 420) or incident depression (n = 153), as compared with non-depressed controls (n = 868). They found a more profound decrease in serum BDNF levels in patients with persistent and remitted depression than in controls, whereas the incident depression group did not differ significantly from the non-depressed controls. On these bases, the authors suggested that the presence of reduced BDNF levels is a consequence of repeated episodes of depression rather than being the direct cause of depression development. Moreover, BDNF levels have been found even more reduced time after the onset of the illness, possibly reflecting the chronicity of the disorder.

In another interesting study, Molendijk et al. analyzed serum BDNF levels in 962 depressed patients, 700 fully remitted subjects (> 6 months) and 382 healthy controls in order to identify whether (i) abnormalities in BDNF persisted beyond the clinical state of depression; (ii) BDNF levels were related to the clinical features of depression; (iii) distinct antidepressants equally affected BDNF levels. The authors found low serum BDNF levels in antidepressant-free depressed patients compared with healthy controls. Moreover, data showed that serum BDNF levels were lower in depressed patients who were not on antidepressant medication compared with antidepressant-free subjects who were in full remission and that BDNF levels of this latter group were comparable to those of controls.

These data suggest that low protein levels of BDNF in the blood can be considered as a state characteristic for depression, whose levels normalize during pharmacological treatment also in relation to an amelioration of clinical symptoms.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^114kHxxy]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Effects of Nutrition Support and Serum Albumin Infusion

In the nutrition world, there is an ongoing debate whether inflammatory activity and function should be included in the definition of malnutrition. Although there is agreement that plasma albumin levels reflect inflammation and are a predictor of outcome, the use of serum albumin concentration as an inflammatory indicator is not supported by every nutrition society. Regardless of the outcome of this debate, in clinical practice it is essential to take inflammatory activity (eg, as indicated by hypoalbuminemia) and functional abilities into account because they predict increased risk of medical treatment and, consequently, should influence the art and extent of this treatment. 149 Decreased serum albumin levels are also associated with decreased life expectancy. 25 With increasing severity of inflammation, the effect of nutrition support on muscle protein mass and serum albumin level/synthesis decreases. This is especially relevant in the proinflammatory phase of acute trauma or infection. In this circumstance, it is becoming likely that nutrition support may even delay healing due to potential interference with clearance of damage. 150, 151, 152 In the proinflammatory phase, individuals are anorectic and do not tolerate nutrition support well, despite rapidly losing peripheral tissue protein in muscle, skin, and bone. In this case, it is urgent to install instantaneous treatment of the acute trauma or infection that initiates the proinflammatory phase of inflammation. Hereafter, in the anti‐inflammatory phase, nutrition support is efficacious, gradually promoting a net positive nitrogen balance at the whole‐body level, partly or completely due to rebuilding damaged tissue, while net loss of muscle protein mass is ameliorated. It is not completely clear when muscle, skin, and bone attain a truly positive protein balance. However, when muscle edema decreases, muscle function improves even when muscle size, solids, and composition have not yet regained their pre‐illness levels. Complete recovery of peripheral tissues, such as muscle, skin, bone, nails, hair, etc. will take months after the acute trauma or the start of critical illness.

### Prealbumin: a marker for nutritional evaluation [^117SDdCm]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Determining the level of prealbumin, a hepatic protein, is a sensitive and cost-effective method of assessing the severity of illness resulting from malnutrition in patients who are critically ill or have a chronic disease. Prealbumin levels have been shown to correlate with patient outcomes and are an accurate predictor of patient recovery. In high-risk patients, prealbumin levels determined twice weekly during hospitalization can alert the physician to declining nutritional status, improve patient outcome, and shorten hospitalization in an increasingly cost-conscious economy.

### Albumin in advanced liver diseases: the good and bad of a drug! [^115SRTKk]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Human serum albumin is the most abundant plasma protein, and it regulates diverse body functions. In patients with advanced and decompensated cirrhosis, serum albumin levels are low because of a reduction in the hepatocyte mass due to disease per se and multiple therapeutic interventions. Because of their oncotic and nononcotic properties, administration of human albumin solutions (HAS) have been found to be beneficial in patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis or who have hepatorenal syndrome or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Albumin also improves the functionality of the immune cells and mitigates the severity and risk of infections in advanced cirrhosis. Its long-term administration can modify the course of decompensated cirrhosis patients by reducing the onset of new complications, improving the quality of life, and probably providing survival benefits. There is, however, a need to rationalize the dose, duration, and frequency of albumin therapy in different liver diseases and stages of cirrhosis. In patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, potentially toxic oxidized isoforms of albumin increase substantially, especially human nonmercaptalbumin and 2, and nitrosoalbumin. The role of administration of HAS in such patients is unclear. Determining whether removal of the pathological and dysfunctional albumin forms in these patients by "albumin dialysis" is helpful, requires additional studies. Use of albumin is not without adverse events. These mainly include allergic and transfusion reactions, volume overload, antibody formation and coagulation derangements. Considering their cost, limited availability, need for a health care setting for their administration, and potential adverse effects, judicious use of HAS in liver diseases is advocated. There is a need for new albumin molecules and economic alternatives in hepatologic practice.

### Effects of higher-versus lower-protein diets on health outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116eZCev]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Our a priori primary outcomes were direct patient-important outcomes, including death, cardiovascular diseases, cancer diagnosis, new onset diabetes, renal disease, starting dialysis, bone health/fractures, quality of life and adverse events. However, we expected little information for these primary outcomes and a priori determined to accept surrogate outcomes of the primary outcomes, including body mass index (BMI), weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid levels (total cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL)), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum HbA1c, fasting serum blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, triglycerides, serum creatinine and bone mineral density. One investigator extracted data from eligible studies and a second verified the information using a standardised, pilot tested form, and resolved disagreement by discussion. We contacted authors via email up to two times to request data. Event rates and continuous data were collected by available case analysis when provided by the author and at the last follow-up time of a study.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^1178u2H9]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Visceral proteins as markers of nutrition status — serum albumin and prealbumin continue to be incorrectly cited as nutrition markers; because of the strong associations between inflammation and malnutrition, visceral proteins correlate well with patient risk for adverse outcomes while not specifically reflecting a patient's current nutrition state, and inflammatory markers are useful for determining nutrition risk by identifying those patients likely to be at an increased risk of poor outcomes if adequate nutrition is not delivered. Malnutrition may be characterized by the type of inflammation present: acute illness/injury or chronic illness, and relatively few patients in developed countries have starvation-associated malnutrition. Another common misconception is that serum albumin and prealbumin are markers of protein and muscle mass in body composition; in healthy patients these levels do not decline until BMI is < 12 after ≥ 6 weeks of starvation, with the same reported in elderly patients, and serum albumin and prealbumin levels are known to correlate poorly with nutrition intake. Pediatric data show similar overall findings, and although the visceral proteins retain correlations with inflammation, there is poor correlation with muscle mass or overall malnutrition assessments.

### A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines: nutrition support in adult acute and chronic renal failure [^1124Yo6c]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2010). Medium credibility.

Practice guidelines and rationales — nutrition assessment and inflammation in renal disease emphasize that patients with renal disease should undergo formal nutrition assessment, including evaluation of inflammation, with development of a nutrition care plan (Grade: D). Cross-sectional cohort observations of patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and Stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) link low serum albumin concentration with mortality, and patients with Stage V CKD have higher inflammatory cytokine levels than healthy control subjects; greater weight loss, lower serum albumin concentrations, and depressed appetite occur with inflammation. The trend in albumin concentration in Stage V CKD predicts mortality over 18 months, and evaluation of the serum protein status together with a marker of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) may help to identify patients at high risk for mortality and for whom nutrition support should be considered. Using Subjective Global Assessment with albumin < 3.8 g/dL to represent inflammation in Stage V CKD patients, 11% of patients had malnutrition alone with no inflammation and 18% had combined malnutrition and inflammation; while albumin is often a concomitant of inflammation, it is not a specific indicator, and the evaluation of inflammation is best carried out using multiple indicators.

Protein restriction in chronic kidney disease — In comparisons of low-protein diet (LPD) versus very low-protein diet (VLPD) plus ketoanalogues (KAs), the results "demonstrate the safety of dietary protein restriction over 2 to 3 years in patients with moderate to advanced CKD". Across arms, "both protein and energy intake declined. Serum albumin levels increased, while serum transferin levels, body weight, percent BF, and muscle area, and urine creatinine excretion declined". In a longitudinal body-composition study, "a VLPD plus KA induced a small decline in LBM on the average of 1.2 kg, with concomitant increase in FM, mainly in the first 3 months", whereas "Other short-term studies did not show noticeable effects of LPDs and VLPDs plus KAs on nutritional parameters". Clinically, prescribers "must regularly monitor and adjust protein and energy intake, body composition, and nutritional status", and "Energy needs may be different depending on the stage of CKD and its respective treatment (dialysis vs transplantation)".

### Admission serum albumin concentrations and response to nutritional therapy in hospitalised patients at malnutrition risk: secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^115oKi5k]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Historically, admission serum albumin concentrations have been considered useful biochemical markers for nutrition assessment. However, there is a lack of randomised trial data investigating whether low albumin concentrations are helpful for identifying patients benefitting from nutritional support.

Methods

This study was a secondary analysis of the EFFORT trial, a Swiss-wide multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing individualised nutritional support with usual care nutrition in medical inpatients from April 1, 2014, to February 1, 2018. 1389 of 2028 patients at nutritional risk with available albumin concentrations on admission were included. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 30 and 180 days. Patients were stratified into groups of low or normal albumin based on the albumin cut-off of 30 g/L. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02517476.

Findings

1389 patients (mean age, 73.1 (SD 3.5) years; 747 (53.8%) men) were included and 676 (48.7%) had low serum albumin concentrations at admission (< 30 g/L). Mortality at 180 days was significantly increased in the low albumin group compared with patients with normal albumin concentrations (219/676 (32.4%) vs. 162/713 (22.7%), fully adjusted HR 1.4, 95%CI 1.11 to 1.77, p = 0.005]. Effects of nutritional support on 30-day mortality were similar for patients with low compared to patients with normal albumin concentrations (HR 0.68, 95%CI 0.44 to 1.05 vs. HR 0.70, 95%CI 0.41 to 1.20), with no evidence for a subgroup effect (p for interaction = 0.97).

Interpretation

Based on this secondary analysis of a randomised trial, low admission serum albumin concentrations in hospitalised, non-critically ill, medical patients at nutritional risk had prognostic implications and indicated higher mortality risk but were not helpful in selecting patients for nutritional interventions.

Funding

The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) (PP00P3_150531) and the Research Council of the Kantonsspital Aarau (1410.000.058 and 1410.000.044) provided funding for the EFFORT trial.

### Changes in serum albumin concentrations over 7 days in medical inpatients with and without nutritional support. A secondary post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114EZgeH]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Historically, serum albumin concentration was considered to be a marker of nutritional status and physicians monitored albumin concentrations in patients during their hospital stay. This assumption was based on the pathophysiological grounds that albumin concentration reflects circulating proteins in plasma, with lower concentrations indicating nutritional deficiencies. However, it has been recognized for years that albumin as well as other visceral proteins (e.g. prealbumin) are markers of inflammation and correlate negatively with the severity of acute illness, but show little correlation with nutritional status. In fact, albumin should be considered a negative acute-phase-protein, with concentrations declining in acute and chronic illness due to hepatic reprioritization of protein synthesis and increased transcapillary escape of albumin. In addition, albumin concentrations can fluctuate with hydration status. Yet, in clinical practice, many physicians still continue to monitor albumin concentrations to evaluate the response to nutritional support although supporting studies have been lacking.

Malnutrition is a common condition among medical inpatients, with a prevalence of about 30%, and is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, disability, and higher health care costs. Several studies have shown that nutritional support reduces mortality as well as other adverse outcomes. Therefore, it is important to early identify patients who are nutritionally at risk and provide them with appropriate nutritional therapy to reduce risks for clinical deterioration and, perhaps, improve outcomes. Nutritional screening based on a validated screening tool is the first step to identify patients at risk of malnutrition. While screening tools are sensitive for diagnosis of malnutrition, they may not predict response to treatment. More specific clinical parameters and blood biomarkers are needed to allow a more personalized approach to malnourished patients as not all patients show the same response to nutritional interventions. Recent studies have suggested that some nutritional biomarkers of inflammation, kidney function and muscle health, among others, predict treatment response to nutritional interventions and may help to personalize treatments. We recently found albumin concentrations measured in patients at hospital admission to be helpful to predict clinical outcomes among patients at nutritional risk, but albumin was not helpful in predicting treatment response to nutritional intervention. Also, in the same trial, we measured prealbumin levels on admission, which has a shorter half-life as compared with albumin, but still only provided little information regarding nutritional treatment response. In addition to baseline levels of these visceral proteins at hospital admission, there is still insufficient evidence regarding the usefulness of short-term changes in albumin concentrations over time to predict treatment response.

### Human serum albumin in the clinical syndrome of heart failure [^1123xnwu]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2011). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is common in patients with heart failure, and this condition becomes more prevalent with increasing age and illness. Hypoalbuminemia is thought to result mainly from malnutrition, inflammation and cachexia. Other causal factors include hemodilution, liver dysfunction, protein-losing enteropathy, increased transcapillary escape rate, and nephrotic syndrome. According to Starling's law, low plasma oncotic pressure related to hypoalbuminemia induces a fluid shift from the intravascular to the interstitial space, and there is now clinical evidence that hypoalbuminemia facilitates the onset of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Hypoalbuminemia has emerged as an independent predictor of incident heart failure in end-stage renal disease and elderly patients. Recent data also suggest that hypoalbuminemia provides prognostic information incremental to the usual clinical and biochemical variables in patients with heart failure regardless of clinical presentation. The presence of hypoalbuminemia in patients with heart failure may have potential therapeutic consequence in clinical practice. If present, subclinical excess of fluid must be removed. A dietary survey should also be performed, and renutrition may be indicated. It is unknown whether targeted nutritional intervention and albumin administration confer benefits to hypoalbuminemic patients with heart failure, and further research is warranted in this setting.

### Admission serum albumin concentrations and response to nutritional therapy in hospitalised patients at malnutrition risk: secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^113rv9gM]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For decades, serum albumin concentration has been used as a surrogate marker to quantify the amount of circulating proteins in the plasma and was, thereby, thought to reflect nutrition status. For this reason, albumin was historically viewed as a nutrition marker and patients with low albumin concentrations were considered malnourished and in need of nutritional support interventions. However, these considerations were largely based on pathophysiological considerations and more recent data suggested that albumin is also a negative acute phase protein and may reflect inflammation/acute disease severity and not necessarily nutritional status only. Still, there is an important lack of data from randomised controlled trials investigating whether low albumin concentrations would be helpful for identification of patients benefitting from nutritional support.

Malnutrition is common among hospitalised elderly patients and is strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In the last few years, several trials and meta-analyses of such trials, have provided evidence that nutritional support reduces risks associated with malnutrition. The largest trial, the Effect of early nutritional therapy on Frailty, Functional Outcomes, and Recovery of malnourished medical inpatients Trial (EFFORT), included 2028 medical inpatients at nutritional risk and reported significant reductions in severe complications and mortality for patients receiving nutritional support as compared with patients in the control group receiving usual care hospital nutrition. While the overall population of medical inpatients did show benefit from nutritional support in this trial, it is possible that some patients experienced more or less benefit from this intervention allowing a more individualised approach to the patient at risk for malnutrition. In a previous analysis, we found that patients with high inflammation mirrored by high concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) at admission showed significantly less benefit from nutrition with significant results in interaction analysis. Whether other blood markers – including serum albumin – would also be helpful in identifying patients responding or not responding to nutritional support would be important to further advance nutritional care of the individual patient.

Herein, we performed a secondary analysis of EFFORT with the aim to better define the predictive role of admission albumin concentration in screening and assessment of patients regarding malnutrition. We first investigated the prognostic value of admission serum albumin concentrations and second studied associations of albumin concentrations with effectiveness of nutritional support, overall and within different subgroups.

### Serum albumin, inflammation, and nutrition in end-stage renal disease: C-reactive protein is needed for optimal assessment [^111Brkgv]. Seminars in Dialysis (2018). Low credibility.

Low serum albumin (S-Alb) is a frequent feature of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that independently predicts mortality. Serum albumin has mainly been considered a biomarker of visceral protein and immunocompetence status, fundamental to nutritional assessment. However, low S-albumin level is associated with persistent systemic inflammation and many bodies of evidence show that S-Alb has a limited role as a marker of nutritional status. We reported that a low S-Alb concentration was an independent risk factor for poor outcome in ESRD only in the presence of systemic inflammation. Moreover, the relationships between inflammatory biomarkers and outcome are confounded also by alterations in body composition (such as obese sarcopenia) and oxidative stress. Taken together, S-Alb alone should not be used as a proxy of the nutritional status in a dialysis patient. Its association with dietary intake is poor and low S-Alb values are most often non-nutritional in origin. When analyzing S-Alb to predict mortality risk in ESRD, it should always be combined with measurement of hsCRP.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^113Am6W5]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Visceral proteins and nutrition risk — The visceral proteins albumin and prealbumin must be correctly recognized as inflammatory markers associated with "nutrition risk" in nutrition assessment. The concepts of malnutrition and nutrition risk are distinct concepts that are often inappropriately interchanged in application. Serum albumin and prealbumin levels do not, however, serve as proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and are not useful monitoring parameters to guide nutrition support therapy. To identify these as markers of malnutrition is an oversimplification that should be avoided.

### Admission serum albumin concentrations and response to nutritional therapy in hospitalised patients at malnutrition risk: secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^113EH7Pt]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Historically, admission serum albumin concentrations have been considered useful biochemical markers for nutrition assessment. However, there is a lack of randomised trial data investigating whether low albumin concentrations are helpful for identifying patients benefitting from nutritional support.

Methods

This study was a secondary analysis of the EFFORT trial, a Swiss-wide multicentre, randomised controlled trial comparing individualised nutritional support with usual care nutrition in medical inpatients from April 1, 2014, to February 1, 2018. 1389 of 2028 patients at nutritional risk with available albumin concentrations on admission were included. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality within 30 and 180 days. Patients were stratified into groups of low or normal albumin based on the albumin cut-off of 30 g/L. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02517476.

Findings

1389 patients (mean age, 73.1 (SD 3.5) years; 747 (53.8%) men) were included and 676 (48.7%) had low serum albumin concentrations at admission (< 30 g/L). Mortality at 180 days was significantly increased in the low albumin group compared with patients with normal albumin concentrations (219/676 (32.4%) vs. 162/713 (22.7%), fully adjusted HR 1.4, 95%CI 1.11 to 1.77, p = 0.005]. Effects of nutritional support on 30-day mortality were similar for patients with low compared to patients with normal albumin concentrations (HR 0.68, 95%CI 0.44 to 1.05 vs. HR 0.70, 95%CI 0.41 to 1.20), with no evidence for a subgroup effect (p for interaction = 0.97).

Interpretation

Based on this secondary analysis of a randomised trial, low admission serum albumin concentrations in hospitalised, non-critically ill, medical patients at nutritional risk had prognostic implications and indicated higher mortality risk but were not helpful in selecting patients for nutritional interventions.

Funding

The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) (PP00P3_150531) and the Research Council of the Kantonsspital Aarau (1410.000.058 and 1410.000.044) provided funding for the EFFORT trial

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^1158KX7a]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being addressed repeatedly in the literature, there is still confusion regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and escape of serum albumin, leading to expansion of interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half-life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These 2 factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma. Hypoalbuminemia, therefore, results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy, and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels are adequate indicators, respectively, of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and as supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis. Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in the intensive care unit, which may imply that there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable to play scavenging and antioxidative roles. Management of hypoalbuminaemia should be based on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than infusion of albumin. After the age of 30 years, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity and associated with decreasing serum albumin levels. Nutrition support cannot fully prevent, but slows down, this chain of events, especially when combined with physical exercise.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^112uCmJ6]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia

Hypoalbuminemia (generally defined as a serum albumin concentration ≤ 30 g/l) is very common in critically ill patients, the main reasons probably being increased albumin losses from bleeding and via the gastrointestinal tract, increased capillary permeability leading to a redistribution from the intravascular to the interstitial space (previously called third-spacing), and dilution from intravenous fluid administration Moreover, in some patients – particularly older patients – baseline albumin levels may already be low as a result of poor nutritional status or altered liver function. Although animal models suggested that albumin synthesis may be reduced in critical illness, synthesis appears to be increased in critically ill humans.

Importantly, whatever the underlying mechanisms, hypoalbuminemia is associated with worse outcomes including increased complications and reduced short-term and longer-term survival in critically ill patients. In a meta-analysis of 90 cohort studies that had evaluated hypoalbuminemia as a prognostic biomarker in acutely ill patients, each 10 g/l decrease in serum albumin concentration was associated with a 137% increase in the odds of death, an 89% increase in morbidity, and a 71% increase in length of hospital stay. There is therefore a clear association between the albumin level and the severity of the insult, but it remains uncertain whether the effect of hypoalbuminemia on outcome is a cause–effect relationship or whether hypoalbuminemia is rather a marker of serious disease.

### Serum eosinophil cationic protein levels measured during exacerbation of asthma: characteristics of patients with low titres [^113mWAng]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels reflect ongoing eosinophilic airway inflammation and are used as a marker for asthma activity. ECP levels, however, may not be elevated in some asthmatic patients, even when they are symptomatic.

Objective

To clarify the characteristics of patients with 'low' ECP titres despite asthma exacerbation.

Methods

Serum ECP levels were measured in 113 asthmatic patients during exacerbation. Patients were divided into two groups according to ECP titre: a high ECP group (H; ECP ≥ 16.0 microg/L) and a low ECP group (L; ECP < 16.0 microg/L). Twenty-two patients who had recently received systemic steroids were excluded and the clinical features of the remaining patients in H (n = 54) and L (n = 37 were compared.

Results

Gender, atopic or smoking status, disease severity, inhaled steroid or theophylline usage, peak expiratory flow (% personal best) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (% predicted) did not significantly differ between the two groups. Patients in L were significantly older and had longer disease duration and lower serum IgE levels than those in H. Multivariate analysis combining age, disease duration and IgE levels showed that age and disease duration were independently associated with ECP level. Airway wall thickness, assessed in a subset of patients using computed tomography, was significantly larger in L.

Conclusion

Serum ECP levels in asthmatic patients may not be elevated during exacerbation and thus may not be a useful marker in patients who are older, have longer disease duration or possibly have thicker airway walls. Mechanisms other than eosinophilic inflammation, such as airway remodelling, may be involved in asthma exacerbation in these patients.

### Changes in serum albumin concentrations over 7 days in medical inpatients with and without nutritional support. A secondary post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^116CraRq]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, most patients in our study showed an absolute decrease in serum albumin concentrations in the short-term follow-up over 7 days. We assume that this was due to the acute disease of our patients with an increase in catabolism and the fact that human serum albumin has a half-life of about 19 days. Therefore, the 7-day-course of our analysis was too short and longer-term follow-up may show an increase in concentrations at a later time point when the acute disease and inflammation has resolved. It would have been interesting to also look into prealbumin kinetics over 7 days for comparison, which, however was not possible due to missing day 7 data for prealbumin.

We are aware of several strengths and limitations. To our knowledge, this analysis is among the first and maybe the most comprehensive study to look at changes in serum albumin concentrations in a large population of medical patients from a previous randomized trial with detailed information about nutritional intake and the resolution of the disease. In the 1980s Winkler et al. as well as Ota et al. found prealbumin to be a better indicator for response to short-term nutritional support than other visceral proteins including albumin, due to the shorter half-life, in patients undergoing surgery and those with cancer, respectively. Since then, most studies focused on prealbumin and other visceral proteins as monitoring-parameters for nutritional therapy and little attention has been paid to albumin. Unfortunately, we did not measure prealbumin concentrations over time, but only had admission levels measured in a subset of patients. Thus, it is not possible within this analysis to compare albumin to prealbumin regarding prognostic implications. Other important limitations include possible selection bias due to the underlying trial and because only patients with two albumin concentrations (baseline and day 7) were included. There is also risk for residual confounding although we did adjust our analysis for important confounders. Thus, we excluded some patients who died within the first week or were discharged home early. Also, with 763 patients, our study is larger compared to previous trials but may still be underpowered to find small differences in clinical response in patients with low and normal prealbumin levels. Overall, as a secondary analysis, our findings are hypothesis-generating and need validation in prospective studies.

### C-reactive protein and coronary heart disease: a critical review [^114TjJkV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Modestly elevated baseline concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute phase protein, are associated with the long-term risk of coronary heart disease in general populations, whilst the major acute phase response of CRP following myocardial infarction is associated with death and cardiac complications. The pathogenic and clinical significance of these associations is controversial. Here we critically review the evidence and describe large-scale epidemiological studies, novel experiments and possible specific therapies which will rigorously inform the debate. We distinguish between the potential pathogenicity of high acute phase circulating CRP concentrations in individuals with substantial tissue damage and modest but persistent increases in baseline values in generally healthy subjects.

### Serum albumin and prealbumin in calorically restricted, nondiseased individuals: a systematic review [^112VzfTb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Undernutrition is often suspected in patients when serum albumin or prealbumin levels are low. We asked whether these measures are indeed low in undernourished people if no inflammatory illness is present.

Methods

We did a systematic review to identify otherwise healthy subjects who were severely nutrient-deprived due to poor access to food or unwillingness to eat. We excluded children and pregnant women. We tabulated available measures of nutrient intake, anthropometry, serum albumin and prealbumin, and, when available, changes in these measures during nutritional intervention.

Results

In otherwise healthy subjects, serum albumin and prealbumin levels remained normal despite marked nutrient deprivation until the extremes of starvation, that is, body mass index < 12 or more than 6 weeks of starvation.

Conclusions

In these otherwise healthy subjects, serum albumin and prealbumin levels are not "markers of nutritional status". The "markers" failed to identify subjects with severe protein-calorie malnutrition until extreme starvation. That is, they failed to identify healthy individuals who would benefit from nutrition support, becoming abnormal only when starvation was already obvious. In contrast, serum albumin and prealbumin levels are known to fall promptly with injury or illness regardless of nutrient intake. They are negative acute-phase reactants. When these measures are low in sick patients, this cannot be assumed to reflect nutritional deprivation. Decisions about nutrition support should be based on evidence of meaningful benefit from this treatment rather than on assessment of "nutritional markers".

### Hypoalbuminemia in acute illness: is there a rationale for intervention? A meta-analysis of cohort studies and controlled trials [^111Nt5EN]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in the acutely ill, and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients.

Summary Background Data

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and, separately, of nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia.

Results

Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcome. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay respectively by 28% and 71%, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

Conclusions

Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients. In the interim, there is no compelling basis to withhold albumin therapy if it is judged clinically appropriate.

### Coronary artery disease prognosis and C-reactive protein levels improve in proportion to percent lowering of low-density lipoprotein [^112VNoBB]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

This editorial outlines the data supporting aggressive lipid goals and options for treating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to a range of approximately 30 to 70 mg/dl. The physiologically normal cholesterol range is approximately 30 to 70 mg/dl for native hunter-gatherers, healthy human neonates, free-living primates, and virtually all wild mammals. Randomized statin trials in patients with recent acute coronary syndromes and stable coronary artery disease have demonstrated that cardiovascular events are reduced and cardiovascular survival optimized when LDL cholesterol is reduced to < 70 mg/dl. Secondary prevention trials have shown a decrease in all-cause mortality in proportion to the magnitude of LDL cholesterol reduction. An original analysis of available data shows that the ability of a lipid-lowering therapy to reduce the C-reactive protein level is closely correlated with its efficacy in LDL cholesterol reduction. Randomized trial data have shown no relation between either percentage LDL cholesterol decrease or final LDL cholesterol level achieved and the risk for myopathy or hepatic transaminase elevations associated with statins. Therefore, intensive LDL cholesterol reduction to levels of 30 to 70 mg/dl should be pursued in subjects with or at high risk for coronary artery disease.

### Admission serum albumin concentrations and response to nutritional therapy in hospitalised patients at malnutrition risk: secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^115nUe4W]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Importantly, hypoalbuminaemia and an elevated CRP largely identify the same underlying metabolic response to injury and inflammation, but CRP is more sensitive and specific largely related to is short half-life of about 24–48 h and broad range. Albumin concentrations in response to inflammation have a long half-life of several weeks and may not be restored to normal until the stress response remits, and then only after several weeks. Furthermore, the serum albumin concentration is dramatically altered by a number of other variables not affecting CRP to the same degree, such as the state of hydration and underlying liver and renal function. It will be interesting in future studies to look at the value of prealbumin (transthyretin) concentrations, which have a much shorter half-life, to potentially guide nutritional support interventions.

Our report has strengths and limitations. To our knowledge, this is the first secondary analysis based on a randomised controlled clinical trial to investigate whether hypoalbuminemia is associated with effectiveness of nutritional support. Still, we focussed only on albumin concentrations and other biomarkers such as prealbumin could have shown different results. We excluded patients with no albumin measurements which may introduce selection bias. We also only focused on medical inpatients at nutritional risk and had some exclusion criteria in the original trial including surgical and critically ill patients limiting the generalisability of results. Also, it is likely that patients with the greatest inflammatory response (corresponding to high CRP concentrations and low albumin concentrations) may have been more difficult to feed due to the difficulty of feeding in the more acutely ill. This may explain some of the differences in improvements in outcomes in response to nutritional support seen patients with high vs. low levels of inflammation. Because this was a secondary analysis, our results are hypothesis generating rather than definite and require validation in an independent sample.

Based on this secondary analysis of a randomised trial, low admission albumin concentrations in hospitalised, non-critically ill, medical patients at nutritional risk had prognostic implications and indicated higher mortality risk, but were not helpful in selecting patients for nutritional support interventions.

### Higher circulating FGF21, lower protein intake, and lower muscle mass: associations with a higher risk of mortality [^114H1fC6]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that elevated circulating FGF21 concentrations are associated with low protein intake in a large cohort of the general population. Furthermore, a higher FGF21 concentration, lower protein intake, and lower muscle mass were each associated with increased risk of all‐cause mortality. The associations of FGF21 with mortality appears to be based on its function as a marker for low protein intake, as the association lost significance after adjusting for protein intake. Integrating FGF21 as a biomarker in clinical practice warrants further investigation. Its utility in detecting individuals at heightened risk of protein deficiency or adverse outcomes, particularly in the context of aging or chronic disease, could help guide preventive strategies and improve clinical outcomes.

### Accuracy and limitations of the diagnosis of malnutrition in dialysis patients [^117QfZWm]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

Uremic malnutrition, also known as protein-energy wasting (PEW), is a common phenomenon in maintenance dialysis patients and a risk factor for poor clinical outcomes including worse quality of life and increased hospitalization and mortality. The paradoxical association between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and better outcomes in dialysis patients also referred to as "reverse epidemiology", is a good example of the powerful effect-modifying impact of the nutritional status in this population. Measures of food intake, body composition tools, nutritional scoring systems, and laboratory values such as serum albumin are used to diagnose PEW and to assess the degree of severity of PEW without clearly validated diagnostic criteria. Some observational studies suggest that inflammation is a missing link between the PEW and poor clinical outcomes in dialysis patients, although PEW per se may also predispose to illness and inflammation. Ongoing debate as to whether such surrogates as serum albumin or prealbumin concentrations are markers of nutritional status, inflammation, comorbidity, or other conditions has led to confusion and diagnostic and therapeutic nihilism. Irrespective of the cause of hypoalbuminemia in dialysis patients, evidence suggests that nutritional interventions can increase serum albumin in dialysis patients. Hence, we should continue assessing serum albumin and other surrogates of nutritional status to risk-stratify patients and to allocate nutritional therapy, while well-designed, large-scale, randomized, controlled trials of the effects of nutritional intake on clinical outcomes are awaited.

In an asymptomatic cohort, serum pregnancy-associated protein-A (PAPP-A) levels among women destined to miscarry were 14% of those seen with ongoing pregnancies. Levels were as low 3 weeks before diagnosis as on the day of diagnosis, suggesting that PAPP-A levels might predict future miscarriage.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to serum ceruloplasmin and urinary copper excretion, AASLD 2022 guidelines recommend to recognize that an extremely low serum ceruloplasmin level (< 5 mg/dL) more strongly suggests a diagnosis of WD than modestly subnormal levels, but serum ceruloplasmin by itself is insufficient for making a diagnosis of WD. Do not exclude WD based on normal serum ceruloplasmin levels.

KDOQI Nutrition in CKD — laboratory measurements: In adults with CKD 1–5D or posttransplantation, biomarkers such as normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), serum albumin, and/or serum prealbumin (if available) may be considered complementary tools to assess nutritional status, but they should not be interpreted in isolation as they are influenced by non-nutritional factors (OPINION). In adults with CKD 5D on MHD, serum albumin may be used as a predictor of hospitalization and mortality, with lower levels associated with higher risk (1A).

### Association of prealbumin level with mortality in patients with acute kidney injury [^113wRA9M]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized patients, a population with a high prevalence of malnutrition. Pre-existing malnutrition is associated with adverse outcomes in patients with AKI. This Practice Point commentary discusses a study by Perez Valdevieso et al. that examined the association between serum prealbumin level and mortality in patients with AKI. Adjusted multivariate analyses showed that a serum prealbumin level below the group median (11 mg/dl) was independently predictive of in-hospital mortality and that for every 5 mg/dl increase in serum prealbumin level, in-hospital mortality decreased by 29%. A decreased serum prealbumin concentration at the time of renal consultation for AKI independently predicted poor prognosis. It is unknown whether this adverse prognostic association is primarily caused by malnutrition, a negative acute phase response to inflammation, transcapillary leak, or a combination of factors. Serum prealbumin levels may aid prognostic stratification and clinical decision making in AKI and should be included in future studies. There is no evidence that attempting to raise low prealbumin levels through aggressive nutritional support improves outcomes in AKI.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: a systematic review [^113qUWte]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Reduced synthetic function.

Up to 4% of patients with severe COVID-19 had reduced albumin levels. Studies have found lower albumin levels to be associated with a poorer prognosis (severe pneumonia, longer hospital stays, and higher mortality). This may be due to a direct effect of the virus on the liver or due to systemic inflammation in severe COVID-19. The low albumin levels may be due to switching off of albumin production by the liver, increased catabolism or loss of protein through the GI tract during COVID-19. Thus, the low albumin level mentioned in the studies should not be considered a direct marker of reduced liver function. As histological data do not suggest severe hepatic injury, it would be unlikely that low albumin is mainly contributed by hepatic dysfunction. Prothrombin time (PT) has been suggested as a predictive factor for clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The survival rate is significantly lower in patients with prolonged PT. Baranovskii et al. found significantly prolonged admission PT in ICU-transferred patients compared with stable COVID-19 patients. Such findings may be due to systemic inflammation–related coagulopathy rather than reduced hepatic function.

Raised gamma-GT levels.

Elevations of serum GGT levels point to the presence of cholangiocyte injury, and are observed in a sizeable proportion of those with severe COVID-19. Elevation of GGT in association with a rise in ALP would suggest cholestasis. The need for ICU care and reduced survival was observed in COVID-19 patients with a cholestatic pattern of hepatic injury.

### Low transthyretin concentration linked to adverse prognosis in elderly inpatients [^116Xk8dt]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Low transthyretin concentration is associated with adverse outcomes in elderly inpatients, with a gender-specific difference that is particularly pronounced in men. Clinicians should consider incorporating transthyretin levels into the comprehensive prognostic assessment of elderly inpatients, alongside other clinical and laboratory parameters. Identifying patients at higher risk due to low transthyretin levels, especially male patients, allows for early interventions that may potentially improve clinical outcomes.

### The relationship between perioperative serum albumin and contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients after percutaneous coronary intervention [^112Pzbzh]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Albumin is the major protein of human plasma. Plasma albumin has many physiological properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and anti-platelet aggregation activity. Low serum albumin concentrations may be caused by liver damage during acute inflammation or increased renal excretion, malnutrition, increased catabolism, intestinal loss, severe volume overload, and escape to interstitial spaces. Low serum albumin levels are independently associated with the development of various diseases, such as e myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke, CI-AKI, hip fracture, and malignancy. In patients with acute coronary syndrome, the serum albumin levels are significantly lower in those with CI-AKI than in those without CI-AKI, and the serum albumin level is an independent predictor of CI-AKI. Preprocedural levels of prealbumin were independently associated with an increased risk of CI-AKI and long-term mortality in elderly patients undergoing elective PCI. As indicators of nutritional status and inflammatory factors, perioperative albumin levels and postoperative effects were explored. Several previous studies have shown that perioperative albumin levels are significantly associated with postoperative complications, such as myocardial infarction, in patients with malignancies, including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and lung cancer, and in noncancer patients. Similarly, the relationship between perioperative albumin levels and adverse outcomes after abdominal surgery has been discussed.

However, there are few studies on the relationship between perioperative serum albumin (delta albumin or &Alb) and the occurrence of CI-AKI in patients with coronary heart disease after PCI. The present study was designed to examine the correlation between &Alb and CI-AKI in patients who underwent PCI.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^114Nt2hB]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

ASPEN position paper — visceral proteins and nutrition assessment states that serum albumin and prealbumin characterize inflammation rather than describe nutrition status or protein-energy malnutrition, and that there is an association between inflammation and malnutrition, not between malnutrition and visceral-protein levels. These proteins correlate with patients' risk for adverse outcomes rather than with protein-energy malnutrition. Therefore, serum albumin and prealbumin should not serve as proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and should not be used as nutrition markers.

### Serum heat shock protein 27 levels predict cardiac mortality in hemodialysis patients [^116tdFAw]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Decreased heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) participates in many processes that are involved in cardiovascular (CV) disease. The objective of the study was to evaluate if HSP27 level was predictive of mortality as well as to evaluate factors associated with HSP27 level in a group of patients treated with HD.

Methods

Enrolled to the study were 202 HD patients. Clinical data, biochemical, echocardiographic, and carotid atherosclerosis parameters were evaluated. Patients were splited into groups on the basis of the cut-off lower and higher 50th percentile of serum HSP27 levels, and were followed-up for 28.68 ± 6.12months.

Results

No significant difference was observed between serum HSP27 levels in patients and controls. Low HSP27 patients were older, had higher left ventricular mass index, lower ejection fraction, higher prevalence of diabetes, myocardial infarction and carotid atherosclerosis, higher C-reactive protein level, and worse oxidant/antioxidant status. The multiple regression analysis identified that HSP27 levels were independently, negatively associated with serum oxidized LDL and the number of carotid plaques. Using the Kaplan-Meier analysis it was shown that the cumulative incidences of both CV and sudden cardiac death (SCD) mortality were higher in low HSP27 group in comparison with high serum HSP27 group. A multivariate Cox analysis showed that HSP27 level is an independent and strong predictor of CV as well as SCD mortality.

Conclusions

Low serum HSP27 level is independently associated with both CV and SCD mortality but not with all-cause mortality. Low serum HSP27 level is associated with carotid atherosclerosis and oxidative stress.

Correlation between IL-29 levels and clinical characteristics of CHD patients

The median value of serum IL-29 levels in CHD patients was used to classify CHD patients into IL-29 high-level and low-level groups to further analyze the correlation between serum IL-29 levels and clinicopathological characteristics of CHD patients. The results noted no significant correlation of serum IL-29 levels with age, gender, BMI, hypertension, TC, TG, HDL-c, LDL-c, smoking, alcohol consumption, and diabetes in CHD patients (all P > 0.05), whereas there were significant correlations with SNYTAX scores and CRP levels in CHD patients (all P < 0.05) (Table 2).

### Low serum albumin: a significant predictor of reduced survival in patients with chronic heart failure [^113nVKfU]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Heart failure (HF) has emerged as a major epidemic and is a significant public health burden. It is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. 1 There are numerous clinical parameters that predict clinical outcome. Albumin, a standard clinical parameter that is associated with multiple parameters affecting outcome including nutritional, inflammatory, and volume status of HF patients, should have a significant impact on clinical outcome in these patients. Despite this, there is limited and conflicting evidence in the literature regarding this parameter as an important predictor of outcome in chronic HF. 2, 3, 4 We hypothesized that this parameter would have a significant impact on clinical outcome in patients with chronic HF. We evaluated the impact of serum albumin levels on clinical outcome in a large real‐world cohort of patients with chronic HF.

### Extended phenytoin sodium [^11457ZsV]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Optimum control without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum levels between 10 and 20 mcg/mL, although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin.

In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, congenital enzyme deficiency, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin plasma levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal.

Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but more importantly by tubular secretion. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high plasma levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more.

### Serum albumin and white matter hyperintensities [^115W5j19]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

People living with HIV relative to healthy control individuals commonly have low serum albumin levels that are prognostic for disease severity and rate of progression. In individuals diagnosed with alcohol use disorders (AUD), low serum albumin levels are observed generally in the context of liver disease. Additionally, individuals with HIV and AUD comorbidity have high rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, which can independently lower serum albumin.

Hypoalbuminemia (i.e. low serum albumin) occurs in liver cirrhosis, kidney disease, and malnutrition among other diagnoses due to mechanisms such as decreased liver synthesis, increased urinary excretion, or increased catabolism. Low serum albumin levels can predict cardiovascular incidents (e.g. coronary artery disease, myocardial infarctions, heart failure, arrhythmias) and stroke after consideration of traditional risk factors such as body mass index (BMI), nicotine use, diabetes, and hypertension. Low albumin may promote cardiovascular disease via decreased intravascular oncotic pressure, or mechanisms involving increased oxidative stress (i.e. decreased scavenging) or inflammation.

### Low serum albumin: a significant predictor of reduced survival in patients with chronic heart failure [^113LpD5g]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this cohort of real‐world HF patients, low albumin level was a significant predictor of death as well as death and cardiovascular hospitalizations. This direct inverse relationship between albumin and clinical outcome appears to be relevant across the whole spectrum of albumin levels. Moreover, the present study suggests that a decrease in albumin over time conveys additional predictive value with a significant negative impact on clinical outcome.

Albumin is a hepatic synthesized protein that is associated with numerous detrimental biological processes that are present in HF and pertain to a worse outcome. 9 Low albumin in HF patients may be due to volume overload causing hemodilution, a chronic inflammatory state, liver congestion, malnutrition and cachexia, all causing decreased synthesis of albumin, and less commonly, protein loss due to proteinuria or enteropathy. Conversely, low albumin has a negative impact on several clinical aspects of HF. Albumin has an important role in numerous physiological processes including maintaining colloid osmotic pressure and microvascular integrity, ligand‐binding and transport of substances, antioxidant and antithrombotic functions, and enzymatic activities. 10 Low albumin in HF promotes and aggravates congestion due to reduced intravascular colloid osmotic pressures, 11 increases oxidative stress, 12 inflammation, 10 and the susceptibility to infections. Therefore, low albumin is a summation of numerous deleterious factors in HF patients and would be expected to give important prognostic information in HF. Despite this, there is sparse data in the literature regarding this parameter as a prognostic factor in chronic HF.

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in symptomatic active Crohn's disease (CD) — Per 1000 patients tested (95% confidence interval [CI]) using the test result "Elevated CRP", mild symptoms (prevalence 65%) yield true positives 436 (351–501), false negatives 214 (149–299), true negatives 256 (227–280), and false positives 94 (70–123), whereas moderate-severe symptoms (prevalence 80%) yield true positives 536 (432–616), false negatives 264 (184–368), true negatives 146 (130–160), and false positives 54 (40–70). GRADE certainty of evidence is reported as VERY LOW for both columns on one row and VERY LOW (mild) versus LOW (moderate-severe) on the second grade row. Comments specify that true positives "would be eligible to undergo treatment adjustment", false negatives "may be falsely reassured", true negatives "would be reassured and obviate the need for invasive testing with endoscopy", and false positives "may undergo unnecessary treatment adjustment".

### Postinduction serum infliximab trough level and decrease of C-reactive protein level are associated with durable sustained response to infliximab: a retrospective analysis of the ACCENT I trial [^111kd8PJ]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Significance of this study

What is already known about this subject?
Detectable serum infliximab trough levels are indicative of durable sustained response.
Antibodies to infliximab are associated with a loss or reduction of clinical benefit.
Normalisation of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels is associated with the likelihood of durable sustained response.
What are the new findings?
Patients with baseline immunomodulator use and durable sustained response to 5 mg/kg infliximab maintenance had significantly higher early median serum infliximab trough levels than patients who lost response.
Optimal cut-off values, for example, a ≥ 3.5 µg/mL postinduction serum infliximab trough level and a ≥ 60% CRP decrease from baseline to week 14, significantly predicted durable sustained response to infliximab 5 mg/kg maintenance in patients with raised baseline CRP.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
Measurement of serum infliximab trough levels and the decrease in CRP soon after induction may be indicative of durable sustained long-term response without dose escalation and potentially guide dose increases to sustain responses in patients with low trough levels or inadequate CRP responses.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency diagnostic testing — The panel "felt strongly that individuals with A1AT deficiency should be sought and diagnosed", and "we suggest initial measurement of serum A1AT levels, followed by genetic testing with DNA sequencing of the coding regions of the SERPINA1 gene if A1AT level is < 23 μmol/L (< 1.2 g/L). (Conditional recommendation; low quality evidence)". For high clinical suspicion, "we favored DNA sequencing of the coding exons of the SERPINA1 gene rather than targeted genotyping, as the latter can only test for a limited number of known mutations", whereas "when the clinical suspicion is not as strong, measuring serum level of A1AT protein is suggested, followed by genetic testing if the A1AT level is low". If relying only on targeted panels, "clinicians must be aware that very rare or previously unknown deficiency genotypes may go undetected", and "clinicians should work collaboratively with the laboratory to obtain DNA sequencing", noting that "DNA sequencing is used by most laboratories in Canada as a secondary step only if a suspected deficiency remains unexplained by targeted genotyping of known deficiency genes".

### Determination of effective albumin in patients with decompensated cirrhosis: clinical and prognostic implications [^111AHoxM]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Human albumin is the most abundant protein in the vascular compartment, representing more than half of total plasma protein content. It accounts for ~70%‐80% of total plasma oncotic pressure, thus resulting as the main modulator of fluid distribution among the body compartments. Albumin also exerts many other biological properties unrelated to its oncotic power: It binds, transports, and detoxifies many endo‐ and exogenous molecules, is the major circulating antioxidant, modulates immune and inflammatory responses, and contributes to endothelial stabilization and vascular integrity.

Whereas albumin oncotic power derives from highly conserved features across persons, such as its high molecular weight and negative net charge, the nononcotic properties are strictly related to its peculiar molecular structure, which presents a high degree of microheterogeneity and is affected by physio‐ and pathological processes.

Hypoalbuminemia has long been considered a cardinal feature of decompensated cirrhosis resulting from several events, such as reduced synthesis by hepatocytes, shorter total half‐life attributable to increased catabolism, and dilution attributable to total plasma volume expansion. Low serum albumin concentration, measured by routine laboratory methods, has been consistently shown to be a good prognostic indicator of both mortality and morbidities in decompensated cirrhosis.

In decompensated cirrhosis, besides quantitative changes, circulating albumin undergoes an extensive damage of its molecular structure because of underlying systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Reversible and irreversible oxidation of the cysteine‐34 (Cys‐34) residue, the main antioxidant site of the molecule, as well as nonoxidative alterations, including truncation of the C‐ and N‐ terminal portion of the molecule or glycation, are increased in advanced cirrhosis and correlate with disease severity and patient outcomes. Because of the accumulation of these molecular alterations, the proportion of the molecule with a fully preserved structure, the "native" albumin isoform, declines in parallel with the progression of cirrhosis. Consequently, albumin functions (i.e. binding and detoxification capacity, antioxidant function, and ability to chelate metal ions) decline in parallel with increasing severity of disease.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^115uMAPo]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Multiple myeloma — parameters and assays for response assessment: All measurable parameters need to be followed, including light and heavy chain analysis (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high, benefit outweighs harm; Strength of recommendation: strong). Disease response assessment in myeloma includes evaluation of the level of protein in the blood or urine, the proportion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (or in the peripheral blood in the case of plasma cell leukemia), and, if present, the size of plasmacytoma assessed on imaging or clinical examination. The level of monoclonal protein in the blood has traditionally been measured using serum protein electrophoresis, and in the setting of certain immunoglobulins such as IgA, which can be difficult to quantify, the quantitation by nephelometry can be used in place of serum protein electrophoresis. In patients with predominantly light chain monoclonal protein, the serum free light chain assay can be used, and in patients with very low levels of monoclonal protein immunofixation with isotype-specific antibodies can detect presence of the monoclonal protein. In the urine, monoclonal protein can be measured using electrophoresis, but formal quantitation requires a 24-hour urine sample with assessment of total protein and M-protein levels. The IMWG guidelines provide the specific minimum thresholds for measurable parameters; in general, if there is measurable serum monoclonal protein then it should be followed, otherwise a measurable urine monoclonal protein should be followed, and serum free light chain levels should also be followed in addition to serum protein electrophoresis.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^111nSY5Z]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

The Pathophysiology Underlying Hypoalbuminemia

Hypoalbuminemia is largely a function of increased vascular permeability and increased interstitial volume. In this section we will discuss the role of inflammation in mediating these responses, not only in pathologic states, but also in life events such as pregnancy, lactation, and cancer growth.

Inflammation, Increased Capillary Permeability, and Hypoalbuminemia

Increased vascular permeability for cells and plasma solutes is a universal reaction in trauma, critical illness, chronic disease, life events, multiple or isolated organ failure, and cancer. This response is evident in circumstances including edema in healing wounds and the necessity to maintain intravascular volume by "overhydrating" traumatized or postsurgery patients. Adequately resuscitated patients are maintained in a positive fluid balance of 5–10 liters after clean elective major surgery or other types of trauma. 4 Fluid resuscitation is necessary in these circumstances to avoid hypovolemia and the development of shock. The same happens in children after burns, where fluid balance is positive despite the effort to prevent overhydration. 5 The fact that fluid retention inevitably and visibly occurs in wounds as well as at the whole‐body level after trauma and burns could reflect that this response is beneficial to some extent, but may become harmful when the inflammatory stimulus cannot be adequately overcome or treated. 6, 7 In wounds, virtually every type of immune cell appears, producing cytokines and growth factors that support the healing process. Increased cytokine expression does not only happen after trauma or infection, but also in physiologic states including pregnancy and other situations where increased cell proliferation and matrix deposition are required. 8, 9, 10

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^1161Vyws]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Inflammatory states invariably induce hypoalbuminemia as a consequence of increased capillary escape of serum albumin and other plasma solutes into the interstitium and into cells. This is associated with an increased volume of fat‐free mass due to increased total water content of serum, interstitium, and, possibly, cells. In longstanding conditions, blood volume may be normal, but plasma volume increases due to diminished red cell mass. Together, fat‐free mass constitutes by far the largest part of the distribution volume of albumin leading to hypoalbuminemia. Whereas the FSR of albumin in plasma is increased in hypoalbuminemia, absolute synthesis rates may not increase due to a shorter turnover time and/or fecal/urinary losses of albumin, which have a lowering influence on whole body albumin mass. As a result, the drop in serum albumin concentration may not be compensated by the increase in the FSR of serum albumin.

An increase in serum albumin FSR appears to be a beneficial response in inflammatory conditions in which an immune response, cell proliferation, tissue healing, and growth are required. Here, albumin plays a scavenging and antioxidative role in the interstitial space. In cells, albumin can also be degraded at an accelerated rate, providing amino acids as building blocks for cell proliferation and matrix deposition.

Low serum albumin levels are, therefore, an indicator of the severity of inflammation. Preexisting inflammation is an important factor interfering with the success of medical and surgical treatment, diminishing the adequacy of the response to trauma and disease and reducing quality of life and longevity. In critical illness, spontaneous rises or decreases in serum albumin levels and the accompanying shrinking (weight loss) or increasing (weight gain) total body water, are valuable indicators, respectively, of recovery or deterioration of health. It is unlikely that low serum albumin levels represent a true deficit and, therefore, albumin infusion is unlikely to be beneficial. Moreover, hypoalbuminemia is not a primary indication for nutrition therapy. The focus of treatment should primarily be directed toward treating the inflammatory cause, although a substantial proportion of hypoalbuminemic individuals are also undernourished and require nutrition support. In the proinflammatory phase of trauma or critical illness, nutrition may not be beneficial, but more research is required.

Other plasma proteins have also been promoted as markers of inflammation. C‐reactive protein (CRP) is a true acute‐phase protein rising within 10 hours to plasma levels > 100 mg/L after major surgery or acute sepsis. CRP is present in very low concentrations in healthy individuals but strongly upregulated, stimulated by IL‐6 and NO rising immediately after trauma or infection. There is a close inverse correlation between increases in CRP and decreases in serum albumin levels after 48 hours in well‐resuscitated septic or traumatized patients. Thereafter, CRP drops quickly after 3–4 days to low, but still modestly increased, levels if the proinflammatory phase is successful. 147 In this phase, plasma CRP level is primarily an indicator of the severity of the primary insult, initiating innate immunity to clear tissue debris and microorganisms and their products. 148 Thereafter, in the anti‐inflammatory phase, CRP is neither a precise indicator of the severity of the metabolic response, nor a very precise indicator of whether there is improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. 147 Only in the presence of renewed or unrelenting tissue damage, CRP will steeply increase or remain strongly elevated. Plasma albumin is a constitutive protein, required in health and disease. After an initial steep drop, plasma albumin levels continue to decrease modestly until 3–7 days after operation, when they start to increase slowly in the case of clinical recovery. 4 Normal levels may only be reached after 3–4 months, reflecting the anti‐inflammatory phase promoting wound healing and tissue rebuilding and remodelling.

### Insights into the abnormalities of chronic renal disease attributed to malnutrition [^113x4ePe]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2002). Low credibility.

Low values of serum proteins and loss of lean body mass are commonly found in patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) and especially in dialysis patients. These abnormalities have been attributed to malnutrition (i.e., an inadequate diet), but available evidence indicates that this is not the principal cause. In contrast, there is persuasive evidence that secondary factors associated with the CRI condition cause abnormalities in protein turnover and ultimately result in low serum protein levels and loss of lean body mass. Recent reports have identified some factors that could interfere with the control of protein turnover in CRI patients, including acidosis, inflammation, and/or resistance to anabolic hormones. Each of these stimulates protein breakdown in muscle and activates a common proteolytic pathway, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, acidosis or inflammation suppress hepatic albumin synthesis. Understanding the biochemical mechanisms that regulate the ubiquitin-proteasome and other catabolic pathways are required to identify new strategies for preventing protein deficits that are associated with CRI.

### What should define optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease? [^113Byfax]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

Correction of metabolic acidosis is an important goal in the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, there is no consensus as to what constitutes an optimal correction of metabolic acidosis in this setting - various expert groups from around the world have set different goals for serum bicarbonate levels for patients with CKD. Accumulating evidence seems to indicate that achieving an arterial pH closer to the upper limit of the reference range may have even greater benefits than maintaining the arterial pH closer to the lower limit of the reference range. This benefit seems to be particularly relevant for patients with protein-energy wasting and we present a review of the evidence that supports this argument. Routine measurement of arterial pH, however, is not feasible in clinical practice; using the Henderson equation, a high-normal arterial pH is generally expected to be associated with a serum bicarbonate level of 24–30 mEq/l and should be the therapeutic goal for chronic kidney disease patients with protein-energy wasting.

### Serum transferrin as a biomarker of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha activity and hepatocyte function in liver diseases [^112KYd1q]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The liver is the largest gland of the human body, and accordingly, liver hepatocytes synthesize the majority of serum proteins. Accordingly, the levels of these proteins are diminished in advanced liver disease as they reflect the loss in hepatocytes. Apart from that, the protein synthesis within hepatocytes is subject to a complex regulation by liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs). Hepatocyte nuclear factors constitute prototypical LETFs and regulate the production of multiple liver-specific proteins. During stress situations, various cytokines such as interleukins 1 and 6 or tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) induce the synthesis of species known as acute-phase proteins (APPs) and diminish the production of negative APPs. Albumin or transferrin are characteristic negative APPs. Serum levels of negative APPs constitute attractive biomarkers reflecting both the hepatocellular mass and the amount of superimposed systemic stress or inflammation. In particular, transferrin emerges as a mortality predictor in sepsis and multiple liver disorders.

A defective hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4α)-dependent gene expression was identified as a driver of hepatocellular failure.

Transferrin is one the most abundant serum proteins produced and secreted by the hepatocytes and serves as a chaperone capable of binding and transporting intestine-absorbed and metabolism-derived iron to other cells and tissues. Its concentration in the serum is approximately 200–300 mg/dl, but decreased levels are seen during inflammation and hepatic dysfunction. Particularly low serum transferrin values occur in individuals with sepsis or acute-on-chronic liver failure. In critically ill patients and individuals with decompensated liver cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH), or acute liver failure, low transferrin levels associate with increased mortality. Notably, this association is independent of established predictive scores such as Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, markers of liver synthesis or inflammation.

While transferrin represents an attractive adjunct to the existing prognostic scores, the biological mechanisms underlying its predictive power remain unclear. Here, we studied the mechanisms regulating transferrin production in individuals with advanced liver disease and AH and show that serum transferrin levels reflect the hepatic activity of HNF4α. Thus, transferrin constitutes both a prognostic and a mechanistic biomarker and an attractive surrogate for therapeutic trials aiming to preserve HNF4α signaling as a tool to prevent the development of liver failure.

Serum C-reactive protein — certainty of evidence for rule-out and rule-in: There was very low certainty of evidence supporting normal serum CRP to rule out moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation in a low pretest probability setting, downgraded for inconsistency and very serious imprecision because the point estimate is higher than the maximal tolerable false negative rate. Similarly, in intermediate pretest probability settings, there was very low certainty for normal CRP to rule out due to unacceptably high false negatives and inconsistency, and very low certainty for elevated CRP to rule in in low and intermediate settings due to unacceptably high false positives and inconsistency.

### ASPEN-FELANPE clinical guidelines [^1111U4ef]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) — serum protein markers and outcomes are described as follows: "it is now accepted that the measures lack sensitivity and specificity in making a diagnosis of malnutrition", yet "low serum protein concentrations may have prognostic significance". In one retrospective study, increased serum albumin after PN was associated with less drainage and improved spontaneous closure, and "The odds of spontaneous fistula closure were 18.1-fold greater when the serum albumin improved compared with no improvement". By contrast, "in a large cohort of 277 patients, serum albumin was not found to be an independent predictive factor", confirmed in "79 patients with ECF". Predictors included transferrin, as "higher serum transferrin concentration did predict spontaneous closure", and low transferrin, retinol binding protein, and prealbumin predicted mortality. Among patients receiving PN with improved albumin and "ECF output < 500 mL/d, 93.3% had spontaneous closure compared with 70% failure to close among patients with low serum albumin concentrations and ECF output ≥ 500 mL/d".

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^1125fjEn]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

Visceral proteins in monitoring nutrition support efficacy — interpretation and guidance: In a large urban medical center analysis, serum prealbumin levels correlated only with inflammation and did not reflect the delivery of adequate energy and protein, and similar results were reported in patients receiving enteral nutrition; consequently, serum prealbumin and other visceral proteins have not been shown to be sensitive markers of energy and protein intake adequacy and, therefore, should not be a guide for therapeutic changes. The return of serum albumin and prealbumin levels to normal ranges may still have value in the monitoring of recovery, and normalization of visceral proteins may indicate the resolution of inflammation, the reduction of nutrition risk, a transition to anabolism, and potentially lower calorie and protein requirements.

### Hypoalbuminemia: a new risk factor for progression in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance [^114G88nQ]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have advanced the understanding of the pathogenesis of monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS), describing the influence of a proinflammatory bone marrow environment on the risk of progression. While albumin is a known inflammatory prognostic biomarker in multiple myeloma, its role in MGUS has not been explored. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the prognostic value of albumin in MGUS. Eight hundred and thirty-eight patients with MGUS were included: 71 (8.5%) presented hypoalbuminemia (≤ 3.5g/dL) at diagnosis. Hypoalbuminemia was more common in men (63.4% vs. 49.3%; P = 0.025), older age (≥ 70 years: 74.6% vs. 57.2%; P = 0.005), and IgA isotype (33.8% vs. 21.4%; P = 0.018). These patients presented lower hemoglobin levels and higher creatinine values (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001). Serum M protein ≥ 1.5g/dL (HR 18.9 [95% CI, 1.8–200.8]; P = 0.015) and hypoalbuminemia (HR 14.7 [95% CI, 1.7–124.7]; P = 0.014) were identified as independent prognostic factors for progression. In our series, Mayo Clinic and MGUS-like phenotype models were validated, and the incorporation of hypoalbuminemia into these models helped identify a subgroup of intermediate-risk patients with a higher risk of progression. In conclusion, if confirmed by independent studies, hypoalbuminemia could be integrated into existing prognostic models, improving risk stratification and guiding clinical decision-making.

### The use of visceral proteins as nutrition markers: an ASPEN position paper [^112pWRHm]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2021). High credibility.

ASPEN position on visceral proteins — executive summary states that serum albumin and prealbumin are not components of currently accepted definitions of malnutrition, and that serum albumin and prealbumin do not serve as valid proxy measures of total body protein or total muscle mass and should not be used as nutrition markers. It adds that the serum concentrations of albumin and prealbumin decline in the presence of inflammation, regardless of underlying nutrition status, and that serum albumin and prealbumin declines must be recognized as inflammatory markers associated with "nutrition risk" in the context of nutrition assessment rather than with malnutrition per se, with nutrition risk broadly defined as the risk of developing malnutrition and/or poor clinical outcomes if nutrition support is not provided. It further notes that the role of serum albumin and prealbumin in monitoring delivery and efficacy of nutrition support remains undefined and that their normalization may indicate the resolution of inflammation, the reduction of nutrition risk, a transition to anabolism, or potentially lower calorie and protein requirements.

### Detection and prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a study utilizing mass spectrometry-based monoclonal immunoglobulin rapid accurate mass measurement [^114whWAv]. Blood Cancer Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant plasma cell disorder that is present in ~3–4% of the general population over the age of 50 –. It is associated with a risk of progression to multiple myeloma (MM) or related disorder at a rate of 1% per year. The prevalence estimates for MGUS have been based on testing using serum protein electrophoresis and subsequent confirmation of any abnormality detected on electrophoresis using serum immunofixation. More recently, the prevalence of MGUS has also been refined using the serum-free light-chain (FLC) assay to detect light-chain MGUS. Previous mathematical estimates suggest that when MGUS is first clinically recognized, it has likely been present in an undetected state for a median duration of > 10 years. To verify these estimates, a serum-based method with higher analytical sensitivity than SPEP is needed. Lower levels of monoclonal proteins (M-proteins) can be detected using mass spectrometry assays. In addition to high-analytical sensitivity, mass spectrometric assays also enable accurate follow-up of the identified M-protein as the molecular weight of the M-protein light-chain is a specific and reliable marker of the plasma cell clone. We studied a cohort of patients who were part of the Olmsted County screening study to address this question. We hypothesized that a monoclonal protein can be detected with sensitive mass spectrometry assays in most patients several years prior to a diagnosis of clinical MGUS.

### What Do the elevated protein levels mean in my patients with myeloma, amyloidosis, and related disorders? [^115uLPTN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple myeloma, light chain amyloidosis, and other plasma cell dyscrasias are characterized, in part, by abnormal production of paraproteins that are often responsible for the sequelae of those diseases. These paraproteins are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins produced by clonal antibody-secreting cells (usually plasma cells, but occasionally, B lymphocytes). Significant heterogeneity exists in the presentation of these diseases, ranging from incidental detection of a monoclonal protein in an asymptomatic patient, to life-threatening manifestations that require urgent diagnostic confirmation and intervention. Successful management of such scenarios requires a fundamental understanding of the laboratory assays at one's disposal, their role in the workup of paraproteinemias, and the interpretation thereof. This review broadly covers these assays and their roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of these diseases.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^116qY5AU]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypoalbuminemia is common in clinical practice, and serum albumin levels are often routinely measured in severely ill or malnourished patients. Although hypoalbuminemia may develop within hours in acute disease or after trauma and resuscitation in previously well‐nourished individuals and is also present in chronic inflammatory diseases despite adequate nutrition intake, it is often wrongly considered to be an indicator of inadequate nutrition intake that can be relieved by nutrition support alone. There is actually a poor correlation between the level of nutrition intake and the serum albumin level. For example, anorexia nervosa patients have normal or only slightly decreased serum albumin levels despite very low nutrition intake, unless infected or traumatized. Many anorexia nervosa patients have a body mass index < 18 kg/m 2 and have low muscle mass and strength, but they are otherwise functioning relatively well. 1 Further, patients with chronic diseases and hypoalbuminemia lose fat‐free mass, considered to be an essential indicator of the undernourished state, despite adequate food intake. 2, 3 Rather than reflecting undernutrition per se, hypoalbuminemia is more a reflection of the extent of physiologic stress resulting from disease or trauma‐related inflammation. These considerations do not exclude the likelihood that hypoalbuminemia often coincides with a negative nutrient balance for which nutrition support is indicated.

The objectives of this semicomprehensive review are to define the pathophysiology of hypoalbuminemia associated with increases in capillary permeability and altered kinetics of serum albumin in inflammatory states, including states of physiologic or pathologic growth. In addition, the potentially beneficial role of these changes will be highlighted as well as the significance of increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels as indicators of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. Finally, the significance of hypoalbuminemia as a risk indicator of negative outcome after medical treatment or of diminished longevity will be discussed.

In view of the many areas of pathophysiology addressed, we will limit the number of references to subjects that are not commonly accepted knowledge. In this area, very few randomized trials and meta‐analyses have been performed. Much of the material in this paper regards the pathophysiology of inflammation at the whole‐body level and recent, more in‐depth papers on cell biology and the beneficial intracellular and extracellular role of albumin.

### Interpretation of serum calcium in patients with abnormal serum proteins [^112CjP1i]. British Medical Journal (1973). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia and Hyperalbuminemia" for immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome, ascites and liver cirrhosis.

The Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia and Hyperalbuminemia, or simply Calcium Correction for Albumin, is a clinical tool to adjust serum calcium levels based on the patient's albumin concentration. It is particularly applicable to patients with hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels) or hyperalbuminemia (high albumin levels), conditions often seen in critically ill patients, those with liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, malnutrition, and burns.

The clinical utility of this calculator lies in its ability to provide a more accurate assessment of the patient's calcium status. Serum calcium levels can be influenced by albumin concentrations, as albumin is the primary protein that binds calcium in the blood. Therefore, in conditions where albumin levels are abnormal, the total serum calcium may not accurately reflect the patient's true calcium status. The Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia and Hyperalbuminemia calculator corrects the total serum calcium level based on the albumin level, providing a more accurate reflection of the patient's ionized calcium level, which is the physiologically active form of calcium.

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of this calculator. However, it should be noted that this correction is an estimation and may not be accurate in all clinical situations. For instance

The calculator adjusts calcium levels in cases of abnormal albumin — either hypoalbuminemia or hyperalbuminemia. It accepts three inputs: serum calcium, patient's albumin level, and what is considered the normal albumin level. Inputs come with different possible units: serum calcium can be in mg/dL or mmol/L, and albumin levels in g/dL or g/L.

Here's how the calculation works:

- First, ensure uniform units for computation:

- If serum calcium is in mmol/L, convert it to mg/dL by multiplying by 4.
- If albumin or normal albumin is in g/L, convert it to g/dL by dividing by 10.

- Calculate the corrected calcium using the formula:

- correctedCalcium = serum calcium + (0.8 × (normal albumin - patient albumin))

This formula accounts for albumin's effect on calcium binding. Each 1 g/dL difference in albumin level corresponds to a 0.8 mg/dL adjustment in calcium, reflecting the binding influence.

- If the corrected calcium needs to be in mmol/L, convert it from mg/dL by dividing by 4.

The calculator returns the corrected calcium value in the preferred unit, rounded to two decimal places for precision.

Here's a quick reference for input and output ranges:

- Serum Calcium: 1–20 mg/dL or 0.25–5 mmol/L
- Albumin: 0–10 g/dL or 0–50 g/L
- Normal Albumin: 0–10 g/dL or 0–50 g/L
- Corrected Calcium: 0–20 mg/dL or 0–5 mmol/L

Understanding these adjustments enables healthcare providers to more accurately evaluate metabolic and nutritional statuses in patients with abnormal albumin levels.

### Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency targeted testing and augmentation therapy: a Canadian Thoracic Society meta-analysis and clinical practice guideline [^115bX3xe]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency — reductions in A1AT levels align with clinical risk, as there is a clear pathophysiological cascade from gene mutation to lower A1AT levels and clinical phenotype, with the most profound reduction associated with the highest risk of emphysema; clarifying the mutation and its impact on serum A1AT levels is important to understand susceptibility to disease risk and progression, and meta-analyses illustrate a significant association between protein phenotypes and resulting A1AT levels, with one study demonstrating increased mortality when comparing MZ to MM.

### Precision diagnostics: moving towards protein biomarker signatures of clinical utility in cancer [^113dCD4i]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2017). Medium credibility.

Interest in precision diagnostics has been fuelled by the concept that early detection of cancer would benefit patients; that is, if detected early, more tumours should be resectable and treatment more efficacious. Serum contains massive amounts of potentially diagnostic information, and affinity proteomics has risen as an accurate approach to decipher this, to generate actionable information that should result in more precise and evidence-based options to manage cancer. To achieve this, we need to move from single to multiplex biomarkers, a so-called signature, that can provide significantly increased diagnostic accuracy. This Opinion article focuses on the progress being made in identifying protein biomarker signatures of clinical utility, using blood-based proteomics.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^111asfkm]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

The principles described above with regard to the risk of treatment of patients that are already subject to (especially infectious) inflammation, also apply in medical oncology. Hypoalbuminemia often proves to be a strong independent risk factor for failure of chemotherapy and for mortality. 138, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146

The strong connection between inflammation and plasma albumin levels will generally make the trend of these levels a suitable instrument to assess improvement or deterioration of the disease process. We closely followed up serum albumin levels in a substantial number of patients with abdominal catastrophe in which damage control was achieved, but at the expense of open wounds, fistulas, or temporary stomata. This led to the observation that a rise of serum albumin of a few g/L in the course of a week invariably was associated with a negative fluid balance, body weight loss, and clinical improvement, whereas a drop in serum albumin levels was associated with opposite findings. This led to the practice of postponing surgical reintervention at least 6–12 weeks after damage control, when inflammatory activity had significantly subsided and the clinical condition improved, as reflected by the clinical state and increasing serum albumin levels. 100, 139

### Extending the dynamic range of biomarker quantification through molecular equalization [^113Drco8]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

To fully realize the vision of precision health, there is a pressing need for highly multiplexed biomarker quantification methods that can accurately describe patient physiology. One of the fundamental challenges of contemporary biomarker quantification technologies is the relatively limited quantifiable range inherent to most signal detection modalities, which typically spans 3–4 orders of magnitude. This poses a difficult challenge when measuring multiple protein biomarkers in blood, given that the dynamic range of concentrations in the plasma proteome spans 10+ orders of magnitude. To achieve quantitation across this full range of concentrations, most current methods separate the sample into different panels for the measurement of sets of proteins that fall within roughly the same concentration range. Each panel is processed to specifically tune the signal output from a given set of analytes to the quantifiable regime of the detector. For panels of high-abundance analytes, samples are typically diluted until the signals generated are below the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ). For low-abundance analytes, the output signal is amplified to raise the final signal above the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ). Unfortunately, the need for multiple assay panels also means that larger sample volumes are required, which poses challenges for precious clinical specimens such as bio-banked samples.

Critically, the dilution process introduces the notoriously difficult problem of non-linear dilution. This describes the phenomenon wherein measured concentrations of a given analyte deviate greatly from their expected values when measured at different dilutions, thereby undermining meaningful comparisons of measurement results from multiple panels. The effects of non-linear dilution can be dramatic — for example, upon comparing undiluted patient serum samples to those that were diluted 3-fold, Rosenberg-Hasson et al. observed that only 6% of the biomarkers exhibited a proportional change in signal upon dilution (Supplementary Fig. 1). Indeed, they observed changes in signal ranging from 0.61- to 5.45-fold, with the signal from some proteins even increasing upon dilution. Most troublingly, the observed effects of non-linear dilution varied not only from analyte to analyte but also from sample to sample, suggesting that the optimal dilution for each target could vary across patients. Although there are methods for assessing the magnitude of a non-linear dilution effect, such as spike-and-recovery assays, there is currently no general solution for circumventing the non-linear dilution problem.

### Hypoalbuminaemia and heart failure: a practical review of current evidence [^117VCCjq]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Heart failure associated with other conditions

A couple of studies evaluated the prognostic role of lower levels of albumin in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Among such patients, hypoalbuminaemia independently predicted new‐onset HF and in‐hospital mortality and this trend was inversely correlated with progressively low albumin levels. Another report described increased in‐hospital mortality, HF development, and major bleeding in patients with hypoalbuminaemia. In addition, hypoalbuminaemia was found to predict long‐term mortality and worsening HF.

Hypoalbuminaemia is also important in rare forms of CV diseases, such as congenital heart diseases (CHD), and is a strong independent predictor of death even after adjustment for disease complexity. The Fontan palliative procedure often fails because of the onset of protein‐losing enteropathy which causes severe hypoalbuminaemia. The prognostic role of serum albumin was evaluated in adult HF patients with CHD listed for heart transplantation. Serum albumin levels < 3.2 g/dl were found to almost double the risk of the primary outcome – death or delisting for clinical worsening within 1 year – among CHD patients irrespective of lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, admission to the intensive care unit, and need for mechanical ventilation.

Biventricular congestive HF, which causes fluid retention and increased vascular permeability, contributes to the onset and perpetuation of hypoalbuminaemia. The latter is a prognostic marker for patients referred to cardiac interventional therapies, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement, left ventricular assist device, cardiac resynchronization therapy, and in heart transplant recipients.

### A low serum iron level is a predictor of poor outcome in hemodialysis patients [^112itySW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Iron administration has been implicated as a cause of poor clinical outcome in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. However, the role of low iron levels in the clinical outcome of MHD patients is not clear.

Methods

We examined the predicting value of baseline serum iron level on prospective mortality and hospitalization in a cohort of all 1,283 MHD patients from 10 DaVita dialysis facilities in Los Angeles County, CA.

Results

Patients aged 57.8 ± 15.2 years included 49% men, 45% Hispanics, 25% African Americans, and 53% patients with diabetes. During the first 3 months of the cohort, 97% of patients were administered erythropoietin (EPO) and 60% were administered intravenous iron (gluconate and/or dextran) at least once. During a 12-month follow-up, mortality was significantly greater (23%) in the lowest serum iron quartile (< 45.3 microg/dL [< 8.1 micromol/L]) compared with other quartiles (10% to 12%). Multivariate Poisson and Cox models adjusted for demographic features, dialysis dose and vintage, serum albumin and ferritin and blood hemoglobin concentrations, and administered EPO and iron doses showed that both serum iron level and iron saturation ratio had significant, but inverse, associations with prospective mortality and hospitalization. There was a statistically significant trend toward greater rates of mortality and hospitalization with lower serum iron levels. This reverse association remained significant in a subcohort of 322 MHD patients after additional adjustments for comorbid conditions and serum C-reactive protein level to reflect inflammation.

Conclusion

Low baseline serum iron indicators are associated with increased mortality and hospitalization in MHD patients independent of hemoglobin level, EPO and iron doses, indicators of nutrition and inflammation, and comorbid conditions. Clinical trials to examine the role of iron administration in improving morbidity and mortality by increasing serum iron levels in MHD patients are required.

### Intermittent appearance of antibodies to infliximab is not associated with reduced efficacy in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [^116DvEHx]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Goals

To assess the clinical significance of antibodies to infliximab (ATI) formation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Background

Infliximab therapy in patients with IBD is highly effective though up to 50% of patients lose response to infliximab. ATI formation occurs in 6% to 60% of patients on scheduled infliximab maintenance therapy.

Methods

Infliximab trough levels and ATI at trough were prospectively determined in patients with IBD on maintenance infliximab therapy. Patients on infliximab maintenance therapy with at least 3 ATI measurements were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups: sustained negative (< 1µg/mL) ATI levels, and fluctuating ATI levels (at least 1 sample with ATI < 1 and at least one > 1µg/mL).

Results

Forty-eight patients with IBD with available clinical data and serum samples were included. 25 patients had sustained low ATI levels and 23 patients had fluctuating ATI levels. Both groups were similar in IBD subtype distribution (Crohn's disease in 73.9% and 60%), mean serum albumin levels (4.2 vs. 3.9g/dL), and mean trough serum infliximab levels (3.3 vs. 4.6µg/mL) in fluctuating ATI and low ATI groups, respectively. There were no significant differences in the rate of clinical response (64% vs. 76%) and mean serum C-reactive protein levels (9.4 vs. 8.5mg/dL, ULN = 5) in the fluctuating ATI and low ATI groups. Similar rates of clinical response in the fluctuating ATI and low ATI groups were observed in ulcerative colitis (33% vs. 40%) and Crohn's disease (76% vs. 100%).

Conclusions

The fluctuating pattern of appearance of ATI in patients with IBD was not associated with loss of clinical response or a rise in C-reactive protein. The authors suggest that in clinical decision making, only sustained appearance of ATI should be considered as an adverse therapeutic factor.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^11788bEW]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with inflammation. Despite being addressed repeatedly in the literature, there is still confusion regarding its pathogenesis and clinical significance. Inflammation increases capillary permeability and escape of serum albumin, leading to expansion of interstitial space and increasing the distribution volume of albumin. The half‐life of albumin has been shown to shorten, decreasing total albumin mass. These 2 factors lead to hypoalbuminemia despite increased fractional synthesis rates in plasma. Hypoalbuminemia, therefore, results from and reflects the inflammatory state, which interferes with adequate responses to events like surgery or chemotherapy, and is associated with poor quality of life and reduced longevity. Increasing or decreasing serum albumin levels are adequate indicators, respectively, of improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. In the interstitium, albumin acts as the main extracellular scavenger, antioxidative agent, and as supplier of amino acids for cell and matrix synthesis. Albumin infusion has not been shown to diminish fluid requirements, infection rates, and mortality in the intensive care unit, which may imply that there is no body deficit or that the quality of albumin "from the shelf" is unsuitable to play scavenging and antioxidative roles. Management of hypoalbuminaemia should be based on correcting the causes of ongoing inflammation rather than infusion of albumin. After the age of 30 years, muscle mass and function slowly decrease, but this loss is accelerated by comorbidity and associated with decreasing serum albumin levels. Nutrition support cannot fully prevent, but slows down, this chain of events, especially when combined with physical exercise.

### Admission serum albumin concentrations and response to nutritional therapy in hospitalised patients at malnutrition risk: secondary analysis of a randomised clinical trial [^113rz2Vk]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This report is, to our knowledge, the first to conclusively assess the ability of albumin concentration to predict effectiveness of nutritional support. Regarding our primary endpoint 30-day mortality, there was no significant interaction between albumin concentration and response to nutritional support. When stratified according to inflammation, a stronger treatment response was found in patients with low to moderate inflammation compared to high inflammation (CRP ≥ 100 g/L) confirming previous reports. Still, treatment response did not differ according to albumin concentrations within different groups of patients stratified by inflammation level. Thus, albumin concentrations did not provide additional information regarding benefit of treatment and should not be viewed as a nutritional marker. These results are in line with a recent consensus paper and a meta-analysis concluding that albumin concentrations should be used in the evaluation of severity of disease but not to assess nutritional status or diagnose malnutrition. This may be explained by serum albumin concentrations being affected by a variety of factors, mostly reflecting acute disease or inflammation but not reflecting plasma proteins or nutritional status. The visceral protein albumin is a negative acute-phase protein and albumin concentrations are inversely correlated to CRP concentrations. Normalisation of albumin concentrations may, therefore, not depend on nutritional support or albumin treatment, but rather on the resolution of disease and inflammation.

### Clinical relevance of decreased free protein S levels: results from a retrospective family cohort study involving 1143 relatives [^116Xix93]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

Conflicting data have been reported on the risk for venous thrombosis in subjects with low free protein S levels. We performed a post-hoc analysis in a single-center retrospective thrombophilic family cohort, to define the optimal free protein S level that can identify subjects at risk for venous thrombosis. Relatives (1143) were analyzed. Relatives with venous thrombosis (mean age 39 years) had lower free protein S levels than relatives without venous thrombosis (P < .001), which was most pronounced in the lowest quartile. Only relatives with free protein S levels less than the 5th percentile (< 41 IU/dL) or less than the 2.5th percentile (< 33 IU/dL) were at higher risk of first venous thrombosis compared with the upper quartile (> 91 IU/dL); annual incidence 1.20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72–1.87) and 1.81% (95% CI, 1.01–2.99), respectively; adjusted hazard ratios 5.6, (95% CI, 2.7–11.5) and 11.3 (95% CI, 5.4–23.6). Recurrence rates were 12.12% (95 CI, 5.23–23.88) and 12.73% (95% CI, 5.12–26.22) per year; adjusted hazard ratios were 3.0 (95% CI, 1.03–8.5) and 3.4 (95% CI, 1.1–10.3). In conclusion, free protein S level can identify young subjects at risk for venous thrombosis in thrombophilic families, although the cutoff level lies far below the normal range in healthy volunteers.

### Aminotransferase levels in clinical practice-what is normal? [^112nyEMD]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

No universal consensus exists as to what the upper limit of normal for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) should be. The purpose of this review is to provide insight on the wide variation in the upper limit of normal for ALT, and to highlight key elements resulting in these differences. We also wish to point to potential solutions for standardizing the upper limit of normal.

Recent Findings

There are considerable differences in the values for what constitutes a 'normal' ALT serum concentration set by laboratories, and reference values may vary two-fold between different institutions (from 30 to 60U/l). Key reasons for this include using markedly different reference populations to establish the bounds of normal, and differences in analyzers and assays used to quantify ALT levels. A number of studies have attempted to re-evaluate the upper limit of normal and propose new cut-offs that would allow better detection of liver disease.

Summary

The upper limit of normal for ALT continues to vary from one laboratory to another. Despite ongoing efforts, there is still an unmet demand to standardize ALT reference ranges, which is critical for clinical practice. More rigorous inclusion criteria for reference population studies and harmonization in analyzer differences is required to standardize ALT reference ranges universally.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for nutrition in CKD: 2020 update [^1123wtzF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Guideline 3: Protein and energy intake — very low protein diet (VLPD) with ketoanalog supplements (KAs) and nutritional status in chronic kidney disease (CKD) indicates no consistent deterioration in serum albumin or subjective global assessment (SGA), with mixed anthropometric effects. A VLPD with KAs at 0.28–0.4 g protein/kg per day had "no significant effect on serum albumin levels and nutritional status as measured by SGA", and across adults with CKD, "6 RCTs and 1 NRCT reported no effect" on serum albumin, with "nutritional status… maintained". In MDRD Study B (CKD stages 3–4), there were "no significant differences in anthropometric measurements… (P > 0.05)", whereas Malvy et al observed "significant weight loss… (P < 0.01) and lean mass and FM were reduced" in the VLPD group, while the "moderate- protein group indicated no difference for weight variables". A larger study by Garneata et al reported "no differences throughout the study period in both groups for BMI, MAMC, and TSF".
