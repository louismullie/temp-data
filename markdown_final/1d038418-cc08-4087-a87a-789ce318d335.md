## Question

How do you diagnose a posterior interosseous nerve injury following ORIF of a distal radius fracture?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose posterior interosseous nerve injury following ORIF of a distal radius fracture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to establish clinical suspicion from the postoperative history and risk context. Then, I should verify the key elements of the focused neurological examination. Next, I will consider important mimics to exclude. After that, I need to check which imaging modality to use first and when to escalate. I will then review the role and timing of electrodiagnostic studies. Subsequently, I will synthesize the data into a working diagnosis, and finally, I need to determine management pathways and follow-up monitoring intervals that align with prognosis and severity.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk profile. Following distal radius ORIF, the PIN can be injured by retraction, drill or screw trajectory, plate prominence, or direct manipulation around the radial head–neck–supinator corridor; although these risks are better detailed in surgical technique and radial nerve imaging papers than in DRF-specific PIN series, they remain biologically plausible and reported in postoperative settings, so I should not overlook them [^113K3Emi]. Wait, let me verify onset and trajectory of symptoms: immediate postoperative finger and thumb extension weakness suggests intraoperative traction or hardware-related injury, whereas delayed deficits raise concern for postoperative hematoma, edema, or scar tethering; notably, postoperative PIN palsy after other elbow surgeries often recovers within about 3 to 5 months, which supports an initial period of observation if imaging confirms continuity and no impingement [^1145ghxD].

> I will now examine the targeted neurological findings. The hallmark is inability to actively extend the fingers and thumb at the metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints, while wrist extension may be partially preserved via extensor carpi radialis longus, reflecting a lesion distal to the radial nerve bifurcation; radial deviation of wrist extension can appear if extensor carpi ulnaris is weak, and sensation is typically spared because the PIN is predominantly motor, which helps distinguish it from a more proximal radial nerve palsy [^1145ghxD] [^112nBHMg]. Hold on, I should verify that sensory testing is still performed, because unexpected sensory loss would push me to reconsider a radial nerve proper lesion or concomitant neuropathy rather than an isolated PIN palsy [^112nBHMg].

> Next, I should review mimics and concurrent pathologies so I do not jump to conclusions. Tendon rupture can masquerade as motor nerve palsy; a careful tenodesis effect and passive range assessment, plus early tendon-focused imaging when indicated, help differentiate these entities, especially given known extensor tendon complications after volar plating of distal radius fractures and hardware malposition risks [^116ttLoo] [^117Vgwgk]. I need to ensure that median and ulnar nerve functions are intact, because volar plating can precipitate median neuropathy and postoperative ulnar neuropathy has its own differential and workup nuances; if sensory or intrinsic muscle signs from these nerves are present, I must broaden the evaluation and consider a double-crush scenario or compartment process in the acute postoperative window [^111Go3Vt] [^1151PtVY].

> If clinical suspicion for PIN injury persists, hold on, I should verify the best first-line imaging. High-resolution ultrasound is my preferred initial modality because it allows direct visualization of the nerve, detects focal caliber change and hypoechogenicity indicative of neuropathy, dynamically assesses nerve motion relative to hardware and scar, and can reveal hematoma or direct implant impingement; crucially, in small series of iatrogenic injuries, ultrasound findings have matched intraoperative findings when transection was suspected [^113XXyRd] [^113K3Emi]. But wait, what if sonographic windows are poor due to edema or body habitus? In that case, I need to plan for cross-sectional imaging rather than forcing an inconclusive study that delays care [^113XXyRd].

> I should double-check the role of electrodiagnostics next. EMG and nerve conduction studies help confirm a neurogenic process, localize the lesion to the supinator (Arcade of Frohse) region versus more proximal segments, and grade severity by distinguishing neurapraxia from axonotmesis, thereby informing prognosis and the urgency of surgical consideration; imaging can assist with localization when clinical and electrodiagnostic assessment cannot, but I should avoid unnecessary imaging that adds delay when the electrodiagnostic picture is already clear [^114wrAP3]. Let me reconsider timing: although immediate postoperative EMG has limited yield, establishing a baseline and then repeating at intervals helps track reinnervation or persistent conduction block, guiding the decision to intervene versus continue observation [^114wrAP3].

> If ultrasound is non-diagnostic or equivocal, I need to check escalation options. MRI with neurography sequences can depict nerve edema, caliber change, and surrounding soft tissue pathology, while CT precisely evaluates screw lengths and trajectories relative to the known PIN course around the radial head–neck and supinator tunnel; these choices align with hand and wrist trauma imaging recommendations when tendon or soft tissue concerns coexist with fractures [^112DVeLW] [^115jVjz5]. Wait, let me verify the hardware–nerve relationship more comprehensively: MRI and CT have both revealed nerve displacement or impingement by hematoma or implants in radial nerve pathologies, supporting their use when ultrasound is limited or when hardware-related conflict is suspected [^113K3Emi].

> I will now synthesize the data to establish the diagnosis. A compatible clinical pattern of PIN weakness with preserved sensation, electrodiagnostic confirmation of a radial motor branch lesion distal to the bifurcation, and imaging evidence of nerve continuity versus transection or impingement together yield a confident diagnosis while excluding tendon rupture and other neuropathies; this multimodal correlation is the standard approach in postoperative peripheral nerve injuries to reduce misclassification and avoid inappropriate delays in care [^114wrAP3] [^113XXyRd] [^1145ghxD]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there might be DRF-ORIF–specific PIN diagnostic criteria, but I should confirm that our criteria are extrapolated from broader PIN and iatrogenic nerve injury literature rather than DRF-exclusive datasets, which remains acceptable but should be acknowledged [^113XXyRd] [^113K3Emi].

> Determining management requires aligning pathology with severity and time course. Let me first confirm indications for urgent exploration: imaging-confirmed transection, clear hardware impingement, or progressive deficits despite decompression elsewhere justify early surgical evaluation because delay risks irreversible motor end-organ atrophy and worsened outcomes; implant-related PIN impingement and fracture-associated entrapments have been documented and may require neurolysis, hardware revision, or grafting when continuity is lost [^113K3Emi] [^114pNSPV]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for all cases: when ultrasound or MRI shows nerve continuity without compression and electrodiagnostics suggest neurapraxia or low-grade axonotmesis, initial conservative management with splinting and therapy is appropriate, given the favorable natural history of many closed or iatrogenic neuropathies and the observed 3–5 month recovery window in postoperative PIN palsy after distal biceps repair, although some guidelines recommend considering exploration if there is no meaningful recovery by several months [^1145ghxD] [^1136GFjX] [^114CbSYy].

> I need to ensure follow-up is structured and objective. Serial clinical examinations focusing on graded return of PIN-innervated muscle function and repeat EMG at roughly 6–8 week intervals can document reinnervation and guide the decision to continue observation versus proceed to exploration if there is clinical-electrodiagnostic stasis, acknowledging that excessively delayed surgery beyond the window of motor end-plate viability can compromise outcomes [^1136GFjX] [^114wrAP3]. But wait, I should verify that imaging is repeated only when it will change management; if initial studies already established hardware impingement or transection, timely surgical planning should not be deferred in favor of redundant tests [^114wrAP3].

> In summary, let me reconsider the full pathway to ensure nothing is missed. Suspect PIN injury after distal radius ORIF when postoperative finger and thumb extension fail with largely preserved sensation; confirm with a focused exam, exclude tendon rupture and other neuropathies, obtain high-resolution ultrasound first to assess continuity and hardware conflict, add EMG/NCS for localization and severity, and escalate to MRI or CT when ultrasound is limited or when hardware assessment is critical; then match management to pathology, reserving early exploration for transection or impingement and observation for continuity lesions likely to recover, while monitoring recovery with serial exams and EMG to avoid late interventions that miss the optimal window for motor recovery [^113XXyRd] [^114wrAP3] [^11552J34].

PIN injury after distal radius fracture ORIF is diagnosed by a combination of **clinical examination** and **electrodiagnostic studies** [^112nBHMg]. The hallmark is **motor weakness of finger and thumb extension** with preserved wrist extension, and no sensory loss [^114pNSPV]. **EMG/NCS** confirm the diagnosis, localize the lesion, and assess severity [^114pNSPV]. Imaging (ultrasound or MRI) is used when entrapment, hardware impingement, or mass effect is suspected [^113K3Emi]. Early recognition and prompt evaluation are essential to guide management and optimize outcomes [^1136GFjX].

---

## Clinical presentation and examination

- **PIN injury** typically presents with the following clinical features:

- **Motor deficits**: Weakness or paralysis of finger and thumb extension, resulting in "finger drop" or "thumb drop". Wrist extension is usually preserved due to the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis muscles being innervated proximal to the PIN [^114pNSPV].

- **Sensory deficits**: The PIN is primarily a motor nerve; thus, sensory loss is uncommon. However, patients may report vague dorsal forearm discomfort or paresthesia [^112nBHMg].

- **Physical examination**: Careful assessment of finger and thumb extension strength, wrist extension, and forearm supination/pronation is essential. Comparison with the contralateral limb is helpful.

---

## Electrodiagnostic studies

**Electrodiagnostic studies** are the gold standard for confirming PIN injury, localizing the lesion, and determining severity [^112nBHMg]. **Nerve conduction studies (NCS)** evaluate motor conduction velocity and amplitude in PIN-innervated muscles (e.g. extensor indicis proprius, extensor digitorum communis); reduced amplitude or conduction block indicates axonal injury or demyelination. **Electromyography (EMG)** identifies denervation changes (fibrillation potentials, positive sharp waves) in PIN-innervated muscles, confirming axonal injury and helping differentiate PIN injury from more proximal radial nerve lesions [^114pNSPV].

---

## Imaging modalities

Imaging is adjunctive, particularly when **entrapment, hardware impingement, or mass effect** is suspected [^113K3Emi]. **Ultrasound** uses high-resolution imaging to visualize the PIN and can detect swelling, compression, or entrapment by hardware or scar tissue; it is non-invasive, dynamic, and cost-effective [^113XXyRd]. **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** provides detailed soft tissue visualization, identifying nerve compression, edema, or entrapment by hardware or scar tissue, and is particularly useful when ultrasound findings are inconclusive or deeper structures are involved [^114wrAP3].

---

## Intraoperative findings

In cases requiring surgical exploration, **intraoperative findings** may include:

- **Direct nerve injury**: Laceration, transection, or contusion of the PIN.

- **Entrapment**: Nerve entrapment by hardware, scar tissue, or callus formation.

- **Compression**: Nerve compression by hematoma, hardware, or soft tissue structures [^114pNSPV].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Differential diagnosis includes:

- **Radial nerve injury**: More proximal lesions causing wrist drop and sensory loss.

- **Median nerve injury**: Carpal tunnel syndrome or anterior interosseous nerve syndrome.

- **Ulnar nerve injury**: Cubital tunnel syndrome or Guyon's canal syndrome.

- **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**: Chronic pain syndrome following distal radius fracture [^112NCEMQ].

---

## Timing of diagnosis

Early recognition and prompt evaluation are **critical** [^114CbSYy]. Initial clinical assessment should occur immediately postoperatively, with electrodiagnostic studies performed within 2–3 weeks if PIN injury is suspected [^1136GFjX]. Delayed diagnosis may result in prolonged recovery and poorer functional outcomes [^114pNSPV].

---

## Management and prognosis

Management depends on **severity and etiology**. **Conservative management** involves observation, physical therapy, and occupational therapy for mild injuries or neuropraxia [^1136GFjX]. **Surgical intervention** is indicated for severe injuries, entrapment, or hardware impingement; surgical exploration, neurolysis, or nerve repair may be required [^114pNSPV].

Prognosis varies; mild injuries often recover **spontaneously**, while severe injuries may require **prolonged rehabilitation** or **surgical intervention** [^1145ghxD].

PIN injury after distal radius fracture ORIF is **diagnosed** through clinical examination, electrodiagnostic studies, and imaging. Early recognition and prompt evaluation are essential for optimal outcomes.

### A panorama of radial nerve pathologies: An imaging diagnosis: A step ahead [^113K3Emi]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

- **Normal nerve anatomy and pathology**: The normal posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) can be seen winding around the radial head, passing between two heads of the supinator into the forearm. The nerve is of normal caliber and echogenicity. Just distal to this area, a focal increase in caliber and hypo-echogenicity is noted in the PIN. An intraoperative picture showcases the PIN after release from surrounding local scar tissue.

- **Radial nerve displacement**: A displacement of the radial nerve is observed due to a local hematoma formed following a traumatic fracture of the humerus shaft. A long axis view of the left radial nerve shows displacement by the hematoma. An axial PD sequence demonstrates a hyperintense radial nerve displaced by an underlying acute hematoma in a post-operative case of fracture of the humerus shaft. A coronal PD sequence reveals a hyperintense radial nerve with underlying hematoma in the acute stage. Screws from a medullary nail implanted for fracture fixation of the humerus shaft are also noted.

- **Nerve impingement**: The posterior interosseous nerve is impinged by a nail following internal fixation in a fracture case of both forearm bones. The nerve displays a wavy contour but retains normal caliber. In another instance, the nerve is impinged by an implant, resulting in a similar wavy contour but with normal caliber. The patient underwent tendon transfer to relieve finger drop.

- **Tourniquet-induced pathology**: Loss of the normal honeycomb pattern is seen in a patient who had a tourniquet placed for forearm surgery. This resulted in wrist drop in the post-operative period.

### Prognosis for recovery of posterior interosseous nerve palsy after distal biceps repair [^1145ghxD]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

There is very little information on the incidence of and usual recovery period for posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) palsies after distal biceps repair. This study examined the incidence and the time to resolution of PIN palsies in a large consecutive series of primary distal biceps repairs.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective review was performed of a consecutive series of patients treated by 34 fellowship-trained upper extremity surgeons with primary distal biceps repair through a single anterior incision technique. Patients' records were reviewed to determine how many experienced a postoperative PIN palsy, defined as postoperative digital extension weakness on clinical examination. Demographic information, surgical fixation used, and clinical resolution was collected for these patients. All patients had clinical follow-up until complete resolution of PIN palsy symptoms.

- **Results**: We found 280 patients who were treated with a single-incision technique and one of two methods of biceps tendon fixation. Of these, 9 (3.2%) developed a postoperative PIN palsy after primary distal biceps repair. These 9 patients had complete lack of finger and thumb extension at the first postoperative visit and had complete resolution of symptoms at an average of 86 days (range, 41–145 days).

- **Conclusions**: The incidence of PIN palsy following a single-incision distal biceps repair was 3.2% in our series. These injuries typically resolve within 3 months, and at the latest, 5 months after surgery.

### Does simultaneous fixation of both distal radius and distal ulnar fractures improve outcomes? A retrospective cohort study [^114HnWk2]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

Lutsky et al. concluded that routine surgical fixation of concomitant distal ulnar fractures during distal radius surgery using the open reduction internal fixation technique does not appear to be necessary. However, they noted that the limitation of their study was that it included a wide range of patient ages (range: 19–97 years). Sato et al. evaluated all cases except those younger than 60 years and concluded that the results of treating combined distal radius and ulnar fractures in older people using volar locking plate fixation for the distal radius fracture and leaving the distal ulnar fracture unfixed were encouraging.

The limitations of our study include the following: a high percentage of patients enrolled were older, the study is retrospective in nature, and the interventions and period of immobilization were determined individually by surgeons. Our study may be a comparison of two different treatments chosen by surgeons for similar injuries. Unfortunately, the classification system alone does not take into account the degree of displacement. Moreover, only a small number of patients were included in the study. In AO C3 distal radius fractures or open fracture cases, soft tissue defect and periosteal stripping could affect the functional result and bone healing; therefore, we could not discuss those elements separately. Large-scale prospective studies will be required in the future to corroborate the findings of our study.

### Pediatric and adolescent T-type distal humerus fractures [^116ynQy1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, Global Research & Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Consideration of percutaneous pinning does not negate preparation for open reduction and internal fixation. The surgical consent and discussion with the family should include the possibility of an open procedure if necessary and the use of contrast for an intra-articular arthrogram to confirm reduction. Documentation of preoperative neurovascular examination is also recommended because of the potential for iatrogenic injury to the ulnar nerve.

Room position and equipment should also be prepared or be available for an open conversion. If a closed reduction is attempted, K-wires (2 mm), both threaded and smooth-tip, can be used. The setup of the room should allow for the C-arm to be positioned parallel to the bed, coming in from the foot of the bed. This will allow for the device to arc and provide lateral images without rotating the arm during the reduction and/or fixation. The position should allow for the complete extremity to be on the radiolucent arm board for adequate imaging. The display screen for the fluoroscopic images can be placed at the head of the patient.

- **Reduction maneuvers**: Depend on the fracture type and location of the intra-articular split. Provisional fixation of the condyles in a minimally displaced intra-articular fracture will allow for a reduction maneuver of the fragment to the humeral shaft. Extended fragments are commonly reduced with manual anterior force on the olecranon while simultaneously applying pressure on the proximal fragment.

### Radiographic outcomes and complications of delayed fixation of distal radius fractures [^117VqWgZ]. Hand (2022). Low credibility.

Surgeons are sometimes presented with patients with distal radius fractures who present in a delayed fashion or lose reduction after several weeks of attempted closed management. There are limited studies on delayed surgical treatment of distal radius fractures to assist providers in decision-making.

- **Methods**: We conducted a matched cohort study to compare radiographic outcomes and complications for patients with a distal radius fracture treated with delayed (3–5 weeks) or early (0–2 weeks) surgical fixation. Patients ages 18+ who underwent open reduction and internal fixation of distal radius fractures by a volar approach at 2 Level I trauma centers between 2003 and 2015 were eligible. We measured radiographic outcomes and reviewed medical records to determine operative approach and complications.

- **Results**: There were 25 cases and 50 controls matched for age (18–87), sex, and AO fracture type. The delayed group had surgery at a mean of 24.8 days from injury and the early group at 5.6 days. There was no statistically significant difference between the delayed and early cohorts in radiographic parameters on injury x-rays, in improvement in radiographic parameters on first postoperative x-rays, or in maintenance of radiographic parameters at union.

- **Conclusion**: We did not find significant differences in radiographic outcomes or complication rates between patients with delayed versus early surgical treatment for distal radius fracture. Providers treating patients with late presentation or late displacement have the option of surgical fixation beyond the first few weeks.

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^112PV4v2]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

A prospective study including 108 complete intra-articular fractures of AO type B and C in 108 patients was conducted from 2013 to 2018. The subjects were aged between 18 to 84 years and included 61 men and 47 women. Subjects who were not willing to undergo surgery were excluded. The cohort was divided into three age groups: 18 to 44, 45 to 59, and 60 to 84. Ninety percent of the cases were done within 2 to 24 hours after injury, and the maximum delay for surgery was 3 weeks. The duration of surgery was 30 to 45 minutes, and it was performed under regional block or short general anesthesia. Patients were followed for 3 years.

- **Closed reduction**: Distraction of the fracture is the first step and is done manually by the surgeon with a firm grip of the thumb of the patient with one hand and the index and middle fingers of the patient with the other hand, while counter-traction is done by the first assistant. The hand is then transferred by the surgeon to the second assistant in two stages. In the first stage, the index and middle fingers of the patient are transferred without loss of distraction and simultaneous shift of the surgeon's hand to the medial four metacarpals of the patient. In the second stage, the patient's thumb is transferred to the second assistant. The medial three fingers of the second assistant are used in the supinated position with the extended elbow to hold the thumb of the patient, preventing slippage and providing maximum space for the surgeon to insert the Kirschner wire from the desired level.

### Intraarticular distal radius fracture open reduction internal fixation [^112UTckf]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

The intraarticular distal radius fracture is often treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) through a volar approach. However, this common approach is technically demanding in terms of restoring the articular surface of the radiocarpal joint while respecting soft tissue integrity. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the surgical technique of volar plate fixation for an intraarticular distal radius fracture.

A 32-year-old patient with multiple injuries, including an intraarticular distal radius fracture, was treated using the ORIF method with a volar approach.

- **Methods**: Exposure is executed through a standard flexor carpi radialis approach. The intraarticular fracture of the distal radius is then reduced, and a volar plate is applied. Careful measurement of screw length is described in detail to minimize postoperative tendon irritation. Closure of the soft tissues is completed, with an emphasis on early postoperative rehabilitation.

- **Discussion**: The literature describes multiple, varied techniques for the fixation of intraarticular distal radius fractures. As demonstrated in the video of ORIF using a volar plate, attention to articular reduction, soft-tissue protection, and postoperative rehabilitation are crucial for achieving good clinical outcomes.

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^111KNCtd]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Global Research & Reviews (2020). High credibility.

In severely comminuted intra-articular fractures or osteoporotic fractures, there are chances for pin migration and pin loosening. This can be avoided by applying a volar plaster of Paris slab in the functional position of the wrist, instead of a splint. The chances of malunion are very low due to the prevention of metaphyseal collapse. The occurrence of CRPS is eliminated or reduced to a minimum by the painless early active joint movements of the wrist and fingers. Joint stiffness is less with innovative pinning. There is no tendon or nerve injury with this method because the site of pin penetration can be selected to avoid tendons and nerves.

Recent literature shows that the specific technique is not as important as attaining anatomic reduction; the ability of the surgeon to restore anatomy with the least invasive procedure results in the quickest functional return.

### Surgical interventions for treating distal radial fractures in adults [^114Fjb2c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Fracture of the distal radius is a common clinical problem, particularly in older white women with osteoporosis.

- **Objectives**: To determine when, and if so what type of, surgical intervention is the most appropriate treatment for fractures of the distal radius in adults.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group specialised register (November 2002), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2003), EMBASE (1988 to 2003 Week 8), CINAHL (1982 to February 2003), the National Research Register (Issue 1, 2003), PEDro, conference proceedings and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials involving skeletally mature patients with a fracture of the distal radius, which compared surgical treatment with conservative treatment, different types of surgical intervention, or the duration of immobilisation after surgery. The main categories of surgical intervention were external fixation, percutaneous pinning, open reduction and internal fixation, and the insertion of bone scaffolding materials.

- **Data collection and analysis**: All trials meeting the selection criteria were independently assessed by both reviewers for methodological quality. Data were extracted for anatomical, functional and clinical outcomes (including complications). The trials were grouped into categories relating to the main comparisons and types of surgical intervention. Despite clear heterogeneity in the characteristics of the trials, groupings were established systematically.

### Assessment, management, and rehabilitation of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries for non-surgeons [^112miAcu]. Muscle & nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Nerve grafting addresses the tension pitfall of the primary repair and is particularly valuable in delayed reconstruction, where tension-free primary repair is impossible or in circumstances involving large nerve gaps such as extensive zones of injury or neuromas requiring excision. A donor nerve is used to build a bridge between the two ends of the injured nerve (Figure 2). Note that although sensory nerves such as the sural, medial antebrachial cutaneous, and lateral antebrachial cutaneous are often used as donors for autografts, the grafts function as biological conduits for regeneration since the axons within the grafts undergo Wallerian degeneration. As a result, nerve conduction studies (NCS) evaluation of the putative donor nerve is not required before a nerve's use as an autograft.

The most common problem with autografts is the donor site deficit from harvesting. Some surgeons may use nerve allografts or nerve conduits to avoid donor site morbidity or for other reasons, such as to supplement autografts due to the extent of graft required. The most obvious advantage of allografts and conduits is the lack of any donor site morbidity. The most significant disadvantages are the high costs and the limited evidence of efficacy, particularly for gaps greater than 3–5 cm, for which autografts are superior. For nerve grafting as a whole, a substantial advantage is the restoration of motor and sensory function; however, recovery is often suboptimal if the zone of injury is far from the reinnervation targets, and care must be taken to avoid rotating the proximal or distal coaptation.

### Ten-year national trends in patient characteristics and 30-day outcomes of distal radius fracture open reduction and internal fixation [^116hmZNe]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2022). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures are the most common upper extremity fractures, occurring at a frequency of 16.2 per 10,000 people. The incidence of distal radius fractures is increasing across all age groups globally, as is the utilization of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) for the treatment of these fractures. The increasing rate of distal radius fracture ORIF has been largely propelled by the advent of volar locking plate technology, which enables angular stable control of articular fragments, allowing for early mobilization.

Although the injury and treatment are common, distal radius fractures are associated with notable patient morbidity and mortality. Patients with a distal radius fracture have a 14% higher rate of mortality at 7 years after injury compared with the general population, which likely reflects underlying patient comorbidities and frailty. With surgical treatment of distal radius fractures, the 90-day complication rate is estimated at 4%, and the 1-year complication rate is estimated at more than 30%. Distal radius fracture treatment and its associated complications continue to be a source of economic burden on the healthcare system. This is of growing importance as institutions transition toward value-based care initiatives that balance quality and outcomes against the costs of care.

Understanding temporal trends in patient comorbidities and risk factors and episode-of-care outcomes can offer insights into the value of treatments rendered to patients, inform patient counseling, and identify areas for future improvement. The objective of this study was to assess…

### Distal radius fractures: Approaches, indications, and techniques [^1133nVmo]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures remain among the most common fractures of the upper extremity. The indications for operative management continue to evolve based on outcomes from the most recent clinical studies. Advancements over the past decade have expanded the variety of fixation options available; however, the clinical superiority of a particular treatment modality remains without consensus. Each approach requires the use of unique surgical techniques, and the choice of a particular implant system should be based on the surgeon's familiarity with the implant design and its limitations. As our understanding of the management of distal radius fractures improves, so will our indications for each specific treatment modality.

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^114UT2Eu]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

In the treatment of an intra-articular fracture of the distal radius, closed reduction treatment is currently advocated only for the AO type A fracture. AO type B and C fractures are treated by surgical methods such as open reduction or arthroscope-assisted closed/open reduction. The conventional pinning does not provide stable fixation to withstand the deforming forces acting during fracture healing; hence, it is used as an add-on procedure to other surgical methods. However, in this new method of pinning, stability is achieved by the crossing of the six K-wires at six points, with at least two K-wires in each interfragmentary fixation, thereby preventing pin migration and pin loosening.

- **Advantages of the surgical procedure**: On the analysis of the findings of this surgical procedure, the advantages can be summarized as follows:
	1. Early return to original employment is possible between 3 and 6 months due to the early return of joint movement range and restoration of grip strength, which is not possible with other surgical methods.
	2. Intra-articular fractures can be reduced by modifying the existing closed reduction technique by adding a milking technique in the completely distracted position. In the conventional open reduction internal fixation treatment of intra-articular fractures, there will be further soft-tissue damage. This results in permanent joint stiffness, reducing grip strength and delaying the return to original employment.
	3. Because there is no skin incision and no implants projecting outside the skin, painless movement of the joint is facilitated.

### Mechanism of injury affects the incidence and time to recovery of nerve injuries associated with humeral shaft fractures [^117Hm1Y9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

The literature does not have a consensus regarding the role of nerve exploration with preoperative nerve palsies. Indications for early exploration have included open fractures, vascular injuries, radial nerve deficit after attempted reduction, high-velocity gunshot wounds (GSWs), sharp or penetrating injuries, high suspicion of nerve laceration with spiral oblique fractures, and severe soft-tissue injuries. Late exploration is considered in cases of concern for nerve entrapment, which has been reported in 6% to 25% of cases, although it may introduce additional scarring.

Although low-energy fractures with a nerve palsy should be managed expectantly, others have advocated for exploration with high-energy injuries due to the high rates of neurotmesis and severe contusion. Interestingly, Bercik et al. recommended expectant management of isolated nerve palsies following GSWs of the humerus. In our study, 84% of patients with preoperative nerve palsies underwent early exploration, although nerve exploration was not found to be correlated with nerve recovery. Only two nerves (4%) were found to be transected, requiring a nerve allograft.

Additional studies have shown that there is no difference in final outcomes when comparing groups managed expectantly and those with early exploration. Our high rate of nerve exploration with ORIF is likely due to our institution's trend toward surgical management of humerus fractures and nerve exploration, specifically the radial nerve, as part of the surgical exposure, although this was not performed for patients undergoing IMN.

### Posterior interosseous nerve proximity to cortical button implant for distal biceps repair with single and 2-incision approaches [^115djzRh]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Fixation with a cortical button is the biomechanically strongest surgical approach for distal biceps repair, and utilization of the 2-incision approach may provide a more anatomical repair and improved terminal supination strength. The risk of injury to the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) associated with this approach requires further investigation.

- **Methods**: A distal biceps repair with a cortical button was performed on 10 cadavers, 5 utilizing the single-incision approach and 5 utilizing the 2-incision approach. Contrast was injected into the radial nerve and computed tomography scans were obtained. The distance between the drilled cortical perforation and the PIN was measured.

- **Results**: The mean distance from the cortical perforation to the PIN was not significantly different between approaches (9.4 mm and 8.8 mm). A PIN entrapment was seen in 0 out of 5 for the single-incision approach and 1 out of 5 for the 2-incision approach.

- **Conclusions**: Distal biceps repair with cortical button fixation places the PIN at risk of injury regardless of the approach used. Methods of fixation that require bicortical drilling should be especially avoided when using the 2-incision approach.

- **Clinical relevance**: Distal biceps repair utilizing bicortical drilling for fixation through a 2-incision approach poses high risk of injury to the PIN and should be avoided.

### Assessment, management, and rehabilitation of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries for non-surgeons [^114wrAP3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

- **Radiological investigations**: In clinical practice, the extent and severity of nerve injuries can be difficult to determine. Unfortunately, imaging does not reliably establish nerve injury severity in some challenging scenarios but can be useful in assessing peripheral nerve injuries, particularly for establishing neurotmesis or nerve root avulsion. While obtaining the correct radiological investigation can enhance patient care, inappropriate investigations may result in unnecessary delays in care, contribute to poorer outcomes, and add to healthcare expenditure.

In assessing traumatic brachial plexus injuries, it is intuitive to image the plexus itself, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine to identify nerve root avulsions is a more useful test. The presence of an avulsion clarifies the prognosis and, therefore, directs the next steps for management. Recent studies in both obstetrical brachial plexopathy and adult brachial plexus injury indicate that the sensitivity of diagnosing root avulsion is poor immediately post-injury and markedly improves over one week post-injury, when the mean sensitivity is 93%.

For circumstances in which the peripheral nerve injury does not involve the nerve root(s) or plexus, imaging investigations with ultrasound and/or extremity MRI or magnetic resonance neurography may assist with localization when clinical and electrodiagnostic assessment cannot, or for identification of focal entrapment or hourglass constrictions. Ultrasound has particular utility in dynamic conditions, such as ulnar nerve entrapment at the elbow, but also because of its relative flexibility — some nerves can be assessed effectively.

### Postoperative ulnar neuropathy: A systematic review of evidence with narrative synthesis [^1151PtVY]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

Whereas the signs and symptoms of ulnar nerve dysfunction are straightforward to detect at the bedside, identifying the site, severity, and aetiology of the condition is more challenging. Neurological examination of the limbs and cranial nerves should be documented at the earliest opportunity in a patient suspected of having PUN. Routine screening of patients for evidence of PUN in the recovery room should not be undertaken. Sensory findings in PUN may include paraesthesia, numbness, pain, and loss of two-point discrimination in the ring and little finger.

Broad differential diagnoses to consider in such cases are muscle diseases, radiculopathy, myelopathy, spinal cord trauma/infarction, and stroke. A brachial plexus lesion arising from compression on a cervical rib is a further differential diagnosis to consider. A pre-existing abnormality along the course of a peripheral nerve, for example, an area of nerve compression, may increase the likelihood that a further physically distinct insult will manifest with signs of symptoms of nerve injury. This is known as the "double-crush" phenomenon. A history of pre-existing neurological symptoms in the upper limb should, therefore, be sought. New, acute postoperative pain or paralysis should trigger assessment for compartment syndrome or acute vascular compromise. Communication to the patient of examination findings, possible diagnoses, and further assessment should be undertaken by the relevant anaesthetist and must be documented in the medical record.

### Open reduction internal fixation versus percutaneous pinning with external fixation of distal radius fractures: a prospective, randomized clinical trial [^114LDHRb]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2011). High credibility.

The purpose of this randomized clinical trial was to investigate the functional outcomes of the surgical treatment of distal radius fractures, comparing treatment by external fixation and percutaneous pinning to open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using a plate.

We randomized 53 patients with distal radius fractures that failed closed reduction and casting to ORIF (n = 27) or external fixation (n = 26). For pragmatic reasons, the choice of ORIF was left to the surgeon's discretion (early recruitment, dorsal plates [n = 9]; later recruitment, volar locked plates [n = 18]). Outcomes were measured before surgery, at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, and 12 months and included the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand, range of motion, grip strength, and serial radiographic analysis. Generalized linear modeling using repeated measures was used to identify differences in outcome scores between fixation types over time. Other continuous variables were analyzed using the Student t-test or one-way analysis of variance for multiple groups.

There were no differences in the demographic characteristics or fracture severity between groups. Based on generalized linear modeling, on average, the ORIF group scored 11 points lower on the PRWE across all time points compared to the external fixation group. The PRWE detected higher pain and disability with external fixation before surgery, at 6 weeks, and at 3 months. Using generalized linear modeling, a post hoc subgroup analysis identified significantly better outcomes in one group.

### A unified approach to outcomes assessment for distal radius fractures [^116sqmfU]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures are among the most common upper extremity injuries. Currently, outcome assessment after treatment of these injuries varies widely concerning the measures used, timing of assessment, and the endpoints considered. A more consistent approach to outcomes assessment would provide a standard to assess treatment options and best practices. In this summary, we review the consensus regarding outcomes assessment after distal radius fractures and propose a systematic approach that integrates performance, patient-reported outcomes, pain, complications, and radiographs.

### Giant cell tumor of distal radius after open reduction internal fixation for distal radius fracture [^111adf7c]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures (DRFs) are among the most common injuries treated by orthopaedic surgeons, with volar locked plating being a common approach for managing operative fractures. In the absence of malunion, patients with nonspecific pain following a healed DRF managed with internal fixation are inspected for hardware irritation. Device removal is indicated if there is concern for tendon irritation or attrition.

Giant cell tumors (GCTs) of the distal radius are low-grade malignant lesions that are locally aggressive and can metastasize to the lung and bone. The distal radius is the third most common location for a GCT. These tumors are most commonly seen in patients in the third and fourth decades of life at the metaphyseal-epiphyseal junction. Approximately 12% of patients with a GCT present with pathologic fractures at diagnosis. Surgical resection may be necessary with periarticular tumors due to extensive cortical destruction and soft-tissue extension, or substantial alteration of local bony architecture.

A unique case is presented of a GCT of the distal radius diagnosed 1.5 years after open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a DRF treated by volar plating in a 77-year-old woman. At the time of fracture management, there was no radiographic or clinical evidence of disease, suggesting that the tumor might have developed in the patient's eighth decade after ORIF of a DRF. Definitive management consisted of wide en bloc resection and osteoarticular allograft reconstruction of the distal radius, which resulted in local control and good clinical outcomes.

### Hand numbness and carpal tunnel syndrome after volar plating of distal radius fracture [^111Go3Vt]. Hand (2011). Low credibility.

Open reduction and internal fixation are becoming more popular, with an emphasis on alignment for good functional recovery, and it is more readily used to fix unstable fractures. Dorsal plating has a high incidence of extensor tendon complications, while volar plating has fewer soft tissue complications. The recent development of locking distal radius plates has increased the use of open reduction with internal fixation in the volar approach. Such volar locking plates are also useful for treating dorsally displaced distal radius fractures and comminuted osteoporotic intra-articular fractures.

The incidence of median nerve complications is of particular concern in volar plating for distal radius fractures. In this study, we report the incidence of hand numbness, carpal tunnel syndrome, and the outcome of median nerve neuropathy after volar plating of distal radius fractures.

### Hand surgeon reporting of tendon rupture following distal radius volar plating [^116ttLoo]. Hand (2016). Low credibility.

Volar plate fixation with locked screws has become the preferred treatment for displaced distal radius fractures that cannot be managed nonoperatively. This treatment, however, is not without complications. The purpose of this study was to determine what percentage of hand surgeons, over a 12-month period, have experienced a tendon complication when using volar plates for the treatment of distal radius fractures.

- **Methods**: A total of 3022 hand surgeons were e-mailed a link to an online questionnaire regarding their observation and treatment of tendon injuries associated with volar plating of distal radius fractures. Responses were reported using descriptive statistics.

- **Results**: Of the 596 (20%) respondents, 199 (33%) surgeons reported encountering at least one flexor tendon injury after distal radius volar plating over the past year of practice. The flexor pollicis longus was the most commonly reported tendon injury (254, 75%). Palmaris longus grafting (118, 37%) and tendon transfer (114, 36%) were the most often reported treatments following this complication. A total of 216 respondents (36%) also encountered 324 cases of extensor tendon rupture after volar plating of distal radius fractures, with tendon transfer (88%) being the preferred treatment option.

Both flexor and extensor tendon ruptures can be seen after volar plating of distal radius fractures. Surgeons should be aware of these complications. Critical assessment of hardware position at the time of the index procedure is recommended to avoid complications. Long-term studies are needed to standardize the treatment approach and minimize these risks.

### Evidence-based approach to timing of nerve surgery: A review [^114CbSYy]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Frequently, patients present with postsurgical nerve dysfunction such as radial nerve palsy after open reduction and internal fixation of humeral fractures, peroneal and/or saphenous nerve palsy after knee ligament reconstruction and/or dislocation, or ulnar nerve complications after medial or collateral ligament reconstruction of the elbow. The literature addressing timing in these contexts is highly variable. Generally, symptom severity and duration are thought to be indicators of potential for spontaneous recovery or need for operative intervention. Although the literature lacks consensus recommendations, close monitoring of nerve symptoms is recommended in the early postoperative period (up to 12 weeks).

### Does time to operative intervention of distal radius fractures influence outcomes [^112NCEMQ]. Hand (2022). High credibility.

No investigation has analyzed the time from injury to operative intervention and its effect on complications and functional outcomes in distal radius fractures. This study aimed to determine whether the time to surgical intervention from injury was associated with the observed rate of complications in distal radius fractures.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of all orthopedic trauma patients who came to our center was conducted from 2008 through 2014. Patients with closed distal radius fractures were included. A postoperative complication following distal radius fracture was defined as reoperation, superficial or deep infection, complex regional pain syndrome, new-onset carpal tunnel syndrome, tendon irritation, and symptomatic hardware.

- **Results**: In all, 190 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 48 years (SD ± 14.7). According to the AO-Müller/Orthopaedic Trauma Association classification, radiographs revealed 80 A fractures, 15 B fractures, and 95 C fractures. Thirty distal radii were fixed within 0 to 3 days after injury, 91 patients within 4 to 10 days, and 69 patients after 10 days. Overall, 28 complications (14.7%) were identified. There was no statistical difference in the rate of complications between the time interval groups (P = 0.17).

- **Conclusions**: Despite the increased popularity of surgical intervention for distal radius fractures, the optimal parameters to maximize patient outcomes have yet to be clearly defined. Time to intervention did not affect the rate of postoperative complications and range of motion.

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^113RtkEP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

During the past two decades, open reduction internal fixation techniques have been developed to address the comminuted intra-articular fracture of the distal radius. In some cases, a combination of more than one surgical method is used, such as external fixation, percutaneous pinning, and arthroscope-assisted surgeries. Despite advancements, complications are inevitable. Open techniques generally require extensive soft-tissue dissection and have been associated with higher complication rates than closed techniques. Wrist arthroscopy plays a vital role in the treatment of intra-articular fractures. Limited incision approaches and low-profile modular implants have been introduced to reduce complications.

The treatment of severely comminuted and intra-articular fractures of the distal radius remains a challenge for orthopedic surgeons. In 1908, Lambotte described the placement of a single pin into the radial styloid to stabilize a displaced fracture of the distal radius. Subsequent modifications of the technique were made by Stein and Katz in 1975, followed by Uhl, Lortat-Jacob, and Mortier in 1976, and intra-focal pinning by Kapandji in 1976 and 1986. These are only applicable to extra-articular fractures.

The role of percutaneous pinning in intra-articular fracture of the distal radius serves as an adjunctive procedure, complementing other treatment modes such as arthroscope-assisted closed reduction and internal fixation, open reduction internal fixation, or external fixation. This is due to the belief that pinning is not a stable method of fixation against deforming forces.

### Fractures of the distal part of the radius. The evolution of practice over time. Where's the evidence [^115Zbmab]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

During the administration of the oral (Part II) examinations for the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery over the past nine years, it has been observed that orthopaedic surgeons are opting more often for open treatment as opposed to percutaneous fixation of distal radial fractures. Evidence to support this change in treatment is thought to be deficient. The present study was designed to identify changes in practice patterns regarding operative fixation of distal radial fractures between 1999 and 2007 and to assess the results of those treatments over time.

- **Methods**: As a part of the certification process, Part II candidates submit a six-month case list to the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery. In the present study, we searched the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery Part II database to evaluate changes in treatment over time and to identify available outcomes and associated complications of open and percutaneous fixation of distal radial fractures. All distal radial fractures that had been treated surgically over a nine-year period (1999 to 2007) were reviewed. The fractures were categorized according to fixation method with use of surgeon self-reported surgical procedure codes. Comparisons of percentage treatment type by year were made. Utilization was analyzed by geographic region, and open and percutaneous fixation were compared with regard to complications and outcomes as self-reported by candidates during the online application process.

- **Results**: The proportion of fractures that were stabilized with open surgical treatment increased from 42% in 1999.

### Evaluating outcomes following open fractures of the distal radius [^111QyqYv]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

A paucity of evidence exists regarding the optimal treatment of open fractures of the distal radius. The purpose of this study was to compare short-term complication rates between various treatment options following open fractures of the distal radius.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective review of all open fractures of the distal radius at a single level 1 trauma center over a 10-year period. The primary outcome measure was the number of minor and major complications. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients across treatment and outcome groups were compared, and models were used to describe the relationships between outcome and treatment.

- **Results**: Ninety patients met the inclusion criteria for evaluation. An even distribution between high-energy (n = 45) and low-energy (n = 45) injuries was seen with 61 fractures Gustilo I (67%), 19 Gustilo II (22%), and 10 Gustilo III (11%). The majority of fractures were intra-articular (n = 48 AO type C vs. n = 42 AO type A/B). Fractures were treated with immediate open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) in 67 cases (74%), external fixation in 12 (13%), initial external fixation followed by ORIF at a later time in 8 (9%), or closed reduction and percutaneous pinning in 3 (4%). We observed 33 complications (37%), of which 24 were major and 9 were minor. Mechanism of injury and type of treatment were the only variables shown to correlate with an increased rate of complications.

- **Conclusions**: We conclude that open fractures of the distal radius treated by immediate ORIF at the time of index debridement can result in satisfactory outcomes.

### Is percutaneous pinning an outdated technique for distal radius fractures [^113jQvo6]. Injury (2019). Low credibility.

Distal radius fracture is a very common injury, representing 17.5% of all fractures seen in the emergency room. However, the most effective treatment remains unclear and is controversially debated. For ten years, there has been a revolutionary shift towards open reduction and fixation with volar locking plates, serving as an alternative to the previously less invasive treatment methods such as closed reduction and percutaneous k-wire pinning.

Several meta-analyses have compared clinical outcomes following closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with volar locking plate fixation. Volar locking plate fixation achieves better early functional recovery, improved radiological outcomes, and fewer minor complications. However, long-term results are similar for both fixation methods. Moreover, worse radiological outcomes and more minor complications noted after closed reduction and percutaneous pinning seem not to be clinically significant.

Interestingly, volar locking plate fixation continues to be more prevalent than percutaneous pinning in the operative care of distal radius fractures. Factors such as the age and profession of the surgeon, as well as the location and type of the clinic, seem to influence the choice of surgical treatment method. Furthermore, implant cost appears to play a minor role in the decision between closed reduction with percutaneous pinning and volar locking plate fixation.

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^117QKkk6]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Fractures of the distal radius are the most common fractures of the upper extremity, with 50% being intra-articular. The widespread use of radiographs, along with the direction and degree of displacement, and the presence or absence of articular injury, have led to the development of various classification systems. This begins with Nissen-Lie in 1939 and Gartland and Werley in 1951, followed by others such as Lindstrom, Older, Frykman, Melone, AO classification, Fernandez, Mayo Clinic classification, fragment-specific classification, and columnar classification.

Unlike the more common, lower-energy extra-articular fractures, intra-articular fractures of the distal radius represent a complex injury associated with considerable morbidity. Generally, the prognosis is less favorable for displaced, comminuted, intra-articular fractures. Longitudinal traction and manipulative reduction are generally ineffective because articular fragments often lack capsular or ligamentous attachments and thus do not respond to "ligamentotaxis" alone.

- **More aggressive treatment regimens**: These are generally required to anatomically restore the articular surface due to the inherent instability of the fracture and the tendency for articular fragments to settle after stress relaxation of the tensioned soft-tissue envelope.

The conventional modes of treatment include closed reduction and casting (either plaster of Paris or synthetic material), external fixation, or open reduction internal fixation.

### Closed fractures complicated by peripheral nerve injury [^1136GFjX]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Closed fractures may be complicated by associated peripheral nerve injury. However, because clinical information is limited, determining the best course of treatment is difficult. Most patients with closed fractures have a local nerve injury without nerve division; their prognosis for recovery is favorable. In the acute setting, immediate surgery is usually unwarranted because of the difficulty in accurately defining the severity and extent of nerve injury. When débridement of an open fracture or repair is not required, peripheral nerve injuries are best observed and the extremity treated with splinting and exercise to prevent loss of joint motion.

Patients who fail to demonstrate signs of recovery at 6 months, either clinically or with electrodiagnostic testing, should undergo exploration to maximize the likelihood for return of function. When, during exploration, the nerve is in continuity, intraoperative measurement of nerve action potentials should be done. Measuring nerve action potentials will determine whether nerve grafting, local neurolysis, or excision of the injured segment, accompanied by primary repair, is the most appropriate treatment.

### Distal radius fractures [^116bjLch]. The Journal of Hand Surgery, European Volume (2022). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on distal radius fracture:

- **Definition**: A DRF refers to a fracture of the radius near the wrist, typically within 2–3 cm of the distal end.

- **Pathophysiology**: The most common mechanism of injury for DRFs is a fall onto an outstretched hand with the wrist in extension. When the wrist is in dorsiflexion during the fall, it can lead to a Colles fracture, characterized by dorsal displacement of the distal fragment. Other mechanisms include a fall onto a flexed wrist, resulting in a Smith's fracture, characterized by volar displacement of the distal fragment, and a Barton's fracture, characterized by intra-articular involvement. High-energy trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents or sports injuries, and low-energy falls in older adults can also result in DRFs.

- **Epidemiology**: DRFs are among the most common fractures in the US, with an estimated incidence of 643,000 cases per year.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for DRFs include advanced age, osteoporosis, and participation in high-impact activities or sports.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with a DRF typically present with pain, swelling, and bruising in the wrist area, along with a limited range of motion. In some cases, an obvious deformity may be present if the fracture is severe or displaced. Patients may also develop nerve complications, such as ulnar nerve palsy.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for a DRF largely depends on the severity of the fracture and the patient's overall health. Generally, these fractures heal within a few months.

### A novel method of closed reduction and percutaneous pinning with six K-wires for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius [^1177hCEs]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Upon analysis of the results, within the first three months, 75% of patients experienced either no pain or only mild pain, and 70% of patients regained above 75% of their range of movement. Within this period, 50% of patients returned to either regular or restricted employment and had more than 50% of their contralateral grip strength.

At the end of six months, 97% of patients had either no pain or only mild pain. Within six months, 97% of cases returned to their original employment, either in regular or restricted form. Additionally, at the end of six months, 93% of patients regained either full or more than 75% of their grip strength, and 98% of patients regained either full or more than 75% of the normal range of movement.

- **Illustrations**:
	- **Figure 6**: Detailed analysis of the criterion "pain".
	- **Figure 7**: Detailed analysis of the criterion "functional status".
	- **Figure 8**: Detailed analysis of the criterion "grip strength".

### Functional outcomes for unstable distal radial fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation or closed reduction and percutaneous fixation. A prospective randomized trial [^111m9Uqt]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2009). High credibility.

Despite the recent trend toward internal fixation of distal radial fractures, few randomized trials have examined whether volar plate fixation is superior to other stabilization techniques. The purpose of the present study was to compare (1) open reduction and internal fixation with use of a volar plate and early mobilization with (2) percutaneous fixation and casting or external fixation for the treatment of dorsally displaced unstable extra-articular and simple intra-articular fractures of the distal part of the radius, with a specific emphasis on early functional recovery.

- **Methods**: A prospective randomized study was performed at two institutions. Forty-five consecutive patients with a displaced, unstable fracture of the distal part of the radius were randomized to closed reduction and pin fixation (n = 22) or open reduction and internal fixation with a volar plate (n = 23). Clinical and radiographic assessments were conducted at six, nine, and twelve weeks after surgery and at one year. Outcome was measured on the basis of range of motion, grip and pinch strength, and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores. A questionnaire was used to determine patient satisfaction, and a detailed analysis of complications was performed.

- **Results**: Patients in the open reduction and internal fixation group had superior Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand scores at six, nine, and twelve weeks. At six weeks, the average Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score was 27 in the open reduction and internal fixation group as compared with 53 in the closed reduction and percutaneous fixation group.

### Prevention and management of complications arising from external fixation pin sites [^113NDwFi]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Use of external fixation devices in the management of lower extremity trauma and reconstruction continues to rise. Despite the distinct advantages of external fixation, complications from external fixators still exist. The complex external fixator-associated pin site can be a potential source of significant morbidity, particularly in at-risk patients, leading to soft tissue healing problems, infections, and even osteomyelitis. This article describes both simple and complex techniques used in the prevention and management of complications arising from external fixator pin sites. It also offers solutions to the challenging task of incorporating external fixator wires into negative-pressure dressings.

### Radial nerve palsy in the setting of humeral shaft fracture [^111VzGP3]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

The upper limb has a complex anatomy comprised of many nerve and vascular structures, making humeral shaft fractures extremely important. Injury to the humeral shaft commonly occurs due to trauma and affects younger male or older female patients. The radial nerve travels along the spiral groove of the humerus, placing it at an increased risk of damage in humeral shaft fractures. If injured, there are a variety of classifications of radial nerve injury, different indications for exploration, and treatment methods that orthopedic surgeons have available in treating these injuries. This review aims to discuss the etiology of humeral shaft fracture-associated radial nerve palsy, tools for diagnosis, and treatment.

### Safety of immediate open reduction and internal fixation of geriatric open fractures of the distal radius [^111v5CuN]. Injury (2014). Low credibility.

There is a paucity of literature regarding outcomes of open fractures of the distal radius. No study has detailed this injury or treatment strategy in the geriatric population. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of immediate open reduction and internal fixation of geriatric open fractures of the distal radius.

- **Methods**: A total of 21 geriatric patients with open fractures of the distal radius treated with a single definitive procedure were identified from a prospectively collected database. We reviewed patient demographics, injury characteristics, and treatment specifics. Our primary outcome was surgical-site infection, defined by the need for antibiotics or repeat surgery. Our secondary outcome was the need for other re-operation. Patients were contacted and functional scores obtained.

- **Results**: Patients were followed up for an average of 26 months. One deep infection and one nonunion occurred, requiring repeat surgery. Four minor operative complications occurred, including stiffness requiring manipulation and prominent fixation devices requiring removal. Patients maintained an average wrist flexion-extension arc of 89° and pronation-supination arc of 137°. The average QuickDASH (shortened disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand questionnaire) score was 17.4, indicating minimal disability of the upper extremity.

- **Conclusions**: Immediate open reduction and internal fixation of geriatric open fractures of the distal radius yields adequate functional results with low risk of major complications.

### Percutaneous fixation with Kirschner wires versus volar locking plate fixation in adults with dorsally displaced fracture of distal radius: Randomised controlled trial [^116yJTuj]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

We enrolled patients from 18 centres in the United Kingdom; all trauma centres and surgeons included in the trial, and indeed in the UK, use both Kirschner wires and locking plates for distal radius fractures. The trial centres included both major trauma centres and smaller emergency hospitals.

Study participants were aged 18 or over and had a dorsally displaced fracture of the distal radius within 3 cm of the radiocarpal joint. The only other inclusion criterion was that the treating surgeon believed that the patient would benefit from surgical fixation of the fracture.

Patients were excluded if they presented more than two weeks after the injury, if the fracture extended more than 3 cm from the radiocarpal joint, if the fracture was open (Gustilo grading > 1), if the articular surface of the fracture could not be reduced by indirect techniques (in some fractures, the joint surface is so badly disrupted that the surgeon will have to open up the fracture to restore the anatomy under direct vision), if there was a contraindication to anaesthesia, or if the patient was unable to complete questionnaires.

- **Outcome measures**: Patients' characteristics and baseline (pre-injury) functional status were self-reported after they consented to take part in the trial. The primary outcome measure was the validated patient-rated wrist evaluation (PRWE). This rates wrist function in two equally weighted sections concerning the patient's experience of pain and disability to give a score out of 100, with 100 being the worst score. The PRWE, and secondary measures…

### Short term outcomes following open reduction internal fixation surgery for a distal radius fracture: 2 week versus 4 week immobilization. A retrospective analysis [^1119V7WH]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

The strength of this study is that it provides a pragmatic reflection of therapy outcomes, true to real-life scenarios. Limitations include the non-randomization of participants, lack of blinding of assessors, and retrospective data collection. There is a potential selection bias, as patients more motivated to return to work and function may seek an earlier hand therapy appointment than others. The generalizability of the research may be limited due to data being collected from a single referral source: one therapy clinic. An additional limitation is the involvement of multiple surgeons with varying skill levels.

### Fingerbreadths rule in determining the safe zone of the radial nerve and posterior interosseous nerve for a lateral elbow approach: An anatomic study [^115jVjz5]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Lateral approaches are commonly used for trauma and reconstructive cases around the elbow. The radial nerve (RN) is particularly at risk at the distal humerus while placing external fixator pins, intramedullary blocking screws, and in lateral extended approaches. Surgical procedures involving the radial head and neck require special precaution to avoid posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) lesions. Precise anatomic knowledge of the nerve's path is essential to avoid iatrogenic injuries. Injuries may be sustained by direct trauma or indirectly by soft-tissue retraction, impingement of instrumentation, or suture.

The RN pierces the lateral intermuscular septum of the arm and lateral border of the humerus from posterior to anterior at an average range of 10.2 to 12.5 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyle. The PIN courses along the anterior aspect of the radial neck; it is located 2.5 to 6.2 cm distal to the radial head depending on forearm rotation according to different reports.

Strategies to avoid iatrogenic RN injury during surgery include avoiding dissection too far proximally in the area of the nerve or alternatively, definitive identification of the RN and protection. Typically, the technique described by Gerwin et al. is used for extensile proximal approaches, in which the posterior cutaneous nerve of the arm is identified and traced proximally to its origin from the RN proper.

Strategies to avoid iatrogenic PIN injury include limiting the distal extent of the surgical approach and positioning the forearm in pronation or alternatively, identifying and protecting the nerve.

### A randomized prospective study on the treatment of intra-articular distal radius fractures: open reduction and internal fixation with dorsal plating versus mini open reduction, percutaneous fixation, and external fixation [^1172sVZq]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to compare two methods of surgical treatment for displaced intra-articular fractures of the distal radius: open reduction and internal fixation with dorsal plating (Pi Plate; Synthes, Paoli, PA) versus mini open reduction with percutaneous K-wire and external fixation.

- **Methods**: Patients with AO type C intra-articular distal radius fractures were randomized into two groups: open reduction and internal fixation with dorsal plating, or external fixation and K-wires and mini-open reduction. Patients over the age of 70 years with any associated soft-tissue or skeletal injury to the same limb, and those with pre-existing wrist arthrosis or disability, were excluded from the study. Objective, subjective, and radiographic outcomes were assessed at 2 weeks, 4 to 6 weeks, 10 to 12 weeks, 6 months, and 1- and 2-year intervals. The minimum follow-up period was 6 months, with an average follow-up period of 18 months. The principal outcome analyzed was the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score. Secondary outcomes included grip strength, range of motion, surgical procedure time, complications, and radiographic parameters. The groups were equal with respect to age, gender, fracture subtype, and number of workers' compensation cases.

- **Results**: No significant difference was found in the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores, our primary outcome. The dorsal plate group, however, showed a higher complication rate compared with the external fixator group. The plate group had significantly longer tourniquet times compared with the external fixator group.

### Does simultaneous fixation of both distal radius and distal ulnar fractures improve outcomes? A retrospective cohort study [^1178Tggo]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

Distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures are often found in conjunction with distal radius fractures. However, there is no consensus on optimal management. The purpose of this study was to determine whether simultaneous fixation of both distal radius and distal ulnar fractures would improve outcomes.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients treated for distal radial fractures over a four-year period at our trauma center were identified, and their medical records were analyzed. Twenty-three patients met the inclusion criteria for this study. All radius fractures were fixed using a volar locking plate. Fourteen ulnar fractures were treated with surgical fixation, and nine were treated conservatively. Data were collected on patient demographics, mechanism of injury, whether it was a closed or open fracture, Gustilo classification, AO/OTA classification, immobilization period, follow-up period, and type of treatment. Physical findings comprising the active range of motion and grip strength and radiological findings, including the ulnar variance compared to the healthy side and bone union, were evaluated. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference between the groups in the quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores, but the arc of dorsi-palmar flexion was more restricted in the operative group than in the conservative group. Other results were not significantly different between the two groups. Fixation of distal metaphyseal ulnar fractures can be challenging.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute hand and wrist trauma [^112DVeLW]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for distal radius fracture, specifically in relation to diagnostic imaging, the ACR 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining any of the following as the next imaging study for adult patients with suspected wrist tendon or ligament trauma when radiographs indicate an acute wrist fracture:

- **Magnetic resonance arthrography**: This can provide detailed images of the wrist, aiding in the assessment of soft tissue injuries.
- **MRI without IV contrast**: Offers a comprehensive view of the wrist structure, useful for identifying soft tissue abnormalities.
- **CT arthrography**: Useful for detailed bony architecture imaging and joint space evaluation.
- **Ultrasound**: Provides real-time imaging useful for assessing tendon and ligament integrity.

### Iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury after the surgical treatment of displaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus: Number needed to harm, a systematic review [^114zgRW9]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2010). Low credibility.

Supracondylar fractures of the humerus are common pediatric elbow injuries. Most displaced or angulated fractures are treated by closed reduction and percutaneous pinning, using either a crossed pin or lateral pin configuration. This study conducted a systematic review to determine if there is an increased risk of iatrogenic nerve injury associated with the crossed pin configuration.

- **Methods**: Relevant articles were identified by searching electronic databases and hand searching related journals and conference proceedings. Within each trial, the risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury was calculated for each pinning technique. For studies comparing crossed versus lateral pinning, the resulting trial-based differences in risk estimates were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. The number needed to harm was determined using the pooled risk difference.

- **Results**: Thirty-two trials consisting of 2,639 patients were used in the pooled analysis. The pooled risk difference of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury is 0.035 (95% confidence interval, 0.014–0.056), with a higher incidence of injury in the crossed pinning group. The weighted number needed to harm for the crossed pinning is 28 (95% confidence interval, 17–71).

- **Conclusions**: The results of this review suggest that there is an iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury for every 28 patients treated with crossed pinning compared with lateral pinning. Further research is necessary to ensure that the optimal pinning technique is chosen to treat these fractures.

- **Level of evidence**: Level III.

### What is the relative effectiveness of the various surgical treatment options for distal radius fractures? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1157hu5o]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). High credibility.

Many acceptable treatment options exist for distal radius fractures (DRFs); however, a simultaneous comparison of all methods is difficult using conventional study designs.

- **Questions/Purposes**: We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on DRF treatment to answer the following questions: Compared with nonoperative treatment, (1) which intervention is associated with the best 1-year functional outcome? (2) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of overall complications? (3) Which intervention is associated with the lowest risk of complications requiring operation?

- **Methods**: Ten databases were searched from inception to July 25, 2019. Search and analysis reporting adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Included studies were English-language RCTs that assessed at least one surgical treatment arm for adult patients with displaced DRFs, with less than 20% loss to follow-up. We excluded RCTs reporting on patients with open fractures, extensive bone loss, or ipsilateral upper extremity polytrauma. Seventy RCTs (n = 4789 patients) were included. Treatments compared were the volar locking plate, bridging external fixation, nonbridging external fixation, dynamic external fixation, percutaneous pinning, intramedullary fixation, dorsal plating, fragment-specific plating, and nonoperative treatment. Subgroup analyses were conducted for intraarticular fractures, extraarticular fractures, and patients with an average age greater than 60 years. Mean (range) patient age was 59 years.

### Surgical treatment and outcomes in 45 cases of posterior interosseous nerve entrapments and injuries [^114pNSPV]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2006). Low credibility.

The authors report data on 45 surgically treated posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) entrapments or injuries.

- **Methods**:
	- Forty-five PIN entrapments or injuries were managed surgically between 1967 and 2004 at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) or Stanford University Medical Center. Patient charts were reviewed retrospectively. The LSUHSC grading system was used to assess PIN-innervated muscle function.

	**Injury mechanisms**:
	- Injuries were caused by nontraumatic (21 PIN entrapments and four tumors) and traumatic (nine lacerations, eight fractures, and three contusions) mechanisms.

	**Presentations**:
	- Presentations included weakness in the extensor carpi ulnaris muscle, causing compromised wrist extension and radial drift; extensor digitorum, indicis, and digiti minimi muscles with paretic finger extension; extensor pollicis brevis and longus muscles with weak thumb extension; and abductor pollicis longus muscle with rare decreased thumb abduction due to substitutions of the median nerve-innervated abductor pollicis brevis muscle and, at 90 degrees, the extensor pollicis brevis and longus muscles.

	**Preoperative evaluations**:
	- Preoperative evaluations consisted of electromyography and nerve conduction studies, elbow and forearm plain X-ray films, and magnetic resonance imaging for tumor detection.

	**Surgical findings and treatments**:
	- At surgery, in-continuity lesions were found in 21 entrapments and three fracture-related and three contusion injuries; all transmitted nerve action potentials (NAPs) and were treated with neurolysis. Five fracture-related PIN injuries, one of which was a lacerating injury, were in continuity and transmitted no NAPs; graft replacement was necessary.

### Fingerbreadths rule in determining the safe zone of the radial nerve and posterior interosseous nerve for a lateral elbow approach: An anatomic study [^117SQcS1]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Several studies have measured the distances from different landmarks to the radial nerve (RN) or posterior interosseous nerve (PIN), with a wide range of variability across series. Intuitively, it seems that it would not be safe to consider a standardized safe zone distance for every individual, as these lengths vary across series and according to the relative size of the arm. Moreover, it is important to note that these distances will vary not only according to forearm position but also according to which segment of the bone the nerve is being measured.

In this study, we determined fixed parameters, such as two and four fingerbreadths and the diameter of the radial head or capitellum width, to serve as guides to determine a safe zone for the PIN and RN. As both the RN and PIN have an oblique trajectory along the lateral humerus and radius, we measured different sites where these nerves might be damaged either directly or indirectly during surgical procedures. We also measured the average distance of the PIN from the lateral epicondyle as it crosses the ulnohumeral joint to prevent injury when deeper dissection to the anterior capsule is needed. This distance has not been previously reported and might be of interest to surgeons, especially when working on the anterior capsule during soft-tissue releases for stiff elbows.

The four-finger rule may be applied as a safe zone rule for the RN at the intermuscular membrane and mid-lateral portion of the humerus. While using this rule, the RN may be injured along the anterior cortex of the humerus because this distance is shorter than expected.

### Distal radius fractures [^1127cAZW]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2009). Low credibility.

Distal radius fractures are a common injury, particularly in the elderly population. The severity of these fractures is directly related to the patient's bone mineral density, and clinical results are dependent on this parameter as well.

In terms of treatment, several options exist. Nonoperative management consists of closed treatment with casting. Operative treatment options include intrafocal pinning, nonbridging and bridging external fixation, arthroscopic-assisted external fixation, and various methods of open reduction internal fixation. When operative intervention is indicated, considerations include the characteristics of the fracture and the surgeon's experience with the treatment modalities.

### Assessment, management, and rehabilitation of traumatic peripheral nerve injuries for non-surgeons [^116oWXLM]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

The most common clinical indication for a SETS transfer is to augment recovery in severe ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. In this procedure, the anterior interosseous nerve is divided as it enters the pronator quadratus (PQ) muscle and is transferred to the motor component of the ulnar nerve in the distal forearm. It is conceptualized that by bringing healthy axons closer to the targeted intrinsic muscles of the hand (relative to the axons regenerating from the decompressed nerve at the elbow) improved motor recovery will occur. Several clinical papers have documented improved outcomes relative to historical controls, including one prospective, randomized trial. However, acceptance of SETS transfer surgery is not universal, and some authors doubt the degree of efficacy of the technique.

Although it is generally accepted that when available, nerve transfers produce better results than nerve grafting, literature on direct comparisons is sparse. Moreover, not all nerve transfers yield the same likelihood of good results for varying reasons. The superiority of nerve transfers becomes even more questionable when subnormal or recovering donors are used in the setting of pan plexus and multi‐nerve injuries. Although a comprehensive discussion of which nerve transfers have the best outcomes is beyond the scope of this review, the electrodiagnostic medicine specialist may benefit from conferring with their surgeon colleagues to ascertain which potential transfers might be under consideration. In addition, a further drawback to nerve transfers is that they are not always pos…

### Best practice for management of distal radial fractures (DRFs) [^111dCRXm]. BOA (2018). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for distal radial fractures, and more specifically with respect to closed reduction, the BOA/BSSH 2018 guidelines recommend considering non-operative treatment as a primary option for displaced DRFs in patients aged 65 years or older. Other factors, such as pre-injury function, medical comorbidities, and fracture characteristics, should also be considered. It is important to discuss all available options with the patient to ensure informed decision-making.

### Common fractures of the radius and ulna [^114pHq3f]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Fractures of the radius and ulna are the most common fractures of the upper extremity, with distal fractures occurring more often than proximal fractures. A fall onto an outstretched hand is the most common mechanism of injury for these fractures. Evaluation with radiography or ultrasonography usually confirms the diagnosis. If initial imaging findings are negative and suspicion of a fracture remains, splinting and repeat radiography in seven to 14 days should be performed.

- **Children**: Incomplete compression fractures without cortical disruption, called buckle (torus) fractures, are common. Greenstick fractures, which have cortical disruption, are also common. Depending on the degree of angulation, both types of fractures can be managed with immobilization.

- **Adults**: Distal radius fractures are the most common forearm fractures and are typically caused by a fall onto an outstretched hand. A nondisplaced, or minimally displaced, distal radius fracture is initially treated with a sugar-tong splint, followed by a short-arm cast for a minimum of three weeks. It should be noted that these fractures may be complicated by a median nerve injury.

- **Midshaft ulna fractures**: Isolated midshaft ulna (nightstick) fractures are often caused by a direct blow to the forearm. These fractures are treated with immobilization or surgery, depending on the degree of displacement and angulation.

Combined fractures involving both the ulna and radius generally require surgical correction. Radial head fractures may be difficult to visualize on initial imaging but should be suspected when indicative symptoms or mechanisms are present.

### Ultrasonographic evaluation of the iatrogenic peripheral nerve injuries in upper extremity [^113XXyRd]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of our study is to assess the efficiency of ultrasonography (US) in diagnosing peripheral nerve injury. This study includes nine patients — six with radial, one with median, and two with posterior interosseous (PIO) nerve injuries — diagnosed by clinical and electrophysiological methods over the past three years. Preoperatively, an ultrasonographic examination was performed and correlated with physical exam and surgical findings.

Five patients, diagnosed with peripheral nerve transection by US, underwent surgery. The ultrasonographic findings were concordant with the intraoperative findings. Axonal swelling alone was found in the remaining three patients, who were treated conservatively due to preserved nerve continuity without evidence of nerve compression. In one patient, we were unable to visualize the nerve due to obesity and soft tissue edema.

High-resolution US provides morphological information about the exact location, intensity, and extent of nerve injuries, facilitating preoperative diagnosis. Thus, US may be a useful method for planning optimal treatment strategies, especially in iatrogenic nerve injuries.
