## Question

In cystic fibrosis there's reduced Na absorption in the sweat glands, but increased Na reabsorption in GI tract and lungs? Can you explain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether, in cystic fibrosis, there is reduced sodium absorption in the sweat glands but increased sodium reabsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, and how to explain this apparent paradox. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core CFTR defect and its tissue-specific roles. Then, I should verify the direction of ion transport in sweat ducts versus secretory epithelia in the airways and gut. Next, I will examine the ENaC regulation by CFTR and how that differs by tissue. After that, I should reconcile the apparent contradiction with mechanistic explanations. Finally, I will confirm the clinical implications and whether modulator therapy changes these patterns, anchoring on high-quality sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental defect. CFTR is a cAMP-regulated chloride and bicarbonate channel expressed on the apical surface of epithelia, and in CF, loss of CFTR function impairs chloride/bicarbonate secretion and disrupts ENaC regulation, leading to abnormal salt and water handling across multiple organs, including sweat ducts, airways, and intestine [^1b0b14cb] [^70ea4b00] [^c88a424c].

> Now, I should verify the sweat gland physiology. In the sweat duct, CFTR normally enables chloride reabsorption, which electrically drives sodium reabsorption via ENaC, so the duct conserves salt. In CF, defective CFTR impairs chloride reabsorption, which secondarily reduces sodium reabsorption and yields high sweat chloride and sodium, explaining the diagnostic sweat test and the need for salt supplementation in hot climates [^ce11d658] [^b8e711b3] [^3ebe734a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the lungs and gut. In secretory epithelia such as airway and intestinal lining, CFTR's primary role is to secrete chloride and bicarbonate into the lumen, which osmotically draws water and maintains hydration. CFTR also normally inhibits ENaC-mediated sodium absorption, so when CFTR is absent or dysfunctional, ENaC activity is unchecked, increasing sodium (and water) reabsorption and dehydrating the surface, contributing to thick, viscous mucus and impaired clearance [^7c56bdee] [^b9d1c8c8] [^495ad73d].

> Wait, let me verify the ENaC regulation point because it is easy to misstate. I initially thought CFTR directly activates ENaC, but that would be backwards for secretory epithelia. I should correct that: CFTR normally inhibits ENaC, so loss of CFTR disinhibits ENaC, increasing sodium absorption and dehydrating the airway surface liquid, which is the "low volume" hypothesis of CF lung disease pathogenesis [^7c56bdee] [^b9d1c8c8] [^495ad73d].

> I will now examine the intestine specifically. In the GI tract, CFTR mediates chloride and bicarbonate secretion and restrains ENaC-driven sodium absorption. When CFTR is defective, chloride/bicarbonate secretion falls and ENaC-driven sodium absorption rises, altering luminal pH and contributing to meconium ileus, pancreatic enzyme insufficiency, and malabsorption, which are classic CF gastrointestinal manifestations [^5693f381] [^b5005d9f] [^ed9228a0].

> Let me consider the clinical implications to ensure internal consistency. The sweat test remains the diagnostic gold standard because the absorptive sweat duct is uniquely sensitive to CFTR dysfunction, whereas the secretory airways and intestine show the combined effects of reduced chloride/bicarbonate secretion and increased ENaC-mediated sodium absorption, producing dehydrated, acidic, viscous secretions that impair clearance and digestion [^46855b3e] [^ce11d658] [^1b0b14cb].

> Next, I should review whether modulator therapy changes these patterns. Highly effective CFTR modulators restore chloride and bicarbonate transport and reduce ENaC hyperactivity, which decreases sweat chloride and improves airway surface hydration and mucociliary clearance, aligning the physiologic directionality with clinical benefit across organs, though tissue-specific responses vary and sweat chloride remains a useful biomarker of CFTR function [^c5b115e3] [^3bd73473] [^ed712566].

> Putting this together, the apparent paradox resolves: in CF, sweat ducts show reduced sodium absorption because CFTR-driven chloride reabsorption is impaired, whereas airways and intestine show increased sodium reabsorption due to loss of CFTR's inhibition of ENaC, together producing dehydrated secretions and organ-specific disease manifestations that are mechanistically coherent and clinically observable [^ce11d658] [^7c56bdee] [^1b0b14cb].

In cystic fibrosis, **sweat glands lose CFTR-mediated chloride reabsorption**, which drives sodium and water loss and yields high sweat chloride/sodium [^ce11d658] [^b8e711b3]. In contrast, **airway and intestinal epithelia show increased ENaC-mediated sodium absorption** because CFTR no longer inhibits ENaC, dehydrating mucus and impairing clearance [^7c56bdee] [^b9d1c8c8]. This tissue-specific pattern reflects CFTR's dual role: it facilitates chloride reabsorption in sweat ducts but restrains ENaC in secretory epithelia; when CFTR is absent, sweat ducts cannot reclaim salt, while airways and gut over-absorb sodium, dehydrating secretions and causing disease [^70ea4b00] [^495ad73d].

---

## Sweat glands: reduced sodium absorption

- **Normal physiology**: In sweat ducts, CFTR drives chloride reabsorption, creating a negative potential that pulls sodium and water back into the duct, conserving salt and water [^ce11d658].

- **CF defect**: Mutant CFTR cannot reabsorb chloride, so sodium and water are not reclaimed, causing high sweat chloride/sodium and a risk of salt loss and dehydration [^b8e711b3] [^3ebe734a].

- **Clinical correlate**: Elevated sweat chloride (≥ 60 mmol/L) is a diagnostic hallmark of CF [^46855b3e].

---

## Airways and gastrointestinal tract: increased sodium reabsorption

- **Normal physiology**: CFTR secretes chloride/bicarbonate and inhibits ENaC, limiting sodium absorption and keeping airway/GI surfaces hydrated [^7c56bdee] [^c88a424c].

- **CF defect**: Absent CFTR removes chloride/bicarbonate secretion and ENaC inhibition, causing excessive sodium (and water) absorption, dehydrating mucus and impairing clearance [^7c56bdee] [^b9d1c8c8].

- **Clinical correlate**: Thick, viscous mucus leads to chronic lung infection, pancreatic insufficiency, and intestinal obstruction [^1b0b14cb] [^1fe16784].

---

## Tissue-specific differences in CFTR function

| **Tissue** | **Normal cftr function** | **Cf defect** | **Physiological consequence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Sweat glands | Chloride reabsorption driving sodium/water uptake | No chloride reabsorption | High sweat chloride/sodium; salt loss |
| Airways | Chloride/bicarbonate secretion; ENaC inhibition | No secretion; ENaC hyperactivity | Dehydrated mucus; impaired clearance |
| Intestine | Chloride/bicarbonate secretion; ENaC inhibition | No secretion; ENaC hyperactivity | Thick secretions; malabsorption; obstruction |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Sweat glands**: Salt supplementation and hydration are often needed to prevent hyponatremia and dehydration [^3ebe734a].

- **Airways**: Therapies target mucus hydration (hypertonic saline, dornase alfa) and infection control; CFTR modulators restore ion transport and reduce ENaC hyperabsorption [^1fe16784] [^c5b115e3].

- **Intestine**: Pancreatic enzymes and nutritional support address malabsorption; modulators improve GI function in eligible patients [^1fe16784] [^c5b115e3].

---

In sum, CF causes **reduced sodium absorption in sweat glands** (via lost chloride reabsorption) and **increased sodium absorption in airways and gut** (via unopposed ENaC), explaining the classic CF phenotype and guiding therapy [^ce11d658] [^7c56bdee].

2 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CF

CF is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by a mutation in each of the two CFTR genes. These mutations have differing effects on the assembly, function, and stability of the CFTR protein.CFTR protein is an ion transporter, primarily of chloride and bicarbonate, which can interact with other ion channels, such as epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). The CFTR protein is expressed in epithelial cells in various tissues and organs, primarily impacting the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract (including biliary system), and reproductive tract. People with CF have decreased reabsorption of chloride ions via CFTR channels in the sweat ducts leading to excessive salt loss and electrolyte abnormalities. The sweat test, which remains the best diagnostic test for CF, takes advantage of this increased concentration of chloride ions in the sweat of pwCF (≥ 60 mmol/L). The dysfunction of the CFTR channel leads to dehydrated, acidic, and viscous secretions on the surface of the epithelial cells. In the airways of pwCF, the CFTR dysfunction causes thick mucus, impaired airway clearance, chronic infection and inflammation, which leads to airway flow obstruction, bronchiectasis, and progressive decline in lung function. The thickened, dehydrated, acidic secretions can also block the pancreatic duct, biliary duct, intestinal tract, and/or vas deferens leading to pancreatic insufficiency, CF liver disease, intestinal obstruction, and infertility.

### State of progress in treating cystic fibrosis respiratory disease [^3f78bea1]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The first approved CFTR modulator, ivacaftor, is indicated for patients with CF with a specific mutation, G551D. This mutation results in a reduced probability of opening of the CFTR channel (an altered gating mechanism); there is a sufficient quantity of CFTR but there is impaired function of the channel. Ivacaftor potentiates the CFTR channel by increasing the probability of channel opening. A clinical trial in patients with CF with at least one copy of G551D demonstrated proof of this concept with a decrease in mean sweat chloride from approximately 100 mEq/L to approximately 51 mEq/L. More importantly, there were remarkable clinical benefits with an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second by 10.6% of predicted value, a reduction in risk of pulmonary exacerbations by 55%, an increase in weight and an improvement in quality of life. Similar results have been demonstrated in pediatric patients and ivacaftor has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients aged six years and above. There are important questions that remain to be answered, including whether the drug be used in newly diagnosed infants, will the drug work in other mutations (especially gating mutations), and will the drug have an effect on other manifestations of disease (for example, sinus disease, gastrointestinal absorption, reduction in inflammation in the airways)?

### Cystic fibrosis [^4cf15235]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Cystic fibrosis is a monogenic disease considered to affect at least 100000 people worldwide. Mutations in CFTR, the gene encoding the epithelial ion channel that normally transports chloride and bicarbonate, lead to impaired mucus hydration and clearance. Classical cystic fibrosis is thus characterised by chronic pulmonary infection and inflammation, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, male infertility, and might include several comorbidities such as cystic fibrosis-related diabetes or cystic fibrosis liver disease. This autosomal recessive disease is diagnosed in many regions following newborn screening, whereas in other regions, diagnosis is based on a group of recognised multiorgan clinical manifestations, raised sweat chloride concentrations, or CFTR mutations. Disease that is less easily diagnosed, and in some cases affecting only one organ, can be seen in the context of gene variants leading to residual protein function. Management strategies, including augmenting mucociliary clearance and aggressively treating infections, have gradually improved life expectancy for people with cystic fibrosis. However, restoration of CFTR function via new small molecule modulator drugs is transforming the disease for many patients. Clinical trial pipelines are actively exploring many other approaches, which will be increasingly needed as survival improves and as the population of adults with cystic fibrosis increases. Here, we present the current understanding of CFTR mutations, protein function, and disease pathophysiology, consider strengths and limitations of current management strategies, and look to the future of multidisciplinary care for those with cystic fibrosis.

Introduction

Cystic fibrosis (CF, OMIM #219700) is one of the most common life-shortening autosomal recessive disorders in populations of European descent, affecting about 1 in 4000 individuals. It is also present in most other ethnicities, but the disease frequency varies greatly. CF is caused by sequence variations in the Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR, OMIM #602421) gene on 7q31.2, which lead to absent or decreased chloride and bicarbonate transports across the apical membranes of secretory epithelial cells, elevated intracellular sodium and decreased extracellular water. This results in thickened secretions in affected structures (airways, pancreatic and biliary ducts, intestines and vas deferens). Although the severity of symptoms is variable, most patients with CF typically present progressive obstructive lung disease with persistent airway colonization and bronchiectasis, pancreatic insufficiency, gastrointestinal and nutritional anomalies, abnormally high sweat chloride levels and male infertility due to absent or occluded vasa deferentia. Early detection of CF through newborn screening programs is of major importance for the improvement of both survival and quality of life of patients.

Abstract

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by variants in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conduction regulator (CFTR) protein. Loss of CFTR function disrupts chloride, bicarbonate and regulation of sodium transport, producing a cascade of mucus obstruction, inflammation, pulmonary infection, and ultimately damage in numerous organs. Established CF therapies treat the downstream consequences of CFTR dysfunction and have led to steady improvements in patient survival. A class of drugs termed CFTR modulators has recently entered the CF therapeutic landscape. These drugs differ fundamentally from prior therapies in that they aim to improve the function of disease‐causing CFTR variants. This review summarizes the science behind CFTR modulators, including their targets, mechanism of action, clinical benefit, and future directions in the field. CFTR modulators have dramatically changed how CF is treated, validated CFTR as a therapeutic target, and opened the door to truly personalized therapies and treatment regimens.

Introduction

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein is located on the apical membrane of epithelial cells in multiple organs, including lung, sweat gland, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas, and its dysfunction is responsible for the clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) –. CFTR is a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent chloride and bicarbonate transport channel and plays an important role in maintaining salt and water balance on the epithelial surface. Defective CFTR channel function lowers the water content in the lumen, which leads to the development of a thick and viscous mucus on the epithelial surfaces in CF-affected organs. To date, more than 2000 CFTR mutations have been identified since the first discovery of CF in 1938. CFTR mutations are classified into six categories according to the primary molecular defect of the CFTR protein: synthesis (class I), trafficking process (II), gating (III), conductance (IV), mRNA stability (V), and CFTR stability (VI).

Pathophysiology of disease in cystic fibrosis

CF is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from the inheritance of a mutant allele of the gene for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) from each parent. CFTR is a c-AMP-regulated anion channel normally expressed on the apical surfaces of specialized epithelial cells, including those of the sweat glands, pancreas, and gastrointestinal and reproductive tracts, as well as airway epithelia and submucosal glands. Although the transport of chloride ions across membranes is a recognized and critical CFTR function, there are other proposed CFTR-mediated effects, such as transport of bicarbonate. Inheritance of mutant CFTR alleles is accompanied by a qualitative and/or quantitative reduction of CFTR activity at the cell surface; the extent to which CFTR activity is reduced influences the diversity and severity of pathophysiologic sequelae associated with CF. Individuals carrying a single CFTR mutation may retain as little as 50% of wild-type CFTR activity but are unaffected. Persons with CF (that is, carrying two mutant CFTR alleles) in which one mutation retains residual (but reduced) CFTR function have less aggressive disease phenotypes and better overall survival than their peers who carry mutations in which very little or no CFTR activity is retained.

Pathophysiologic manifestations of CF arise in several organ systems in utero. Neonates with CF are identified for further screening evaluation in part based upon elevated levels of circulating immunoreactive trypsinogen caused by pancreatic ductile or duct blockage, pancreatic autodigestion, and leakage of digestive enzymes into the systemic circulation. From birth, reduced CFTR activity in the sweat glands of people with CF hampers that individual's ability to recover salt from their sweat. This provides the basis for the definitive test for CF: pilocarpine-induced iontophoresis (the CF 'sweat test'), with the majority of patients having chloride concentrations in sweat exceeding 60 mEq/L. Reduced water and bicarbonate secretion in the gut may lead to meconium ileus in 10% to 15% of CF neonates. Finally, most, if not all, males with CF are born without a palpable vas deferens.

### Is it cystic fibrosis? The challenges of diagnosing cystic fibrosis [^0e9a6f43]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The spectrum of conditions caused by abnormal CFTR function is broad - from 'classic' cystic fibrosis (CF) to single organ conditions termed CFTR-related disorders. Defining and securing the diagnosis in an important minority of patients can be a challenge as the sweat test is equivocal or normal; the impact this has on the patient (at different stages of their life) can be very significant as it has the potential to lead to misdiagnosis and over (or under) treatment with associated psychological burden. The nasal potential difference test and intestinal current measurements are physiological measurements of CFTR function and thus can provide important diagnostic information. This article provides an overview of the latest developments in CF diagnostics, outlining the approach to be taken when the diagnosis is unclear and some of the areas of uncertainty.

### Sodium channels and cystic fibrosis [^f3868ce0]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) represents the rate-limiting step of sodium absorption across airway epithelia and thereby constitutes the major pathway for volume absorption from the airway surface liquid compartment. ENaC dysregulation leads to dehydration of airway surfaces in patients with cystic fibrosis, which in turn disrupts the primary innate lung defense mechanism, mucus clearance. The development of treatment strategies that address this defect is a logical and promising means of preventing or delaying the onset of this lethal lung disease.

### Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulators for cystic fibrosis: a new dawn? [^5a769a9c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting inherited condition in Caucasians. It is a multisystem autosomal recessive disorder caused by variants in the gene for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a cell-surface localised chloride channel that regulates absorption and secretion of salt and water across epithelia. Until recently, the treatment for CF was predicated on ameliorating and preventing the downstream symptoms of CFTR dysfunction, primarily recurrent respiratory infections and pancreatic exocrine failure. But a new class of therapy-the CFTR modulators, which treat the basic defect and decrease the complications of CF, leads to significantly improved pulmonary function, decreased respiratory infections and improved nutrition. The newest agent, a combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, will be suitable for approximately 90% of all people with CF and is likely to decrease the morbidity and significantly increase the life expectancy for most people with CF. The major barrier to their widespread introduction has been their cost, with many countries unwilling or unable to fund them. Nevertheless, such is their therapeutic efficacy and their likely potent effect on life expectancy that their advent has wider societal implications for the care of children and adults with CF.

CFTR gene is responsible for chloride transport across the epithelial cell membrane, which affects the generation of fluids in the lung, gastrointestinal system, and sweat. In the absence of a normally functioning CFTR protein, generated secretions become thicker and more viscous. The mucus generated within the lungs cannot be adequately cleared and leads to recurrent infection, chronic inflammation, and colonization with resistant organisms. CF differs from non-CF bronchiectasis in that symptoms may present in early childhood and novel therapeutics that modify the CFTR protein have been shown to improve lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life. We present a general guide to the approach to cystic fibrosis in adults. For pediatric management please refer to the Pediatric Pulmonology rotation guide.

Potentiators enhance the function of CFTR protein that has reached the cell surface. Multiple trials have examined potentiator therapy with or without combination corrector therapy.

In the first trial, published in 2011, ivacaftor alone was associated with improvements in lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, symptoms, weight, and sweat chloride concentrations, compared with placebo, in patients with the G551D mutation. Combination therapies with a potentiator and a corrector were associated with similar efficacy in patients with various genotypes. In a trial published in 2019, triple-combination therapy with two modulators with a potentiator was associated with improvement in lung function and fewer exacerbations in the 90% of CF patients with either one or two copies of the Phe508del CFTR mutation.

### Bicarbonate in cystic fibrosis [^73610a4d]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis (CF, mucoviscidosis) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is a chloride and bicarbonate channel necessary for fluid secretion and extracellular alkalization. For a long time, research concentrated on abnormal Cl - and Na + transport, but neglected bicarbonate as a crucial factor in CF.

Methods

The present short review reports early findings as well as recent insights into the role of CFTR for bicarbonate transport and its defects in CF.

Results

The available data indicate impaired bicarbonate transport not only in pancreas, intestine, airways, and reproductive organs, but also in salivary glands, sweat duct and renal tubular epithelial cells. Defective bicarbonate transport is closely related to the impaired mucus properties and mucus blocking in secretory organs of CF patients, causing the life threatening lung disease.

Conclusions

Apart from the devastating lung disease, abrogated bicarbonate transport also leads to many other organ dysfunctions, which are outlined in the present review.

### Introduction [^5693f381]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2017). Medium credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) themes in cystic fibrosis (CF) state that CFTR mutations have significant impact on epithelial surfaces throughout the GI tract, altering salt, water, and pH balance and leading to pathophysiologic cascades unique to people with CF that necessitate management approaches different than those for the general population. Because of this altered pathophysiology, many disease presentations in people with CF are different and distinct from those observed in the general population, and early recognition of these atypical presentations may be critically important to management and long-term outcomes. As people with CF are living longer as a result of clinical advances in care, long-term consequences of impaired CFTR function together with intrinsic, extrinsic, environmental, and medication effects and chronic inflammation may be part of the pathophysiology leading to an increased incidence of GI cancers, and clinicians must be cognizant of these factors as people with CF live longer and the early detection of GI malignancies becomes increasingly important.

### Macromolecular interactions and ion transport in cystic fibrosis [^a316d010]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease caused by autosomal recessive mutations of the CF transmembrane regulator, CFTR. CFTR functions in the plasma membrane of epithelial cells lining the lung, pancreas, liver, intestines, sweat duct, and the epididymis. The primary problem in CF is that mutations in CFTR affect its ability to be made, processed, and trafficked to the plasma membrane and/or its function as a Cl(-) channel and conductance regulator. Many proteins and processes normally interact with normal CFTR throughout its life cycle and mutant CFTR during the disease process. Understanding the function of these proteins and processes is expected to provide a clearer understanding of how normal CFTR is involved in salt movement and how mutant CFTR is handled by the cell and leads to the pathophysiology of CF. Recently, efforts to find therapies that correct defective CFTR have been intensifying. To facilitate our understanding of normal and mutant CFTR and the identification of new drug targets for developing novel therapies, a panel of experts was convened by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to explore the critical questions, challenges, and current opportunities to highlight new areas of research that would facilitate a integrated understanding of the processes and proteins that impact CFTR. The meeting highlighted the multiple pathways and interacting proteins involved in CFTR folding and biosynthesis, processing, and trafficking. A number of critical areas for future study were identified. Although these therapies are promising, a big question remains as to whether simply correcting defective CFTR will lead to significant improvement in patient health or whether the symptoms manifested in CF will require therapies in addition to those that target defective CFTR specifically.

### Mucus, mucins, and cystic fibrosis [^7c56bdee]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is both the most common and most lethal genetic disease in the Caucasian population. CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and is characterized by the accumulation of thick, adherent mucus plaques in multiple organs, of which the lungs, gastrointestinal tract and pancreatic ducts are the most commonly affected. A similar pathogenesis cascade is observed in all of these organs: loss of CFTR function leads to altered ion transport, consisting of decreased chloride and bicarbonate secretion via the CFTR channel and increased sodium absorption via epithelial sodium channel upregulation. Mucosa exposed to changes in ionic concentrations sustain severe pathophysiological consequences. Altered mucus biophysical properties and weakened innate defense mechanisms ensue, furthering the progression of the disease. Mucins, the high-molecular-weight glycoproteins responsible for the viscoelastic properties of the mucus, play a key role in the disease but the actual mechanism of mucus accumulation is still undetermined. Multiple hypotheses regarding the impact of CFTR malfunction on mucus have been proposed and are reviewed here. (a) Dehydration increases mucin monomer entanglement, (b) defective Ca 2+ chelation compromises mucin expansion, (c) ionic changes alter mucin interactions, and (d) reactive oxygen species increase mucin crosslinking. Although one biochemical change may dominate, it is likely that all of these mechanisms play some role in the progression of CF disease. This article discusses recent findings on the initial cause(s) of aberrant mucus properties in CF and examines therapeutic approaches aimed at correcting mucus properties.

### Cell signaling and regulation of CFTR expression in cystic fibrosis cells in the era of high efficiency modulator therapy [^c88a424c]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2023). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP- and protein kinase A (PKA)-regulated channel, expressed on the luminal surface of secretory and absorptive epithelial cells. CFTR has a complex, cell-specific regulatory network playing a major role in cAMP- and Ca 2+ -activated secretion of electrolytes. It secretes intracellular Cl - and bicarbonate and regulates absorption of electrolytes by differentially controlling the activity of the epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) in colon, airways, and sweat ducts. The CFTR gene expression is regulated by cell-specific, time-dependent mechanisms reviewed elsewhere [1]. This review will focus on the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational regulation of CFTR by cAMP-PKA, non-coding (nc)RNAs, and TGF-β signaling pathways in cystic fibrosis (CF) cells.

### CFTR, bicarbonate, and the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis [^bdffcfee]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

The gene that encodes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (CFTR) was identified in 1989, yet major pathophysiologic questions remain unanswered. There is emerging evidence that CFTR is a bicarbonate channel, a driver of chloride-bicarbonate exchange and through its action on local pH, a regulator of other ion channels and of proteins that function optimally in a neutral environment. In both the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, bicarbonate drives ionic content and fluid on epithelial surfaces, allows mucins to unfold and become slippery, and contributes to innate immunity. In the GI tract bicarbonate neutralizes gastric acid to support digestion and absorption. When CFTR is dysfunctional, lack of bicarbonate secretion disrupts these normal processes and thus leads directly to the clinical symptoms and signs of CF. This article synthesizes evidence from cell, animal, and human investigations that support these concepts. Bicarbonate secretion does not seem to be the same in all tissues and varies with physiologic demand. Thus, tissue type and whether conditions are baseline or stimulated needs to be taken into account when evaluating the evidence concerning the role of bicarbonate in the pathophysiology of CF as a regulator of local pH. Basic and applied research that focuses on the role of CFTR-mediated bicarbonate secretion helps explain many of the diverse clinical manifestations that are CF.

### Clinical practice and genetic counseling for cystic fibrosis and CFTR-related disorders [^64e5723f]. Genetics in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator-related disorders encompass a disease spectrum from focal male reproductive tract involvement in congenital absence of the vas deferens to multiorgan involvement in classic cystic fibrosis. The reproductive, gastrointestinal, and exocrine manifestations of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator deficiency are correlated with CFTR genotype, whereas the respiratory manifestations that are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis are less predictable. Molecular genetic testing of CFTR has led to new diagnostic strategies and will enable targeting of molecular therapies now in development. Older diagnostic methods that measure sweat chloride and nasal potential difference nonetheless remain important because of their sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the measurement of immunoreactive trypsinogen and the genotyping of CFTR alleles are key to newborn screening programs because of low cost. The multiorgan nature of cystic fibrosis leads to a heavy burden of care, thus therapeutic regimens are tailored to the specific manifestations present in each patient. The variability of cystic fibrosis lung disease and the variable expressivity of mild CFTR alleles complicate genetic counseling for this autosomal recessive disorder. Widespread implementation of newborn screening programs among populations with significant cystic fibrosis mutation carrier frequencies is expected to result in increasing demands on genetic counseling resources.

### Ion channels as targets to treat cystic fibrosis lung disease [^b9d1c8c8]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2018). Low credibility.

Lung health relies on effective mucociliary clearance and innate immune defence mechanisms. In cystic fibrosis (CF), an imbalance in ion transport due to an absence of chloride ion secretion, caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and a concomitant sodium hyperabsorption, caused by dyregulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), results in mucus stasis which predisposes the lungs to cycles of chronic infection and inflammation leading to lung function decline. An increased understanding of CFTR structure and function has provided opportunity for the development of a number of novel modulators targeting mutant CFTR however, it is important to also consider other ion channels and transporters present in the airways as putative targets for drug development. In this review, we discuss recent advances in CFTR biology which will contribute to further drug discovery in the field. We also examine developments to inhibit the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and potentially activate alternative chloride channels and transporters as a multi-tracked strategy to hydrate CF airways and restore normal mucociliary clearance mechanisms in a manner independent of CFTR mutation.

### Nonclassic cystic fibrosis and CFTR-related diseases [^a2493fc7]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review the spectrum of disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene.

Recent Findings

The growing recognition of "atypical" cases of cystic fibrosis presenting in adolescence or adulthood and manifested by disease in only one or two organ systems, along with CF diagnostic criteria based not only on sweat chloride values but genetic screening and nasal ion transport measurements, have made the diagnosis of CF less straightforward for many clinicians.

Summary

This review seeks to clarify the key diagnostic criteria for CF and uses the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Consensus Diagnostic Guidelines and recent publications to discuss the characteristics of classic CF, nonclassic CF, and CFTR-related diseases.

### COVID-19 meets cystic fibrosis: for better or worse? [^ce9f80af]. Genes and Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common autosomal recessive life-limiting conditions affecting Caucasians. The resulting defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR) results in defective chloride and bicarbonate secretion, as well as dysregulation of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). These changes bring about defective mucociliary clearance, reduced airway surface liquid and an exaggerated proinflammatory response driven, in part, by infection. In this short article we explore the overlap in the pathophysiology of CF and COVID-19 infection and discuss how understanding the interaction between both diseases may shed light on future treatments.

### Cystic fibrosis gene modifier SLC26A9 modulates airway response to CFTR-directed therapeutics [^1b8f1613]. Human Molecular Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cystic fibrosis (CF; MIM:219700) is a common life-limiting genetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; MIM:602421) gene. CF affects multiple organs including the lungs, pancreas, sweat glands, intestine and male reproductive tract. Meconium ileus (intestinal obstruction at birth; ∼ 15% of patients) and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction occur early in life, while the majority of CF-associated mortality results from repeated pulmonary exacerbations and reduced lung function later in the course of disease. Individuals with the same CFTR mutations have variable outcomes across CF-affected organs. Mutation heterogeneity and several environmental exposures (such as infection history, secondhand smoke, and ambient air pollution) along with other genes beyond CFTR (referred to as modifier genes) also influence lung disease severity.

CFTR is an anion channel present in select epithelial tissues. CF-causing variants affect the amount of protein and/or the function of the CFTR channel at the apical membrane surface. For example, the most common CF-causing allele is a three base pair deletion resulting in the loss of a phenylalanine residue at position 508 in the CFTR protein, Phe508del (c.1521_1523delCTT; p. Phe508del). Phe508del represents ∼70% of all CF-causing alleles and results in only nominal CFTR levels at the apical membrane due to processing deficiencies; any residual mutant channel that does reach the cell surface exhibits reduced open probability and appears subject to rapid elimination. In contrast, the missense mutation G551D (c.1652G > A; p. Gly551Asp), occurring on at least one allele in ∼4–5% of individuals with CF (with varying geographical frequency;), results in cell-surface channel localization with defective gating.

### Vanzacaftor-tezacaftor-deutivacaftor for children aged 6–11 years with cystic fibrosis (RIDGELINE trial VX21-121-105): an analysis from a single-arm, phase 3 trial [^c5b115e3]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening, autosomal recessive disease caused by variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that affects more than 92 000 individuals globally. There are over 2000 CFTR variants, although F508del is the most common variant in tested populations with cystic fibrosis to date, and allelic frequency varies across geographical regions. CFTR variants can lead to decreased CFTR quantity and function at the cell surface, resulting in an inability to regulate chloride transport in tissues such as those in the lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands. Cystic fibrosis pathophysiology starts in intrauterine life, as suggested by a high prevalence of pancreatic damage, vas deferens occlusion, and meconium ileus in neonates with the disease and by infants having elevated concentrations of chloride in their sweat (characteristic of CFTR dysfunction). Poor nutrition, which is associated with pancreatic insufficiency and increased energy expenditure, has been associated with progressive loss of lung function and increased risk of death. Progressive lung disease might appear early in life, with pulmonary infection, inflammation, and structural lung damage occurring in children as young as 3 months.

CFTR modulators target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis by improving CFTR function systemically, including in the lungs and sweat glands. Elexacaftor–tezacaftor–ivacaftor, the current standard of care CFTR modulator therapy approved for people aged 2 years and older with cystic fibrosis and at least one eligible variant and who have access, improves lung function (as measured by both FEV 1% predicted and lung clearance index [LCI]), respiratory symptoms, and CFTR function (as measured by reduced concentrations of chloride in sweat). – Real-world data from people receiving elexacaftor–tezacaftor–ivacaftor showed that this drug combination modifies the disease course, improves survival, and reduces lung transplant rates.– Treatment with CFTR modulators early in life has the potential to prevent manifestations of cystic fibrosis. Although additional data are needed to determine the lifetime clinical benefits of early treatment with CFTR modulators, observational and registry studies have shown that children and adolescents who receive CFTR modulator treatment early in life (eg, at age 6 years) have higher mean FEV 1% predicted and lower rates of pulmonary exacerbations, hospitalisations, transplants, and death.

### Cystic fibrosis and the gut [^b5005d9f]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive disease caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The gene product, CFTR protein, has important manifestations in the intestine, pancreas and hepatobiliary system. Increased survival has caused CF to be primarily an adult disease today. Physicians must be knowledgeable as to the varied phenotype in the gastrointestinal tract. This review will outline the main gastrointestinal manifestations including a section on gastrointestinal malignancy in CF. Novel treatments treating the basic effect in CF are now being introduced and their effects on the gastrointestinal tract are discussed.

### TMEM16A potentiators: is there a need for new modulators in cystic fibrosis? [^4df83e71]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

On October 21, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a highly effective triple combination therapy (elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor) for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) with at least one copy of the F508del mutation in CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator). This combination therapy improved lung function, sweat chloride, weight, and quality of life in an unprecedented fashion for a folding mutation. Thus, the currently available highly active modulators have the potential to reach ∼90% of the population of patients with CF. This raises the question whether additional therapies for CF or other airway diseases related to CFTR dysfunction are still needed.

Given the remaining patients with CF without current highly effective treatment modalities, patients who cannot tolerate or who respond poorly to available modulators and the uncertainty of the treatment efficacy over time, the answer is a resounding yes. The question then is which mechanisms to target. Because lung disease is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, a main aim of CFTR modulators is to hydrate mucus by restoring airway surface liquid volume to facilitate mucociliary clearance (MCC). Homeostasis of airway surface liquid is tightly regulated and maintained by the balance of ion channel activities in the airway epithelium, including chloride secretion by CFTR and calcium-activated chloride (CaCC) channels, potassium secretion by large-conductance calcium-activated and voltage-dependent potassium (BK) channels, and sodium absorption by the epithelial sodium (ENaC) channels. Ion channels that compensate for defective CFTR therefore represent an important therapeutic target group.

### A new era in the treatment of cystic fibrosis: correction of the underlying CFTR defect [^7b0f4571]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by dysfunction or deficiency of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an epithelial chloride channel that has a key role in maintaining homoeostasis of the airway surface liquid layer in the lungs. More than 1900 CFTR mutations that might result in a disease phenotype have been identified; these can be grouped into classes on the basis of their effect on CFTR protein production, trafficking, function, and stability. In the past 2 years, landmark clinical trials have shown that correction of CFTR function leads to substantial clinical benefit for individuals with cystic fibrosis. These findings are ushering in a new era of cystic fibrosis treatments designed to correct the underlying CFTR defect caused by different mutation classes. With analysis of continuing trials and available patient registries, here we assess mutation types and the number and geographical distribution of patients who are likely to benefit from CFTR-correcting treatment.

### C.3623G > A mutation encodes a CFTR protein with impaired channel function [^1d150f17]. Respiratory Research (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by the loss or dysfunction of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel activity resulting from mutations. Clinically, chronic lung disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality for CF patients. Other symptoms include pancreatic insufficiency, elevated sweat electrolytes, gastrointestinal disorders, reproductive abnormalities, etc.

CFTR is a cAMP/cGMP-regulated chloride /bicarbonate channel primarily expressed at the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining airway, gut, and exocrine glands, where it is responsible for transepithelial fluid secretion and homeostasis. CFTR channel function is determined by the number of channels at the cell surface, the open probability of the channels, and the single channel conductance. Mutations in the CFTR gene alter one or more of these parameters, causing the impairment or loss of the channel activity. More than 2000 CFTR mutations have been identified, which can be roughly categorized into 5 groups based on the nature of defect(s). The classification of CFTR mutations helps define strategies to restore CFTR channel function based on mutation-specific defect(s). It should be noted that some mutations have multiple defects. For example, F508del, the most prevalent CFTR mutation, induces a maturation defect in CFTR protein; when this maturation defect is rescued, the mutant protein still exhibits defects in channel gating and stability at the cell surface. Among the 2000 plus known CFTR mutations, only a relatively few have been studied in detail both at the molecular level and for the specific disease manifestations. In order to better understand the disease of CF and develop effective therapies, there is a need to study the molecular characteristics of rare CFTR mutations to identify the defect(s), particularly for rare mutations seen in minority populations such as African-Americans.

### Introduction [^eb6a77cf]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2017). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) gastrointestinal (GI) management — research gaps and transplant-related cancer risk are highlighted as follows. Published literature is several years to decades old. Significant limitations in the interpretation of this literature exist because of changes in diagnostic technologies and management strategies, and there is a critical need to update clinical practice guidelines to reflect current practice. By identifying these gaps and potential clinical end points, published review articles have highlighted specific questions and areas for future collaboration. The emergence of the widespread use of CFTR modulators holds promise for improving CF-specific GI management, and close observation will be needed to determine the long-term effects of these therapies on GI function in CF and how that translates to disease management. Finally, the risk of esophageal, colorectal, biliary, and gallbladder cancers is significantly increased post lung transplant.

The sweat of patients with cystic fibrosis has elevated levels of sodium and chloride compared with that of nonaffected persons. The quantities of electrolytes lost in sweat may be of considerable magnitude, 1, 2 and are dependent on sweat electrolyte concentration and volume. Frequently observed hypochloremia in patients with CF living in the New Orleans area necessitates the use of salt supplementation. Excessive supplementation resulted in life-threatening hypernatremia in one patient. We wish to alert physicians to this complication of salt supplementation.

### Pharmacological treatment of the biochemical defect in cystic fibrosis airways [^a9a2f65e]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

The understanding of the biochemical defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) has advanced considerably since discovery of the CF gene in 1989 and characterization of its product. Studies showing that the abnormality in chloride flux could be corrected by transfection of wild-type cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) complimentary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) have led to gene therapy trials on both sides of the Atlantic. However, gene therapy as a treatment for CF has yet to be realized. Pharmacological manipulation of the biochemical defect may provide an alternative or complementary approach to treatment. This review will discuss pharmacological agents in development which could correct the abnormal ion movement. The mechanisms of action of these pharmacological agents can be divided broadly into drugs which affect the most common CF mutation, deltaF508, which increase trafficking of the mutant CF protein to the apical membrane; drugs which increase chloride secretion; and drugs which reduce sodium reabsorption across the apical membrane. Treatment options for cystic fibrosis have developed rapidly since discovery of the cystic fibrosis gene over a decade ago. The targeting of specific therapies for particular cystic fibrosis genotypes and the use of combination treatments of chloride channel openers with sodium channel blockers are likely to be key advances in the next decade.

### Update on pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis lung disease [^5b93cc2a]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

It has been an ongoing challenge to translate knowledge pertaining to the molecular basis of cystic fibrosis (CF) into a clear understanding of the development of CF lung disease. Various hypotheses have attempted to explain the apparent breach of innate defenses in CF, although a definitive explanation has been elusive.

Recent Findings

Recent data suggest that altered ion transport functions — namely sodium hyperabsorption and reduced chloride secretion — lead to a depletion of airway surface liquid. As a result, the overlying mucus layer may encroach upon cell surfaces and become adherent, thus interfering with cilia-dependent and cough clearance. These static, and ultimately anaerobic, niches provide a favorable environment for the development of bacterial biofilms and persistent infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Summary

With a better understanding of pathogenic steps leading to CF lung disease, we may now be able to direct the development of therapies that will substantially improve disease outcomes.

Introduction to Cystic Fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that is estimated to affect approximately 160,000 individuals across 94 countries. CF is caused by pathogenic mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. The CFTR gene encodes an anion channel that transports chloride and bicarbonate across the apical surface of multiple epithelial cell types in the lungs and other organs (Figure 1). The CFTR channel also regulates sodium transport via the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC. Reduced or absent functioning of the CFTR channel in the airways of people with CF results in a cycle of chronic pulmonary infection, inflammation, and progressive structural lung damage. Although yet to be fully elucidated, factors implicated in this include impaired mucus hydration and subsequent mucociliary clearance, as well as reduced pH that potentially leads to impaired bacterial killing (Figure 1). Extrapulmonary clinical manifestations can include chronic sinusitis and nasal polyps; exocrine pancreatic insufficiency leading to malnutrition, pancreatitis, and CF-related diabetes; liver and intestinal disease; bone disease; and reduced fertility in both men and women.

Figure 1.
Mechanism of disease. CFTR = cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; Cl − = chloride ion; ENaC = epithelial sodium channel; HCO 3 − = bicarbonate ion; Na + = sodium ion.

Since the identification of the CFTR gene in 1989, more than 2,000 different variants have been discovered, of which approximately 700 have been determined to be disease-causing mutations (,–). Seven classes of CFTR mutations have been identified, impacting either the quantity or function of CFTR protein at the cell surface (Figure 2).

Figure 2.
CFTR mutation classes. CFTR = cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; Cl − = chloride ion; HCO 3 − = bicarbonate ion.

An understanding of the effects of mutations on CFTR function has allowed for the development of small molecules that restore defective CFTR function caused by a subset of mutation classes; these treatments are known as CFTR modulators.

### Mechanisms of the noxious inflammatory cycle in cystic fibrosis [^85049979]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited autosomal recessive and lethal disease in caucasian population. It is due to mutations in the product of the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter is a membrane glycoprotein that functions not only as a cyclic AMP-regulated chloride channel in epithelial cells but also, as a reduced glutathione transporter. Moreover, CFTR can regulate other channels such as the outwardly rectifying Cl - channels (ORCC), epithelial Na + channels (ENaC), renal outer medullary K + channels (ROMK) or other inwardly rectifying K + channels. It is expressed in various organs such as lung, pancreas, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and sweat glands.

More than 1,500 mutations of CFTR have been identified. Mutations affect localization of CFTR at the apical plasma membrane and could interfere with its function and regulation. The most common mutation, deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (CFTRΔF508), results in a misfolded protein that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The lack of functional CFTR at the plasma membrane correlates with impaired ionic balance and modification of cellular homeostasis. This pathological aspect is well documented and is characterized by thick secretions. Thus, viscous and hyper-concentrated pancreatic secretions obstruct pancreatic ducts in CF patients accounting for the destruction of pancreas epithelium, which could promote inflammation. Concerning the respiratory system, airway obstruction resulting from the thick mucus and reduced clearance of inhaled particles, including bacteria, promotes persistent infection and chronic inflammation that are the major causes of death. However, even in the absence of bacterial or viral pathogens, exacerbated inflammation has been reported in the respiratory tract of CF infants. Hence, the origin of inflammation in CF has been a matter of debate and, recent data suggest that the retention of the misfolded protein could play a key role in the development and maintenance of the inflammatory response.

In the present review, we examine hypotheses of the coordinated and integrated pathophysiologic processes associated with CFTR defect retention in the ER that could lead to intrinsic inflammatory and apoptotic responses.

Cystic fibrosis epidemiology and genetics — key background points indicate that cystic fibrosis is the most common life-threatening autosomal recessive disease in the US, affecting approximately 1 in 4000 newborns in the US, and it is a multisystem disorder caused by mutations in the gene for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which encodes an ion channel protein, with more than 2000 mutations identified to date.

### Cystic fibrosis: a disease in transformation, yet more work to be done! [^3bd73473]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The article by Graeber and colleagues comes from five German CF centers and examines the effect of ETI on CFTR function in airway and intestinal epithelia, using CFTR biomarkers, SCC, nasal potential difference (NPD), and intestinal current measurement (ICM). The study included 107 patients with one or two F508del CFTR variants (55 with F508del and minimal function variant; 52 with F508del/F508del) over a 6-month period. Some of the patients with F508del/F508del migrated from tezacaftor/ivacaftor to ETI. The biomarkers show changes in the biomarkers in parallel with clinical change observed (Table 1 and Figures E2–E4). Only weak correlations were seen between CFTR biomarker response and changes in lung function with ETI (Figure 4).

Two key issues that emerge from this study include the gene–dose effects comparing variants with one versus two F508del alleles and the impact of ETI on different epithelial surfaces. The study seems to indicate that improvement in CFTR function in F508del /minimal function participants had a lesser impact on SCC than the F508del/F508del participants, suggesting a gene–dose effect in the sweat duct. Yet, changes in NPD and ICM (Table E6) did not demonstrate this dose effect in airway and intestinal epithelial surfaces. A related finding is the heterogeneity of biomarker response to ETI in individual patients, such as strong SCC and yet limited NPD ± ICM responses. The authors speculate that tissue-specific differences in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic responses to ETI and/or differences in genetic modifiers (e.g. inflammation/microbiome of the airway and GI versus sweat duct) may be responsible for these observations.

### Advancing clinical development pathways for new CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis [^be317eb0]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening genetic disease affecting approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide. Until recently, drug development efforts have emphasised therapies treating downstream signs and symptoms resulting from the underlying CF biological defect: reduced function of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The current CF drug development landscape has expanded to include therapies that enhance CFTR function by either restoring wild-type CFTR protein expression or increasing (modulating) the function of mutant CFTR proteins in cells. To date, two systemic small-molecule CFTR modulators have been evaluated in pivotal clinical trials in individuals with CF and specific mutant CFTR genotypes that have led to regulatory review and/or approval. Advances in the discovery of CFTR modulators as a promising new class of therapies have been impressive, yet work remains to develop highly effective, disease-modifying modulators for individuals of all CF genotypes. The objectives of this review are to outline the challenges and opportunities in drug development created by systemic genotype-specific CFTR modulators, highlight the advantages of sweat chloride as an established biomarker of CFTR activity to streamline early-phase development and summarise options for later phase clinical trial designs that respond to the adoption of approved genotype-specific modulators into standard of care. An optimal development framework will be needed to move the most promising therapies efficiently through the drug development pipeline and ultimately deliver efficacious and safe therapies to all individuals with CF.

### Targeting ion channels in cystic fibrosis [^dc1a1949]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2015). Low credibility.

Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause a characteristic defect in epithelial ion transport that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF). Hence, pharmacological correction of this ion transport defect by targeting of mutant CFTR, or alternative ion channels that may compensate for CFTR dysfunction, has long been considered as an attractive approach to a causal therapy of this life-limiting disease. The recent introduction of the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor into the therapy of a subgroup of patients with specific CFTR mutations was a major milestone and enormous stimulus for seeking effective ion transport modulators for all patients with CF. In this review, we discuss recent breakthroughs and setbacks with CFTR modulators designed to rescue mutant CFTR including the common mutation F508del. Further, we examine the alternative chloride channels TMEM16A and SLC26A9, as well as the epithelial sodium channel ENaC as alternative targets in CF lung disease, which remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Finally, we will focus on the hurdles that still need to be overcome to make effective ion transport modulation therapies available for all patients with CF irrespective of their CFTR genotype.

Cystic fibrosis — ivacaftor outcomes in patients with at least one G551D CFTR mutation: The authors observed a 48.1 mmol/L decrease in sweat chloride concentration in treated patients compared with placebo (P < 0.001), and the incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups, with a lower proportion of serious adverse events in those treated with ivacaftor compared with placebo (24 vs. 42%). Data published in abstract form reported similar results in 52 children, aged 6–11 years, with at least one G551D mutation treated with ivacaftor (150 mg twice daily). After 24 weeks of treatment, FEV1 increased 12.6% from baseline in the group receiving ivacaftor, compared with 0.04% in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). Overall, the committee rated the certainty of net benefit for ivacaftor in patients with at least one G551D CFTR mutation as high and the net benefit as substantial, and in vitro data suggest that there may be a role for ivacaftor in treating other mutations where CFTR protein is present at the cell surface, but there is insufficient information to make a recommendation for these.

### Cystic fibrosis: an overview [^7c5fd262]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common inherited disorders of white populations. The isolation and cloning of the gene in CF that encodes the production of a transport protein that acts as an apical membrane chloride channel, termed cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), have improved our understanding of the disorder's pathophysiology and has aided diagnosis, but has also revealed the disease's complexity. Gene replacement therapy is still far from being used in patients with CF, mostly because of difficulties in targeting the appropriate cells. Life expectancy of patients with this disorder has greatly improved over past decades because of better symptomatic treatment strategies. This article summarizes advances in understanding and treatment of CF.

### Cystic fibrosis since 1938 [^3f943fdc]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) was distinguished from celiac disease in 1938. Then, it was a pathologic diagnosis, life expectancy was approximately 6 months, and the autosomal recessive disease was believed to arise from abnormal mucus plugging exocrine ducts. Death often occurred from lung infection. Discovery of the sweat electrolyte defect in 1953 and standardization of the sweat test in 1959 allowed identification of milder cases, and CF was no longer considered only a disorder of mucus. In 1955, establishment of centers with programs of aggressive, comprehensive care initiated striking improvement in longevity. The pillars of care established then (attention to nutrition, airway clearance, treatment of lung infection) remain today. In 1983, chloride transport was identified as the basic physiologic CF defect, accompanied by increased sodium reabsorption. In 1980, we learned that inflammation contributes independently to lung disease and constitutes an independent therapeutic target. In 1989, the discovery of the CF gene demonstrated the basic defect to be in a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. This afforded new diagnostic tests, opportunities for research, and prospects for using the gene as therapy. Since then, substantial advances in basic and clinical research catalyzed therapeutic improvements: median survival age now exceeds 30 years. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation center network provides not only opportunity to conduct clinical trials but also means to disseminate new therapies. In the future, treatments directed at the basic defect can be expected, with concomitant improvements in morbidity and mortality.

Generalized genotype–phenotype correlations in cystic fibrosis — reproductive, gastrointestinal, endocrine, and respiratory associations are summarized. Reproductively, "Infertility is present in > 98% of males with 2 CFTR mutations in trans". Gastrointestinal correlations include "There is a strong correlation between pancreatic insufficiency and having two mutations (in trans) that both lead to a failure of the CFTR protein to reach the cell surface and/or block chloride conductance", and "Meconium ileus is predominantly associated with pancreatic insufficient mutations". Endocrine risk is summarized as "Pancreatic insufficient mutations confer the highest risk for CF-related diabetes". For respiratory disease, "Chronic, progressive lung disease is the predominant clinical feature of CF. CF-associated lung disease is highly variable, even in patients with the same genotype, and is influenced by both environmental factors and modifier genes". Additionally, phenotype patterns by functional class note that "Typically, Classes I, II and III mutations are associated with a classic CF phenotype, including pulmonary disease, elevated sweat chloride, pancreatic insufficiency, and male infertility", whereas "In contrast, classes IV and V mutations tend to be associated with a pancreatic sufficient phenotype and a later onset of symptoms (Mickle and Cutting 1998; Zielenski et al. 2000) or CFTR-related disorder".

### Sodium channel blockers for cystic fibrosis [^abc5d586]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

People with cystic fibrosis (CF) have increased transport of the salt, sodium across their airway lining. Over-absorption of sodium results in the dehydration of the liquid that lines the airway surface and (along with defective chloride secretion) is a primary defect in people with CF.

Objectives

To determine whether the topical administration of drugs that block sodium transport improves the respiratory condition of people with CF.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted principal investigators known to work in the field, previous authors and pharmaceutical companies who manufacture ion transport agents for unpublished or follow-up data. Most recent search of the Group's register: 19 December 2013.

Selection Criteria

Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials of sodium channel blockers compared to placebo or another sodium channel blocker or the same sodium channel blocker at a different dosing regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data. Meta-analysis was limited due to differing study designs.

Main Results

Five RCTs, with a total of 226 participants, examining the topical administration of the short-acting sodium channel blocker, amiloride, compared to placebo were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review. In three studies over six months, there was a significant difference found in the difference in relative change in FVC in favour of placebo (weighted mean difference 1.51% (95% confidence interval -2.77 to -0.25), although heterogeneity was evident. A two-week study demonstrated that hypertonic saline with amiloride pre-treatment did not result in a significant improvement in respiratory function or mucus clearance, in contrast to pre-treatment with placebo. There were no significant differences identified in other clinically relevant outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence that the topical administration of a short-acting sodium channel blocker improves respiratory condition in people with cystic fibrosis and some limited evidence of deterioration in lung function.

### TMEM16A potentiation: a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of cystic fibrosis [^a6db6014]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic multiorgan disease that is primarily associated with pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tract dysfunction. CF is estimated to affect 75,000 patients globally and is caused by loss of function mutations in the anion channel, CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). Impaired CFTR function results in defective fluid and solute transport across epithelia with consequences for the hydration status and pH of the mucosal environment. In the lungs, a major phenotype associated with the loss of CFTR function is a hyperconcentrated mucus gel that is poorly removed from the airways by mucociliary and cough clearance mechanisms, leading to chronic bacterial infection and a progressive loss of lung function. CFTR modulators, which can partially rescue the function of mutated CFTR, have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes in those patients genetically suited to these therapies and have received recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval. However, those patients who do not share mutations in CFTR that are susceptible to these drugs will require alternative therapeutics that are mutation independent.

CFTR-independent approaches to treat the ion transport defect in CF include targeting the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) with blockers to attenuate fluid reabsorption from the airways and increasing the activity of the Ca 2+ -activated Cl − channel (CaCC) to promote fluid secretion. Before understanding the molecular identity of the airway epithelial CaCC, denufosol, an inhaled P2Y2-receptor agonist, was developed as a treatment for CF lung disease. In vitro, the denufosol-mediated increase in intracellular Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+] i) activated the CaCC and attenuated ENaC function in cultured airway epithelial cells, resulting in a transient increase in airway fluid volume. The subsequent lack of clinical benefit of denufosol has been ascribed to the short pharmacodynamic activity of a compound that depleted intracellular Ca 2+ stores and desensitized the receptor. This would render the epithelium refractory to further stimulation by either residual denufosol or the endogenous P2Y2-receptor ligands, ATP and uridine-5′-triphosphate (UTP), potentially slowing mucus transport in the longer term. Furthermore, a global elevation of cellular Ca 2+ in the airway epithelium by denufosol also stimulated an acute goblet cell exocytosis that may have negatively impacted changes in lung function subsequent to the increased volume of mucus in the airways. The therapeutic utility of upregulating the CaCC pathway thereby remained an unanswered question.

### Atypical cystic fibrosis and CFTR-related diseases [^0d14e1ea]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF), which is among the most common life-shortening recessive illnesses, is caused by mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and typically involves chronic infection and progressive obstruction of the respiratory tract as well as pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Disease severity, to some extent, correlates with organ sensitivity to CFTR dysfunction and to the amount of functional protein, which is influenced by the type of mutation. Atypical CF represents approximately 2% of affected individuals, and includes cases presenting in adolescence or adulthood with pancreatic exocrine sufficiency, normal or borderline sweat chloride concentrations, or with a single predominant clinical feature. This review briefly describes diagnostic methods and phenotypic characteristics of classic and atypical CF, as well as CFTR-related diseases, conditions in which mutated CFTR may contribute to the pathogenesis but do not strictly fit established diagnostic criteria.

### Airway disease phenotypes in animal models of cystic fibrosis [^495ad73d]. Respiratory Research (2018). Low credibility.

CF lung disease pathophysiology

Understanding the underlying pathophysiology of CF lung disease is necessary prior to examining the phenotypes observed in animal models. Under normal conditions, the CFTR protein functions as an epithelial anion channel responsible for cyclic-AMP-dependent chloride and bicarbonate secretion, as well as the regulation of epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). CF arises when mutations occur in the CFTR gene, subsequently disrupting epithelial ion transport. To date, over 2000 disease-causing CFTR mutations have been identified. These mutations are classified into 6 categories based on the mechanism of CFTR dysfunction including defective protein synthesis and processing, dysfunctional channel regulation and conduction, and reduced protein synthesis and stability. The most common CF-causing mutation is the Class II mutation Phe508del, with approximately 90% of CF patients carrying one copy.

Although the role of CFTR in transepithelial ion transport is widely accepted, the exact mechanisms underlying CF lung disease development have long been debated. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. The leading theory with a large body of supporting evidence is known as the "low volume" hypothesis. This theory postulates that reduced transepithelial chloride transport due to dysfunctional CFTR, as well as increased sodium absorption caused by a lack of CFTR-dependent inhibition of ENaC, creates an ion imbalance that leads to osmotically-driven water absorption into the tissues, and in turn, reduced airway surface layer (ASL) hydration. The depleted ASL results in dehydration of the mucus layer and consequently, viscous mucus adheres to airway surfaces. Onset of mucus-stasis and impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC) result in ineffective removal of inhaled microorganisms. Bacteria adhere to the airway mucus eventually resulting in the formation of biofilms that effectively evade antimicrobial substances and host neutrophils. Over time, more resistant and atypical organisms colonise the airways including mycobacteria, yeast, and fungus. A state of chronic lung infection incites persistent inflammatory responses that lead to destruction of the airway tissue, bronchiectasis, progressive loss of lung function, and ultimately respiratory failure.

### Pharmacological therapy for cystic fibrosis: from bench to bedside [^68bd96ee]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2011). Low credibility.

With knowledge of the molecular behaviour of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), its physiological role and dysfunction in cystic fibrosis (CF), therapeutic strategies are now being developed that target the root cause of CF rather than disease symptoms. Here, we review progress towards the development of rational new therapies for CF. We highlight the discovery of small molecules that rescue the cell surface expression and defective channel gating of CF mutants, termed CFTR correctors and CFTR potentiators, respectively. We draw attention to alternative approaches to restore epithelial ion transport to CF epithelia, including inhibitors of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) and activators of the Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel TMEM16A. The expertise required to translate small molecules identified in the laboratory to drugs for CF patients depends on our ability to coordinate drug development at an international level and our ability to provide pertinent biological information using suitable disease models.

Introduction

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most frequent and severe rare genetic disease in Caucasian population, with a recessive modality of inheritance and an incidence observed in 1/2000–3000 newborns.

More than 2000 variants of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene have been described (2114 variants, based on the CFTR1 database, last accessed on July 2023). Their combined inheritance gives rise to genotypes with different courses and severities of symptoms in various affected organs.

CFTR is a transmembrane protein channel that is expressed in most epithelial tissues, regulating ion exchange. In particular, it is responsible for chloride, bicarbonate, and water efflux in the epithelia, preventing sodium-channel-driven water reabsorption, thus balancing water exchange and preserving tissue hydration and mucus fluidity and function. CFTR role is particularly relevant in respiratory, digestive and reproductive tracts, where mutated CFTR results in diseased tissues, with the most severe and life-threatening pathogenic effects occurring in the respiratory system. In fact, in the lungs of CF patients, the thick and dense mucus leads to infections, chronic inflammation, severe tissue damage, and finally, respiratory failure.

### Unmet needs in cystic fibrosis [^781bd7ae]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem illness caused by abnormalities in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and protein. CFTR is an ion channel regulating transport of chloride, bicarbonate, and water, and influencing sodium resorption. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder, and with about 70,000 CF patients worldwide, it is the most common life shortening disease among persons of European descent. CFTR disease-causing mutations have been organized into six classes.:

Areas Covered

Recently, small molecule targeted therapy for specific classes of CFTR abnormalities have included CFTR correctors that decrease protein degradation and CFTR potentiators that increase channel open probability enhancing chloride transport.

Expert Opinion

Although there are many novel medications in preclinical and clinical testing, there is need for safe and effective CFTR modulating drugs and immunomodulatory medications to decrease the abundant neutrophilic inflammation response in the airway without unwanted adverse effects. Thymosin alpha 1 treatment of airway cells isolated from phe508del CF patients and from CF knockout mice, decreased inflammation, increased CFTR maturation, and facilitated translocation of CFTR protein to the plasma membrane increasing channel activity. If similar results are seen in humans with CF, thymosin alpha 1 has the unique potential to be a single molecule therapy for treating CF airway disease.

### Preclinical modeling for therapeutic development in cystic fibrosis [^adfbd1e0]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) suffer from the consequences of deficient CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene) activity. CFTR controls epithelial chloride and sodium transport, with deficient function altering tissue milieu hydration, cellular membrane potential, and cellular functions, resulting in a multiorgan disease. The consequences of this pathophysiology results in increased mucous viscosity, mucus plugging, inflammation, and infection that ultimately destroys the lungs. Unfortunately, to date, there are no therapeutic panaceas for CF. Even with small molecule CFTR correctors and potentiators, the established pulmonary damage still requires supplemental avenues of therapeutic intervention. The pursuit of new treatments requires the right model of choice for determining potency, efficacy, and adverse effects. The modeling system requires that the tissue pathophysiology be consistent both with the target of treatment and with the complexity of enhanced mucus viscosity/plugging, inflammation, and infection.

The primary challenge to developing new therapeutics for CF is the lack of a readily accessible, cost-effective model system that allows for the simultaneous evaluation of mucociliary clearance abnormalities, infection susceptibilities, and inflammation. The Cftr -deficient mouse model does not have mucus/mucociliary clearance manifestations but does provide important insight into immune mechanisms associated with CF-deficient management of infection and inflammation. The βENaC (β epithelial sodium channel) mouse model has altered sodium ion transport, resulting in enhanced mucous viscosity and sustained inflammation, but does not have many of the other anomalies associated with deficient Cftr. In the case of the βENaC mouse model, additional therapeutic testing translated to a Cftr -deficient scenario assures an evaluation of other potential complications because of deficient Cftr. The cost of breeding mice, the short reproductive cycle, and the production of large litters streamlines numbers for efficiently powered studies with a lower cost in husbandry than the larger animal counterparts. However, mice are not humans, and they do not recapitulate all aspects of CF pathophysiology.

### Patient information: cystic fibrosis… [^1fe16784]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by an abnormal gene that is inherited from both biological parents. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene is responsible for salt transport across different tissues in the body. In CF, the protein made by the abnormal CFTR gene is absent or dysfunctional, resulting in reduced salt transport and decreased water movement, which causes thick mucus to accumulate in various parts of the body. Newborn screening programs measure a chemical in the blood called immunoreactive trypsinogen, which is elevated in CF. Most newborn screening programs also include genetic testing for the most common mutations that cause CF. Diagnosis is confirmed by finding elevated chloride levels in sweat. The sweat chloride test is also used for diagnosis of CF if the condition is clinically suspected in a child or adult.

How Does Cystic Fibrosis Affect Body Functions. Abnormal or absent CFTR protein causes accumulation of thick mucus, which blocks the airways, leads to repeated episodes of infection and inflammation, and results in damage to the lungs. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people with CF. People with CF also have thick mucus in the pancreas, which limits release of digestive enzymes and leads to difficulty digesting food, malabsorption of nutrients, and poor weight gain. In addition, damage to the pancreas can lead to development of CF-related diabetes. People with CF may have chronic diarrhea and episodes of constipation. Other parts of the body can also be affected. Most men with CF are infertile, and women with CF may have difficulty becoming pregnant. People with CF often have chronic sinusitis. Also, people with CF are at increased risk of dehydration in hot weather because of abnormal functioning of their sweat glands. Treatments for Cystic Fibrosis.

Most people with CF take inhaled medications daily to thin their mucus and use mechanical devices several times daily to dislodge mucus from the airways. Oral and inhaled antibiotics may be prescribed to help control infection, while intravenous antibiotics are used to treat flares of infection. Most people with CF require a high-calorie diet with fat-soluble vitamin supplements and pancreatic enzyme replacement medications with each meal. Endres TM, Konstan MW. What Is Cystic Fibrosis.

### Novel outcome measures for clinical trials in cystic fibrosis [^ed712566]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2015). Low credibility.

Sweat Test

Determination of sweat electrolytes has been performed in clinical laboratories for over 40 years and remains the gold standard diagnostic test for CF. The measure provides a sensitive indicator of CFTR activity, and correlates well with the CF phenotype. Sweat chloride measurements are feasible in multicenter clinical trials, and use of the macroduct collection system allows analysis in a central laboratory, facilitating standardized methodology among centers. Furthermore, the procedure does not place a significant burden on patients and is rarely associated with complications. Several lines of evidence suggest that sweat chloride is a robust outcome measure in clinical trials evaluating agents directed at restoring CFTR function. As sweat chloride levels change significantly with small changes in CFTR activity, as seen in genotype–phenotype correlations, their determination allows the evaluation of the effect of CFTR modulators with relatively low activity, providing a reasonable assay for dose-response relationships. However, change in sweat chloride has not proven to be predictive of lung function response on an individual basis in studies involving a CFTR potentiator. Recently, sweat rate and sweat conductivity have been determined in conjunction with sweat chloride levels, to assess the secretory function of the sweat gland. These techniques may be particularly well suited to detecting altered glandular activity, although this needs to be demonstrated in prospective studies.

In conclusion, application of ion channel measurements in clinical trials appears feasible given its established use, favorable safety and acceptability profile and validity (Table 1). Widespread use in recent years has improved understanding of its sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. However, the need for well-trained personnel and use of accepted standard operating procedures should be employed when including sweat chloride as an outcome measure in clinical trials. In addition, concerns regarding whether pharmacodynamic activity in the absorptive epithelium of the sweat gland correlates with activity in the secretory epithelia of the airway and other organs still need to be addressed. This could be achieved by characterizing CFTR, and its response to novel therapies, in different tissues. Other questions include whether tissue (i.e. skin) penetration or differences in the absorptive function of CFTR following pharmacologic rescue of F508del may impair its ability to detect the efficacy of multi-agent therapy.

### Salt excretion in sweat in cystic fibrosis… [^b8e711b3]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor: — Since the discovery of abnormally high levels of sodium and chloride in sweat in children with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas by di Sant'Agnese et al in 1953, the sweat test has proved to be a valuable help in pediatrics. The finding of a high salt excretion by eccrine sweat glands in a child with steatorrhea associated with pulmonary disease makes the diagnosis of CFP certain. Most investigators give the upper normal limit of sodium at 70–80 mEq/liter and that of chloride at 50–60 mEq/liter. In CFP very high sodium values up to 120 mEq/liter and more are encountered, and chloride levels may be even higher. Salt loss by sweating is also important in adrenal cortical hypofunction, but, in general, sodium and chloride concentrations are not as high as in CFP. On the other hand, pituitary hypofunction is not followed by abnormal salt excretion. Siegenthaler P, de Haller R, Dubach UC. Salt Excretion in Sweat in Cystic Fibrosis. JAMA.

### Genetic evidence supports the development of SLC26A9 targeting therapies for the treatment of lung disease [^f705777e]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cystic Fibrosis [CF (MIM:219700)] is a common life-limiting autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by pathogenic variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; MIM:602421). CF affects multiple organs; morbidity in the pancreas and intestine are seen at birth –, while progressive lung disease is experienced throughout the course of disease and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Variability in disease severity across the affected organs is due, in part, to variation in other genes, referred to as modifier genes. Modifier genes impact phenotypic expressivity in the presence of a dysfunctional major causal gene, for example, CFTR.

CFTR is localized to the cell membrane of epithelial cells and functions as an ion channel. Over 400 variants have been reported to cause CF through variable effects on protein function. CF-causing mutations impact apical chloride and bicarbonate transport, altering hydration and pH of airway surface liquid resulting in viscous mucus. Accumulation of this viscous mucus leads to cycles of infection and inflammation, obstructing and damaging the airways, resulting in progressive lung damage and end-stage lung disease.

### Results of a phase IIa study of VX-809, an investigational CFTR corrector compound, in subjects with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation [^97ccf2c6]. Thorax (2012). Low credibility.

Background

VX-809, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator, has been shown to increase the cell surface density of functional F508del-CFTR in vitro.

Methods

A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of VX-809 in adult patients with cystic fibrosis (n = 89) who were homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation. Subjects were randomised to one of four VX-809 28 day dose groups (25, 50, 100 and 200 mg) or matching placebo.

Results

The type and incidence of adverse events were similar among VX-809- and placebo-treated subjects. Respiratory events were the most commonly reported and led to discontinuation by one subject in each active treatment arm. Pharmacokinetic data supported a once-daily oral dosing regimen. Pharmacodynamic data suggested that VX-809 improved CFTR function in at least one organ (sweat gland). VX-809 reduced elevated sweat chloride values in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.0013) that was statistically significant in the 100 and 200 mg dose groups. There was no statistically significant improvement in CFTR function in the nasal epithelium as measured by nasal potential difference, nor were there statistically significant changes in lung function or patient-reported outcomes. No maturation of immature F508del-CFTR was detected in the subgroup that provided rectal biopsy specimens.

Conclusions

In this study, VX-809 had a similar adverse event profile to placebo for 28 days in F508del-CFTR homozygous patients, and demonstrated biological activity with positive impact on CFTR function in the sweat gland. Additional data are needed to determine how improvements detected in CFTR function secondary to VX-809 in the sweat gland relate to those measurable in the respiratory tract and to long-term measures of clinical benefit.

### ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters in normal and pathological lung [^c060b92f]. Respiratory Research (2005). Low credibility.

CFTR in cystic fibrosis

Mutations in the CFTR gene can cause cystic fibrosis and are associated with abnormal Cl - and Na + ion transport in several tissues including the lungs, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, liver, sweat glands and male reproductive organs. Although the normal expression of CFTR in the lung is lower compared to tissues such as the intestine and pancreas, its function in the lung is of major importance. The most frequent mutation in this gene is the delta F508 mutation which leads to cystic fibrosis. Defective CFTR function can cause viscous secretions in the lungs which leads to chronic inflammation with acute exacerbations by impaired mucociliary clearance. There are major risks for colonisation with Pseudonomas aeruginosa which leads to pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency. Besides abnormal CFTR localisation and expression in cystic fibrosis, also in non-cystic fibrosis airway tissue CFTR can be abnormally expressed in remodelled or dedifferentiated epithelium. whereas in delta F508 CFTR epithelial cells there may be a normally processed CFTR. The regulation and transport function of CFTR are dependent of the state of differentiation and polarisation of epithelial cell cultures. Dedifferentiation with hyperplasia or metaplasia was associated with an intracellular localisation or absence of CFTR protein. Hurbain et al. analysed MRP1-5 transcript levels in nasal respiratory cells from cystic fibrosis patients with homozygous delta F508 mutation. Surprisingly, low MRP1 levels were associated with more severe disease and in addition, MRP1 levels were related to cAMP-independent chloride transport suggesting that MRP1 regulates another chloride channel in the apical membrane. CFTR function is cAMP regulated, and therefore, MRP4 or MRP5 activity may play a role in regulation of CFTR, since these proteins transport cAMP. Another study showed that CFTR function is blocked by two MRP substrates (taurolithocholate-3-sulphate and beta-estradiol). This implies that these two substances are also substrates for CFTR, or that CFTR and MRP proteins possess similar anion binding sites. Bebok et al. showed that nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen nitrogen species (RONS) decrease wild-type CFTR protein levels in airway epithelial cell monolayers. Natural sources of NO and RONS are activated in alveolar and interstitial macrophages, neutrophils, alveolar type II cells. and airway epithelial cells. In this view, CFTR function may be important in pulmonary infections and in the effect of oxidative stress generated by e.g. cigarette smoke.

### Variant cystic fibrosis phenotypes in the absence of CFTR mutations [^f1c03fd0]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting autosomal recessive disorder with a highly variable clinical presentation. The classic form involves characteristic findings in the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, male reproductive tract, and sweat glands and is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Nonclassic forms of cystic fibrosis have been associated with mutations that reduce but do not eliminate the function of the CFTR protein. We assessed whether alteration in CFTR function is responsible for the entire spectrum of variant cystic fibrosis phenotypes.

Methods

Extensive genetic analysis of the CFTR gene was performed in 74 patients with nonclassic cystic fibrosis who had been referred by 34 medical centers. We evaluated two families that each included a proband without identified mutations and a sibling with nonclassic cystic fibrosis to determine whether there was linkage to the CFTR locus and to measure the extent of CFTR function in the sweat gland and nasal epithelium.

Results

Of the 74 patients studied, 29 had two mutations in the CFTR gene, 15 had one mutation, and 30 had no mutations. A final genotype of two mutations was more common among patients who had been referred after screening for common cystic fibrosis-causing mutations identified one mutation than among those who had been referred after screening had identified no such mutations (26 of 34 patients vs. 3 of 40 patients, P < 0.001). Comparison of clinical features and sweat chloride concentrations revealed no significant differences among patients with two, one, or no CFTR mutations. Haplotype analysis in the two families revealed no linkage to CFTR. Although each of the affected siblings had elevated sweat chloride concentrations, measurements of cyclic AMP-mediated ion and fluid transport in the sweat gland and nasal epithelium demonstrated the presence of functional CFTR.

Conclusions

Factors other than mutations in the CFTR gene can produce phenotypes clinically indistinguishable from nonclassic cystic fibrosis caused by CFTR dysfunction.

### Sodium channel blockers for cystic fibrosis [^26c61d83]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

People with cystic fibrosis (CF) have increased transport of the salt, sodium across their airway lining. Over-absorption of sodium results in the dehydration of the liquid that lines the airway surface and is a primary defect in people with CF.

Objectives

To determine whether the topical administration of drugs that block sodium transport improves the respiratory condition of people with CF.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted principal investigators known to work in the field, previous authors and pharmaceutical companies who manufacture ion transport agents for unpublished or follow-up data. Most recent search of the Group's register: 22nd August 2011.

Selection Criteria

Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials of sodium channel blockers compared to placebo or another sodium channel blocker or the same sodium channel blocker at a different dosing regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data. Meta-analysis was limited due to differing study designs.

Main Results

Five RCTs, with a total of 226 participants, examining the topical administration of the short-acting sodium channel blocker, amiloride, compared to placebo were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review. In three studies over six months, there was a significant difference found in the difference in relative change in FVC in favour of placebo (weighted mean difference 1.51% (95% confidence interval -2.77 to -0.25), although heterogeneity was evident. A two-week study demonstrated that hypertonic saline with amiloride pre-treatment did not result in a significant improvement in respiratory function or mucus clearance, in contrast to pre-treatment with placebo. There were no significant differences identified in other clinically relevant outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no evidence that the topical administration of a short-acting sodium channel blocker improves respiratory condition in people with cystic fibrosis and some limited evidence of deterioration in lung function.

### Could a defective epithelial sodium channel lead to bronchiectasis [^8017daa7]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Recently, the ENaC channel has been shown to play a critical role in lung and airway mice physiology: ENaCα knock-out mice died shortly after birth of respiratory failure due to an inability to clear fluid from the alveolar space. Moreover, mice overexpressing ENaCβ subunit, but not α or γ, developed cystic-fibrosis-like disease with mucus obstruction and poor bacterial clearance. In humans, cystic fibrosis disease in the airways is linked to the combined defects of failure to secrete chloride and of accelerated sodium transport resulting from the absence of ENaC inhibition by the defective CFTR protein. Moreover, some respiratory abnormalities have been reported in patients with clinical disorders due to ENaC mutations. Hence, in Liddle's syndrome, an increased sodium channel activity in the nasal epithelium was observed. In PHA-I, patients frequently exhibit respiratory tract disease, especially up to the age of 5–6 years and in some patients, a defect in nasal epithelial sodium transport has been described with an excess of airway surface liquid.

Recently, sequencing of the exons and flanking introns of the genes encoding the α, β, and γ subunits of ENaC in twenty non-classic CF patients, that is patients with bronchiectasis and elevated sweat chloride concentrations but without two CFTR mutations, identified in four patients five missense mutations (one in ENaCα and four in ENaCβ) and one splicing mutation in the 3' splice site of ENaCβ intron 12. Our aim was to evaluate if a defective ENaC protein could be involved in the development of bronchiectasis. To do so, we extensively analysed ENaCβ and ENaCγ genes in 55 patients with idiopathic bronchiectasis and identified 8 patients bearing one mutation in the ENaCβ or γ genes. One mutation was found in 3 unrelated patients who were also heterozygous for a CFTR mutation or variant. Moreover, 5 patients bearing one mutation in the ENaCβ or γ genes had functional abnormalities in the nasal epithelium or in the sweat glands suggesting impaired sodium transport.

### Where is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator? [^90e47b6c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a mucoobstructive pathology associated with chronic inflammation and chronic bacterial infection of the lungs. Mutations in the CF gene lead to dysfunction of the CFTR (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) and development of clinical symptoms. Two central characteristics of CF lung disease are an inadequate hydration and a defective transport of the mucous layer that covers and protects the airway surface. Despite the huge progress made in CF care, the exact relationships between primary defects and different manifestations of the disease are lacking. In that context, it is important to establish a precise map of CFTR expression along the airways. Such studies, begun immediately after the discovery of the CF gene, gradually concluded that CFTR was detected in airway surface epithelial cells, including in airway multiciliated cells, as well as in rare "CFTR hot" cells near or within airway submucosal gland acini or gland duct cells.

In 2018, Montoro and colleagues and Plasschaert and colleagues applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), a technology that allows unbiased transcriptional profiling of tens of thousands of individual cells. They generated a catalog of the cells expressed in the lung, and, more particularly, they revealed a population of rare cells that they entitled pulmonary ionocytes. This name reflected a population of cells found in fish gills and frog skin, which contribute to ion homeostasis and hydration. Interestingly, pulmonary ionocytes were not only established by Montoro and colleagues and Plasschaert and colleagues as the sites of highest CFTR expression in airway cells but were also characterized by their high expression of other ion-transport genes, including subunits of the amiloride sensitive Na + channel, and components of H + -ATPases. This peculiar gene expression program, also showing similarities with renal intercalated cells, suggests that ionocytes could be directly involved in active absorption of fluids and/or regulation of acid-base homeostasis. In the murine tracheal epithelium, the majority of CFTR was present in pulmonary ionocytes but basal and secretory cells also expressed CFTR. Remarkably, little to no CFTR expression was detected in multiciliated cells, which were thought to be the main harbor of CFTR expression.

### Transient correction of the basic defect in sweat glands in an individual with cystic fibrosis carrying the complex CFTR allele F508del-R553Q [^fa18c1c8]. Thorax (2009). Low credibility.

The molecular pathology of mutant F508del CFTR is partially corrected in vitro by the secondary amino acid substitution R553Q in the ABC signature motif. An individual with the CFTR genotype R553X/F508del-R553Q showed the typical symptoms and electrophysiological anomalies of cystic fibrosis in the airways and intestine. Sweat chloride concentrations were normal early in life, but were later raised into the range that is diagnostic for cystic fibrosis, suggesting that R553Q could temporarily correct the basic defect in sweat glands. R553Q caused a delay in diagnosis because of false negative sweat tests but was not a disease reverting suppressor mutation as had been inferred from cellular models.

### Cystic fibrosis [^1b0b14cb]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2024). High credibility.

Cystic fibrosis is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in CFTR, the gene encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The discovery of CFTR in 1989 has enabled the unravelling of disease mechanisms and, more recently, the development of CFTR-directed therapeutics that target the underlying molecular defect. The CFTR protein functions as an ion channel that is crucial for correct ion and fluid transport across epithelial cells lining the airways and other organs. Consequently, CFTR dysfunction causes a complex multi-organ disease but, to date, most of the morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis is due to muco-obstructive lung disease. Cystic fibrosis care has long been limited to treating symptoms using nutritional support, airway clearance techniques and antibiotics to suppress airway infection. The widespread implementation of newborn screening for cystic fibrosis and the introduction of a highly effective triple combination CFTR modulator therapy that has unprecedented clinical benefits in up to 90% of genetically eligible people with cystic fibrosis has fundamentally changed the therapeutic landscape and improved prognosis. However, people with cystic fibrosis who are not eligible based on their CFTR genotype or who live in countries where they do not have access to this breakthrough therapy remain with a high unmet medical need.

### Cystic fibrosis and the role of gastrointestinal outcome measures in the new era of therapeutic CFTR modulation [^bc4c1574]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2015). Low credibility.

With the development of new drugs that directly affect CFTR protein function, clinical trials are being designed or initiated for a growing number of patients with cystic fibrosis. The currently available and accepted clinical endpoints, FEV1 and BMI, have limitations. The aim of this report is to draw attention to the need and the ample possibilities for the development and validation of relevant gastrointestinal clinical endpoints for scientific evaluation of CFTR modulation treatment, particularly in young children and infants. The gastrointestinal tract offers very good opportunities to measure CFTR protein function and systematically evaluate CF related clinical outcomes based on the principal clinical gastrointestinal manifestations of CF: intestinal pH, intestinal transit time, intestinal bile salt malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, exocrine pancreatic function and intestinal fat malabsorption. We present a descriptive analysis of a variety of gastrointestinal outcome measures for clinical relevance, reliability, validity, responsiveness to interventions, feasibility in particular in young children and the availability of reference values.

### The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator: an intriguing protein with pleiotropic functions [^21cfe220]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2002). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis is a frequent autosomal recessive disorder that is caused by the malfunctioning of a small chloride channel, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. The protein is found in the apical membrane of epithelial cells lining exocrine glands. Absence of this channel results in imbalance of ion concentrations across the cell membrane. As a result, fluids secreted through these glands become more viscous and, in the end, ducts become plugged and atrophic. Little is known about the pathways that link the malfunctioning of the CFTR protein with the observed clinical phenotype. Moreover, there is no strict correlation between specific CFTR mutations and the CF phenotype. This might be explained by the fact that environmental and additional genetic factors may influence the phenotype. The CFTR protein itself is regulated at the maturational level by chaperones and SNARE proteins and at the functional level by several protein kinases. Moreover, CFTR functions also as a regulator of other ion channels and of intracellular membrane transport processes. In order to be able to function as a protein with pleiotropic actions, CFTR seems to be linked with other proteins and with the cytoskeleton through interaction with PDZ-domain-containing proteins at the apical pole of the cell. Progress in cystic fibrosis research is substantial, but still leaves many questions unanswered.

With increased longevity of patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, and widespread lung transplantation facilities, the sequelae of defective CFTR in other organs than the airways come to the fore. This minireview highlights recent scientific progress in the understanding of CFTR function in the pancreas, the intestine and the kidney, and explores potential therapeutic strategies to combat defective CFTR function in these organs.

### Revisiting cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator structure and function [^2937fece]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2004). Low credibility.

The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a channel/enzyme which mediates passive diffusion of chloride and bicarbonate through epithelial cell membranes. It is expressed in many cell types throughout the body, but in the airways it is found mainly in secretory serous cells of the submucosal glands. CFTR belongs to a large super-family of ATP binding cassette transporters that have two nucleotide binding domains with characteristic sequences or "motifs". Although most other ATP binding cassette transporters consume ATP to actively transport various substrates, in CFTR the interactions of ATP with nucleotide binding domains control opening and closing of the channel pore (i.e., channel gating). Recent high resolution structures of bacterial nucleotide binding domains combined with new biochemical and electrophysiological studies of CFTR itself have led to major advances in our understanding of CFTR gating. For example, it is now clear that the ATPase activity of CFTR is not strictly required for its channel activity. CFTR has at least two distinct gating modes; one dependent on hydrolysis and the other requiring only stable ATP binding. In this article we discuss a working hypothesis for CFTR that incorporates these recent findings and discuss some interesting implications of the paradigm shift for other aspects of CFTR function and dysfunction.

Nonscreened individuals with suspected cystic fibrosis — individuals presenting with CF symptoms should use the same diagnostic criteria recommended for the screened population for sweat chloride testing, CFTR genetic analysis, and CFTR functional testing to confirm a CF diagnosis; diagnosis of CF in the nonscreened population still occurs, the diagnostic algorithm remains applicable, and the pretest probability of CF will influence the interpretation of sweat chloride testing, CFTR genetic analysis, or CF physiologic testing.

### Cystic fibrosis [^72f5f89a]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in white people, with a frequency of about 1 in 2500 livebirths. Discovery of the mutated gene encoding a defective chloride channel in epithelial cells — named cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) — has improved our understanding of the disorder's pathophysiology and has aided diagnosis, but has shown the disease's complexity. Gene replacement therapy is still far from being used in patients with cystic fibrosis, mostly because of difficulties of targeting the appropriate cells. Life expectancy of patients with the disorder has been greatly increased over past decades because of better notions of symptomatic treatment strategies. Here, we summarise advances in understanding and treatment of cystic fibrosis, focusing on pulmonary disease, which accounts for most morbidity and deaths.

### Advancing clinical development pathways for new CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis [^a3aa1a74]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Table 3
Comparison of sweat chloride and FEV 1% predicted as phase II endpoints assuming thresholds of effect comparable with those observed for lumacaftor–ivacaftor

The most notable shortcoming of sweat chloride as a CFTR biomarker may be its complicated relationship with long-term clinical outcomes. Investigators have noted that sweat chloride change is not predictive of FEV 1 change within individual patients, and two retrospective analyses of phase III ivacaftor study data have reached differing conclusions with respect to the strength of the association between these outcomes. Discordance between the magnitude of modulator-associated sweat chloride change and FEV 1 change in individuals may be due to differences in tissue bioavailability or efficacy thresholds in the sweat duct and the airway, and may also result from inhomogeneous 'reversibility' of CF lung dysfunction. In fact, variability of lung function response to other chronic respiratory therapies has tended to be the rule rather than the exception in randomised controlled trials. However, despite the lack of a direct linear correlation between FEV 1 in individuals and sweat chloride, there is strong evidence that sweat chloride predicts clinical outcomes at the population level, supporting its role as a key outcome measure for clinical trials. Further evidence is needed to determine how helpful a sweat chloride endpoint will be in demonstrating modulator dose proportionality, but given that small changes in CFTR function are known to result in significant sweat chloride changes, there appears to be strong potential. To be clear, because of the potential for tissue-specific effects, a systemic candidate modulator that does not decrease sweat chloride may still in theory have the potential to improve CF health, but when a candidate is shown to substantially decrease sweat chloride it is reasonable to predict that subsequent clinical benefit will be observed in larger phase III trials. In contrast, a candidate with a nominal sweat chloride effect may garner little enthusiasm for development from the community. Overall, the strengths of sweat chloride as a primary endpoint in early phase trials of systemic CFTR modulators appear to far outweigh its perceived weaknesses.

### Ion channel modulators in cystic fibrosis [^ed015ff8]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and remains one of the most common life-shortening genetic diseases affecting the lung and other organs. CFTR functions as a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-dependent anion channel that transports chloride and bicarbonate across epithelial surfaces, and disruption of these ion transport processes plays a central role in the pathogenesis of CF. These findings provided the rationale for pharmacologic modulation of ion transport, either by targeting mutant CFTR or alternative ion channels that can compensate for CFTR dysfunction, as a promising therapeutic approach. High-throughput screening has supported the development of CFTR modulator compounds. CFTR correctors are designed to improve defective protein processing, trafficking, and cell surface expression, whereas potentiators increase the activity of mutant CFTR at the cell surface. The approval of the first potentiator ivacaftor for the treatment of patients with specific CFTR mutations and, more recently, the corrector lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor for patients homozygous for the common F508del mutation, were major breakthroughs on the path to causal therapies for all patients with CF. The present review focuses on recent developments and remaining challenges of CFTR-directed therapies, as well as modulators of other ion channels such as alternative chloride channels and the epithelial sodium channel as additional targets in CF lung disease. We further discuss how patient-derived precision medicine models may aid the translation of emerging next-generation ion channel modulators from the laboratory to the clinic and tailor their use for optimal therapeutic benefits in individual patients with CF.

### Future therapies for cystic fibrosis [^ab7c9a92]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The last few years: transformational change from CFTR modulator drugs

Building on this substantial progress in outcomes, the last decade has witnessed the development of new drugs targeting the basic defect in CF, with substantial health and quality of life benefits. The cause of CF is a reduction in the amount or function of CFTR protein at the surface of epithelial cells in the lungs and other organs. This directly reduces epithelial chloride and bicarbonate transport through CFTR and also perturbs function of a range of other ion channels and intracellular pathways with which CFTR interacts.

There are more than 350 recognised CF-causing mutations in the CFTR gene, from a total of > 2000 identified variants. CFTR mutations have historically been grouped into six classes, based on how they impact CFTR transcription/ translation, intracellular trafficking or function. In practice, this distinction is not clear-cut, and the same mutation can cause defects in multiple aspects of CFTR expression. For example, the most common mutation, found on at least one allele in around 90% of UK CF patients, is p. Phe508del, a deletion of three base pairs resulting in the deletion of phenylalanine at codon 508. This is generally regarded as a class II mutation leading to aberrant folding/ trafficking of CFTR and proteasome-mediated degradation; however, p. Phe508del CFTR also demonstrates reduced channel open probability (class III), and instability leading to rapid turnover at the cell membrane (class VI). Knowledge of different CFTR mutation classes has underpinned the development of new molecular therapies. An important initial step was the identification of ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator that increases channel opening and ion transport. This is highly effective in mutations where apical cell surface CFTR is present but dysfunctional (e.g. class III). Where mutations are mixed in class, such as p. Phe508del, ivacaftor has been combined with CFTR correctors, which improve folding, reduce protein degradation and facilitate protein trafficking to the cell surface. The initial dual drug combinations (lumacaftor/ ivacaftor and tezacaftor/ ivacaftor) led to modest clinical improvements in patients, but most recently, a triple combination of two correctors targeting different aspects of CFTR misfolding (elexacaftor and tezacaftor) plus ivacaftor (ETI) has been developed. ETI is highly effective in patients with even just one copy of the p. Phe508del mutation, regardless of the second mutation –. This combination, licensed as Kaftrio® or Trikafta®, therefore offers an even greater possibility of effective CFTR modulation for ~ 90% of CF patients.

### Beyond chloride transport: CFTR in the 21st century-introductory remarks to a new state of the art series [^d8bef902]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2005). Low credibility.

This new series of articles on cystic fibrosis provides an overview of the confusing plethora of problems that arise from the loss of function in a low abundance protein, the cystic fibrosis membrane conductance regulator CFTR. The references are designed to take the clinical reader into areas and journals that they might not normally read. In particular we have concentrated on recent advances that suggest CFTR has functions that do not relate to chloride transport alone. In forthcoming issues of the journal the topics covered range from prospects and difficulties in the translation of new therapies into clinical practice, the regulation of the defective gene (promoters, enhancers, silencers, etc.), regulation and interaction of the CFTR protein product with other proteins in the cell, to functional approaches using developmental and secretory paradigms. These themes have been chosen to bring controversies at the cutting edge of cystic fibrosis research to the practicing pulmonologist in order to stimulate lateral thinking, which we hope will ultimately benefit our patients.

### Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis: consensus guidelines from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [^cbaf61cf]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Cystic fibrosis diagnosis — CFTR mutation categories and functional testing — notes that CF- causing mutation: individuals with 2 copies on separate alleles will likely have CF, whereas Non-CF-causing mutation: individuals with 1 or more are unlikely to have CF. It further states that in individuals presenting with a positive newborn screen, symptoms of CF, or a positive family history, the identification of 2 CF-causing mutations (defined by CFTR2) is consistent with a diagnosis of CF and that sweat chloride testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, and that the absence of detection of 2 CF-causing CFTR mutations does not exclude a diagnosis of CF. If further CF functional testing is needed, nasal potential difference (NPD) and intestinal current measurement (ICM) should be performed in a validated reference center with trained staff if certified by the CF Foundation for ICM or ECFS Clinical Trial Network, and in individuals with a positive newborn screen but variable or uncharacterized CFTR mutations (< 25 CF-causing mutations), the diagnosis of CF can be made by demonstrating CFTR dysfunction (sweat chloride ≥ 60 mmol/L or CF-typical NPD or ICM).

### Assessment of CFTR function in rectal biopsies for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis [^a2fe5359]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2004). Low credibility.

The Ussing chamber technique has contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of ion transport in the pathogenesis of human diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF). Here, we summarize protocols developed to study the Cl- channel function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein in rectal biopsies from normal individuals and CF patients. These protocols can be applied to study the function and pharmacological modulation of wild-type and mutant CFTR in the context of the native epithelium. Together with sweat testing and genetic analyses, these functional measurements may aid in establishing a diagnosis of CF.

### Allosteric inhibition of CFTR gating by CFTRinh-172 binding in the pore [^b90f1214]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

In the human body, the chloride channel Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) mediates chloride transport across the cell membrane in multiple epithelial-lining organs, including intestines, biliary ducts, pancreas ducts, respiratory airways, and sweat ducts –. This trans-epithelial movement of chloride through CFTR plays a critical role in the secretion or absorption of salt and water in these organ systems; malfunction of CFTR channels causes human diseases. Specifically, loss-of-function mutations of the CFTR gene are the root cause of cystic fibrosis (CF); conversely, numerous studies have linked upregulated CFTR activity to secretory diarrhea and polycystic kidney disease, resulting from excessive salt/water transport into the intestinal lumen and kidney cysts, respectively –.

Topological analysis of CFTR places it in the ATP-binding Cassette (ABC) transporter family, which harnesses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to move substrates across cell membranes –. Structurally, ABC proteins possess two transmembrane domains (TMDs) forming the substrate translocation pathway and two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that recruit and hydrolyze ATP as the energy source. While many ABC proteins retain two catalysis-competent NBDs, only one of the ATP binding sites (i.e. site 2) in CFTR can hydrolyze ATP, with site 1 being hydrolysis-incompetent –. Unique to CFTR is a regulatory domain (R domain) that sits between the two TMD/NBD complexes, hence preventing ATP-binding induced NBD dimerization. Activation of CFTR is achieved by spontaneous dislodgement of the R domain from the inhibitory position, followed by protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of multiple serine residues in the R domain that prevents the R domain from returning to the inhibitory position –. Once the R domain is phosphorylated, ATP-binding induced NBD dimerization and subsequent hydrolysis of ATP in site 2 are coupled to the opening and closing of the CFTR pore, respectively.

### Could a defective epithelial sodium channel lead to bronchiectasis [^41208471]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is an abnormal dilation of bronchi due to the destruction of their walls. The main symptoms associated with bronchiectasis are chronic cough, purulent sputum and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections, and most patients show a varying degree of airflow obstruction. In approximately 50% of cases, causative factors are identified such as childhood infection, immune defects, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, aspiration of irritants, cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, rheumatoid arthritis, other connective tissue disorders, ulcerative colitis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The remaining 50% of cases without identified etiology are classified as idiopathic.

The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) allows passive transport of sodium into the cells. It is expressed in epithelial cells lining the renal tubule, the respiratory airways and alveoli, the distal colon and the duct of several exocrine glands, such as salivary and sweat glands. ENaC is composed of three subunits (alpha, beta and gamma) in the proposed stoichiometry 2α :1β :1γ, or 3α :3β :3γ. Each ENaC subunit activity may be regulated by other proteins such as CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator) which is the protein involved in cystic fibrosis. Human clinical disorders due to ENaC mutations are a rare occurrence. However, they have been well described. Liddle's syndrome (OMIM 177200), an autosomal dominant form of volume-expanded low-renin hypertension is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the β or γ ENaC subunits. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in the α, β or γ ENaC subunits have been found in autosomal recessive pseudohypoaldosteronisme type I (PHA-I) (OMIM 264350) with salt wasting, hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. In PHA-I patients, there is also a defective sodium transport in the sweat glands that causes elevated sweat chloride and sodium concentrations. Hence, as sweat testing is the standard diagnostic test for cystic fibrosis, PHA-I is a classic differential diagnosis of elevated sweat chloride concentration, although usually readily distinguishable from cystic fibrosis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is considered a rare and lethal genetic disease, occurring in approximately 1:3500 births in the United States and at a higher incidence in many northern European countries. 1, 2 It is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an anion channel and regulator of other ion transporters which controls the hydration and viscoelastic properties of mucus in several epithelial tissues. 1, 2, 3, 4 Disease‐causing CFTR variants alter ion transport, leading to mucus obstruction. In the lungs, this sets the stage for chronic infection, inflammation, and airway damage that can progress to respiratory failure. There are more than 2000 variants in the CFTR gene that have been described, and a subset of these are clearly disease‐associated (and). The vast majority of people with CF have a relatively small number of variants that have been carefully characterized; however, there are numerous uncommon or rare variants that remain poorly characterized (with approximately 1200 variants identified in less than five CF subjects worldwide).

### The CF-modifying gene EHF promotes p. Phe508del-CFTR residual function by altering protein glycosylation and trafficking in epithelial cells [^9b8ea315]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The autosomal-recessively inherited monogenic disease cystic fibrosis (CF; OMIM #219700)is caused by two defective copies of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a chlorideand bicarbonate, channel localized in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The CFTR-transmitted basic defect can be used to diagnose the disease by the analysis of sweat glands, nasal, or intestinal epithelium.

As CF is a rare disease affecting about 1:2000 newborns in the Caucasian population, sample sizes of several 10 000 individuals desirable for many genome-wide association studies (GWAS)cannot be obtained for the rare disease CF. To preserve reasonable power to detect CF-modifying genes, the European CF Twin and Sibling Study restricts the analysis to homozygotes of c.1521_1523delCTT in CFTR, studies extreme phenotypes, in a case–reference setting and employs endophenotypes, rather than global clinical variables such as lung function.

Recently, Wright et al have described and replicated a significant association signal on a 11p13 intergenic region. We wanted to know whether we could reproduce this finding in our truly independent patient cohort of homozygotes for c.1521_1523delCTT in CFTR from the European CF Twin and Sibling Study, which differs from the North American CF Genetic Modifier Study by recruitment strategy, phenotype evaluation, choice of genetic markers and approach to evaluate genetic data as outlined before. In addition, we have studied transcriptome data from rectal suction biopsies, as first, intestinal epithelium expresses large amounts of CFTRand second, owing to the high turnover rate of epithelial cells in the intestine, these samples are less prone to secondary alterations by inflammatory processes in comparison to pulmonary tissue.

### CFTR stabilizes ENaC at the plasma membrane [^4a5bb1d0]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2007). Low credibility.

CFTR was reported to regulate ENaC channel opening, decreasing ENaC activity in airways and increasing it in sweat ducts. We generated MDCK-I cell lines stably expressing tagged alphabetagammaENaC+CFTR or ENaC alone, and developed an assay to quantify cell-surface half-life of ENaC. Surprisingly, we found that co-expressed CFTR stabilizes ENaC at the plasma membrane, suggesting that CFTR regulates ENaC stability, not just opening.

### Effect of neutrophil elastase and its inhibitor EPI-hNE4 on transepithelial sodium transport across normal and cystic fibrosis human nasal epithelial cells [^adac1e3c]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abnormalities in cyclic AMP-dependent chloride secretion and excessive sodium (Na +) reuptake by airway epithelial cells related to cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) deficiency are thought to alter fluid homeostasis at the airway surface liquid leading to dehydration, impaired mucociliary clearance, and infection. Activation of CFTR Cl - channel is known to inhibit epithelial Na + channel (ENaC) in normal native airway epithelial cells. In CF airways, mutation of CFTR leads to increased ENaC activity with increased transepithelial Na + and water reabsorption. Indeed, it has been shown that overexpression of the β-ENaC subunit in mouse airways increases Na + reabsorption, decreases mucociliary and bacterial clearance and leads to airway inflammation and obstruction, and to a cystic fibrosis-like disease. Therefore, inhibition of ENaC activity in the airways has been proposed for treatment of CF pulmonary disease.

### Inefficient cationic lipid-mediated siRNA and antisense oligonucleotide transfer to airway epithelial cells in vivo [^42ffbf3e]. Respiratory Research (2006). Low credibility.

More recently RNA interference (RNAi), using short (< 30 bp) double-stranded RNA molecules termed siRNAs, has emerged as an alternative gene silencing strategy. RNAi was first identified in plants and invertebrates, but more recently also in mammalian cells. Since the studies in mammalian cells a large number of publications now document the use of RNAi in cell culture-based systems and the power of RNAi for drug validation and studies of enzyme pathways is well recognized. The use of RNAi as a therapeutic approach is in its infancy, but several organs, including liver, eye, lung, brain, skeletal muscle, as well as tumours, have been targeted successfully in vivo.

Antisense or RNAi-mediated gene silencing may provide novel opportunities for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR) and affects many organs, but most morbidity and mortality relates to chronic inflammation and bacterial colonisation of the lung. The CFTR gene encodes a chloride channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells, and in CF patients chloride secretion through CFTR is reduced or absent. This, coupled with increased sodium absorption through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), leads to abnormal water transport across the epithelium and accumulation of sticky, dehydrated mucus, which in turn leads to chronic bacterial colonisation and inflammation (reviewed in). Similar to CFTR, ENaC is expressed in airway surface epithelium and glands. Normally CFTR inhibits ENaC-mediated sodium transport, although the mechanism is not completely understood. In CF this inhibition is lost, resulting in increased sodium and water absorption. Down-regulation of ENaC expression, or inhibition of its function, may therefore attenuate CF lung disease. The latter has proved difficult because of the short half-life of amiloride, and potential renal side effects of longer acting inhibitors. With regards to the former, ENaC consists of 3 separate subunits (α, β and γ). Jain et al generated asODN against all three subunits, and demonstrated that only asODN against the α subunit significantly decreased the density of ENaC channels.

Transfection of differentiated airway epithelial cells with plasmid DNA (pDNA), which is generally > 5000 bp, is inefficient, and the extra- and intracellular barriers to airway gene transfer have been identified over the last decade (reviewed in). Here, we assessed, whether smaller nucleic acids such as asODNs (20 bases) or siRNA (20–22 base pairs) can more readily overcome these barriers, and thereby provide an alternative approach for the treatment of CF lung disease.

### Therapeutic approaches to CFTR dysfunction: from discovery to drug development [^d668ef5d]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2018). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations have complex effects on the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. They disrupt its processing to and stability at the plasma membrane and function as an ATP-gated Cl - channel. Here, we review therapeutic strategies to overcome defective CFTR processing and stability. Because CF mutations have multiple impacts on the assembly of CFTR protein, combination therapy with several pharmacological chaperones is likely to be required to rescue mutant CFTR expression at the plasma membrane. Alternatively, proteostasis regulators, proteins which regulate the synthesis, intracellular transport and membrane stability of CFTR might be targeted to enhance the plasma membrane expression of mutant CFTR. Finally, we consider an innovative approach to bypass CFTR dysfunction in CF, the delivery of artificial anion transporters to CF epithelia to shuttle Cl - across the apical membrane. The identification of therapies or combinations of therapies, which rescue all CF mutations, is now a priority.

### Could a defective epithelial sodium channel lead to bronchiectasis [^ad250479]. Respiratory Research (2008). Low credibility.

Four of the missense mutations were detected in patients with functional abnormalities suggesting impaired sodium transport in the sweat glands or in the nasal epithelium: two variants (p. Pro369Thr, p. Asn288Ser in ENaCβ) were detected in this study for the first time and the other two (p. Ser82Cys and p. Gly183Ser) have been described before. These variants have not been previously found in normal subjects in several studies and were not detected in our ethnically-matched control group and in a "control" population of 56 cystic fibrosis patients with two pathogenic CFTR mutations. They are therefore unlikely to be common polymorphisms. These variants were each found at the heterozygous state and the deleterious effect of this finding might be questioned. In vitro studies in the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system could be performed to evaluate the precise effect of the new mutations we have found on ENaC structure and function. However, we did not performe these studies because it is thought that this system is not sensitive enough to detect little changes in ENaC activity and that only mutations leading to large changes in ENaC activity are liable to be detected. Moreover, it is not known whether amphibian cells such as Xenopus oocytes possess the whole cellular machinery involved in the complex regulation of the ENaC in mammalian cells. However, the functional abnormalities found in the patients speak for a role of the ENaC mutation in the pathophysiology of their airway disease. Hence, the patients bearing the p. Pro369Thr and p. Gly183Ser mutations had normal sweat chloride concentration (22 and 7 mmol/L, respectively) and a high basal PD (- 43 and - 39 mV, respectively) showing elevated nasal sodium transport. This pattern is similar to that described in Liddle's syndrome. Indeed, in the presence of ENaC gain-of-function mutations such as in Liddle's syndrome, the sodium and chloride reabsorption in the sweat duct are normal leading to normal sweat chloride concentrations. In contrast, there is an increased sodium reabsorption in the airway epithelium causing an increased nasal PD. Therefore, the functional pattern we observed for sodium transport in the sweat gland and in the airway epithelium suggests that p. Pro369Thr and p. Gly183Ser are mutations causing a gain of ENaC function. As for the patient bearing the p. Asn288Ser mutation, she had high sweat chloride concentration (57 mmol/L) with low basal nasal PD (- 10 mV), displaying the pattern described for PHA-I patients. In loss-of-function mutations in the ENaC gene as seen in PHA patients, the defective ENaC causes defective sodium and chloride reabsorption in the sweat duct and elevated sweat chloride and sodium concentrations. In the airways, the low sodium reabsorption leads to a low basal nasal PD. Therefore, the functional pattern we observed for the p. Asn288Ser mutation suggests it to be a loss-of-function mutation.

### The role of airway epithelium and blood neutrophils in the inflammatory response in cystic fibrosis [^2b7eb176]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2005). Low credibility.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which accounts for the cAMP-modulated chloride conductance of airway epithelial cells. CFTR also regulates other membrane proteins like the negative regulation of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to hyperabsorption of sodium chloride and a reduction in the periciliary salt and water content which leads to impaired mucociliary clearance. It seems that a lack of functional CFTR leads to abnormal function of the NF-kappaB pathway in submucosal gland cells, causing an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the chemokine IL-8, and a pro-inflammatory environment. CFTR is also expressed in neutrophils and several neutrophil functions like cytokine production, migration, phagocytosis and apoptosis seem altered in CF. In this review we describe the role of airway epithelium and blood neutrophils in the viscious circle of inflammation and infection seen in CF.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) diagnostic confirmation — sweat chloride thresholds and testing — states that a sweat test is required for confirmation of CF; a sweat chloride level ≥ 60 mmol/L indicates a diagnosis of CF, and sweat chloride < 30 mmol/L is the normal threshold for all ages (exceptions occur).

### Molecular genetics of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator: genotype and phenotype [^ee589128]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

The cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene encodes an epithelial ion channel. Although one mutation remains the most common cause of CF (F508del), there have been more than 2000 reported variations in CFTR. For the most part, individuals who carry only one mutation (heterozygotes) have no symptoms; individuals who inherit deleterious mutations from both parents have CF. However, growing awareness of CFTR mutations that do not ever or do not always cause CF, and individuals with mild or single-organ system manifestations of CFTR-related disease have made this Mendelian relationship more complex.

Cystic fibrosis diagnosis — CFTR2 mutation categories and confirmatory sweat chloride: All populations, the latest definitions identified in the Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) project should be used to aid with CF diagnosis, using categories including CF-causing mutation, mutation of varying clinical consequence, uncharacterized mutation/mutation of unknown clinical consequence, and non-CF-causing mutation; in individuals with two CF-causing mutations on separate alleles, a sweat chloride test result ≥ 30 mmol/L is confirmatory for patients with this genotype.

### Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guidelines. use of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator modulator therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis [^6e982b92]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2018). Medium credibility.

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation pulmonary guideline — background and mechanism for F508del and IVA/LUM explain that F508del is the most common CFTR mutation worldwide; approximately 50% of individuals are homozygous and 40% are heterozygous, that this mutation results in markedly decreased amounts of CFTR at the apical surface of respiratory epithelial cells due to its destruction in the endoplasmic reticulum, that the small amount of protein at the cell surface demonstrates minimal gating activity so CFTR modulator therapy directed at the F508del mutation must include both a corrector to increase surface protein expression and a potentiator to augment ion conductance, and that LUM partially corrects CFTR misfolding, allowing increased CFTR surface expression, whereas IVA improves its gating function.

### Frequency of the hyperactive W493R ENaC variant in carriers of a CFTR mutation [^043b495d]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The basic defect of the autosomal recessive disorder cystic fibrosis (CF) manifests in chloride hyposecretion and sodium hyperabsorption. CF-like disease has been reported in a heterozygous carrier of F508del CFTR and the hyperactive variant p.W493R-SCNN1A of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC).

Methods

The hypothesis that heterozygosity for p.W493R-SCNN1A and one loss-of-function CFTR mutation causes or predisposes to CF or CF-like disease was tested in 441 parents of a child with CF.

Results

p.W493R-SCNN1A was detected in three female carriers of F508del CFTR who did not show any symptoms of respiratory or intestinal disease that could be interpreted as the manifestation of CF or CFTR-related disorder. Frequency of p.W493R was lower in CF parents than in Caucasian control subjects.

Conclusions

A hyperactive ENaC does not necessarily cause CF-like disease in a CF gene carrier, but its low frequency in CF parents suggests that it is a risk factor.

### Advancing clinical development pathways for new CFTR modulators in cystic fibrosis [^910fd571]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

While there has been encouraging progress in development of CFTR modulators, significant work remains. To date, no systemic modulators that have entered clinical trials have been genotype independent; all have been CFTR mutation dysfunction-specific. If CFTR modulators are to form the basis for personalised medicine in CF, effective modulators will be needed to treat the full range of CFTR genotypes found in the CF population. In addition, more potent alternatives to currently approved systemic CFTR modulators will be needed to increase the magnitude of benefit that can be achieved with respect to clinical outcomes. Finally, approval of more than one CFTR modulator for the same indication has the potential to introduce market competition that may motivate reductions in the substantial annual treatment costs associated with these therapies.

Given the rapid development pace of CFTR modulator therapies when compared with other CFTR-enhancing strategies, we address in this paper the key issues that will impact our ability to advance new CFTR modulators through the drug development pipeline. The objectives of this review are to outline the challenges and opportunities in drug development created by genotype-specific CFTR modulators, highlight the advantages of sweat chloride as an established biomarker of CFTR activity to streamline early-phase development and summarise options for later phase clinical trial designs that respond to the adoption of approved genotype-specific modulators into standard of care. As the complexity of developing therapies in a competitive drug development environment and a finite patient population is not unique to CFTR modulators, many of the issues addressed in this paper can be extended to the entire spectrum of CFTR-enhancing therapies.

### The effect of respiratory muscle training on children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^4d837c31]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Introduction

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem autosomal recessive disease that affects approximately 90,000 individuals, according to data from CF registries worldwide. This is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, leading to a decrease or loss in the function of the CFTR protein. Many studies have shown that this foundational flaw causes irreversible, progressive lung disease to start very early in life in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). CFTR is responsible for transporting chloride ions across the apical membrane of tissue epithelial cells, secreting bicarbonate to regulate the pH of the fluid on the airway surface, and inhibiting epithelial sodium channels (ENaC). Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to dehydration and the production of thick secretions in organs such as the reproductive, digestive, and respiratory tracts. Thickened mucus in the lungs sticks to the surface of the airways, reducing the amount of mucociliated tracts cleared and raising the risk of infection and inflammation, which progressively damages the lungs. As a result, breathing becomes more difficult, and gas exchange is reduced. This lowers exercise tolerance and eventually leads to respiratory failure, the main cause of death from cystic fibrosis.

More recently, the introduction of CFTR modulator medications can correct basic deficiencies, which in time may alter the manifestations and complications of CF. Nevertheless, a cure for this condition is not currently available, and ongoing rehabilitation is necessary due to its chronic nature. Therefore, it is crucial to develop or improve the therapeutic approaches aimed at preserving or improving lung function for the well-being of patients with cystic fibrosis. The effective intervention recently is physical exercise, including respiratory muscle training (RMT). The goal of respiratory muscle training is to enhance expiratory and/or inspiratory muscular strength and endurance in order to improve respiratory function. Respiratory muscle training has demonstrated efficacy in individuals diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and those suffering from various respiratory conditions. It is yet unknown, nevertheless, if respiratory muscle training helps patients with cystic fibrosis. The last systematic review on this topic was published in 2020. Ten randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of respiratory muscle training on individuals with cystic fibrosis were included in the analysis. Nonetheless, the authors conclude that there is insufficient data to support the use of RMT in cystic fibrosis. The primary cause of this result is the poor methodological quality of the individual research.
