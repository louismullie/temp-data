## Question

Rankin score

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the modified Rankin Scale (mRS): what it measures, how it is scored, its psychometric properties, analytic approaches, limitations, and practical recommendations for trials and practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the construct and scoring structure. Then, I should verify reliability and validity across methods and raters. Next, I will examine analytic strategies, including dichotomous, ordinal, utility-weighted, and win-probability approaches. After that, I need to review limitations and alternatives. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and a concise conclusion, ensuring each point is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the construct and scoring. The mRS is a clinician-reported, global disability scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death), with 7 ordered categories that reflect increasing dependence in daily activities. Modern versions explicitly include death as category 6, and consensus nomenclature now standardizes descriptors such as "symptomatic but nondisabled" for mRS 1 and "requires constant care" for mRS 5, which helps harmonize interpretation across trials [^1167qM7G] [^117J4xzY] [^114NkGHN].

> Wait, let me verify the psychometrics before drawing conclusions. Inter-rater reliability for unstructured mRS is only moderate overall (kappa roughly 0.46–0.57), but it improves with structured interviews and training; for example, the Rankin Focused Assessment (RFA) achieves weighted kappa near 0.99 in some studies, and the simplified mRS questionnaire (smRSq) shows good agreement with faster administration, while meta-analytic summaries suggest substantial reliability on average with higher performance for structured approaches than standard interviews [^1177AP9R] [^111S3wvD] [^111d4fKM] [^112wKgDJ] [^112jJ9cj].

> Hold on, I should verify validity and related measures. The mRS demonstrates construct validity via relationships with stroke severity, lesion burden, and other disability scales, and it correlates with long-term outcomes and costs; however, there is notable overlap between adjacent mRS grades with instruments like the Barthel Index, underscoring that mRS is a global measure rather than an ADL inventory, and that complementary scales may be needed when granular function is important [^114QT6No] [^112tSyFm] [^115zuKnn].

> Next, I should review analytic approaches. Dichotomizing mRS (e.g., 0–1 vs 2–6 or 0–2 vs 3–6) is simple but statistically inefficient and risks information loss. Ordinal shift analyses (e.g., proportional odds) better preserve power and detect treatment effects across the spectrum, though they assume proportional odds and can be hard to interpret clinically. Utility-weighted mRS (UW-mRS) incorporates patient-centered values but shows heterogeneous weights across studies and may reduce power compared with unweighted ordinal analyses. Win probability (WinP) offers an intuitive, assumption-free metric ("the chance a treated patient does better than a control patient") with straightforward sample-size tools [^114MKwRo] [^112KDdnK] [^111NiXm7] [^112UVCZe] [^111vKiR9].

> I need to check the implications of nonlinearity and step-changes. Cohort data show that transitions around mRS 2–3 and 3–4 carry disproportionate prognostic and cost consequences, supporting weighted ordinal approaches that emphasize these clinically important shifts; however, weights vary by population and context, so trial-specific derivation or concurrent utility measurement is prudent to avoid misinterpretation [^112Qn8Rx] [^1113JTPG] [^111NiXm7].

> Let me consider limitations and alternatives carefully. The mRS has a ceiling effect in mild strokes, may not capture cognitive, mood, or fatigue domains, and is vulnerable to detection bias in open-label trials. Early NIHSS can serve as a surrogate or adjunct, with mediation analyses showing much of the mRS effect is captured by 24–168 hour NIHSS, though patient-centered outcomes and long-term functional trajectories still require 90-day mRS or complementary measures [^114QFJiP] [^114vtMq9] [^111GhpFG] [^112wrBkm].

> But wait, what about administration mode and central adjudication? Telephone and video assessments can be reliable, with substantial agreement to in-person scoring, and central adjudication improves reliability and can reduce sample size needs. However, recent randomized and multicenter data suggest that with local blinding and structured tools, central adjudication may not always change trial conclusions, so its added value should be weighed against logistics and cost [^112wKgDJ] [^115fk79K] [^1141R1Yp] [^116bwVii].

> I should double-check timing and longitudinal use. Most recovery occurs within 90 days, making 90-day mRS the conventional primary endpoint. Repeated measures and longitudinal models can increase power and precision, and discharge mRS is only a modest proxy for 90-day outcomes, with meaningful changes occurring between 30 and 90 days, so early discharge scores should be interpreted cautiously [^112c5j8E] [^111mFNtP] [^116idbt9].

> Next, I should review practical recommendations. Use structured interviews or validated tools (RFA, smRSq, mRS-9Q) to improve reliability, train and certify raters, and document administration mode. Prefer ordinal analyses for primary outcomes when feasible, consider UW-mRS as co-primary or sensitivity analysis with prespecified weights, and report WinP to enhance interpretability. In open-label designs, employ central adjudication when feasible. And pair mRS with complementary measures (e.g. NIHSS, EQ-5D, home-time) to address construct gaps and patient relevance [^111S3wvD] [^111d4fKM] [^114MMyWa] [^112UVCZe] [^11751uYJ] [^114MKwRo].

> In summary, the mRS remains the standard global disability outcome in stroke trials because it is simple, widely accepted, and prognostically informative. Its psychometrics are acceptable and improvable with structured methods, ordinal analyses are statistically superior to dichotomies, and thoughtful integration with complementary measures and modern analytic frameworks yields more efficient, interpretable, and patient-centered evaluations of treatment effects [^112X2zZc] [^114MKwRo] [^111NiXm7].

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a **7-level ordinal measure** of global disability and dependence, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death) [^1167qM7G]. It is the **standard primary outcome** in stroke trials, typically assessed at 90 days, and is best analyzed with ordinal (shift) methods that preserve the scale's granularity and statistical power [^114MKwRo] [^111vKiR9]. Reliability improves with structured interviews or central adjudication, and the mRS correlates with long-term outcomes and costs, supporting its validity and clinical relevance [^112wKgDJ] [^112tSyFm] [^111iUXqF].

---

## Structure and scoring

The mRS comprises **seven categories**, each reflecting a distinct level of disability:

| **Score** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| 0 | No symptoms at all |
| 1 | No significant disability; able to carry out all usual activities |
| 2 | Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities but able to look after own affairs without assistance |
| 3 | Moderate disability; requiring some help but able to walk without assistance |
| 4 | Moderately severe disability; unable to walk without assistance and unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance |
| 5 | Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent, and requiring constant nursing care and attention |
| 6 | Death |

---

## Clinical significance and applications

The mRS is the **most widely used primary outcome measure** in acute stroke trials, particularly at 90 days, and is endorsed by regulatory agencies and clinical guidelines for its clinical relevance and patient-centeredness [^114QFJiP] [^112X2zZc]. It is also used in clinical practice to guide prognosis, rehabilitation planning, and discharge decisions.

---

## Reliability and validity

Inter-rater reliability varies with method; unstructured interviews have moderate agreement (kappa ~0.46), whereas structured tools (e.g. Rankin Focused Assessment, mRS-9Q) and central adjudication improve reliability substantially (kappa 0.80–0.99) [^116xUnxp] [^111S3wvD] [^114MMyWa] [^1141R1Yp]. Validity is supported by strong correlations with other stroke scales (NIHSS, Barthel Index) and with long-term outcomes, including mortality, institutionalization, and healthcare costs [^114QT6No] [^112tSyFm] [^111iUXqF].

---

## Statistical analysis considerations

Ordinal (shift) analyses — such as proportional odds logistic regression — are preferred because they use the full mRS range, increase statistical power, and detect treatment effects across the disability spectrum [^114MKwRo] [^112KDdnK]. Dichotomization (e.g. mRS 0–2 vs 3–6) is common but **reduces power and may miss clinically important shifts** [^114MKwRo] [^112KDdnK]. Utility-weighted mRS incorporates patient preferences but shows variable weights across studies and may reduce power compared with unweighted ordinal analyses [^111NiXm7] [^114yVcnu].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Subjectivity in scoring and variability across raters can **reduce reliability**, especially without structured interviews or training [^1177AP9R] [^116trsH5]. The scale's **limited sensitivity** in mild stroke and its inability to capture specific deficits (e.g. cognitive or emotional) are additional limitations [^114QFJiP] [^112wrBkm]. Floor and ceiling effects may also occur in **certain populations**.

---

## Recent developments and innovations

Structured interviews and digital tools (e.g. mRS-9Q, **telemedicine platforms**) improve reliability and feasibility, including for remote assessment [^114MMyWa] [^111jqTqh]. Central adjudication further reduces **variability and bias**, though its impact on trial conclusions varies [^116bwVii] [^113EL6ZU]. Patient-reported and **utility-weighted approaches** aim to better reflect patient values, but require careful validation and standardization [^111NiXm7] [^115SBrSF].

---

## Clinical implications and future directions

The mRS remains integral to stroke care and research, but its use should be standardized with **structured interviews**, rater training, and **ordinal analyses** to maximize reliability and clinical interpretability [^112wKgDJ] [^112KDdnK]. Complementary measures (e.g. NIHSS, Barthel Index, patient-reported outcomes) can address limitations and provide a more complete picture of recovery [^1115NJ9N]. Continued refinement and validation are needed to ensure the mRS remains relevant across diverse populations and clinical contexts [^111NiXm7] [^113yVzfR].

### A simple, assumption-free, and clinically interpretable approach for analysis of modified rankin outcomes [^111vKiR9]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

There is debate regarding the approach for analysis of modified Rankin scale scores, the most common functional outcome scale used in acute stroke trials.

Methods

We propose to use tests to assess treatment differences addressing the metric, "if a patient is chosen at random from each treatment group and if they have different outcomes, what is the chance the patient who received the investigational treatment will have a better outcome than will the patient receiving the standard treatment?" This approach has an associated statement of treatment efficacy easily understood by patients and clinicians, and leads to statistical testing of treatment differences by tests closely related to the Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test), which can be tested precisely by permutation tests (randomization tests).

Results

We show that a permutation test is as powerful as are other approaches assessing ordinal outcomes of the modified Rankin scores, and we provide data from several examples contrasting alternative approaches.

Discussion

Whereas many approaches to analysis of modified Rankin scores outcomes have generally similar statistical performance, this proposed approach: captures information from the ordinal scale, provides a powerful clinical interpretation understood by both patients and clinicians, has power at least equivalent to other ordinal approaches, avoids assumptions in the parameterization, and provides an interpretable parameter based on the same foundation as the calculation of the probability value.

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^113Wssex]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Our analysis has several strengths, including a robust population-based design, high rates of ascertainment of all incident strokes, completeness of follow-up, replication of findings for several outcomes, and generalizability, with similar 5-year mortality and disability rates as prior population-based studies. However, there are some potential shortcomings. First, a randomized-controlled trial is required to prove a causal association between shifting patients to lower mRS scores and reducing long-term disability, mortality, and costs, and to validate the differential value of various state transitions suggested by our analyses. Our findings would also benefit from further validation in other large cohort studies. Second, since assessors were not blinded to prior mRS scores, 1- and 5-year disability assessments could have been unfavorably biased in patients with higher 3-month mRS scores. However, ordinal analysis remained superior with different disability definitions, and trends were similar for 5-year death and costs, which are untainted by disability assessments. Third, we only studied patients with ischemic stroke; distinctions among mRS grades may differ in other diseases. Fourth, given that our aim was to examine how the mRS relates to long-term outcomes, we did not adjust for all the potential factors that could also influence long-term disability, mortality, and costs, including stroke subtype, impairment on the NIH Stroke Scale, various cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities (such as cancer), recurrent strokes, socioeconomic status, or adherence to rehabilitation or secondary prevention. Ethnicity, potentially a relevant factor for such long-term outcomes, was also not examined; the Oxford Vascular Study population is 95% white. Such factors may need to be accounted for by studies seeking to more accurately estimate long-term outcomes for purposes like resource allocation. Fifth, given our wide recruitment period, secular trends in society and the health care system may have shifted the mRS distribution of our population over time. For instance, increasing longevity could have resulted in a higher proportion of patients with increased premorbid mRS over time; therefore, our estimate of the burden of premorbid disability may be an underestimate compared with present-day populations.

### Utility-weighted modified rankin scale as primary outcome in stroke trials: a simulation study [^114yVcnu]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (UW-mRS) has been proposed as a new patient-centered primary outcome in stroke trials. We aimed to describe utility weights for the mRS health states and to evaluate the statistical efficiency of the UW-mRS to detect treatment effects in stroke intervention trials.

Methods

We used data of the 500 patients enrolled in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). Utility values were elicited from the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire assessed at 90 days after inclusion, simultaneously with the mRS. Utility weights were determined by averaging the utilities of all patients within each mRS category. We performed simulations to evaluate statistical efficiency. The simulated treatment effect was an odds ratio of 1.65 in favor of the treatment arm, similar for all mRS cutoffs. This treatment effect was analyzed using 3 approaches: linear regression with the UW-mRS as outcome, binary logistic regression with a dichotomized mRS (0–1/2–6, 0–2/3–6, and 0–4/5–6), and proportional odds logistic regression with the ordinal mRS. The statistical power of the 3 approaches was expressed as the proportion of 10000 simulations that resulted in a statistically significant treatment effect (P ≤ 0.05).

Results

The mean utility values (SD) for mRS categories 0 to 6 were: 0.95 (0.08), 0.93 (0.13), 0.83 (0.21), 0.62 (0.27), 0.42 (0.28), 0.11 (0.28), and 0 (0), respectively, but varied substantially between individual patients within each category. The UW-mRS approach was more efficient than the dichotomous approach (power 85% versus 71%) but less efficient than the ordinal approach (power 85% versus 87%).

Conclusions

The UW-mRS as primary outcome does not capture individual variation in utility values and may reduce the statistical power of a randomized trial.

### Modified rankin scale at 90 Days versus National Institutes of Health stroke scale at 24 hours as primary outcome in acute stroke trials [^114QFJiP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) are most often measured with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days. The mRS is a 7‐point ordinal scale representing functional neurological disability, ranging from 0 (no deficits at all) to 6 (death). Randomized controlled trials are conducted to test novel treatments for diseases, and choosing an appropriate outcome measure is a critical step when designing a trial. The choice of the outcome determines the statistical approach to data analysis and the sample size that will be required.

The mRS assessed at 90 days after stroke onset has become the dominant primary outcome for studies assessing any acute stroke intervention for several reasons, including its use in the initial trials assessing intravenous thrombolysis, clear patient preference data, and acceptance by regulatory agencies as an outcome that patients understand and find meaningful. Academic guidelines and regulatory agencies have recognized and endorsed this choice meaning that, de facto, any new treatment needs to provide evidence of efficacy using the mRS at 90 days in a phase 3 trial before it can become widely accepted and endorsed in stroke treatment guidelines. Similarly, many practicing physicians would expect a new treatment to improve outcomes as measured by the mRS at 90 days before they use it in routine clinical practice.

Nevertheless, challenges remain when using the mRS at 90 days as a primary trial outcome. First, the mRS may show a ceiling effect, and hence poor discriminative value, among patients with mild stroke deficits. Such patients often score an mRS of 0 or 1 at 90 days, despite low subjective health utility. Second, the 90‐day follow‐up period allows for poor outcomes to arise from subsequent developments well after the stroke event and its treatment, particularly in older patients, perhaps institutionalized in nursing homes, who have multiple comorbidities. Practically, a 90‐day follow‐up period also increases trial duration and cost. For dose‐finding and other trials using adaptive randomization, in which the next patient allocation to a particular study arm is driven in part by prior patient outcome, having to wait for 90‐day measures also reduces efficiency of response profile exploration.

### Understanding the relationship between costs and the modified rankin scale: a systematic review, multidisciplinary consensus and recommendations for future studies [^114eNU4t]. European Stroke Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background and purpose

Cost-of-illness studies often describe a single aggregate cost of a disease state. This approach is less helpful for a condition with a spectrum of outcomes like stroke. The modified Rankin Scale is the most commonly used outcome measure for stroke. We sought to describe the existing evidence on the costs of stroke according to individual modified Rankin Scale categories. This may be useful in future cost effectiveness modelling studies of interventions where cost data have not been collected, but disability outcome is known.

Methods

Systematic review of the published literature, searching electronic databases between 2004 and 2015 using validated search filters. Results were screened to identify studies presenting costs by individual modified Rankin Scale categories.

Results

Of 17,782 unique identified articles, 13 matched all inclusion criteria. In only four of these studies were costs reported by modified Rankin Scale categories. Most studies included direct medical costs only. Societal costs were assessed in two studies. Overall, studies had a high methodological and reporting quality. The heterogeneity in costing methods used in the identified studies prevented meaningful comparison of the reported cost data. Despite this limitation, the costs consistently increased with greater severity (increasing modified Rankin Scale score).

Conclusions

Few cost studies of stroke include information based on stroke recovery measured by individual modified Rankin Scale categories and the existing data are limited. To reliably capture this information, future studies are needed that preferably apply standardised costing methods to promote greater potential for use in cost-effectiveness analyses whereby direct collection of patient-level resource use has not been possible.

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^114MKwRo]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) has been widely used as an outcome measure in stroke trialsand in more than 30 other neurologic conditions including Parkinson disease and autoimmune encephalitis (data available from Dryad, table e-1). However, there is lack of consensus on how the mRS should be analyzed, with more than half of stroke trials since 2007 still using dichotomous analysis, splitting the mRS into favorable/unfavorable outcomes, while about a quarter used ordinal (shift) analysis, assessing all changes across the range. There is also disagreement about optimal dichotomy, with many recent trials using 0–1/2–6 instead of 0–2/3–6.

Dichotomous analyses provide results that are easily explained using the absolute risk reduction in outcome between treatment groups but they may often be statistically inefficient, requiring larger sample sizes, and risk overvaluing a beneficial transition at one end of the distribution while disregarding harm at the other. The ordinal approach, first advocated for stroke trials by Bath et al.and Saver, reduces this risk and allows trials to reduce sample size by 14% to 53% — particularly appealing for trials in rarer conditions — but might also reduce statistical power if benefit is clustered at a few predictable state transitions. When seeking a clinically interpretable parameter (common odds ratio), ordinal analysis is also limited by the proportional odds assumption, although alternatives have been proposed. The dilemma is complicated by interrater variability, which is greatest for grades 1 and 2, around which the mRS is dichotomized.

### Exploring the reliability of the modified rankin scale [^1177AP9R]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most prevalent outcome measure in stroke trials. Use of the mRS may be hampered by variability in grading. Previous estimates of the properties of the mRS have used diverse methodologies and may not apply to contemporary trial populations. We used a mock clinical trial design to explore inter- and intraobserver variability of the mRS.

Methods

Consenting patients with stroke attending for outpatient review had the mRS performed by 2 independent assessors with pairs of assessors selected from a team of 3 research nurses and 4 stroke physicians. Before formal assessment, interviewers estimated disability based only on initial patient observation. Each patient was then randomized to undergo the mRS using standard assessment or a prespecified structured interview. The second interviewer in the pair reassessed the patient using the same method blinded to the colleague's score. For each patient assessed, one rater was randomly assigned to video record their interview. After 3 months, this interviewer reviewed and regraded their original video assessment.

Results

Across 100 paired assessments, interobserver agreement was moderate (k = 0.57). Intraobserver variability was good (k = 0.72) but less than would be expected from previous literature. Forty-nine assessments were performed using the structured interview approach with no significant difference between structured and standard mRS. Researchers were unable to reliably predict mRS from initial limited patient assessment (k = 0.16).

Conclusions

Despite availability of training and structured interview, there remains substantial interobserver variability in mRS grades awarded even by experienced researchers. Additional methods to improve mRS reliability are required.

### Optimal end points for acute stroke therapy trials: best ways to measure treatment effects of drugs and devices [^117Xi4zh]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Over the past decade, analysis of completed actual trials, model population studies, and theoretical work have improved approaches to selecting and analyzing end points in acute stroke treatment trials.

Methods

Narrative review.

Results

Because stroke affects persons in their biological, functional, social, and experiential dimensions, measures of impairment, disability, handicap, and quality of life are all desirable in pivotal trials, with disability being most important. Scales that are valid, reliable, responsive, and easy to administer are preferred; consequently, the modified Rankin Scale has become the most widely used single clinical efficacy measure. Because stroke cripples and kills, most outcome scales array patient outcome in ordered ranks, spread over the entire range from normal to disabled to dead. Generally, shift analysis, analyzing all health state transitions concurrently, is the most efficient analytic technique to detect treatment effects, with sliding dichotomy less efficient and fixed dichotomy least efficient, unless treatment effects strongly cluster at 1 or a few health state transitions that can be prespecified. Test statistics must also take into account interpretability, ie, how well they can be converted into metrics capturing all outcomes the intervention might alter in proportion to the degree they are valued by the patient; full ordinal analysis is most informative, sliding dichotomy is intermediately informative, and fixed dichotomy is least informative regarding this global outcome.

Conclusions

Stroke trial power and interpretation can be substantially enhanced by adherence to the principles delineated in this review. Full ordinal and sliding dichotomy analysis will most often be advantageous compared with fixed dichotomous approaches.

### One-year outcomes and functional recovery among survivors of intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage… [^1147RBUT]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

CLEAR-III indicates the Clot Lysis: Evaluating Accelerated Resolution of Intraventricular Hemorrhage phase 3 trial; ICH, intracerebral hemorrhage; IVH, intraventricular hemorrhage; MISTIE-III, the Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus Alteplase for Intracerebral Hemorrhage Evacuation phase 3 trial; mRS, modified Rankin Scale score. Patients were enrolled from August 1, 2010, to September 30, 2018, with a follow-up duration of 1 year. Of 999 enrolled patients, 724 survived with a day 30 modified Rankin Scale score of 4 to 5 after excluding 13 participants with missing day 30 mRS. An additional 9 patients were excluded because of missing 1-year mRS. The final pooled cohort included 715 patients with day 30 mRS 4 to 5. Data were analyzed from July 2019 to January
2022. Intracerebral hemorrhage prognostication is historically performed on admission, and most models predict short-term outcomes.

1–3 However, survivors of severe ICH often have initial considerable disability, with a median 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 54 and limited understanding of future recovery. In MISTIE-III, leukoaraiosis was graded on magnetic resonance imaging, using the Fazekas scale. 25 Severe leukoaraiosis was defined as van Sweiten Scale score 3 or higher, deep Fazekas scale score 2 to 3, and/or total Fazekas scale score greater than 3. Median time to home, death, and withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment were calculated using time-to-event analyses. mRS and EQ-VAS score trajectories were assessed using mixed-effects linear regression, treating mRS and EQ-VAS scores as outcome, day of assessment as fixed effects, and patients as random effects.

### Modified rankin scale at 90 Days versus National Institutes of Health stroke scale at 24 hours as primary outcome in acute stroke trials [^111eHVY6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our study has several limitations. First, the categories of the "ordinal" NIHSS score we chose were somewhat arbitrary, the goal being to create a score that can be analyzed using the same methods that are used for 90‐day mRS. We recognize that other approaches exist to collapse scores into fewer categories, such as Bayesian structural equation modeling. These advanced approaches have not been explored in this study, since they require more advanced statistical knowledge and nuanced modeling decisions and are more challenging to interpret. Second, sample sizes in the NIHSS subgroups analyzed were small (≈100 each), and results from the subgroup analyses should therefore be interpreted with caution. It is also important to note that we defined mild strokes as NIHSS < 10 for the subgroup analysis to increase subgroup sample size, as opposed to the more commonly used NIHSS < 6 definition. Third, it is likely that the association of 24‐hour NIHSS and 90‐day mRS is influenced by the quality of postacute stroke care. The trials included in HERMES were conducted in developed countries with overall good postacute care and stroke rehabilitation infrastructure, and it is not clear whether our results are generalizable to other settings with different postacute setups. Fourth, we fully acknowledge that combining short‐term and long‐term outcomes into a win ratio in a a post hoc fashion has its limitations, and we do not attempt to prove EVT benefit with this analysis. Rather, our intention is to explore the win ratio as an alternative way of capturing treatment effect using EVT as an exemplary intervention with robust, previously proven treatment effect, and validation in other data sets are warranted, as are exploration of additional "win ratio outcome combinations", which could include quality‐of‐life metrics and other patient‐reported outcome measures. Finally, we used EVT as an exemplary acute stroke treatment in this study, but future research should explore whether and to what extent the performance of outcome scales examined in this study is generalizable to other acute stroke therapies.

### Quality improvement in neurology: stroke and stroke rehabilitation quality measurement set update [^117UnASR]. Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Functional outcome assessment following recanalization therapy — acute ischemic stroke: A measure was created to address a gap in current measurement settings and assesses the percentage of patients with acute ischemic stroke who received any acute reperfusion therapy who have a functional outcome assessment via the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) documented at 90 days.

### Clinical interpretation and use of stroke scales [^1115NJ9N]. The Lancet: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

No single outcome measure can describe or predict all dimensions of recovery and disability after acute stroke. Several scales have proven reliability and validity in stroke trials, including the National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS), the modified Rankin scale (mRS), the Barthel index (BI), the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), and the stroke impact scale (SIS). Several scales have been combined in stroke trials to derive a global statistic to better define the effect of acute interventions, although this composite statistic is not clinically tenable. In practice, the NIHSS is useful for early prognostication and serial assessment, whereas the BI is useful for planning rehabilitative strategies. The mRS and GOS provide summary measures of outcome and might be most relevant to clinicians and patients considering early intervention. The SIS was designed to measure the patient's perspective on the effect of stroke. Familiarity with these scales could improve clinicians' interpretation of stroke research and their clinical decision-making.

### Repeated measures of modified rankin scale scores to assess functional recovery from stroke: AFFINITY study Findings [^1165AR6c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The direction of associations was largely concordant between single‐measure and repeated‐measures models except for a history of depression (positive OR in the univariable single‐measure model, but negative OR in the univariable repeated‐measures model and the multivariable single and repeated‐measures model). However, the size of associations was generally reduced (ORs closer to unity) in the repeated‐measures model, with lower variance (increased precision) and smaller CIs.

### Standardized nomenclature for modified rankin scale global disability outcomes: consensus recommendations from stroke therapy academic industry roundtable XI [^1167qM7G]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS), a 7-level, clinician-reported, measure of global disability, is the most widely employed outcome scale in acute stroke trials. The scale's original development preceded the advent of modern clinimetrics, but substantial subsequent work has been performed to enable the mRS to meet robust contemporary scale standards. Prior research and consensus recommendations have focused on modernizing 2 aspects of the mRS: operationalized assignment of scale scores and statistical analysis of scale distributions. Another important characteristic of the mRS still requiring elaboration and specification to contemporary clinimetric standards is the Naming of scale outcomes. Recent clinical trials have used a bewildering variety, often mutually contradictory, of rubrics to describe scale states. Understanding of the meaning of mRS outcomes by clinicians, patients, and other clinical trial stakeholders would be greatly enhanced by use of a harmonized, uniform set of labels for the distinctive mRS outcomes that would be used consistently across trials. This statement advances such recommended rubrics, developed by the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable collaboration using an iterative, mixed-methods process. Specific guidance is provided for health state terms (eg, Symptomatic but Nondisabled for mRS score 1; requires constant care for mRS score 5) and valence terms (eg, excellent for mRS score 1; very poor for mRS score 5) to employ for 23 distinct numeric mRS outcomes, including: all individual 7 mRS levels; all 12 positive and negative dichotomized mRS ranges, positive and negative sliding dichotomies; and utility-weighted analysis of the mRS.

### What should be defined as good outcome in stroke trials; a modified rankin score of 0–1 or 0–2? [^111ekUxM]. Journal of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Good outcome in stroke trials has been defined as a modified Rankin scale (mRs) score of 0–1 or 0–2. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical meaning of these two dichotomies.

Methods

We studied 152 patients six months post stroke using the mRs and a new disability measure the AMC Linear Disability Scale (ALDS) item bank. Descriptive statistics were used to show the ALDS scores by the levels of the mRs. To investigate the clinical meaning of the different definitions of good outcome, the mean probability to perform activities of daily life (ADL) of all mRs grades and these two dichotomies was calculated.

Results

The ability to perform difficult ALDS items declined gradually with increasing mRs grade. When favourable outcome is defined as mRs 0–1, 15% of the cohort has a good outcome; of these patients 84% were likely to perform outdoor activities. If good outcome is defined as mRs 0–2, the percentage of patients with good outcome increased to 37%, whereas 66% of these patients were likely to perform outdoor activities.

Conclusion

If good outcome is defined as the ability to perform outdoor activities mRs 0–1 should be chosen. If complex ADL are considered as good outcome mRs 0–2 is the outcome measure of choice. Independent of which outcome measure is chosen, the treatment effect in clinical trials must be large before good outcome is achieved. Therefore, it is likely that clinically important treatment effects can be missed in clinical trials with both these mRs endpoints.

### Role of the proportional odds assumption for the analysis of ordinal outcomes in neurologic trials [^112KDdnK]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ordinal scales such as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOS-E) are widely used for outcome assessment in clinical trials in neurologic diseases. Compared with binary outcomes, ordinal scales allow a more detailed assessment of the effect of the treatment on the functional status of patients and provide more statistical power when the treatment results in a general shift toward better (or worse) functional status.

We recently reviewed the statistical practice of analyzing ordinal outcomes in current trials of acute neurologic diseases. One notable finding was that ordinal outcomes were dichotomized in about one-third of the included studies. Dichotomization results in a loss of statistical power when the underlying effect of the treatment is a global shift to better outcome categories. Irrespective of the effect pattern, dichotomization always causes a loss of information because the original scale cannot be recovered after dichotomization. The loss of information is especially problematic if the treatment effect is bidirectional, as in the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study trial where patients on IV alteplase had both more good outcomes and more poor outcomes than control patients. Dichotomizing an ordinal outcome has been motivated by the clinical meaningfulness of a particular cut-point, which depends on the research question, mechanism of the intervention, and patient case-mix. We stress that even if the primary analysis is based on dichotomization, it remains important to explore the full ordinal scale. This aligns with the recommendations of the US Food and Drug Administration. Ordinal methods are powerful and informative, but they continue to be underused.

### Predicting 90-day modified rankin scale score with discharge information in acute ischaemic stroke patients following treatment [^1113hjti]. BMJ Neurology Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the primary cause of adult-onset disability and a leading cause of death in the USA. Understanding the degree of long-term disability in stroke survivors is important for rehabilitation planning, estimating the cost efficiency of stroke care and determining the efficacy of acute stroke interventions and management. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score is the standard disability outcome measure used in both stroke patient care and clinical trials and has been found to be especially valuable when evaluated at 90 days after stroke onset.

Because of the practical difficulty obtaining reliable follow-up information from stroke survivors, mRS scores are not commonly assessed after patient discharge in clinical settings. Even in research studies, long-term follow-up is often challenging and incomplete. Therefore, discharge mRS scores are often employed as a surrogate for long-term outcomes. One study of 261 patients in a statewide hospital-based acute stroke registry found discharge mRS to be a strong independent predictor of 90-day mRS scores. Another study found that discharge mRS correlates strongly with clinical scores predicting long-term adverse outcomes. However, both concluded that discharge mRS score is not a sufficient proxy of 90-day mRS score based on their calculations of Cohen's weighted kappa statistics between 0.21 and 0.40, a range which has been suggested to indicate only fair agreement. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that 30-day mRS scores may be a good proxy for 90-day mRS score.

Furthermore, others have used discharge disposition, which is readily available in administrative claims databases, as the primary poststroke outcome. While previous studies examining the association between discharge disposition and 90-day mRS indicate that discharge disposition is a good predictor of 90-day mRS scores, these were conducted within clinical trials. There is no research assessing the association between discharge disposition and 90-day mRS in the clinical practice setting, which is necessary to ensure findings from clinical trials are generalisable to real-world populations.

The purpose of this study was to better understand the variability of individual mRS scores from stroke hospitalisation discharge to 90 days and to assess prediction of 90-day mRS scores using discharge mRS scores and discharge disposition in a non-clinical trial cohort.

### Comparison of the National Institutes of Health stroke scale with disability outcome measures in acute stroke trials [^115uyWf3]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Acute stroke trials typically use disability scales as their primary end point. Neurologic impairment scales such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) are possibly more sensitive to change in patient status. We aimed to compare a range of potential NIHSS end points with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI) end points.

Methods

We simulated a total of 6000 clinical trials, each with 1400 patients. We estimated statistical power for a range of NIHSS end points, including prognosis-adjusted and fixed dichotomized end points. These end points were compared with the BI and mRS dichotomized at 95 and 1, respectively.

Results

The most powerful fixed end point was the NIHSS dichotomized at 1. For prognosis-adjusted outcome, we found greatest power if we defined success as achieving a score of ≤ 1 or improvement by at least 11 points from baseline. We are more likely to achieve a statistically significant result by using this prognosis-adjusted end point instead of NIHSS ≤ 1 (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.5 to 3.2). Use of the optimal NIHSS prognosis-adjusted end point rather than BI ≥ 95 could justify a reduction in sample size of approximately 68% (95% CI, 67% to 69%) without loss of statistical power.

Conclusions

The NIHSS neurologic scale appears more sensitive than the BI or mRS, allowing smaller sample sizes or greater statistical power. The use of an NIHSS prognosis-adjusted end point could allow therapeutic effects from drugs to be more easily identified.

### Comparison of local and centrally adjudicated modified rankin scale scores in the MOST trial [^1141R1Yp]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a key measure of functional outcomes in stroke trials. To minimize variability, structured tools like the Rankin Focused Assessment and central adjudication are recommended. This study compares local versus centrally adjudicated mRS scores in the MOST trial (Multi-Arm Optimization of Stroke Thrombolysis).

Methods

MOST was a phase 3, single-blind, randomized trial evaluating argatroban, eptifibatide, or placebo in addition to intravenous thrombolysis. The primary outcome, 90-day mRS score, was gathered through in-person video recordings by blinded local personnel. Recordings were sent to central adjudicators for final scoring. As in-person visits became limited due to SARS-CoV-2, remote interviews were allowed. We hypothesized that local mRS scores would be moderately associated with central scores. Fleiss-Cohen quadratic weighted κ statistics were used to determine the strength of agreement.

Results

Out of 514 participants, 378 had recorded visits available (121 in-person video, 157 remote video, 100 remote audio). Local assessors were blinded 96.8% of the time and 85.4% of visits used the Rankin Focused Assessment. Overall agreement between local and central mRS scores was excellent (weighted κ, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.83–0.90]). A nonsignificant decrease in strength of agreement was noted for those with a nonzero baseline mRS (mRS score = 0, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.84–0.91] versus mRS score > 0, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.68–0.91]). Trial conclusions were unchanged when utilizing the local mRS versus central adjudication.

Conclusions

Local mRS scores demonstrated strong agreement with central scores across all assessment modes. With blinded end point assessments, central mRS adjudication in acute stroke trials may not be necessary.

### Inter-method reliability of the modified rankin scale in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage [^112NuKeF]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is one of the most frequently used outcome measures in randomized clinical trials in patients with an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The mRS is an ordinal 7-point scale ranging from no residual symptoms (0), to severely disabled (5) or death (6). The mRS measures the constructs: mobility, disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and living arrangements (Table 1)

Table 1
The mRS score

Given the broad use of the mRS as a primary endpoint for aSAH in randomized controlled trials, it is important to assess its reliability. In clinical trials it is often not described how the mRS is assessed, while the method might influence the mRS score. There are several possible assessment methods of the mRS. First, a regular non-structured assessment by a physician or nurse practitioner, in which the mRS is often scored in hindsight after an appointment to the outpatient clinic. Second, a face-to-face structured interview can be used to score the mRS. The structured interview consists of specific questions per mRS score. It has been shown that the inter-rater reliability of the mRS in patients after stroke is better with a structured interview than with conventional scoring, although some studies show conflicting results. Third, a self-assessment by the patient (either online or on paper) is a reported possibility of mRS measurement in stroke. Next to these different structural methods, the assessment can be conducted in person or by telephone. The aim of this study is to evaluate the inter-method reliability between a structured interview or self-assessment of the mRS compared to a regular assessment by a physician.

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^111AJVd3]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Aside from the issue of which approach is most statistically robust for short-term outcome analysis, the long-term trajectories of patients in different mRS grades can also inform the choice of primary outcome analysis, by testing the validity of the ordinal vs dichotomous forms of the mRS as they relate to long-term clinical or health-economic outcomes. If meaningful differences in outcomes are seen across the range of mRS scores, resulting in a significantly better fit in regression models using the ordinal mRS, this would favor ordinal approaches, but if meaningful differences are seen only between certain groupings of mRS levels (e.g. mRS 0–2 vs 3–6), this would favor dichotomization.

Moreover, a dichotomous approach usually results in exclusion of patients with premorbid disability, since patients with mRS score > 1 or > 2 before their stroke cannot achieve a "favorable" poststroke outcome if defined as a 3-month mRS of 0–1 or 0–2, respectively. For example, recent trials of thrombectomy in acute stroke generally excluded patients with premorbid mRS score ≥ 2. However, such patients could still contribute in ordinal analysis. It is unclear to what extent dichotomies risk excluding key segments of the population, potentially limiting the external validity of results; quantifying this risk may help trialists decide whether to dichotomize the mRS.

We therefore compared how the 3 commonly used mRS representations (ordinal/full-range vs dichotomized as 0–1/2–6 or 0–2/3–6) relate to 5-year disability, survival, and health/social care costs in 3-month survivors of ischemic stroke in a population-based study. We also examined the proportion of patients who had premorbid mRS score > 1 or > 2 — who would risk exclusion with dichotomous approaches — and examined whether the relationship of the mRS representations to long-term outcomes would differ on excluding these patients.

### Comparing the properties of traditional and novel approaches to the modified rankin scale: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111jqTqh]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We found that mRS is a valid measure of function in stroke research, and that it can be successfully applied using differing methods and technologies. Individual approaches to mRS differed in their inter-rater reliability, but no approach completely removed this variability. Although some of the newer structured interviews reported reliability that was substantially better than seen with traditional mRS, we do not think we have sufficient evidence to recommend a single mRS assessment that should become the standard. This is because, for each individual approach to mRS there were limited numbers of studies, there were potential issues with bias, and a lack of head-to-head studies to directly confirm superiority of one particular method. What is apparent is that reliability of mRS has demonstrated temporal improvement. This suggests that the last decades of research into mRS properties and development of interventions to improve mRS reliability have been worthwhile. Clinical trials in stroke continue to evolve and there is no room for complacency, trialists should continue to critically assess and attempt to improve the properties of stroke outcomes.

Our data differ from previous reviews that suggested structuring the mRS may not be justified. There are now many scales that provide a structure to the mRS interview and their properties are not equivalent. As opposed to early attempts at a script for mRS, more recent structured scales (i.e. RFA and smRSq) demonstrated higher IRR than the standard mRS. New structured scales decrease ambiguity by allowing follow-up questions, operationalised criteria, instruction sheets, and the use of medical records. A complicating factor in the comparison of reliability is the widespread adoption of mRS training and guidance on scoring. Raters using contemporary structured assessments are likely to have also completed mRS training, and improvements in reliability compared to historical studies may, in part, relate to consistency from training.

Overall, validity of structured mRS approaches was excellent. Although, individual scales varied substantially with some novel scales showing poor validity (e.g. RFA). Notably, excellent construct validity of the standard mRS has been previously measured. Therefore, caution is warranted before making conclusive statements about the validity of novel mRS variants.

We found that mobile applications or central video reviews to assess mRS score may be more reliable than a telephone interview. Although the reliability of telephone interview remains high, studies have mentioned its unsuitability for patients with aphasia, and underestimation of disability given the absence of visual cues.

### Distribution-free approach to the design and analysis of randomized stroke trials with the modified rankin scale [^112UVCZe]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Many methods have been suggested for analyzing the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). However, there lacks a unified approach to analysis and sample size determination that properly uses the ordinal nature of the data. We propose a simple method for CI estimation and corresponding sample size determination.

Methods

We quantify treatment effect by the win probability (WinP) that a randomly selected patient in the treatment group has an equal or a better mRS score than a patient in the control group. Thus, a win probability of 0.5 means no effect, likened to a draw in competitive sports. We estimate the win probability and its SE based on the ranks of mRS scores, where tied scores are handled by average ranks. Corresponding methods for hypothesis testing, CI estimation, and sample size determination are derived. The methods are evaluated with a simulation study based on real data from 10 randomized stroke trials that used mRS as the outcome measure.

Results

Simulation results demonstrated that the methods performed very well in terms of CI coverage, tail errors, and assurance to achieving the prespecified precision. Because the methods are very simple, we implemented them in an Excel spreadsheet, requiring only user inputs on frequencies of mRS scores in 2 comparison groups.

Conclusions

Sound statistical methods are important for the success of randomized stroke trials. The proposed methods and associated spreadsheet should prove useful for stroke researchers in the planning and analysis of randomized trials. Meta-analysis has also been made easy for trials with ordinal scores.

### Weights for ordinal analyses of the modified rankin scale in stroke trials: a population-based cohort study [^112Qn8Rx]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ordinal/shift analyses of ordered measures like the modified Rankin Scale(mRS) are underused as primary trial outcomes for neurological disorders - despite statistical advantages - potentially hindered by poor clinical interpretability versus dichotomies, and by valuing state-transitions equally (linear scale). Weighted ordinal analyses incorporating step-changes at key transitions might have greater statistical validity and clinical applicability.

Methods

In a prospective population-based cohort of ischaemic stroke (Oxford Vascular Study, recruited 2002–2014), we stratified 5-year outcomes of death, dementia, and/or institutionalization, health/social-care costs, and EuroQol-derived quality-adjusted life-expectancy(QALE) by 3-month mRS. We compared root-mean-square errors(RMSEs) from linear regressions for these outcomes with the mRS coded as a linear scale versus incorporating a spline at transitions 1–2, 2–3, or 3–4. We derived 3-month mRS weights for probability of 5-year death/dementia/institutionalization using age/sex-adjusted logistic regressions, and cost and QALE weights from 1000-bootstraps. We applied these weights to analyse recent trials of thrombectomy for acute ischaemic stroke.

Findings

Among 1,607 patients, a non-linear (S-shaped) relationship was observed between 3-month mRS and each 5-year outcome, with RMSEs 18–73% lower using a spline at mRS 2–3 versus a linear representation. Age/sex-adjusted probability weights for 5-year death/dementia/institutionalization were: mRS 0 = 0.19; 1 = 0.27; 2 = 0.41; 3 = 0.73; 4 = 0.77; 5 = 0.94 (mRS 6 = 1 by definition). Similar trends were seen with costs; estimated 5-year QALEs were: mRS 0 = 3.88; 1 = 3.49; 2 = 3.01; 3 = 1.87; 4 = 1.30; 5 = 0.06; 6 = 0. Results were similar stratifying by age/sex, and excluding pre-morbidly disabled patients. Using a weighted ordinal approach, estimates of thrombectomy impact were more favourable than estimates with dichotomous approaches, 5-year cost reductions being 29% higher than with 0–2/3–6, and over three-fold higher than with 0–1/2–6 dichotomy.

Interpretation

Our findings favour weighting the mRS in ordinal analyses for stroke and other neurological disorders, as state-transitions differ in clinical prognosis, quality-of-life, and costs. These weights could also be used for prognostication and cost-effectiveness analyses.

### Health utility weighting of the modified rankin scale: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116nroA7]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

The literature was systematically reviewed for all studies that concurrently reported mRS scores and utility weights in stroke survivors, with the aim of exploring potential implications in using and interpreting a UW-mRS in the poststroke population. First, differences in utility weighting were examined between studies that used different health utility scales. Next, interstudy variance in utility weighting was compared between studies using the same health utility scale, and the associations of geographically specific tariffs were explored. In addition, EuroQoL 5-dimension (EQ-5D)–weighted UW-mRSs identified by the systematic review were retrospectively applied to major superiority design acute clinical stroke trials to assess how the outcome of each trial might be interpreted.

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^112aeDJf]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

We have demonstrated that the ordinal mRS relates better to 5-year disability (whether defined as mRS > 1 or > 2), death/disability, mortality, and health/social care costs, than both the 0–1/2–6 and 0–2/3–6 dichotomies. In addition to further validating the mRS as an outcome measure, these findings have implications for trials using the mRS as the primary outcome measure.

First, our findings favor retaining the full ordinal range of the mRS over dichotomizing it for analysis, by adding clinical data to prior arguments about statistical efficiency. Efficiency depends on expected treatment effects and does not always favor ordinal analysis. However, a clinically robust primary outcome measure should capture differences in long-term disability, care needs (costs), and survival — objective treatment goals in neurologic disease — and our analyses demonstrate that the ordinal mRS best reflects these outcomes, with differences seen across the range of the scale. These results imply that any shifts in mRS can be meaningful, and that it may be misleading to consider certain states as being equivalent with respect to long-term outcomes. It is also inappropriate to view patients with premorbid disability as having no potential to benefit from disability-lowering treatments, given significant differences in long-term outcome among patients with 3-month mRS grades 3, 4, and 5, and certainly between mRS 2 and 3.

### Sublingual edaravone dexborneol in acute ischemic stroke… [^114NkGHN]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Shown are scores on the modified Rankin Scale for the patients in the 2 treatment groups. Scores range from 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no symptoms; 1, no clinically significant disability; 2, slight disability; 3, moderate disability; 4, moderately severe disability; 5, severe disability; and 6, death. mRS indicates modified Rankin Scale; NIHSS, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; OR, odds ratio; TOAST, Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment. Question Does sublingual edaravone dexborneol improve functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Findings.

In this randomized clinical trial including 914 patients who received sublingual edaravone dexborneol or placebo, the proportion of patients achieving a favorable outcome defined as a 90-day modified Rankin Scale score of 1 or less was 64. 4% in the sublingual edaravone dexborneol group, which was significantly higher than
54. 7% in the placebo group. The rate of adverse events was similar between the 2 groups. Patients randomly assigned to treatment groups were aged 18 to 80 years and had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score between 6 and 20, a total motor deficit score of the upper and lower limbs of 2 or greater, a clinically diagnosed AIS symptom within 48 hours, and a modified Rankin Scale score of 1 or less before stroke. Patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria or declined to participate were excluded. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients with an mRS score of 1 or less on day 90 after randomization.

The secondary outcomes included mRS score on day 90, the proportion of patients with an mRS score of 2 or less on day 90, the change in NIHSS score from baseline to day 14, and the proportion of patients with an NIHSS score of 1 or less on day 14, 30, and 90 after randomization.

### Contemporary outcome measures in acute stroke research: choice of primary outcome measure [^112X2zZc]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The diversity of available outcome measures for acute stroke trials is challenging and implies that the scales may be imperfect. To assist researchers planning trials and to aid interpretation, this article reviews and makes recommendations on the available choices of scales. The aim is to identify an approach that will be universally accepted and that should be included in most acute trials, without seeking to restrict options for special circumstances.

Methods

The article considers outcome measures that have been widely used or are currently advised. It examines desirable properties for outcome measures such as validity, relevance, responsiveness, statistical properties, availability of training, cultural and language issues, resistance to comorbidity, as well as potential weaknesses. Tracking and agreement among outcomes are covered.

Results

Typical ranges of scores for the common scales are described, along with their statistical properties, which in turn influence optimal analytic techniques. The timing of recovery on scores and usual practice in trial design are considered.

Conclusions

The preferred outcome measure for acute trials is the modified Rankin Scale, assessed at 3 months after stroke onset or later. The interview should be conducted by a certified rater and should involve both the patient and any relevant caregiver. Incremental benefits at any level of the modified Rankin Scale may be acceptable. The modified Rankin Scale is imperfect but should be retained in its present form for comparability with existing treatment comparisons. No second measure should be required, but correlations with supporting scales may be used to confirm consistency in direction of effects on other measures.

### Comparing the properties of traditional and novel approaches to the modified rankin scale: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jJ9cj]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Inter-rater reliability

In total, four studies were excluded from the meta-analysis due to missing 95% CI. – The IRR(K) across all versions of the mRS ranged from fair to excellent, and the IRR(KW) ranged from moderate to excellent. Overall, the IRR(K) was substantial, and IRR(KW) was excellent. Table 2 shows the summary of IRR across all retrieved mRS studies.

The IRR varied across mRS scales. RFA had both highest IRR(K) and IRR(KW). The lowest IRR(K) was found with the standard mRS and the lowest IRR(KW) was found with the mRS decision tool. Forest plots in Figure 2 demonstrate the IRR(K) and IRR(KW) across mRS scales.

The overall IRR(K) of mRS before the adoption of the standardised training and certificationwas moderate (n = 10, K = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.44–0.67), whereas the IRR(K) after the training has been introduced was substantial (n = 18, K = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.62–0.77).

A sensitivity analysis removing all high ROB studies showed the overall IRR of K = 0.66 (95% CI: 0.58–0.74), with the IRR of standard mRS being K = 0.52 (95% CI: 0.41–0.63) and the IRR of Structured Interview (SI) being K = 0.73 (95% CI: 0.64–0.81).

Given the presence of publication bias, we conducted an exploratory analysis, grouping the IRR of the standard mRS by year of publication. As shown in Figure 3, the highest IRR(KW) of the standard mRS was reported before the year 1999, and after 2018.

Validity of structured mRS scales

Table 3 shows validity of mRS scales when compared with stroke-related measures, with standard mRS, and smRSq. Two studies were not included in the meta-analysis due to missing 95% CI. Validity of the structured mRS scales with other stroke measures ranged from poor to excellent. Overall, validity of structured mRS scales with the standard mRS was excellent. Validity of structured mRS scales with the smRSq was good.

### Added value of a blinded outcome adjudication committee in an open-label randomized stroke trial [^113EL6ZU]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Valid outcomes are essential in the evaluation of treatment effect in clinical trials. In stroke trials, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most commonly used primary outcome measure. This 7-point ordinal scale describes the degree of global disability or dependence in daily life after stroke (ie, functional outcome). To obtain reliable mRS scores is challenging in all stroke trials due to the subjective nature causing moderate interobserver agreement. With the introduction of the prospective randomized open blinded end point (PROBE [prospective randomized open blinded end point]) design, which is frequently used in stroke trials, reliable outcome assessment became even more challenging. It may be difficult to remain blinded during mRS assessment because patients and their proxies are aware of the treatment they received. This is especially difficult when the treatment contrast between the experimental and control arm is large, for example, in trials that compare an intervention such as endovascular treatment with no intervention. Unblinded assessment of outcomes can lead to systematic (ie, differential) misclassification, which causes biased effect estimates. – In addition, incorrect classification of outcomes, also when at random (ie, nondifferential misclassification), can reduce the power of detecting a true treatment effect. Both differential and nondifferential misclassification can result in incorrect conclusions with regard to treatment efficacy.

To reduce differential and nondifferential misclassification, external, blinded outcome adjudication can be used. An outcome adjudication committee consists of a group of independent clinical experts who validate the assessment of outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. In trials with PROBE design, they also assure blinded outcome assessment by evaluating masked reports. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that central adjudication in stroke trials did not have any impact on trial conclusions. However, site investigators were blinded to treatment allocation in the majority of the included studies, and the studies had predominantly objective outcome measures. Outcome adjudication committees may be most valuable in studies in which both the intervention is not delivered in a blinded manner and the outcomes are subjective. The added value of an outcome adjudication committee in trials with PROBE design and a subjective outcome is unknown. We aimed to assess the degree of misclassification of mRS scores by a central assessor compared with mRS scores of an outcome adjudication committee and its impact on treatment effect estimates in a stroke trial with PROBE design.

### Repeated measures of modified rankin scale scores to assess functional recovery from stroke: AFFINITY study Findings [^115psDge]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Previous repeated‐measures analyses of the mRS have focused on either describing mRS over time or identifying treatment effect, rather than associations, and have not used ordinal logistic regression. A comparison of statistical methodshighlighted that multistate Markov models and partial proportional odds models were the most efficient in analyzing ordinal mRS, but noting that Markov models are designed for prediction of transitions between individual mRS categories, rather than identifying associations. A posttrial analysis of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt‐PA Stroke Trial further supports use of the partial proportional odds model for analyzing mRS, finding lower prediction error and better model fit when compared with the proportional odds model (with violation of the proportional odds assumption). Another posttrial analysis of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke rt‐PA Stroke Trial used both repeated measures (baseline; day 7; months 3, 6, and 12) and single‐measure methods to compare treatment effects of thrombolysis on dichotomized mRS (mRS < 1). At 90 days, repeated‐measures analysis augmented treatment effect compared with single‐measure analysis, with larger odds ratios and greater precision. Another study used repeated‐measures of mRS (baseline; months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12) in generalized linear models to analyze thrombolysis and endovascular treatment effects on dichotomous and ordinal mRS but did not identify associations with functional recovery nor compare with single‐measure analysis.

Common associations in stroke functional recovery models include age, preadmission comorbidities, prestroke dependency, and neurologic deficit., mRS score is commonly recorded before the trial and at 90 days (and recommended at 90 days), and models typically predict a single measure in time (eg, day 90 mRS). However, individualized understanding of functional recovery over time may be clinically important to assist personalized rehabilitation and discharge. Understanding an individual's ordinal mRS score may assist with this, while acknowledging that mRS as a global measure of function will not fully characterize physical or cognitive abilities. Recovery is often not linear nor the same for each person, and thus mRS should be assessed several times to reflect potential fluctuations. Previous longitudinal stroke studies have found that older age, male sex, previous ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease, and diabetes are associated with mRS scores that either stay constant or increase over time, although broadly mRS scores decrease with time.

### Time spent at home poststroke: "home-time" a meaningful and robust outcome measure for stroke trials [^11751uYJ]. Stroke (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Stroke outcome assessment requires some measure of functional recovery. Several instruments are in common use but all have recognized limitations. We examined duration of stay in the patient's own home over the first 90 days since stroke-"home-time"-as an alternative outcome likely to show graded response with improved reliability.

Methods

We examined prospectively collected data from the GAIN International trial using analysis of variance with Bonferroni contrasts of adjacent modified Rankin scale score categories.

Results

We had full outcome data from 1717 of 1788 patients. Increasing home-time was associated with improved modified Rankin scale scores (P < 0.0001). The relationship held across all modified Rankin scale grades except 4 to 5.

Conclusions

Home-time offers a robust, useful, and easily validated outcome measure for stroke, particularly across better recovery levels.

### Weights for ordinal analyses of the modified rankin scale in stroke trials: a population-based cohort study [^115BkX1N]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Our analysis has several strengths, including a robust population-based design with high ascertainment of incident strokes; completeness of follow-up for disability, dementia, death, institutionalization, and cost data; and replication of findings for various subgroups. However, there are potential limitations. Firstly, the generalizability of our mRS weights may be limited by differences in practice settings, case-mix, ethnicity, or cultural values. The OXVASC population is from a geographically distinct part of the United Kingdom, is 95% White, relatively elderly (mean age 73-years), and is cared for within a publicly funded healthcare system with relatively accessible acute and post-acute stroke care. Mortality and morbidity-based weights may differ considerably in lower and middle-income countries. Some of the patients in our cohort had their index stroke up to 18 years ago, during which time stroke care and outcomes have changed considerably. As such, our weighted mRS may be seen as a work in development that requires further validation and refinement using stroke datasets from different populations like the Northern Manhattan Studyor the Clinical Research Collaboration for Stroke in Korea. Secondly, the weights generated for 3-month mRS may not be generalizable to mRS measurements at other time-points. Thirdly, if a new therapy modifies risks of long-term dementia, institutionalization, quality-of-life, or mortality beyond reduction in stroke-related disability, then our probability-weighted mRS approach could under-estimate that benefit. Our estimates of resource use may also not be representative in such cases. However, this would still be an improvement over conventional approaches that do not capture prognostic implications, and could serve as a useful "shorthand" estimate of cost-effectiveness. Fourthly, further data is required to demonstrate the clinical interpretability of our weighted mRS data in practice; for example, this could include focus groups with clinicians and trialists who are shown trial data using different ordinal approaches and asked to choose which presentation is easiest to understand. Indeed, weighting the mRS by different prognoses or costs is not the only method to potentially improve the clinical interpretability of mRS data in clinical trials. Work by other groups may examine combining other scales with the mRS to create a single, aggregate measure, or using other scales like the Barthel Indexor Functional Independence Measureto add granularity, particularly with more intermediate mRS scores. It could be argued that a weighted approach may be more useful for more granular scales, but striking the right balance between granularity and a manageable number of state-transitions for weighting can be complicated; the 20-point Barthel Index, for example, may need up to 21 weights. Fifthly, whilst we included the costs of long-term care in addition to hospital- or clinic-based costs, we did not include important indirect costs like social services assistance and productivity losses that constitute a major proportion of longer-term post-stroke costs. Including such costs in cost-based weights would likely further amplify differences between higher and lower mRS scores. Sixthly, our weights are limited to patients with ischaemic stroke; separate weights for the mRS would ideally need to be derived for patients with haemorrhagic stroke or other conditions, in whom mRS-stratified outcomes may be considerably different. We also did not adjust for all potential confounding factors that may influence long-term outcomes; future work may seek to derive separate weights for patients in different stroke subtypes, for example. We partially accounted for the influence of comorbidities in the current paper by examining the weights for different outcomes not only in the overall cohort but also after removing patients with higher levels of pre-morbid mRS, which captures pre-stroke comorbidity burden reasonably well.

### Repeated measures of modified rankin scale scores to assess functional recovery from stroke: AFFINITY study Findings [^111mFNtP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most widely used primary outcome measure in stroke trials and is considered a valid tool for evaluating stroke interventions. The mRS has 7 categories to measure functional status, ranging from independent and free of disability (0) to death (6). Historically, in analyses of variables associated with the mRS, mRS scores were dichotomously transformed rather than ordinally preserved, and statistical methods were single measure (usually 3 or 6 months after enrollment) rather than longitudinal. Numerous trials and systematic reviews have found variance in the statistical significance of stroke interventions (as measured by treatment effect on mRS), depending on trial design, choice of outcome (including simplified and utility‐weighted mRS) and statistical methods. While ordinal mRS analyses have increased in number because of greater statistical power and association with long‐term clinical outcomes and costs, these are usually single mRS measurement analyses. A 2018 literature review found 2 studies using repeated measures of the mRS to analyze recovery over time; however, these did not analyze ordinal mRS. Further to this, our literature searches have not revealed studies comparing single‐measure and repeated‐measures ordinal logistic mRS analyses to identify associations with functional recovery. If collected, usage of all serial follow‐up data (rather than study end points) should strengthen validity of any identified associations with mRS by increasing statistical powerand is concordant with the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable goals in applying repeated measures to understand the natural history of recovery and optimal timing of interventions.

### Comparing the properties of traditional and novel approaches to the modified rankin scale: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113MmMRW]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

Due to heterogeneity of the studies, separate random-effects meta-analyses of IRR and validity across studies were conducted and visualised using forest plots in R (v.4.1.2). We run a subgroup meta-analysis comparing IRR before and after adoption of mandatory mRS training for raters. IRR was described using Cohen's kappa (K) and Cohen's weighted kappa (KW). K ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 means perfect agreement. The agreement was interpreted based on Cohen's guidelines: no agreement (K ≤ 0), slight (K: 0.01–0.20), fair (K: 0.21–0.40), moderate (K: 0.41–0.60), substantial (K: 0.61–0.80) and excellent (K ⩾ 0.81–1).

Spearman's rho (sr) was used as a measure of validity where mRS was compared against related stroke measures: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), stroke size, Short-Form 12-Item Survey-version 2 (SF-12v2), Barthel Index (BI), Stroke Impact Scale-16 (SIS-16). Validity was judged poor if sr ≤ 0.60, good if sr = [0.60–0.79] and excellent if sr ⩾ 0.80.KW was used as a measure of concurrent validity of structured scales with the standard mRS or smRSq and interpreted as defined above.

IMR measured by KW was summarised, with a random-effects meta-analysis conducted when > 2 studies used the same mode of mRS administration.

We described estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) where possible. If 95% CIs were not available the data could not be included in meta-analyses.

### National Institutes of Health stroke scale: an alternative primary outcome measure for trials of acute treatment for ischemic stroke [^114vtMq9]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months is the most commonly used primary outcome measure in stroke treatment trials, but it lacks specificity and requires long-term follow-up interviews, which consume time and resources. An alternative may be the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), early after stroke. Our aim was to evaluate whether the NIHSS assessed within 1 week after treatment could serve as a primary outcome measure for trials of acute treatment for ischemic stroke. Methods- We used data from 2 randomized controlled trials of endovascular treatment for ischemic stroke: the positive MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands; N = 500) and the neutral IMS (Interventional Management of Stroke) III trial (N = 656). We used a causal mediation model, with linear and ordinal logistic regression adjusted for confounders, to evaluate the NIHSS 24 hours and 5 to 7 days after endovascular treatment as primary outcome measures (instead of the mRS at 3 months) in both trials. Patients who had died before the NIHSS was assessed received the maximum score of 42. NIHSS+1 was then log₁₀-transformed. Results- In both trials, there was a significant correlation between the NIHSS at 24 hours and 5 to 7 days and the mRS. In MR CLEAN, we found a significant effect of endovascular treatment on the mRS and on the NIHSS at 24 hours and 5 to 7 days. After adjustment for NIHSS at 24 hours and 5 to 7 days, the effect of endovascular treatment on the mRS decreased from common odds ratio 1.68 (95% CI, 1.22–2.32) to respectively 1.36 (95% CI, 0.97–1.91) and 1.24 (95% CI, 0.87–1.79), indicating that treatment effect on the mRS is in large part mediated by the NIHSS. In the IMS III trial there was no treatment effect on the NIHSS at 24 hours and 5 to 7 days, corresponding with the absence of a treatment effect on the mRS. Conclusions- The NIHSS within 1 week satisfies the requirements for a surrogate end point and may be used as a primary outcome measure in trials of acute treatment for ischemic stroke, particularly in phase II(b) trials. This could reduce stroke-outcome assessment to its essentials (ie, neurological deficit), and reduce trial duration and costs. Whether and under which conditions it could be used in phase III trials requires a debate in the field with all parties. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://www.isrctn.com.

### Comparing the properties of traditional and novel approaches to the modified rankin scale: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113hBCaY]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

Search strategy

We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and a protocol is registered at the PROSPERO platform (CRD42023437832). Cross-disciplinary databases were all searched for entries between December 2008 and June 2023: MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database), Health and Psychosocial Instruments through Ovid; CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PsycINFO (Psychological Information Database) through EBSCO (Elton B. Stephens Company). Dates chosen to overlap with the previous systematic review of studies reporting reliability of the mRS, and data were added to update and expand this review. We used pre-specified search syntax including validated terms for stroke. Further manual searching was performed based on bibliographies of the retrieved studies to identify any missing titles.

To maximise resource efficiency, the primary researcher (LT) screened titles and abstracts using Endnote X9and a second researcher (KM) independently reviewed the first 20% of titles and abstracts, following the Cochrane recommendations. In the event of disagreement, third researcher (TQ) re-evaluated the studies.

Study selection

Inclusion

We included studies based on the following criteria: (1) Human adult stroke participants*, (2) Describes at least one psychometric property of mRS. All clinical subtypes of stroke were included. There were no restrictions on participants' times since stroke. No restrictions were applied to the number, background or experience of mRS raters.

Exclusion

The following criteria were applied: (1) mRS not evaluated as a unique scale, (2) No original data, (3) Duplicate record, (4) non-English studies, (5) Pre-stroke mRS only.

* Studies with mixed samples of stroke and non-stroke participants were excluded.

Data extraction

LT and KM independently extracted data, following a prespecified data extraction proforma based on the study protocol. We contacted authors of published studies to supply missing data. Extracted data included study details, types of mRS scales and information on their development, modes of administration, participants' demographic characteristics, mRS raters' details, measures of IRR, validity and IMR.

### Simple and reliable determination of the modified rankin scale score in neurosurgical and neurological patients: the mRS-9Q [^114MMyWa]. Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a 6-level outcome scale used to assess level of function in neurological disease.

Objective

We examined the interobserver reliability and intraobserver reliability of the mRS-9Q, a 9-question "yes/no" survey that measures the mRS score in neurosurgical and neurological patients.

Methods

The mRS-9Q was administered in person or by telephone, and a Web-based tool was used to calculate the mRS score and to perform error checking. Part 1 compared the mRS-9Q with an mRS structured interview (n = 80). Part 2 compared mRS-9Q administration by telephone and by hard copy (n = 80). Part 3 compared mRS-9Q administration by an expert interviewer with administration by a nonexpert (n = 83). Part 4 examined reproducibility of the mRS-9Q over a 2-week period (n = 84).

Results

Agreement was very good in all study parts. In Part 1 (mRS-9Q vs mRS with structured interview), κ = 0.80 and κw = 0.96. In Part 2 (mRS-9Q telephone vs hard copy), κ = 0.83 and κw = 0.95. In Part 3 (mRS-9Q expert vs nonexpert), κ = 0.73 and κw = 0.93. In Part 4 (mRS-9Q reproducibility), κ = 0.76 and κw = 0.93.

Conclusion

The mRS-9Q is a simple, easy-to-administer survey with a custom Web-based mRS calculation and error-checking tool. The mRS-9Q can reliably determine the mRS by hard copy survey or by telephone and can be administered by experts or nonmedical study personnel. The mRS-9Q can be used to measure functional outcome in a broad population of patients with neurosurgical and neurological diseases.

### Utility-weighted modified rankin scale as primary outcome in stroke trials: a simulation study [^117QsKBn]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most widely used primary outcome measure in trials for acute stroke interventions. The mRS is an ordinal scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death) measuring the degree of disability or dependence in everyday life. Previously, dichotomizing the mRS into dead or dependent (mRS, 3–6) versus independent (mRS, 0–2) was common, but this results in a reduction in statistical power to detect relevant treatment effects. Therefore, statistical approaches preserving the ordinal nature of outcome measures, such as proportional odds logistic regression, have been recommended for stroke and other neurological disorders.–

Currently, the importance of incorporating quality of life (QoL) in outcome analysis in stroke trials is increasingly recognized. – For the mRS to reflect both treatment effect and patient perception, the utility-weighted mRS (UW-mRS) has been proposed and used as primary end point. In the UW-mRS, utilities based on the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) values are assigned to the mRS health states. Two prior studies reported utility weights for the mRS health states: 1 representing the values of patients and 1 representing the values of clinicians. The utility weights that were proposed for the UW-mRS are based on these 2 studies. Compared with the ordinal mRS, the UW-mRS showed similar statistical power to detect treatment effects in empirical data in a wide range of stroke trials. However, because in empirical data, the true treatment effect is unknown, the only valid method to assess statistical power is simulation.

We aimed to describe utility weights for the mRS health states and to evaluate the statistical efficiency of the UW-mRS to detect treatment effects in stroke trials.

### Comparing early National Institutes of Health stroke scale versus 90-day modified rankin scale outcomes in acute ischemic stroke trials: a systematic review and analysis [^115jgtWg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Data Extraction

Six reviewers (L. A.R. J.M.O. M.K. A.S. R.V.M. A.G.) independently extracted the characteristics and outcomes of each trial. For publications reporting on multiple trials or phases of trials, data were extracted for each trial or trial phase separately. We extracted aspects of study design as well as patients and treatment characteristics. We aimed to collect data on NIHSS outcomes at all available time points within 7 days post stroke. Thus, studies reporting NIHSS scores on > 1follow‐up time‐point could contribute to multiple timepoints. Data on NIHSS scores were collected in all available formats, including median with interquartile range or mean ± SD, dichotomized scores or change from baseline NIHSS score. Data on 90‐day mRS score were extracted as the full distribution across all scores of the mRS whenever possible. If this was not reported, we extracted data on the distribution by dichotomized scores or by summary statistics (median with interquartile range or mean ± SD). If studies applied dichotomization for mRS, NIHSS, or both we recorded the definitions that were used. In case of disagreement, the authors resolved discrepancies in consensus meetings.

Risk of Bias

We used version 2 of the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool for randomized trials for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials in the following domains: (1) randomization process, (2) deviations from intended interventions, (3) missing outcome data, (4) measurement of the outcome, and (5) selection of the reported results. In case of disagreement, the authors resolved discrepancies in consensus meetings.

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^112o2pvw]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare how 3 common representations (ordinal vs dichotomized as 0–1/2–6 or 0–2/3–6) of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)-a commonly used trial outcome measure-relate to long-term outcomes, and quantify trial ineligibility rates based on premorbid mRS.

Methods

In consecutive patients with ischemic stroke in a population-based, prospective, cohort study (Oxford Vascular Study; 2002–2014), we related 3-month mRS to 1-year and 5-year disability and death (logistic regressions), and health/social care costs (generalized linear model), adjusted for age/sex, and compared goodness-of-fit values (C statistic, mean absolute error). We also calculated the proportion of patients in whom premorbid mRS score > 1 or > 2 would result in exclusion from trials using dichotomous analysis.

Results

Among 1,607 patients, the ordinal mRS was more strongly related to 5-year mortality than both the 0–1/2–6 and 0–2/3–6 dichotomies (all p < 0.0001). Results were similar for 5-year disability, and 5-year care costs were also best captured by the ordinal model (change in mean absolute error vs age/sex: -$3,059 for ordinal, -$2,805 for 0–2/3–6, -$1,647 for 0–1/2–6). Two hundred forty-four (17.1%) 3-month survivors had premorbid mRS score > 2 and 434 (30.5%) had mRS score > 1; both proportions increased with female sex, socioeconomic deprivation, and age (all p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

The ordinal form of the 3-month mRS relates better to long-term outcomes and costs in survivors of ischemic stroke than either dichotomy. This finding favors using ordinal approaches in trials analyzing the mRS. Exclusion of patients with higher premorbid disability by use of dichotomous primary outcomes will also result in unrepresentative samples.

### Comparing the properties of traditional and novel approaches to the modified rankin scale: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111qUZWL]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

When comparing psychometric properties of traditional and contemporary mRS scales, it is encouraging to see that reliability is less of an issue in recent studies. This is likely driven by the various interventions described. However, we should not be complacent, as poor reliability is still an issue when mRS is used as research outcome.

### Modified rankin scale at 90 Days versus National Institutes of Health stroke scale at 24 hours as primary outcome in acute stroke trials [^112AuVGM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this post hoc analysis of pooled individual participant data of 7 randomized controlled EVT trials, the association between EVT and 90‐day mRS was strongly mediated by 24‐hour NIHSS, with a high degree of association and associated predictive power of NIHSS at 24 hours on mRS at 90 days. This confirms the results of prior studies and suggests that 24‐hour NIHSS is a useful surrogate outcome for patients with AIS undergoing EVT. We found that detection of EVT benefit in the entire patient sample was optimal when using either a combined hierarchical outcome that includes 90‐day mRS and 24‐hour NIHSS, 90‐day mRS alone, or a grouped "ordinal" 24‐hour NIHSS variable. These 3 approaches resulted in similar results and yielded the highest effect sizes and thus smallest hypothetical sample sizes required to detect a significant benefit of EVT.

Ordinal 7‐level grouping of the NIHSS score is not commonly used in clinical practice, although it has been done previously. We decided to pursue this approach because it has several advantages over using "raw" NIHSS values: First, the suggested grouping allowed us to incorporate death into the scale, which is not part of the original NIHSS. Second, it results in a 7‐point ordinal scale, with 0 representing no deficits and 6 representing death, strongly paralleling the structure of the mRS. Therefore, ordinal 24‐hour NIHSS can be analyzed using the same statistical approaches that are used for 90‐day mRS (eg, using ordinal logistic regression), and the interpretation is arguably somewhat similar. Third, using a grouped, ordered NIHSS score avoids problems related to non‐normality that often arise when using a linear regression approach to analyze "raw" 24‐hour NIHSS values, as the 24‐hour NIHSS commonly shows a skewed or even U‐shaped distribution (many patients may have very low or very high NIHSS). This often results in violations of the linear regression assumptions, as was also the case in our study (Figure S2).

### Comparing early National Institutes of Health stroke scale versus 90-day modified rankin scale outcomes in acute ischemic stroke trials: a systematic review and analysis [^111E7pJt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

By aggregating results from > 100 trials, our findings further strengthen and corroborate the use of early NIHSS outcome assessments in stroke trials. Another study assessed the correlation between NIHSS at 5 to 7 days and 90‐day mRS in the MR CLEAN and IMS III (Interventional Management of Stroke III) trials and showed that the treatment effect on the mRS is largely mediated by NIHSS at 24 hours follow‐up. Other studies also showed that NIHSS score within 1 week of follow‐up is the most important predictor of functional outcome on the 90‐day mRS.

This study has several limitations. First, there was considerable heterogeneity in definitions that were used for dichotomization of NIHSS and mRS scores in the included studies. This may have potentially affected agreement between the outcomes, although the extent to which this may have influenced our results is unknown. Second, we used 90‐day mRS as the reference standard although it may be affected by various factors that occur independent of acute ischemic stroke or the assessed intervention. This could have led to disagreement between early NIHSS and 90‐day mRS scores resulting in a potential underestimation of the performance of early NIHSS score, whereas in fact early NIHSS score better reflects the neurological injury. There was considerable variability in the way early NIHSS was reported in the included studies, both in terms of timing and the method of presentation (dichotomized, means/median or change compared with baseline). It is unclear how this may have influenced our findings. Although there is consensus that reporting results of a shift analysis of the full ordinal scale is the desirable way to report 90‐day mRS outcomes, no clear agreement exists for assessing early NIHSS score. Future studies should establish the optimal way of analyzing early NIHSS measurements, both in terms of timing and analytical methods, to standardize its use as an alternative to 90‐day mRS as the primary outcome in stroke trials. Ideally, such studies should look at individual patient data across a larger number of studies.

### Repeated measures of modified rankin scale scores to assess functional recovery from stroke: AFFINITY study Findings [^112c5j8E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This article has presented poststroke recovery over 12 months for an international cohort of 1276 participants with acute stroke of mild to moderate severity. Most (81% of average 12‐month mRS score improvement) recovery occurred in the first 3 months after stroke, in line with literature and recommended timing for functional assessment. Nonetheless, small functional gains were made in the "late subacute" (4–6 months) and "chronic" phase (> 6 months) as defined by the Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable. This was reflected in the associations of time since stroke (at days 90, 180, and 365) with lower mRS categories in all cumulative logit models, except for mRS 0 to 5 versus 6 (at days 90, 180, and 365) and mRS 0 to 4 versus 5 to 6 (day 365). This can be explained by an increase in deaths over time compared with the day 28 reference category (sample total of 1% at day 28, 2% at day 90, 2% at day 180, and 4% at day 365) and an increase in mRS 5 and 6 (sample total of 5% at day 365) compared with day 28 (sample total of 4%), respectively. We note that the follow‐up points are not evenly spaced in time, meaning that the strength of the time associations are not directly comparable and are more heavily weighted toward early recovery (eg, from day 1 to day 28 compared with day 28 to day 90). In comparison with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke control group at 12 months (mRS 0 [11%], mRS 1 [17%], mRS 2 [12%], mRS 3 [13%], mRS 4 [11%], mRS 5 [5%], and mRS 6 [29%]), our 12‐month results were more heavily weighted toward lower mRS scores, indicating greater recovery (mRS 0 [15%], mRS 1 [41%], mRS 2 [15%], mRS 3 [17%], mRS 4 [6%], mRS 5 [1%], and mRS 6 [4%]). This may reflect that AFFINITY enrolled less severe strokes compared with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

### Comparing early National Institutes of Health stroke scale versus 90-day modified rankin scale outcomes in acute ischemic stroke trials: a systematic review and analysis [^113nSAhD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Agreement in Individual Patient Data

Among 1420 patients (315 in ESCAPE and 1105 in ESCAPE‐NA1), 90‐day mRS score and at least 1 early NIHSS measurement within 7 days post stroke were available for 1409 patients (99.2%).

When classifying trial results trichotomized as positive versus negative versus neutral, there was agreement between NIHSS and mRS in overall trial results (positive for ESCAPE, neutral for ESCAPE‐NA1) for all time points except 2‐hour NIHSS score. When dichotomizing NIHSS scores at 0 to 2 and combining results for all time points, there was agreement with 90‐day mRS outcomes in 3523/5195 (67.8%) assessments. Specifically, among 1564 NIHSS assessments classified as good outcome, 1438 (91.9%) were also classified as good outcome by the 90‐day mRS score; however, among 3631 poor NIHSS outcomes, only 2085 (57.4%) also had poor 90‐day mRS outcomes. Agreement measures increased for later versus earlier NIHSS assessments (2 hours: 56.6%; 24 hours: 66.6%; 48 hours: 71.8%; 5–7 days: 76.5%, P < 0.01; Cohen's kappa and Gwet's AC1 rising from 0.21 and 0.19 [ie, poor/slight agreement] respectively at 2 hours to 0.54 and 0.53 [ie, intermediate to good/moderate] at 5–7 days, Table 4, Table S4). For all time points, sensitivity was low (2 hours 26.2% and 5–7 days 67.6%) and specificity was high (2 hours 97.6% and 5–7 days 89.7%). Agreement measures with 90‐day mRS scores were higher when dichotomizing NIHSS scores at 0 to 7 (percentage agreement 4169/5195 [80.3%], with good mRS outcomes in 2409/2860 [84.2%] good NIHSS outcomes and poor mRS outcomes in 1760/2335 [75.4%] bad NIHSS outcomes), with similar improvement over time (2 ‐hours: 72.8%; 24 hours: 80.5%; 48 hours: 83.1%; 5–7 days: 84.7%, P < 0.01; Cohen's kappa and Gwet's AC1 rising from 0.47 and 0.46 [ie, intermediate to good/moderate] respectively at 2 hours to 0.67 and 0.61 [ie, intermediate to good/substantial] at 5–7 days, Table 4). Sensitivity increased (2 hours: 62.9%, 5–7 days: 86.2%) and specificity decreased (2 hours: 93.3%, 5–7 days: 72.1%). That being said, the effect sizes obtained with the NIHSS in terms of SMDs were similar at each time point to those obtained with the 90‐day mRS score (Table 5).

### Prestroke modified rankin stroke scale has moderate interobserver reliability and validity in an acute stroke setting [^112K7YjV]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the recommended functional outcome assessment in stroke trials. Utility of mRS may be limited by interobserver variability. prestroke function, described using mRS, is often used as trial entry criterion. We assessed the reliability and validity of prestroke mRS in acute stroke.

Methods

We present two complementary analyses of the properties of prestroke mRS: (1) Paired interviewers (trained in mRS) performed independently a blinded assessment of mRS and prestroke mRS. Interobserver variability was described using percentage agreement and weighted (kw) κ statistics with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Validity was assessed by comparing prestroke mRS with other markers of function (comorbidity; medication count; need for carers). (2) We further assessed validity using a larger retrospective dataset. We compared prestroke mRS with Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and the Rockwood frailty index. Rank correlation coefficient or Fisher exact test were used as appropriate.

Results

Paired interviewers assessed 74 stroke survivors. Median standard mRS was 4 (interquartile range [IQR], 2–4), median prestroke mRS was 1 (IQR, 0–3; range, 0–4). Reliability for standard mRS interview was 56% agreement, kw = 0.55 (95% CI, 0.39–0.71). Reliability for prestroke mRS was 70%, kw = 0.70 (95% CI, 0.53–0.87). The retrospective dataset described 231 subjects. In this data set, Spearman Rho for prestroke mRS and frailty index was J. 0.82 (95% CI, 0.78–0.86); CCI 0.50 (95% CI, 0.40–0.59); patient age 0.45 (95% CI, 0.34–0.54); medication count 0.28 (95% CI, 0.15–0.40). There was no association between need for carers and prestroke mRS (p = 0.10).

Conclusions

Interobserver reliability of prestroke mRS is limited but comparable with standard mRS. Poor correlation of prestroke mRS with certain markers of function suggests limited validity. Our data would suggest that relying on mRS alone may be a suboptimal measure of prestroke function and could potentially bias trial samples.

### Association between disability measures and healthcare costs after initial treatment for acute stroke [^113Ftt8y]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The distribution of 3-month modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores has been used as an outcome measure in acute stroke trials. We hypothesized that hospitalization and institutional care home stays within the first 90 days after stroke should be closely related to 90-day mRS, that each higher mRS category will reflect incremental cost, and that resource use may be less clearly linked to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or Barthel index.

Methods

We examined resource use data from the GAIN International trial comparing 90-day mRS with total length of stay in hospital or other institutions during the first 90 days. We repeated analyses using NIHSS and Barthel index scores. Relationships were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni contrasts of adjacent score categories. Estimated costs were based on published Scottish figures.

Results

We had full data from 1717 patients. Length of stay was strongly associated with final mRS (P < 0.0001). Each mRS increment from 0 to 1–2 to 3–4 was significant (mean length of stay: 17, 25, 44, 58, 79 days; P < 0.0005). Ninety-five percent confidence limits for estimated costs (pound) rose incrementally: 2493 to 3412, 3369 to 4479, 5784 to 7008, 7300 to 8512, 10 095 to 11 141, 11 772 to 13 560, and 2623 to 3321 for mRS 0 to 5 and dead, respectively. Weaker relationships existed with Barthel and NIHSS.

Conclusions

Each mRS category reflects different average length of hospital and institutional stay. Associated costs are meaningfully different across the full range of mRS outcomes. Analysis of the full distribution of mRS scores is appropriate for interpretation of treatment effects after acute stroke and more informative than Barthel or NIHSS end points.

### Deriving modified rankin scores from medical case-records [^112W3LEi]. Stroke (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Modified Rankin score (mRS) is traditionally graded using a face-to-face or telephone interview. Certain stroke assessment scales can be derived from a review of a patient's case-record alone. We hypothesized that mRS could be successfully derived from the narrative within patient case-records.

Methods

Sequential patients attending our cerebrovascular outpatient clinic were included. Two independent, blinded clinicians, trained in mRS, assessed case-records to derive mRS. They scored "certainty" of their grading on a 5-point Likert scale. Agreement between derived and traditional face-to-face mRS was calculated using attribute agreement analysis.

Results

Fifty patients with a range of disabilities were included. Case-record appraisers were poor at deriving mRS (k = 0.34 against standard). Derived mRS grades showed poor agreement between observers (k = 0.33). There was no relationship between certainty of derived mRS and proportion of correct grades (P = 0.727).

Conclusions

Accurate mRS cannot be derived from standard hospital records. Direct mRS interview is still required for clinical trials.

### Boosting the chances to improve stroke treatment [^112EF1PQ]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

There is a lack of agreement regarding measuring the effects of stroke treatment in clinical trials, which often relies on the dichotomized value of 1 outcome scale. Alternative analyses consist mainly of 2 strategies: use all the information from an ordinal scale and combine information from several outcome scales in a single estimate.

Methods

We reanalyzed 3 outcome scales that assessed patient recovery (modified Rankin Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and Barthel Index). With data collected from the 1652 patients in the Citicoline pooling data analysis, we used 2 standard techniques of exploratory multivariate analysis to analyze the distances among ranks and to isolate the common and the unique information provided by each of the 3 scales.

Results

The different scale values correspond to gradually different patient status, confirming that information is lost when a scale is collapsed to just 2 values, whether recovered or not. The scales shared 90.7% (95% CI, 84.5–96.9) of their information, with no individual scale contributing unique information.

Conclusions

Salient stroke outcome information is lost when an ordinal scale is collapsed into fewer categories. In contrast, the full scales provide a comprehensive patient outcome estimate. Furthermore, in the context of stroke clinical trials, those scales are highly correlated, providing the rationale to pool them into a single estimate. These insights may be used to optimize the analysis of stroke trials to increase study power to detect efficacious interventions.

### Variability in modified rankin scoring across a large cohort of international observers [^111GWCqr]. Stroke (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The modified Rankin scale (mRS) is the most commonly used outcome measure in stroke trials. However, substantial interobserver variability in mRS scoring has been reported. These studies likely underestimate the variability present in multicenter clinical trials, because exploratory work has only been undertaken in single centers by a few observers, all of similar training. We examined mRS variability across a large cohort of international observers using data from a video training resource.

Methods

The mRS training package includes a series of "real-life" patient interviews for grading. Training data were collected centrally and analyzed for variability using kappa statistics. We examined variability against a standard of "correct" mRS grades; examined variability by country; and for UK assessors, examined variability by center and by professional background of the observer.

Results

To date, 2942 assessments from 30 countries have been submitted. Overall reliability for mRS grading has been moderate to good with substantial heterogeneity across countries. Native English language has had little effect on reliability. Within the United Kingdom, there was no significant variation by profession.

Conclusions

Our results confirm interobserver variability in mRS assessment. The heterogeneity across countries is intriguing because it appears not to be related solely to language. These data highlight the need for novel strategies to improve reliability.

### Utility-weighted modified rankin scale as primary outcome in stroke trials: a simulation study [^116N9Kzo]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Ordinal outcome scales are also used in other neurological disorders besides stroke. Examples are the Glasgow Outcome Scale in traumatic brain injury and the Guillain-Barre syndrome disability score in Guillain-Barre syndrome. These ordinal outcomes could be transformed to patient-centered outcomes using utility values, similar to the UW-mRS. For randomized trials in patients with other neurological diseases, such as traumatic brain injury and Guillain-Barre syndrome, our study might, therefore, also implicate that ordinal analysis should remain the gold standard.

Our study has several strengths. The simulation study was based on data from the MR CLEAN trial, with relatively broad inclusion criteria. As such, our findings should be generalizable to future stroke trials. Furthermore, simulation is the most adequate method to evaluate statistical power. Also, we used utility values derived using the recommended time trade-off method, which should be less prone to bias compared with other elicitation methods.

Some limitations should also be acknowledged. As with all simulation studies, we do not know how far our findings may be extrapolated beyond the modeled situations. For instance, we only simulated a model with a uniform treatment effect across all mRS health state transitions, which, therefore, adheres perfectly to the proportional odds assumption. However, if the proportional odds assumption would be violated, and treatment effect would not be uniform across the different outcome categories, ordinal analysis would still be the most efficient. Nevertheless, further validation of our results is required. Finally, we used the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire assessed at 90 days after inclusion, which reflects neither short-term QoL nor the final health state. A better reflection of patient perception could be achieved by calculating QALYs based on multiple QoL measurements in 1 patient. Nevertheless, the aim of this study is not to describe QoL but to evaluate efficiency in detecting treatment effects.

In conclusion, the UW-mRS has been received as a promising new patient-centered outcome in stroke research. However, the UW-mRS does not capture individual variation in utilities within each mRS health state. Also, interpretation of treatment effect on the UW-mRS scale might be more challenging than was first suggested. Finally, clinicians and researchers should be aware of the reduction in power compared with ordinal analysis of the mRS when they use the UW-mRS as outcome measure in acute stroke intervention trials. More thorough evaluation of the UW-mRS in terms of its added value, analytic approach, and interpretation is required.

### Patient relevance of the modified rankin scale in subarachnoid hemorrhage research: an international cross-sectional survey [^112wrBkm]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

There is significant heterogeneity in the reporting of outcome measures in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) research. The modified Rankin scale (mRS) is the most commonly reported functional outcome measure. The mRS focuses on physical disability; however, many aSAH survivors experience sequalae in other domains, and the mRS may therefore not capture outcomes important to aSAH survivors. The objective of this study was to assess the clinical relevance of the mRS as a research outcome measure to people with lived aSAH experience.

Methods

We conducted an international cross-sectional survey of 355 aSAH survivors, family members, and caregivers to evaluate patient-perceived outcomes in relation to the mRS. The mRS was assessed using a previously validated web-based tool.

Results

Response rate was 60%; respondents from 7 continents were composed of 86% aSAH survivors and 14% family members/caregivers. Agreement between self-assessed outcome and the mRS was poor (Kappa 0.26 [CI 0.14–0.39]). Of the 172 respondents who self-assessed as having had a good aSAH outcome, 122 (71%) had a score of 0–2 on the mRS. Approximately 19% of respondents with a good outcome, based on a measured mRS score of 0–2, self-assessed as having had a poor aSAH outcome. When the mRS score was dichotomized as 0–3 corresponding to a good outcome, agreement between the score and self-assessed outcome remained poor with a Kappa score of 0.40 (CI 0.20–0.60). Approximately 30% of respondents believed that the mRS should not be used as an outcome measure in future aSAH trials.

Discussion

The findings suggest that there is poor agreement between aSAH survivors' self-assessed outcome, their actual mRS score, and the dichotomization of the mRS score into good/poor outcomes. Patient-centered and patient-informed outcome measurement tools are needed to guide the aSAH research agenda.

### Measuring disability in stroke: relationship between the modified rankin scale and the barthel index [^115zuKnn]. Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in acute stroke trials is traditionally measured with the modified Rankin scale (mRs) and the Barthel index (BI). The mRs is a global disability scale divided into six steps from total independence to total dependence. The BI assesses ten basal activities of daily living, of which eight assess level of dependence (bathing, grooming, using stairs, dressing, feeding, toilet use, transfers and walking). The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the mRs and the total scores and item-scores of the BI.

Methods

During a period of 3 months mRs and BI scores were collected from two multicentre randomised, placebo-controlled trials with lubeluzole (515 and 519 patients). In each patient we compared the mRs grades with the total BI score and the scores on the ten subitems.

Results

For both trials there was extensive overlap of BI scores between mRs grades and a wide range in BI scores among patients with mRs grades 3 and 4. We also found discrepancies between the BI item-scores and mRs grades. About 40% of patients with mRs grades 1 (able to carry out all usual activities) and 2 (able to look after own affairs without assistance) were not independent on at least one activity of the BI. In both studies, about 30% of the patients needed help or supervision for walking, although they were classified as mRs 3 (requiring some help but able to walk without assistance).

Conclusions

Investigators in stroke trials use the mRs as a subjective global disability scale, and they do not strictly take into account limitations in performing specific basal activities of daily living, as assessed by the BI, to assign mRs grades.

### Diagnosis and management of neuro-behçet's disease: international consensus recommendations [^1173se2Z]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Outcome measures

There is no validated scale for measuring disability in NBD. The following three potential scales could be considered. Two of these require a neurologist's input with special training.

The modified Rankin scale is internationally accepted and well-validated for the measurement of disability in cerebro-vascular diseases. This scale measures overall functional ability and does not focus on individual functional system/domain like cognition. It is easy to perform and can be used without special training. The scores range from 0 to 6.

Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) is validated and is the most widely utilized assessment tool in MS. Some studies have used EDSS to measure neurological disability in NBD, but it has not been validated. The complexity and the technical skills required for its use make it difficult to be adopted by non-neurologists in routine practice.

Neuro-Behçet's disability score (NBDS) has been proposed for parenchymal-NBD patients to quantify disabilities. This comprises scores for motor and cognitive status. NBDS is the arithmetic sum of both scores and ranges from 0 to 8, with 8 being death due to NBD. Although it appears to be more thorough than the Rankin scale, in the absence of validation this more complex score would be difficult to interpret and extrapolate (Table 9).

### Improving the efficiency of stroke trials: feasibility and efficacy of group adjudication of functional end points [^115fk79K]. Stroke (2013). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Use of the modified Rankin scale (mRS) in multicenter trials may be limited by interobserver variability. We assessed the effect of this on trial power and developed a novel group adjudication approach.

Methods

We generated power and sample size estimates from simulated trials modeled with varying mRS reliability. We conducted a virtual acute stroke trial across 14 UK sites to develop a group adjudication approach. Traditional mRS interviews, performed at local sites, were digitally recorded and scored by adjudication committee. We assessed the effect of translation by comparing scores in translated mRS interviews, originally conducted in English and Mandarin. Agreement was measured using κ and weighted κ (κw) statistics and intraclass correlation coefficient.

Results

Statistical simulations suggest that improving mRS reliability from κ = 0.25 to κ = 0.5 or 0.7 may allow reductions in sample size of n = 386 or 490 in a typical n = 2000 study. Our virtual acute stroke trial included 370 participants and 563 mRS video assessments. We adjudicated mRS in 538 of 563 (96%) study visits. At 30 and 90 days, 161 of 280 (57.5%) and 131 of 258 (50.8%) clips showed interobserver disagreement. Agreement within the adjudication committee was good (30-day κw = 0.85 [95% confidence interval, 0.81–0.86]; 90-day κw = 0.86 [95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.88]) without significant or systematic bias in mRS scoring compared with the local mRS. Interobserver reliability of translated mRS assessments was similar to native language clips (native [n = 69] κw = 0.91 [95% confidence interval, 0.94–0.99]; translated [n = 89] κw = 0.90 [95% confidence interval, 0.83–0.96]).

Conclusions

Achievable improvements in interobserver reliability may substantially reduce study sample size, with associated financial benefits. Central adjudication of mRS assessments is feasible (including across international centers), valid and reliable despite the challenges of mRS assessment in large clinical trials.

Stroke and transient ischemic attack — Several registries use the 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Clinical Data Standards stroke definition; the workgroup recommends strengthening the 2014 definition to require disability measurement with modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores recorded at set time points and recommends use of the 2014 ACC/AHA transient ischemic attack definition.

### Health utility weighting of the modified rankin scale: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111NiXm7]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

The utility-weighted modified Rankin Scale (UW-mRS) has been proposed as a patient-centered alternative primary outcome for stroke clinical trials. However, to date, there is no clear consensus on an approach to weighting the mRS.

Objective

To characterize the between-study variability in utility weighting of the mRS in a population of patients who experienced stroke and its implications when applied to the results of a clinical trial.

Data Sources

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched from January 1987 through May 2019 using major search terms for stroke, health utility, and mRS.

Study Selection

Original research articles published in English were reviewed. Included were studies with participants 18 years or older with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or subarachnoid hemorrhage, with mRS scores and utility weights evaluated concurrently. A total of 5725 unique articles were identified. Of these, 283 met criteria for full-text review, and 24 were included in the meta-analysis.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

PRISMA guidelines for systematic review were followed. Data extraction was performed independently by multiple researchers. Data were pooled using mixed models.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The mean utility weights and 95% CIs were calculated for each mRS score and health utility scale. Geographic differences in weighting for the EuroQoL 5-dimension (EQ-5D) and Stroke Impact Scale-based UW-mRS were explored using inverse variance-weighted linear models. The results of 18 major acute stroke trials cited in current guidelines were then reanalyzed using the UW-mRS weighting scales identified in the systematic review.

Results

The meta-analysis included 22 389 individuals; the mean (SD) age of participants was 65.9 (4.0) years, and the mean (SD) proportion of male participants was 58.2% (7.5%). For all health utility scales evaluated, statistically significant differences were observed between the mean utility weights by mRS score. For studies using an EQ-5D-weighted mRS, between-study variance was higher for worse (mRS 2–5) compared with better (mRS 0–1) scores. Of the 18 major acute stroke trials with reanalyzed results, 3 had an unstable outcome when using different UW-mRSs.

Conclusions and Relevance

Multiple factors, including cohort-specific characteristics and health utility scale selection, can influence mRS utility weighting. If the UW-mRS is selected as a primary outcome, the approach to weighting may alter the results of a clinical trial. Researchers using the UW-mRS should prospectively and concurrently obtain mRS scores and utility weights to characterize study-specific outcomes.

### Comparing the properties of traditional and novel approaches to the modified rankin scale: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117U46GL]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most commonly used measure of functional outcome after stroke. Traditionally, mRS has been administered through an unstructured interview, based on the limited guidance from Rankin's original description.

Despite its widespread use, mRS has been frequently criticised for its low inter-rater reliability (IRR), that is, a poor score agreement between raters. A 2009 meta-analysis described an overall moderate reliability of the standard mRS(K = 0.46), albeit with substantial uncertainty in the estimate.

Researchers have attempted to improve the IRR of mRS for stroke through various interventions including training, adjudicationand structured interview scripts. Although popular, the benefits of structured interviews have not been consistently demonstrated. Various approaches to the structured interview have been reported, for example, Bruno et al.based the simplified mRS questionnaire (smRSq) on yes/no questions, while Saver et al.developed the Rankin Focussed Assessment (RFA) deriving the score from multiple sources.

It remains unclear whether these novel approaches remove the previous concerns regarding the psychometric properties of mRS. As well as concerns around reliability, the validity of new approaches to mRS should not be assumed and empirical testing is required before these scales can be recommended. Moreover, with multiple versions of structured mRS interviews available there is uncertainty regarding the optimal method for administering mRS.

In addition to new approaches to the interview, there has been a shift towards employing technology in the administration of the mRS. Researchers have argued that mobile and web applications may complement clinician delivery of mRS, yet the inter-modality reliability (IMR) has not been compared across variants of the mRS.

Therefore, there is a need to update the evidence describing reliability and validity of mRS assessment. The aim of this systematic review was to describe psychometric properties of mRS and compare novel and traditional approaches.

### Understanding the relationship between costs and the modified rankin scale: a systematic review, multidisciplinary consensus and recommendations for future studies [^111iUXqF]. European Stroke Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Cost-of-illness studies often describe a single aggregate cost of a disease state. This approach is less helpful for a condition with a spectrum of outcomes like stroke. The modified Rankin Scale is the most commonly used outcome measure for stroke. We sought to describe the existing evidence on the costs of stroke according to individual modified Rankin Scale categories. This may be useful in future cost effectiveness modelling studies of interventions where cost data have not been collected, but disability outcome is known.

Methods

Systematic review of the published literature, searching electronic databases between 2004 and 2015 using validated search filters. Results were screened to identify studies presenting costs by individual modified Rankin Scale categories.

Results

Of 17,782 unique identified articles, 13 matched all inclusion criteria. In only four of these studies were costs reported by modified Rankin Scale categories. Most studies included direct medical costs only. Societal costs were assessed in two studies. Overall, studies had a high methodological and reporting quality. The heterogeneity in costing methods used in the identified studies prevented meaningful comparison of the reported cost data. Despite this limitation, the costs consistently increased with greater severity (increasing modified Rankin Scale score).

Conclusions

Few cost studies of stroke include information based on stroke recovery measured by individual modified Rankin Scale categories and the existing data are limited. To reliably capture this information, future studies are needed that preferably apply standardised costing methods to promote greater potential for use in cost-effectiveness analyses whereby direct collection of patient-level resource use has not been possible.

### Comparing early National Institutes of Health stroke scale versus 90-day modified rankin scale outcomes in acute ischemic stroke trials: a systematic review and analysis [^116oia4A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was agreement between results of the trial assessed on the NIHSS at 24‐hour follow‐up and the results of the trial assessed on the mRS at 90‐day follow‐up. Secondary outcomes were agreement between trial results as assessed on the NIHSS at 2‐hour, 48‐hour, 72‐ to 96‐hour, and 5‐ to 7‐day follow‐up and the mRS score at 90‐day follow‐up.

We used the authors' specifications of favorable versus unfavorable outcomes for dichotomizing scores for each RCT for both the 90‐day mRS and early NIHSS scores. We classified trial results on the NIHSS and mRS as positive versus neutral versus negative. A result on the NIHSS was defined as positive if (1) both the point estimate and the lower boundary of the 95% CI of the odds ratio for favorable NIHSS were > 1 (indicating statistically significant improvement on the dichotomized NIHSS) or (2) if the point estimate and the upper boundary of the 95% CI of the standardized mean differences (SMDs) were < 0 (indicating improvement of continuous NIHSS scores, including scores reported as change in NIHSS score compared with baseline NIHSS score). Results were classified as negative if the point estimate and upper boundary of the 95% CI were < 1 for dichotomized scores and > 0 for continuous scores. All other results were classified as neutral. Results measured using mRS scores at 90‐day follow‐up were categorized into positive, negative, and neutral results in the same manner.

Statistical Analysis

We quantified the distribution of cohort‐level characteristics with descriptive analyses. We summarized the effect sizes observed for each intervention arm versus control in each trial, for each timing of the NIHSS until 7 days and for the 90‐day mRS. Effect sizes were grouped as either odds ratios (ORs) or SMDs depending on how results were presented in the included studies. To facilitate synthesis of studies reporting mean and median summary statistics for effect sizes, these were transformed into SMD's whenever possible. Unadjusted summary effect measures were calculated in STATA version 17 using the metan command. We separately calculated each summary effect measure (SMDs and ORs) for each outcome (NIHSS and mRS), including each available time point of NIHSS assessment (2‐hour, 24‐hour, 48‐hour, 72‐ to 96‐hour, and 5‐ to 7‐day follow‐up).

### Impact of central adjudication of the score on the modified rankin scale in an international, randomized, acute stroke trial [^112rcQKM]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The modified Rankin scale (mRS) is the most frequently used primary outcome measure in acute stroke research. It is an ordinal scale with six categories ranging from zero through five, categorizing the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities. In currently used versions, a seventh category is added to signify death. Despite its wide-spread use as a primary outcome measure, the reliability of the mRS is hampered by significant inter-observer variability, – which may reduce statistical power and negatively influence the validity of study results, especially in studies without proper blinding of the adjudicator.

Central outcome adjudication of videoed recordings of the mRS by independent experts blinded to treatment allocation has been proposed to improve the reliability and precision of treatment estimates by limiting detection bias, reducing random or systematic errors, benefiting from expert opinion and experience of the raters, and to guarantee blinding. As it facilitates scoring of a single assessment by several raters with the possibility to combine these to control inter-observer variability, central outcome adjudication may enhance statistical power and permit smaller sample sizes. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized stroke trials found no evidence so far that this process has any impact on trial conclusions, but the mRS was the primary outcome in just one of the included trials. In two other, open-label, randomized trials of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke in a single country, central adjudicators disagreed with the locally allocated mRS score in 13% and 11% of the cases, but this was not associated with material differences in estimates of treatment effect. In one of these trials central adjudication was based on a written report of the mRS interview, and in the other on an audio or video recording of the interview. These trials have generally been conducted within experienced centers, where the mRS is routinely used by staff. The value of central adjudication of the mRS in larger, international, open-label stroke trials conducted in less experienced settings is uncertain.

We assessed inter-observer variability and impact on treatment effect estimates of central mRS adjudication based on a video recording in the European, open-label, randomized PREvention of Complications to Improve OUtcome in elderly patients with acute Stroke (PRECIOUS) trial.

### Harmonized outcome measures for use in atrial fibrillation patient registries and clinical practice: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society board of trustees [^114Deagi]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Table 2 — Atrial fibrillation minimum measure set — thromboembolic events defines stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), and systemic embolism for outcome capture. Stroke is an acute episode of focal or global neurological dysfunction caused by brain, spinal cord, or retinal vascular injury as a result of hemorrhage or infarction; symptoms or signs must persist ≥ 24 hours, or if documented by CT, MRI or autopsy, the duration of symptoms/signs may be less than 24 hours; stroke may be classified as ischemic, hemorrhagic, or undetermined; and stroke disability measurement should be performed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge and 6 months post-discharge, with mRS scores recorded. Transient Ischemic Attack is a transient episode of focal neurological dysfunction caused by brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without acute infarction and with signs and symptoms lasting less than 24 hours. Systemic embolism is acute arterial insufficiency or occlusion of the extremities or any non-central nervous system organ with clinical, imaging, surgical/autopsy evidence of arterial occlusion in the absence of other likely mechanism.

### Adopting a patient-centered approach to primary outcome analysis of acute stroke trials using a utility-weighted modified rankin scale [^1139Znb5]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most commonly used primary end point in acute stroke trials, its power is limited when analyzed in dichotomized fashion and its indication of effect size challenging to interpret when analyzed ordinally. Weighting the 7 Rankin levels by utilities may improve scale interpretability while preserving statistical power.

Methods

A utility-weighted mRS (UW-mRS) was derived by averaging values from time-tradeoff (patient centered) and person-tradeoff (clinician centered) studies. The UW-mRS, standard ordinal mRS, and dichotomized mRS were applied to 11 trials or meta-analyses of acute stroke treatments, including lytic, endovascular reperfusion, blood pressure moderation, and hemicraniectomy interventions.

Results

Utility values were 1.0 for mRS level 0; 0.91 for mRS level 1; 0.76 for mRS level 2; 0.65 for mRS level 3; 0.33 for mRS level 4; 0 for mRS level 5; and 0 for mRS level 6. For trials with unidirectional treatment effects, the UW-mRS paralleled the ordinal mRS and outperformed dichotomous mRS analyses. Both the UW-mRS and the ordinal mRS were statistically significant in 6 of 8 unidirectional effect trials, whereas dichotomous analyses were statistically significant in 2 to 4 of 8. In bidirectional effect trials, both the UW-mRS and ordinal tests captured the divergent treatment effects by showing neutral results, whereas some dichotomized analyses showed positive results. Mean utility differences in trials with statistically significant positive results ranged from 0.026 to 0.249.

Conclusions

A UW-mRS performs similar to the standard ordinal mRS in detecting treatment effects in actual stroke trials and ensures the quantitative outcome is a valid reflection of patient-centered benefits.

### Comparing early National Institutes of Health stroke scale versus 90-day modified rankin scale outcomes in acute ischemic stroke trials: a systematic review and analysis [^112dDzZ7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

There are also important downsides to the NIHSS to consider. Compared with the mRS, the NIHSS may be more difficult to interpret, especially for patients. Furthermore, it shows a weaker association with quality of life and its statistical characteristics are less optimal. Through historical precedent, 90‐day mRS has become the standard for stroke trials and it is favored as the primary outcome by key regulators. The 85% agreement between early NIHSS and 90‐day mRS scores in the current study might be insufficient to convince regulators of the role of early NIHSS as a primary outcome. Adoption of early NIHSS as a substitute primary outcome in stroke trials would be limited if regulatory approval cannot be obtained based on such trials.

A previous study showed that NIHSS increasingly predicts functional outcome at 90 days as the time since stroke onset progresses, accounting for one quarter of the variance at 1 to 3 hours after stroke onset, half at 24 hours, and three quarters at 90 days. However, our trial‐level results indicated a consistently high level of agreement across all assessed time points within 1 week of follow‐up, whereas our individual patient data showed there was higher agreement for later assessments. These findings hold potential implications for the design of future stroke trials, as relying on the NIHSS measurement at 24 hours may be more feasible and practical when assessing outcome on a study level, considering that patients are often transferred or discharged from the participating hospital, which complicates later in‐person assessment. However, when the goal is to predict outcomes at an individual patient‐level, our results indicate it might be better to wait at least 1 week before assessing the NIHSS. Furthermore, predicting functional outcomes for individual patients is more accurate when combining several radiological and clinical factors, including early NIHSS score, rather than relying solely on early NIHSS score. Several prediction tools have been developed and demonstrated to accurately predict functional outcomes on an individual level, though many have not been externally validated.

### Comparing early National Institutes of Health stroke scale versus 90-day modified rankin scale outcomes in acute ischemic stroke trials: a systematic review and analysis [^1156ZfMj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

NIHSS assessed at 24‐hours aligned with 90‐day mRS scores in 84% of trials for identifying positive versus neutral versus negative RCT results, indicating intermediate to good agreement. However, individual patient data showed that NIHSS score within 7 days risks misclassifying around 1 in 4 patients with respect to 90‐day mRS score, with some improvement in agreements for assessments between 48 hours and 7 days. These data contribute to a better understanding of the nuances of considering early NIHSS score as an outcome measure in acute ischemic stroke RCTs.

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^115kPBfB]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Fourth, our findings demonstrate nonlinear trends in the long-term outcomes predicted by different mRS grades, suggesting that not all shifts should be weighted equally in an ideal ordinal analysis. The shift from 0–2 to 3–6 appears to merit the highest weighting, but there are also jumps in mortality and care costs from 3 to 4 to 5. This is in contrast to conventional approaches to ordinal analysis, such as proportional odds logistic regression, which assume that all step increases in the mRS are equal. The utility-weighted mRS may be one method to address this issue, although it most values transitions from 3 to 4 to 5. However, as recently suggested in a simulation study, differently weighted approaches such as the utility-weighted mRS may reduce the statistical power of randomized trials vs conventional ordinal analysis, although in this case, it was still more efficient than dichotomous approaches. Using a sliding dichotomy, in which a good outcome — and thereby the state transition of interest for a given patient — is defined based on initial severity or other characteristics is more informative than a fixed dichotomy, but still fails to utilize information from the entire range of mRS outcomes.

Modified Rankin Scale — functional outcome in stroke is described as a 6-point clinical outcome scale in which a lower score indicates a better outcome. Scores range from 0 (No symptoms) through 3 (Moderate disability; requiring some help but able to walk without assistance) to 5 (Severe disability; bedridden, incontinent, and requiring constant nursing care and attention) and 6 (Dead).

### National Institutes of Health stroke scale: an alternative primary outcome measure for trials of acute treatment for ischemic stroke [^115BH5QN]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute treatment for ischemic stroke has been rapidly evolving over the past 5 years, resulting in a drastic improvement of functional outcome after ischemic stroke in selected patients. However, a considerable number of patients do not recover to functional independence after acute treatment or are still not eligible for acute treatment. – To improve outcome and expand patient selection, new treatments or modifications to existing treatment modalities are continuously being tested in novel (randomized) clinical trials. One of the most important considerations in the design of a valid and useful clinical trial is the selection of an appropriate primary outcome measure.

The most commonly used primary outcome measure in (ischemic) stroke treatment trials is the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). This 7-point ordinal scale describes the degree of global disability or dependence in daily life after stroke, that is, functional outcome. It is known for its simplicity and its ease of interpretation. However, the mRS has important practical limitations. Because the mRS measures functional outcome and has a floor effect in the acute setting (ie, patients will receive mRS scores of 4 or 5 because they are often bed-bound during hospital admission), it should ideally be assessed after patients have had the chance to resume their daily activities; typically after 3 months. This long time span between treatment and outcome assessment may require intensive efforts to track down patients leading to increased trial duration and costs. Another undesirable result of this long time span is the risk of loss to follow-up. When investigators are reluctant to enroll patients who are at high risk for loss to follow-up, for example, because of socioeconomic factors or visitors from abroad, this could also lead to slower patient enrollment and selection bias.

### Improving the reliability of stroke disability grading in clinical trials and clinical practice: the rankin focused assessment (RFA) [^111S3wvD]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The modified Rankin Scale rates global disability after stroke and is the most comprehensive and widely used primary outcome measure in acute stroke trials. However, substantial interobserver variability in modified Rankin Scale scoring has been reported. This study sought to develop and validate a short, practicable structured assessment that would enhance interrater reliability.

Methods

The Rankin Focused Assessment was developed by selecting and refining elements from prior instruments. The Rankin Focused Assessment takes 3 to 5 minutes to apply and provides clear, operationalized criteria to distinguish the 7 assignable global disability levels. The Rankin Focused Assessment was prospectively validated 3 months poststroke among 50 consecutive patients enrolled in the Phase 3 National Institutes of Health Field Administration of Stroke Therapy-Magnesium (FAST-MAG) Trial.

Results

Among the 50 patients, mean age was 71.5 years (range, 43 to 93 years), 48% were female, and stroke subtype was hemorrhagic in 24%. At Day 90, 43 patients were alive and 7 had died. The modified Rankin Scale median was 2.0 and mean was 2.8. When pairs of 14 raters assessed all enrolled patients, the percent agreement was 94%, the weighted kappa was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.0), and the unweighted kappa was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00). Among the 43 surviving patients, the percent agreement was 93%, the weighted kappa was 0.99 (0.98 to 1.0), and the unweighted kappa was 0.91 (0.82 to 1.00).

Conclusions

The Rankin Focused Assessment yields high interrater reliability in the grading of final global disability among consecutive patients with stroke participating in a randomized clinical trial. The Rankin Focused Assessment is brief and practical for use in multicenter clinical trials and quality improvement activities.

### Reliability of the modified rankin scale across multiple raters: benefits of a structured interview [^116trsH5]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is widely used to assess global outcome after stroke. The aim of the study was to examine rater variability in assessing functional outcomes using the conventional mRS, and to investigate whether use of a structured interview (mRS-SI) reduced this variability.

Methods

Inter-rater agreement was studied among raters from 3 stroke centers. Fifteen raters were recruited who were experienced in stroke care but came from a variety of professional backgrounds. Patients at least 6 months after stroke were first assessed using conventional mRS definitions. After completion of initial mRS assessments, raters underwent training in the use of a structured interview, and patients were re-assessed. In a separate component of the study, intrarater variability was studied using 2 raters who performed repeat assessments using the mRS and the mRS-SI. The design of the latter part of the study also allowed investigation of possible improvement in rater agreement caused by repetition of the assessments. Agreement was measured using the kappa statistic (unweighted and weighted using quadratic weights).

Results

Inter-rater reliability: Pairs of raters assessed a total of 113 patients on the mRS and mRS-SI. For the mRS, overall agreement between raters was 43% (kappa = 0.25, kappa(w) = 0.71), and for the structured interview overall agreement was 81% (kappa = 0.74, kappa(w) = 0.91). Agreement between raters was significantly greater on the mRS-SI than the mRS (P < 0.001). Intrarater reliability: Repeatability of both the mRS and mRS-SI was excellent (kappa = 0.81, kappa(w) ≥ 0.94).

Conclusions

Although individual raters are consistent in their use of the mRS, inter-rater variability is nonetheless substantial. Rater variability on the mRS is thus particularly problematic for studies involving multiple raters. There was no evidence that improvement in inter-rater agreement occurred simply with repetition of the assessment. Use of a structured interview improves agreement between raters in the assessment of global outcome after stroke.

### Modified rankin scale at 90 Days versus National Institutes of Health stroke scale at 24 hours as primary outcome in acute stroke trials [^112Pao6v]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The association between EVT and 90‐day mRS is mediated by 24‐hour NIHSS, confirming that 24‐hour NIHSS is a useful surrogate outcome for 90‐day mRS in patients with AIS undergoing EVT, with a similar EVT effect size compared with 90‐day mRS. It could potentially enhance detection of EVT benefit in patient subgroups with very low or very high baseline NIHSS. Combining 90‐day mRS and 24‐hour NIHSS in an ordered hierarchical outcome could slightly improve detection of EVT treatment effect compared with 90‐day mRS, although this warrants confirmation. Future research should explore whether these results are generalizable to other types of acute stroke therapies.

### Health utility weighting of the modified rankin scale: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115SBrSF]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Although the mRS score is a universally accepted outcome for major acute stroke trials, use of a concurrent health utility scale may more fully capture changes important to survivors, whereas the mRS cannot. In addition to its implicit value statement in ranking death as the worst possible outcome, the mRS may also be insufficiently sensitive to important functional differences altering quality of life. For example, the EQ-5D may be more responsive than the mRS to stroke survivors' perceptions of functional changes. However, these minimally important differences may vary by cohort; when choosing a health utility scale, it is important that it reflects the needs and values of a particular study population. For example, in an exclusively minor stroke and transient ischemic attack cohort, where issues with fatigue, cognition, and mood may be most important for quality of life, the EQ-5D (which does not capture cognition) may not be an optimal choice for health utility weighting.

The variability of health utility weighting observed in this study provides evidence to support prior recommendations that clinical trials using a UW-mRS should prospectively and concurrently obtain both the mRS scores and health utility weights to establish trial-specific weighted scales. However, our findings also raise the broader question of whether a weighted score is the best approach to incorporating patient preferences into trial results; it may be more informative to simply provide the mRS score and a health utility weight separately as co-primary outcomes. Using both outcomes separately allows investigators to report functional differences using the clinically interpretable and reliable mRS alongside a contextually appropriate health utility scale to characterize meaningful differences in patient quality of life.

### Reliability of the modified rankin scale: a systematic review [^116xUnxp]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

A perceived weakness of the modified Rankin Scale is potential for interobserver variability. We undertook a systematic review of modified Rankin Scale reliability studies.

Methods

Two researchers independently reviewed the literature. Crossdisciplinary electronic databases were interrogated using the following key words: Stroke*; Cerebrovasc*; Modified Rankin*; Rankin Scale*; Oxford Handicap*; Observer variation*. Data were extracted according to prespecified criteria with decisions on inclusion by consensus.

Results

From 3461 titles, 10 studies (587 patients) were included. Reliability of modified Rankin Scale varied from weighted kappa = 0.95 to kappa = 0.25. Overall reliability of mRS was kappa = 0.46; weighted kappa = 0.90 (traditional modified Rankin Scale) and kappa = 0.62; weighted kappa = 0.87 (structured interview).

Conclusion

There remains uncertainty regarding modified Rankin Scale reliability. Interobserver studies closest in design to large-scale clinical trials demonstrate potentially significant interobserver variability.

### Assessment of functional outcome in a national quality register for acute stroke: can simple self-reported items be transformed into the modified rankin scale? [^116h2yzG]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

To enable self-reporting of functional outcome in quality registers, the corresponding questions have to be easy to interpret. In scientific research, the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a standard assessment method. Such methods, with an outsider observer, are not feasible to use in quality registers. For several aspects, eg, comparisons between outcome in clinical studies and observational studies, we determined to see whether the functional outcome, as assessed in a quality register, can be transformed into mRS grades.

Methods

The agreement between self-reported functional outcome (including dependency, living situation, mobility, dressing and toileting) and mRS were analyzed using 555 stroke patients registered in Riks-Stroke, the Swedish quality register for acute stroke, during a 5-month period in 4 hospitals. The self-reported outcome and the mRS grades were concurrently assessed by a telephone interview performed by an experienced nurse 3 months after stroke.

Results

A translation using 5 of the questions from Riks-Stroke classified 76% of the patients to the correct mRS grade. The correlation between Riks-Stroke and mRS was 0.821 and Cohen's kappa (weighted) was 0.853.

Conclusions

The study shows that self-reported functional outcome can be transformed into mRS grades with a high precision, making the translation useful for future comparative purposes in stroke outcome studies.

### Predicting 90-day modified rankin scale score with discharge information in acute ischaemic stroke patients following treatment [^117K1AMJ]. BMJ Neurology Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This study demonstrates the use of employing both discharge mRS and discharge disposition for predicting 90-day mRS scores, the standard measure of long-term functional outcomes in acute ischaemic stroke patients. It is important to understand the predictive value of these variables because both discharge mRS and discharge disposition are readily available in clinical and administrative datasets enabling widespread study of stroke outcomes following treatment outside the context of clinical trials in real-world practice.

The first part of our analysis showed that although there were minimal changes in patient mRS scores between discharge and 30 days, there were considerable differences between 30 and 90 days. This finding aligns with the observation that there is only modest agreement between discharge and 90-day mRS in clinical settings. Even though the changes in mRS scores between 30 days and 90 days are statistically significant (table 2), we find that figure 2 is even more informative on this matter. When we study these numbers at the individual patient level, we find that 98.6% (276/280) of patients maintained the exact same functional status between discharge and 30 days, while this was only true for 31.8% (89/280) of patients between 30 and 90 days. Moreover, the functional status of 33.2% (93/280) and 35.0% (98/280) of patients improved and worsened, respectively, between 30 and 90 days. This observation is upheld to some extent when the mRS scores are stratified by discharge disposition. Since most improvement from rehabilitation has been reported within the first 90 days after stroke, we would not expect significant changes observed in mRS scores between discharge and 90 days to continue. Because there was almost no difference between mRS scores at discharge and 30 days in our study, and discharge scores are more likely to exist in comparable studies, we used discharge mRS scores for the rest of the analysis.

### Weights for ordinal analyses of the modified rankin scale in stroke trials: a population-based cohort study [^112Qk4nG]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, cohort-derived data for clinical endpoints or health-economic outcomes of interest can be used to inform prognostication, cost-effectiveness, and weighted ordinal analyses of the mRS in clinical trials. Analyses of other stroke cohorts could validate our findings. Cohort studies of other neurological conditions may derive similar weights for commonly-used ordinal scales to examine their predictive validity and facilitate clinically-meaningful ordinal analyses.

### Comparing the properties of traditional and novel approaches to the modified rankin scale: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112wKgDJ]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most commonly used functional measure in stroke research but is limited by inter-rater reliability (IRR). Various interventions to improve mRS application have been described. We aimed to compare properties of differing approaches to mRS assessment.

Patients and Methods

Multidisciplinary databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Health and Psychosocial Instruments [OVID], CINAHL, PsycINFO [EBSCO]) were searched for adult human stroke studies describing psychometric properties of mRS. Two researchers independently screened 20% titles and abstracts, reviewed all full studies, extracted data, and conducted risk of bias (ROB) analysis. Primary outcomes for random-effects meta-analysis were IRR measured by kappa (K) and weighted kappa (KW). Validity and inter-modality reliability measures (Spearman's rho, KW) were also summarised.

Results

From 897 titles, 46 studies were eligible, including twelve differing approaches to mRS, 8608 participants. There was high ROB in 14 (30.4%) studies. Overall, reliability was substantial (n = 29 studies, K = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.58–0.71) but IRR was higher for novel approaches to mRS, for example, the Rankin Focussed Assessment (n = 2 studies, K = 0.94, 95%CI: 0.90–0.98) than standard mRS (n = 13 studies, K = 0.55, 95%CI:0.46–0.64). Reliability improved following the introduction of mRS training (K = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.44–0.67; vs K = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.62–0.77). Validity ranged from poor to excellent, with an excellent overall concurrent validity of novel scales (n = 6 studies, KW = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.75–0.97). The agreement between face-to-face and telephone administration was substantial (n = 5 studies, KW = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.74–0.87).

Discussion

The mRS is a valid measure of function but IRR remains an issue. The present findings are limited by a high ROB and possible publication bias.

Conclusion

Interventions to improve mRS reliability (training, structured interview, adjudication) seem to be beneficial, but single interventions do not completely remove reliability concerns.

### Repeated measures of modified rankin scale scores to assess functional recovery from stroke: AFFINITY study Findings [^112tRrbs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Baseline cohort characteristics were summarized using mean and SD for age at stroke, median with interquartile range for stroke scores and counts with percentage for binary variables (Table 1). The distribution of mRS scores (by category) over 12 months is visualized in the Figure, with a Sankey diagram visualizing transitions in mRS over 12 months in Figure S2. Patterns of mRS change (Worsening, Improving, Constant) between follow‐up intervals are summarized with counts (percentages), mean mRS change, and SD (Table 2). Associations between key baseline independent variables (demographic, clinical) and mRS scores were analyzed using partial proportional odds ordinal logistic regression, as recommended by the Optimizing Analysis of Stroke Trials Collaborationand validated in previous studies, identifying associations rather than treatment effect and transitions. With < 5% (n = 30) of participants missing baseline (day 1) characteristics or day 365 mRS data, complete case analysis without imputation was used.

### Comparison of hospital performance in acute ischemic stroke based on mortality and functional outcome in south Korea [^113ffLC7]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent evidence suggests a correlation between modified Rankin Scale-based measures, an outcome measure commonly used in acute stroke trials, and mortality-based measures used by health agencies in the evaluation of hospital performance. We aimed to examine whether the 2 types of measures are interchangeable in relation to evaluation of hospital performance in acute ischemic stroke.

Methods

Five outcome measures, unfavorable functional outcome (3-month modified Rankin Scale score ≥ 2), death or dependency (3-month modified Rankin Scale score ≥ 3), 1-month mortality, 3-month mortality, and 1-year mortality, were collected for 8292 individuals who were hospitalized for acute ischemic stroke between January 2014 and May 2015 in 14 hospitals participating in the Clinical Research Collaboration for Stroke in Korea - National Institute of Health registry. Hierarchical regression models were used to calculate per-hospital risk-adjusted outcome rates for each measure. Hospitals were ranked and grouped based on the risk-adjusted outcome rates, and the correlations between the modified Rankin Scale-based and mortality-based ranking and their intermeasure reliability in categorizing hospital performance were analyzed.

Results

The comparison between the ranking based on the unfavorable functional outcome and that based on 1-year mortality resulted in a Spearman correlation coefficient of -0.29 and Kendall rank coefficient of -0.23, and the comparison of grouping based on these 2 types of ranks resulted in a weighted kappa of 0.123 for the grouping in the top 33%/middle 33%/bottom 33% and 0.25 for the grouping in the top 20%/middle 60%/bottom 20%, respectively. No significant correlation or similarity in grouping capacities were found between the rankings based on the functional outcome measures and those based on the mortality measures.

Conclusions

This study shows that regardless of clinical correlation at an individual patient level, functional outcome-based measures and mortality-based measures are not interchangeable in the evaluation of hospital performance in acute ischemic stroke.

Interventions Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous rhPro-UK or alteplase. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary objective was to assess whether rhPro-UK was noninferior to alteplase. The noninferiority margin was a between-group difference of less than 10%. The primary outcome was a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 1 at 90 days.

This was an open-label trial, but patients at each center were assessed by independent investigators who were blinded to the group assignment. End point assessments were done on day 90, with a separate case report of the modified Rankin Scale, NIHSS, and Barthel Index scores provided to investigators to ensure that they were blinded to the allocation of patients. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an excellent functional outcome at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included major neurological improvement at 24 hours, functional independence at 90 days, and a Barthel Index score of 75 to 100 at 90 days after treatment. A Barthel Index score of 75 to 100 was obtained in 272 patients in the rhPro-UK group and 271 patients in the alteplase group.

### Outcomes validity and reliability of the modified rankin scale: implications for stroke clinical trials: a literature review and synthesis [^114QT6No]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The modified Rankin scale (mRS), a clinician-reported measure of global disability, is widely applied for evaluating stroke patient outcomes and as an end point in randomized clinical trials. Extensive evidence on the validity of the mRS exists across a large but fragmented literature. As new treatments for acute ischemic stroke are submitted for agency approval, an appreciation of the mRS's attributes, specifically its relationship to other stroke evaluation scales, would be valuable for decision-makers to properly assess the impact of a new drug on treatment paradigms. The purpose of this report is to assemble and systematically assess the properties of the mRS to provide decision-makers with pertinent evaluative information.

Methods

A Medline search was conducted to identify reports in the peer-reviewed medical literature (1957–2006) that provide information on the structure, validation, scoring, and psychometric properties of the mRS and its use in clinical trials. The selection of articles was based on defined criteria that included relevance, study design and use of appropriate statistical methods.

Results

Of 224 articles identified by the literature search, 50 were selected for detailed assessment. Inter-rater reliability with the mRS is moderate and improves with structured interviews (kappa 0.56 versus 0.78); strong test-re-test reliability (kappa = 0.81 to 0.95) has been reported. Numerous studies demonstrate the construct validity of the mRS by its relationships to physiological indicators such as stroke type, lesion size, perfusion and neurological impairment. Convergent validity between the mRS and other disability scales is well documented. Patient comorbidities and socioeconomic factors should be considered in properly applying and interpreting the mRS. Recent analyses suggest that randomized clinical trials of acute stroke treatments may require a smaller sample size if the mRS is used as a primary end point rather than the Barthel Index.

Conclusions

Multiple types of evidence attest to the validity and reliability of the mRS. The reported data support the view that the mRS is a valuable instrument for assessing the impact of new stroke treatments.

### Modified rankin scale at 90 Days versus National Institutes of Health stroke scale at 24 hours as primary outcome in acute stroke trials [^111GhpFG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We investigate whether the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at 24hours could serve as a primary outcome in acute ischemic stroke trials, and whether combining 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and 24-hour NIHSS in a hierarchical outcome could enhance detection of treatment effect, using endovascular treatment (EVT) as an exemplary study intervention.

Methods

This was a post hoc analysis of pooled data from 7 randomized EVT trials. Twenty-four-hour NIHSS as a surrogate outcome for 90-day mRS was assessed in a causal mediation model. A 7-point ordinal NIHSS score was generated by grouping 24-hour NIHSS, including death as a separate category ("ordinal" NIHSS). EVT effect sizes and sample sizes required for detecting EVT benefit with 80% power were compared when using granular 24-hour NIHSS, ordinal 24-hour NIHSS, 90-day mRS, and a hierarchical outcome (win ratio) that combines 90-day mRS and 24-hour NIHSS.

Results

A total of 1720 patients were included. Twenty-four-hour NIHSS mediated the association between EVT and 90-day mRS and met criteria for a useful surrogate outcome. Effect sizes were highest and sample sizes required to detect EVT benefit smallest for the win ratio approach (228), followed by 90-day mRS (240) and ordinal 24-hour NIHSS (242). In patients with baseline NIHSS < 10 and ≥ 25, ordinal 24-hour NIHSS resulted in the highest effect size.

Conclusions

Twenty-four-hour NIHSS is a useful surrogate outcome for 90-day mRS in patients with acute ischemic stroke undergoing EVT, with a similar EVT effect size compared with 90-day mRS. It could potentially enhance detection of EVT benefit in patients with very low or high baseline NIHSS. An ordered hierarchical outcome could improve detection of EVT treatment effect.

### Improving modified rankin scale assessment with a simplified questionnaire [^111d4fKM]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a popular primary stroke outcome measure, but its usefulness is limited by suboptimal reliability (inter-rater agreement).

Methods

We developed and tested the reliability of a simplified mRS questionnaire (smRSq) in 50 patients after stroke seen in outpatient clinics. Randomly chosen paired raters administered the smRSq within 20 minutes of each other and the ratings were blinded until the end of this study.

Results

Agreement among the raters was 78%, the kappa statistic was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.58–0.86), and the weighted kappa(w) statistic taking into account the extent of disagreement was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72–0.92). The average time to administer the smRSq was 1.67 minutes.

Conclusions

The smRSq appears to have very good reliability that is similar to that of a structured interview mRS and is considerably less time-consuming.

### Comparing the properties of traditional and novel approaches to the modified rankin scale: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113yVzfR]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations of included studies

Results of the reviewed studies should be interpreted with caution due to risk of bias and issues with reporting. Recurring issues included failure to report quantitative data or to use appropriate psychometric terminology. Additionally, there was no uniformity regarding the time interval between assessments, leading to potential for recall bias.

Causes for rater disagreement in mRS have been described and include the estimation of walking ability, and driving. Eight studies attributed rater discrepancies to the acute setting in which mRS was administered. As mRS requires evaluation of engagement in daily activities, its assessment within hospital setting invites rater's subjective judgement. The ideal study should assess the properties of mRS as it is most commonly used in research – at 90 days post ictus.

Strengths and limitations of the systematic review

Results of this review may be undermined by publication bias. With previous reviews suggesting no benefit in mRS reliability using the SI, papers that show benefits may have been favoured for publication. When grouped by year of publication, we saw that studies published during the development of novel scales reported lower IRR of the standard mRS compared to older or more independent validation studies.

We believe that the present review has several strengths including a systematic screening of multiple databases, input from an expert clinician, and the use of multiple ROB tools, which uncovered a wider range of biases.

Implications and future directions

We hope to increase awareness of the biases found in mRS literature. Furthermore, we recommend that future studies investigate the useability of mobile applications to administer mRS, reassess validity of structured mRS scales in larger samples, and work towards understanding reasons for ongoing variability. Improving interrater reliability is of particular importance for clinical trials, in which the misclassification of endpoint scores increases the risk of Type II error and decreases statistical power. This results in an inefficient use of resources, as lower power leads to the need for larger sample sizes.

Our data support use of interventions to improve mRS reliability. Using the limited evidence, the smRSq had the most desirable psychometric properties. Nevertheless, only four studies reported reliability, and a direct comparison with standard mRS was lacking. Therefore, we are unable to make a definitive recommendation on a single preferred approach.

To minimise the effects of poor reliability in clinical trials it may be necessary for trialists to combine approaches, for example training, structured script and offline adjudication. However, we should not assume that combining interventions will bring added benefit and any multimodal approach should be subject to robust assessment.

The Modified SOAR (Stroke subtype, Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification, Age, and prestroke modified Rankin) Score is a clinical calculator used in the management of stroke patients. It is specifically designed to predict the risk of death and dependency at discharge in patients with acute stroke.

The Modified SOAR Score applies to patients who have been diagnosed with an acute stroke. It is particularly useful in the early stages of stroke management, helping clinicians to stratify patients based on their risk and guide treatment decisions.

The score takes into account the type of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic), the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification (which categorizes stroke based on clinical symptoms and signs), the patient's age, and their prestroke modified Rankin Score (a measure of disability).

There are no specific exclusion criteria for the use of the Modified SOAR Score, but it may be less accurate in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or in those with rare causes of stroke. It should also be used with caution in patients with significant comorbidities that could independently affect their prognosis.

The Modified SOAR score for stroke aids in evaluating the risk of inpatient mortality for stroke patients by considering several key factors. It encompasses the type of stroke, classification according to the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project, patient age, pre-stroke modified Rankin Score, and NIHSS Score. Based on these inputs, each option in a category is mapped to a distinct numerical value contributing to the final score.

Here's how input categories and their options contribute to the score:

- **Stroke Type**
- **Infarct**: 0 points
- **Hemorrhage**: 1 point

- **Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project Classification**
- **Total anterior circulation stroke**: 2 points
- **Partial anterior circulation stroke**: 0 points
- **Lacunar stroke**: 0 points
- **Posterior circulation stroke**: 1 point

- **Age**
- **≤ 65**: 0 points
- **66–85**: 1 point
- **≥ 86**: 2 points

- **Pre-stroke Modified Rankin Score**
- **5**: 2 points
- **0–2**: 0 points
- **3–4**: 1 point

- **NIHSS Score**
- **0–4**: 0 points
- **5–10**: 1 point
- **≥ 11**: 2 points

The sum of these scores yields a total between 0 and 9, reflecting the patient's risk of inpatient mortality. The interpretation of this score is as follows:

- A score of 0–1 indicates a mortality risk of 1.0%
- A score of 2 suggests a risk of 1.5%
- A score of 3 results in a risk of 6.5%
- A score of 4 signifies a risk of 9.2%
- A score of 5 corresponds to a risk of 19.5%
- A score of 6 presents a risk of 26.2%
- A score of 7 indicates a risk of 49.2%
- Scores of 8–9 convey a risk greater than 49.2%

This systematic approach evaluates a patient's condition on admission and informs clinical decisions with estimated risk percentages to guide care strategies effectively.

### Predicting 90-day modified rankin scale score with discharge information in acute ischaemic stroke patients following treatment [^116idbt9]. BMJ Neurology Open (2021). High credibility.

Objectives

To understand variability in modified Rankin Scale scores from discharge to 90 days in acute ischaemic stroke patients following treatment, and examine prediction of 90-day modified Rankin Scale score by using discharge modified Rankin Scale and discharge disposition.

Materials and methods

Retrospective analysis of acute ischaemic stroke patients following treatment was performed from January 2016 to March 2020. Data collection included demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes data (modified Rankin Scale score at discharge, 30 days and 90 days and discharge disposition). Pearson's χ² test assessed statistical differences in distribution of modified Rankin Scale scores at discharge, 30 days and 90 days. The predictive power of discharge modified Rankin Scale score and disposition quantified the association with 90-day outcome.

Results

A total of 280 acute ischaemic stroke patients (65.4% aged ≥ 65 years, 47.1% female, 60.7% white) were included in the analysis. The modified Rankin Scale score significantly changed between 30 and 90 days from discharge (p < 0.001) after remaining stable from discharge to 30 days (p = 0.665). The positive and negative predictive values of an unfavourable long-term outcome for discharge modified Rankin Scale scores of 3–5 were 67.7% (95% CI 60.4% to 75.0%) and 82.0% (95% CI 75.1% to 88.8%), and for non-home discharge disposition were 72.4% (95% CI 64.5% to 80.2%) and 74.5% (95% CI 67.8% to 81.3%), respectively.

Conclusions

Discharge modified Rankin Scale score and non-home discharge disposition are good individual predictors of 90-day modified Rankin Scale score for ischaemic stroke patients following treatment.

### Ordinal vs dichotomous analyses of modified rankin scale, 5-year outcome, and cost of stroke [^112tSyFm]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare how 3 common representations (ordinal vs dichotomized as 0–1/2–6 or 0–2/3–6) of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) — a commonly used trial outcome measure — relate to long-term outcomes, and quantify trial ineligibility rates based on premorbid mRS.

Methods

In consecutive patients with ischemic stroke in a population-based, prospective, cohort study (Oxford Vascular Study; 2002–2014), we related 3-month mRS to 1-year and 5-year disability and death (logistic regressions), and health/social care costs (generalized linear model), adjusted for age/sex, and compared goodness-of-fit values (C statistic, mean absolute error). We also calculated the proportion of patients in whom premorbid mRS score > 1 or > 2 would result in exclusion from trials using dichotomous analysis.

Results

Among 1,607 patients, the ordinal mRS was more strongly related to 5-year mortality than both the 0–1/2–6 and 0–2/3–6 dichotomies (all p < 0.0001). Results were similar for 5-year disability, and 5-year care costs were also best captured by the ordinal model (change in mean absolute error vs age/sex: −$3,059 for ordinal, −$2,805 for 0–2/3–6, −$1,647 for 0–1/2–6). Two hundred forty-four (17.1%) 3-month survivors had premorbid mRS score > 2 and 434 (30.5%) had mRS score > 1; both proportions increased with female sex, socioeconomic deprivation, and age (all p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

The ordinal form of the 3-month mRS relates better to long-term outcomes and costs in survivors of ischemic stroke than either dichotomy. This finding favors using ordinal approaches in trials analyzing the mRS. Exclusion of patients with higher premorbid disability by use of dichotomous primary outcomes will also result in unrepresentative samples.

### Optimizing cutoff scores for the barthel index and the modified rankin scale for defining outcome in acute stroke trials [^11531z8f]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

There is little agreement on how to assess outcome in acute stroke trials. Cutoff scores for the Barthel Index (BI) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) are frequently arbitrarily chosen to dichotomize favorable and unfavorable outcome. We investigated sensitivity and specificity of BI cutoff scores in relation to the mRS to obtain the optimal corresponding BI and mRS scores.

Methods

BI and mRS scores were collected from 1034 ischemic stroke patients. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for BI cutoff scores from 45 to 100 in mRS score 1, 2, and 3 and were plotted in receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves.

Results

The cutoff scores for the BI with the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity were 95 (sensitivity 85.6%; specificity 91.7%), 90 (sensitivity 90.7%; specificity 88.1%), and 75 (sensitivity 95.7%; specificity, 88.5%) for, respectively, mRS 1, 2, and 3. The area under the ROC curve was 0.933 in mRS 1, 0.960 in mRS 2, and 0.979 in mRS 3.

Conclusions

The optimal cutoff scores for the BI were 95 for mRS 1, 90 for mRS 2, and 75 for mRS 3. For future acute stroke trials that assess stroke outcome with the BI and mRS, we recommend the use of these BI cutoff score(s) with the corresponding mRS cutoff score(s), to ensure the use of consistent and uniform end points.

### Comparing the properties of traditional and novel approaches to the modified rankin scale: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113xxRxL]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

The Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is the most commonly used functional measure in stroke research but is limited by inter-rater reliability (IRR). Various interventions to improve mRS application have been described. We aimed to compare properties of differing approaches to mRS assessment.

Patients and methods:

Multidisciplinary databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Health and Psychosocial Instruments [OVID], CINAHL, PsycINFO [EBSCO]) were searched for adult human stroke studies describing psychometric properties of mRS. Two researchers independently screened 20% titles and abstracts, reviewed all full studies, extracted data, and conducted risk of bias (ROB) analysis. Primary outcomes for random-effects meta-analysis were IRR measured by kappa (K) and weighted kappa (KW). Validity and inter-modality reliability measures (Spearman's rho, KW) were also summarised.

Results:

From 897 titles, 46 studies were eligible, including twelve differing approaches to mRS, 8608 participants. There was high ROB in 14 (30.4%) studies. Overall, reliability was substantial (n = 29 studies, K = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.58–0.71) but IRR was higher for novel approaches to mRS, for example, the Rankin Focussed Assessment (n = 2 studies, K = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90–0.98) than standard mRS (n = 13 studies, K = 0.55, 95%CI:0.46–0.64). Reliability improved following the introduction of mRS training (K = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.44–0.67; vs K = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.62–0.77). Validity ranged from poor to excellent, with an excellent overall concurrent validity of novel scales (n = 6 studies, KW = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.75–0.97). The agreement between face-to-face and telephone administration was substantial (n = 5 studies, KW = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.74–0.87).

Discussion:

The mRS is a valid measure of function but IRR remains an issue. The present findings are limited by a high ROB and possible publication bias.

Conclusion:

Interventions to improve mRS reliability (training, structured interview, adjudication) seem to be beneficial, but single interventions do not completely remove reliability concerns.

### Weights for ordinal analyses of the modified rankin scale in stroke trials: a population-based cohort study [^1113JTPG]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Ordinal scales are commonly used in clinical trials. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is used in over 20 neurological conditions (Appendix 1 and 2) and is the favoured primary outcome measure in stroke trials, partly due to ease of administration, reproducibility, and minimal floor or ceiling effects. However, analyses of trials using such measures are often hampered by dichotomous approaches, which result in information loss, risk ignoring bi-directional effects, and often require larger samples than ordinal approaches (examining all outcome levels). Dichotomies also promote exclusion of pre-morbidly disabled patients (e.g. mRS ≥ 2 pre-stroke) who cannot contribute positively to dichotomy-defined treatment effects.

Despite these pitfalls of dichotomization, adoption of ordinal analyses remains poor. Although there has been a trend in recent years towards the use of ordinal analyses, dichotomous approaches continue to be favoured as the primary outcome by many high-profile trials. One reason may be the poor clinical interpretability of conventional ordinal approaches, providing outputs like p-values or common odds-ratios without intuitive effect sizes. Such approaches also value state-transitions equally. However, previous data on mRS-stratified quality-of-life ratings and 90-day home-time post-stroke suggest steeper slopes between grades 3–5 versus 0–2, with the greatest step-change potentially seen from mRS = 2 to mRS = 3, the conventional dichotomy cut-off, although this non-linearity has not been systematically tested. If the mRS is indeed non-linear in relation to key outcomes, this would favour weighting the scale in ordinal analyses to reflect real-world differences between health-states. This approach would capture changes across the scale's range like conventional ordinal analyses, and acknowledge the greater clinical importance of certain state-transitions, like dichotomous analyses.

### Impact of central adjudication of the score on the modified rankin scale in an international, randomized, acute stroke trial [^116bwVii]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Our finding that the highest rates of disagreement were seen in patients who were centrally adjudicated as independent of others is comparable with a previous study. The quadratic weighted kappa of 0.92 in our study is comparable with that of REVASCAT (0.92) and corresponds well with the systematic review. No unweighted kappa was calculated in REVASCAT. In MR CLEAN, no kappa or weighted kappa was calculated.

In line with MR CLEAN, there was no difference in treatment effect estimates when based on central or local mRS adjudication. This may be explained in part by the use of an ordinal shift analysis for the primary outcome, in which misclassification has a smaller impact than with dichotomized comparisons. In REVASCAT local assessment was associated with a slightly larger benefit of treatment than central assessment (OR 1.93 vs 1.71), but the sample size was small and confidence intervals were comparable. In a meta-analysis of 15 randomized stroke trials assessing either stroke prevention or acute treatment of stroke, there was no difference in effect estimates based on central or local assessment of the primary outcome, being recurrent stroke in eight trials, a composite event including stroke in six, and the mRS in one.

### Stroke severity is a crucial predictor of outcome: an international prospective validation study [^114gge3V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of adult disability. 1 Despite currently available treatment options for stroke, patients often face the prospect of significant poststroke disability. 2 The implementation of regional and nationwide stroke systems of care and quality‐improvement initiatives has significant impact on reducing stroke‐related morbidity and improving outcomes. 3, 4, 5, 6

The Global Comparators Stroke GOAL collaboration is an international project facilitated by Dr Foster with participation from > 40 hospitals in Europe, the United States, and Australia. 7 The participating hospitals are a selected group of mostly academic hospitals that have been collaborating to share data and compare clinical outcomes and performance across international boundaries. The overall aim of the Global Comparators Stroke GOAL program is to compare stroke systems of care and outcomes across regions and countries.

The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) is a validated measure of functional outcome after stroke (ranging from 0, indicating no symptoms at all, to 6, indicating death), commonly used in large‐scale multicenter stroke trials and prospective studies of poststroke disability. 8, 9, 10 The utility of the mRS has been tested in modified telephone‐based interviews 11, 12 and at different time points after stroke. 13, 14 A number of prior poststroke outcome studies have used mRS in their prediction models, including the multinational Virtual International Stroke Trials Archives (VISTA); however, the majority of reports were based on the retrospective analysis of historical data. 15, 16 A major motivation for the current study was to design and implement a prospective international pilot project to validate the mRS as a robust stroke outcome measure and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score as a reliable predictor of outcome for future use in multinational database research.

### Utility-weighted modified rankin scale scores for the assessment of stroke outcome: pooled analysis of 20 000 + patients [^117Cuxyh]. Stroke (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Patient-centered care prioritizes patient beliefs and values towards wellbeing. We aimed to map functional status (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores) and health-related quality of life on the European Quality of Life 5-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) to derive utility-weighted (UW) stroke outcome measures and test their statistical properties and construct validity.

Methods

UW-mRS scores were derived using linear regression, with mRS as a discrete ordinal explanatory response variable in 8 large international acute stroke trials. Linear regression models were used to validate UW-mRS scores by assessing differences in mean UW-mRS scores between the treatment groups of each trial. To explore the variability in EQ-5D between individual mRS categories, we generated receiver operator characteristic curves for EQ-5D to differentiate between sequential mRS categories and misclassification matrix to classify individual patients into a matched mRS category based on the closest UW-mRS value to their observed individual EQ-5D value.

Results

Among 22 946 acute stroke patients, derived UW-mRS across mRS scores 0 to 6 were 0.96, 0.83, 0.72, 0.54, 0.22, -0.18, and 0, respectively. Both UW-mRS and ordinal mRS scores captured divergent treatment effects across all 8 acute stroke trials. The sample sizes required to detect the treatment effects using UW-mRS scores as a continuous variable were almost half that required in trials for a binary cut point on the mRS. Area under receiver operator characteristic curves based on EQ-5D utility values varied from 0.66 to 0.81. Misclassification matrix showed moderate agreement between actual and matched mRS scores (kappa, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.67–0.68]).

Conclusions

Medical strategies that target avoiding dependency may provide maximum benefit in terms of poststroke health-related quality of life. Despite variable differences with mRS scores, the UW-mRS provides efficiency gains as a smaller sample size is required to detect a treatment effect in acute stroke trials through use of continuous scores.
