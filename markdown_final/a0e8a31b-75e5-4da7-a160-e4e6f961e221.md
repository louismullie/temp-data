## Question

What are implications of keloid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the implications of keloids across pathophysiology, clinical burden, treatment challenges, and future directions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining keloids and distinguishing them from hypertrophic scars. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms, including genetic, inflammatory, and mechanobiologic drivers. Next, I will examine the clinical and psychosocial burden and epidemiology. After that, I need to review treatment efficacy, recurrence, and current algorithms. Finally, I will consider research gaps, emerging therapies, and practical counseling points, making sure I double-check areas where evidence is weak or conflicting before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical distinction. Keloids are benign fibroproliferative scars that extend beyond the original wound margins, rarely regress spontaneously, and are characterized by excessive collagen deposition and fibroblast proliferation, in contrast to hypertrophic scars that remain within wound boundaries and often regress over time, which has important implications for prognosis and management decisions.

> I will now examine the pathophysiological implications, starting with genetics. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for heritability and specific loci. Familial aggregation and segregation analyses support an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance and variable expression, and recent multi-ancestry GWAS identified numerous susceptibility loci with ancestry-dependent heritability, including signals in integrin signaling and fibrosis pathways, reinforcing a strong genetic predisposition that varies by ancestry [^115aeU7K] [^117UUtkA] [^112FoAyd].

> Next, I should review inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check which cytokine axes are most consistently implicated. Chronic reticular dermal inflammation with dysregulation of TGF-β, IL-6, IL-8, PDGF, and VEGF drives fibroblast activation and ECM accumulation; JAK/STAT signaling appears central, with early clinical signals that JAK inhibition may reduce symptoms and thickness, and emerging multi-omics data implicate IL-17 and mast cell–macrophage crosstalk as key nodes, while epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and noncoding RNAs like miR-21 and miR-29b modulate fibrosis programs and mechano-memory in keloid fibroblasts [^112QQ2Wv] [^112ihRyf] [^113x3qeD] [^1131cKVV] [^113EKQJA].

> Mechanobiology is another critical layer. Let me consider tension and mechanotransduction. High-tension anatomic sites (chest, shoulders, deltoids, earlobes) correlate with higher keloid risk and recurrence, and keloid peripheries exhibit increased mechanical strain with upregulated caveolin-1/ROCK signaling, linking positional mechanics to peripheral invasion and progression; this helps explain why tension-offloading strategies are emphasized in prevention and why site-specific recurrence rates differ even after adjuvant radiotherapy [^116bBVtT] [^116pRqZ8] [^117DbDBz].

> I should confirm the clinical burden and epidemiology. Keloids cause pain, pruritus, contractures, and disfigurement, with substantial quality-of-life impairment comparable to chronic inflammatory skin diseases; prevalence is markedly higher in individuals of African and Asian descent, with US estimates around 1 in 30 Black individuals versus less than 0.1% in many European populations, underscoring ancestry-linked susceptibility and the need for culturally tailored counseling and access to care [^112QQ2Wv] [^115ugUru] [^111t4HeS].

> Now, treatment implications and recurrence risk. Hold on, I should verify recurrence rates across modalities. Monotherapy with surgery or corticosteroids yields high recurrence, often 45–100% after excision alone, whereas combination strategies, particularly surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy or intralesional agents, substantially reduce recurrence; contemporary algorithms stratify by lesion number/size and risk, favoring multimodal therapy for larger/multiple keloids and long-term surveillance for early detection of recurrence [^114BQug4] [^116LqUs2] [^112xHzT4] [^111zwb33].

> Let me review specific therapies and their evidence base. Silicone gel sheeting and intralesional triamcinolone remain foundational first-line options with supportive evidence, while 5-fluorouracil combined with triamcinolone shows consistent superiority to steroid monotherapy in systematic reviews; lasers have variable and generally low-certainty evidence in Cochrane analyses, though pulsed-dye laser may modestly improve thickness and erythema; adjuvant radiotherapy reduces recurrence but requires careful technique and patient selection, with intensity-modulated approaches improving conformality in complex sites [^115r4D8Z] [^115pvsCj] [^113FMBuS] [^116N9PEs].

> But wait, what about emerging and investigational strategies. I should double-check the status of JAK inhibition, biologics, and epigenetic approaches. Early clinical and preclinical data suggest JAK inhibitors can reduce symptoms and fibrosis, dupilumab has case-level signals of symptom control and possible prevention in inflammatory contexts, and PARP-1 inhibition is being explored as an antifibrotic target; mechanistically, these align with inflammatory and fibrotic pathways, but larger RCTs are needed to define efficacy, durability, and safety [^112ihRyf] [^115nDUVZ] [^114RvabM].

> Next, I should review research gaps and methodological limitations. The literature remains dominated by low-level evidence; many studies are small, heterogeneous, and short in follow-up, with inconsistent outcome measures and underrepresentation of diverse populations; the lack of a complete animal model slows mechanistic translation, though humanized and xenograft models are advancing; standardized, validated scar scales and patient-reported outcomes are needed to harmonize evidence and better capture biopsychosocial burden [^114NcND7] [^1136gR1P] [^114bSKKW] [^112QQ2Wv].

> I need to ensure I translate this into practical clinical counseling. For patients with prior keloids or high-risk ancestry, I should advise avoiding elective procedures when possible, use tension-minimizing surgical techniques, and implement early prevention with silicone and pressure if procedures are necessary; I should set expectations about recurrence risk, emphasize multimodal therapy for established keloids, and arrange prolonged follow-up to catch early recurrences, while also screening for psychosocial distress and advocating for insurance coverage given the documented QoL impact [^1141rBtS] [^116bBVtT] [^111zwb33] [^115ugUru].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overarching implications. Keloids are not merely cosmetic; they are chronic fibroproliferative wounds driven by intersecting genetic, inflammatory, and mechanical programs, with substantial functional and psychosocial morbidity and a high propensity to recur after incomplete treatment; effective care demands individualized, multimodal strategies anchored in risk stratification, site-specific mechanics, and long-term surveillance, while ongoing research into JAK/STAT, IL-17, epigenetics, and mechanotransduction may soon yield disease-modifying therapies [^112QQ2Wv] [^116LqUs2] [^112ihRyf] [^113x3qeD].

---

Keloids are **benign fibroproliferative scars** that extend beyond the original wound margins and rarely regress spontaneously. They cause **significant psychosocial distress** [^115ugUru], pain, pruritus, and functional impairment, especially in darker skin tones and high-tension sites [^111t4HeS] [^117DbDBz]. Treatment is challenging due to high recurrence rates [^117BCCSj]; **multimodal therapy** (intralesional corticosteroids, silicone, pressure, surgery with adjuvant radiation or 5-FU) is most effective [^115pvsCj] [^116N9PEs]. Prevention focuses on minimizing tension, infection, and trauma; **early recognition and patient education** are essential to reduce recurrence and burden [^116bBVtT] [^1141rBtS].

---

## Clinical implications

### Physical symptoms and functional impact

Keloids often cause **pain and pruritus**, reflecting ongoing inflammation and nerve involvement [^notfound]. Functional impairment occurs when keloids overlie joints or sensitive areas, limiting mobility and causing discomfort [^111t4HeS].

---

### Psychological and social implications

Keloids can be **disfiguring**, leading to significant anxiety, depression, and social isolation [^117EdoT6]. Patients may face stigma and reduced self-esteem, especially when lesions are visible or symptomatic [^116rM2aW].

---

### Quality of life impact

Keloids substantially reduce quality of life, with effects comparable to chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis [^113FXBak]. The burden spans physical symptoms, psychological distress, and social limitations [^116rM2aW].

---

## Therapeutic implications

### Treatment challenges

Keloids are **notoriously difficult to treat**, with high recurrence rates across modalities [^116LqUs2]. No single therapy is universally effective, necessitating individualized, multimodal approaches [^115pvsCj].

---

### Current treatment options

| **Treatment modality** | **Mechanism of action** | **Efficacy and recurrence** |
|-|-|-|
| Intralesional corticosteroids | Anti-inflammatory, inhibit fibroblast proliferation | - First-line <br/> - Recurrence 9–50% [^notfound] |
| Silicone gel sheeting | Occlusion, hydration, reduce tension | - Reduces recurrence <br/> - Well tolerated [^notfound] |
| Pressure therapy | Mechanical modulation, reduce tension | - Effective adjunct <br/> - Especially post-surgical [^notfound] |
| Surgical excision | Remove keloid tissue | - High recurrence (45–100%) <br/> - Requires adjuvants [^114BQug4] |
| Radiation therapy | Inhibit fibroblast proliferation | - Adjunct to surgery <br/> - Recurrence 10–20% [^116N9PEs] |
| 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) | Antimetabolite, inhibit fibroblasts | - Effective adjunct <br/> - Reduces recurrence [^notfound] |
| Laser therapy | Vascular targeting, reduce erythema and thickness | - Variable efficacy <br/> - Often adjunctive [^notfound] |

---

### Emerging therapies

- **JAK inhibitors**: Tofacitinib shows promise in reducing thickness, pruritus, and pain [^112ihRyf].
- **Dupilumab**: Case reports suggest symptom improvement and prevention of new keloids [^115nDUVZ].
- **Epigenetic modulation**: miR-29b mimics and HDAC inhibitors under investigation [^1131cKVV].

---

## Preventive implications

### Risk factors and prevention strategies

- **Genetic predisposition**: Family history and ancestry (African, Asian, Hispanic) increase risk [^111k1RsU].
- **Mechanical tension**: High-tension sites (chest, shoulders, earlobes) are prone to keloids [^117BCCSj].
- **Trauma and inflammation**: Minimize infection, foreign bodies, and prolonged healing [^111XsxV5].
- **Early intervention**: Silicone, pressure, and corticosteroids applied early reduce risk [^116bBVtT].

---

### Patient education and counseling

Education should emphasize **avoidance of elective procedures** and trauma in high-risk patients [^1141rBtS]. Counseling should set realistic expectations regarding recurrence and the need for ongoing care, and patients should be taught to recognize early signs and seek prompt treatment [^111zwb33].

---

## Research and future directions

- **Genetic studies**: Multi-ancestry GWAS identify novel susceptibility loci, informing targeted therapies [^112FoAyd].
- **Mechanistic research**: Ongoing studies on fibroblast signaling, inflammation, and mechanotransduction [^116pRqZ8].
- **Clinical trials**: Larger, high-quality RCTs are needed to validate emerging therapies and refine algorithms [^112xHzT4].

---

Keloids are **complex fibroproliferative scars** with significant clinical, psychological, and social implications. Management requires **multimodal therapy** and prevention, with ongoing research to improve outcomes and quality of life [^112QQ2Wv].

Background

Keloid management can be difficult and frustrating, and the mechanisms underlying keloid formation are only partially understood.

Methods

Using original and current literature in this field, this comprehensive review presents the major concepts of keloid pathogenesis and the treatment options stemming from them.

Results

Mechanisms for keloid formation include alterations in growth factors, collagen turnover, tension alignment, and genetic and immunologic contributions. Treatment strategies for keloids include established (e.g., surgery, steroid, radiation) and experimental (e.g., interferon, 5-fluorouracil, retinoid) regimens.

Conclusion

The scientific basis and empiric evidence supporting the use of various agents is presented. Combination therapy, using surgical excision followed by intradermal steroid or other adjuvant therapy, currently appears to be the most efficacious and safe current regimen for keloid management.

### Hypertrophic response and keloid diathesis: two very different forms of scar [^111M6vdE]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Have a greater appreciation of the extent of differences and similarities between keloid and hypertrophic scarring. 2. Have a greater appreciation of the significance of the stage of maturation of a keloid or hypertrophic scar with regard to its morphologic, biochemical, and molecular profile. 3. More critically review basic science research that is based on poorly characterized scar tissue. 4. More critically review clinical studies that are based on poorly characterized scar tissue.

Background

Hypertrophic and keloid scars remain extremely challenging, particularly in their variable response to treatment. The understanding of hypertrophic and keloid scarring is evolving from a position where they were regarded as different stages of the same process to the contemporary perspective of two separate entities. This article reviews the differences in the two forms of scarring and discusses the implications for future research.

Methods

The authors conducted a MEDLINE search of all English language reviews linking key words "hypertrophic", "keloid", and "scarring".

Results

Over the past four decades, there has been considerable clinical and experimental research looking at the biological nature and therapeutic response of keloid and hypertrophic scarring. As more differences are emerging regarding the fundamental biology of the scars, investigators are giving more detailed characterization of their source material. It is evident that even within the broad categories of hypertrophic and keloid scarring there is a heterogenous distribution of pathologic connective tissue matrix biology.

Conclusion

Considerable advances have been made in our understanding of the fundamental biology of scarring. As research methodology becomes even more sophisticated, it will be even more crucial to extensively characterize source material, recognizing major differences not only between keloid and hypertrophic scar but also between scars of varying stages of maturation and histomorphological, biochemical, and molecular variations within individual scars.

### Abnormal wound healing: keloids [^112mGLFi]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Wound healing is a complex and carefully regulated physiologic response to a traumatic injury. Deregulation of this coordinated process can lead to exuberant scar formation as seen in keloids and hypertrophic scars. Despite their common occurrence, keloids remain one of the most challenging dermatologic conditions to successfully treat and may have significant psychosocial impact for the patient. In this review, we discuss the clinical features, genetics, epidemiology, and treatment of keloids.

### Keloids and hypertrophic scars: a spectrum of clinical challenges [^117EdoT6]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Since their earliest description, keloids and hypertrophic scars have beleaguered patients and clinicians alike. These scars can be aesthetically disfiguring, functionally debilitating, emotionally distressing, and psychologically damaging, culminating in a significant burden for patients. Our current understanding of keloid pathophysiology has grown and continues to advance while molecular biology, genetics, and technology provide ever-deepening insight into the nature of wound healing and the pathologic perturbations thereof. Greater understanding will lead to the development and application of refined therapeutic modalities. This article provides an overview of our current understanding of keloids, highlighting clinical characteristics and diagnostic criteria while providing a comprehensive summary of the many therapeutic modalities available. The proposed mechanism, application, adverse events, and reported efficacy of each modality is evaluated, and current recommendations are summarized.

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms of repair in acute and chronic wound healing [^113CGPUn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Can hypertrophic excessive scarring be dampened or reversed without affecting the rate and quality of skin wound healing?

It is generally believed that aspects of the acute wound inflammatory response drive scar formation at the time when skin wound healing is occurring – but can inflammation or its downstream consequences be modulated in ways that allow efficient healing but reduce scarring? One opportunity here might be to utilize the body's own inflammation resolution signals to drive early 'shutdown' of the inflammatory response. A better understanding of precisely how wound fibroblasts alter their behaviour, after receiving 'fibrosis' signals from inflammatory cells, and subsequently deposit collagen in pathological ways would also offer insight into antifibrotic therapeutic targets.

Is the molecular basis for keloid scarring similar to that for hypertrophic scarring?

If inflammation causes hypertrophic scarring, then does even more inflammation cause the 'overflowing' keloid scar? Or is keloid scarring due to an inability of wound fibroblasts to respond to wound 'stop' signals and, if so, what are these? There are no animal models of keloid scarring, but there are opportunities for genome-wide association studies to identify genes that might predispose to keloid scarring, and these might also lead us towards more generic antiscarring therapies if the mechanisms of hypertrophic and keloid scarring are at all related.

Much is known about the cellular and molecular basis of normal skin healing, but there are still avenues of research left to unravel that will guide us towards better prognostic indicators and better therapeutics for the various skin wound healing pathologies reviewed above.

Clinical Relevance

An increased understanding of how scarring quality is influenced by genetic factors will help to enable personalized patient management in acute wound care. Scar prevention measures such as pressure therapy, splinting, and silicones could be better targeted at patients who are most at risk of hypertrophic or keloid scarring, while avoiding unnecessary treatment and hospital visits for those who do not need such measures.

### Keloids and hypertrophic scars: are they two different sides of the same coin? [^112kakrW]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Keloids and hypertrophic scars are different forms of excessive dermal fibrosis thought to be caused by regulation of cellularity increase and decrease during the wound-healing process in predisposed individuals. Differences between keloids and hypertrophic scars include distinct clinical features, histologic evidence, and cellular function in response to molecular events. Keloids and hypertrophic scars are the results of increased fibroblast density and extracellular matrix substances. Interactions between epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts play an important role in regulating tissue homeostasis and processing scar formation. Keloids and hypertrophic scars are the two different stages of the same process that is based on separate clinical and histochemical entities. The aim of this review is to provide updated information regarding similarities and differences between keloids and hypertrophic scars as two different sides of the same coin. This article will also enable the dermatologist to better understand fundamental biology of the scarring.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^116LqUs2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In the past decade, many high-quality studies have been conducted, and the level of evidence for many treatment or prevention regimens has strengthened. As reflected in my reprised review here, these changes have led to pathologic scar management strategies that now effectively and safely prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate these pernicious scars. However, given ethnic differences in pathologic scar propensity, prevention and treatment algorithms should be optimized for each human race by means of international collaboration.

### A role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 in keloid pathogenesis [^114k1WM9]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The molecular pathomechanisms that drive keloid formation are only partially understood. Genetic studies have provided evidence for a genetic predisposition to keloid formation, and a keloid risk allele has been reported in the gene locus for the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4. Fujita et al. (2018) explore the consequences of this genetic risk allele in NEDD4 for inflammation in the skin and for keloid pathogenesis. This study implicates a specific transcript variant of NEDD4, NEDD4-TV3, as a regulator of NF-κB/STAT3-mediated inflammation and provides evidence that an increase in NEDD4-TV3 promotes keloid formation.

### Keloids: prevention and management [^114h3NAR]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Keloids result from an abnormal wound-healing process in which the normal regulatory pathways during tissue regeneration and scar remodeling are disrupted. While the pathogenesis of keloids continues to be investigated, numerous treatment options exist. Although prevention of keloid formation is the best management, early recognition of keloid formation is integral in treatment and prevention of recurrence. Surgical resection with adjuvant silicone gel sheeting or triamcinolone injection is common, but can still result in recurrence. New treatments include chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, and mitomycin C. Although further clinical investigation is required for newer treatments, initial results are promising.

### Hypertrophic scars and keloids – a review of their pathophysiology, risk factors, and therapeutic management [^114pYdYK]. Dermatologic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertrophic scars and keloids result from an abnormal fibrous wound healing process in which tissue repair and regeneration-regulating mechanism control is lost. These abnormal fibrous growths present a major therapeutic dilemma and challenge to the plastic surgeon because they are disfiguring and frequently recur.

Objective

To provide updated clinical and experimental information on hypertrophic scars and keloids so that physicians can better understand and properly treat such lesions.

Methods

A Medline literature search was performed for relevant publications and for diverse strategies for management of hypertrophic scars and keloids.

Conclusion

The growing understanding of the molecular processes of normal and abnormal wound healing is promising for discovery of novel approaches for the management of hypertrophic scars and keloids. Although optimal treatment of these lesions remains undefined, successful healing can be achieved only with combined multidisciplinary therapeutic regimens.

### Scars [^112QQ2Wv]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2023). High credibility.

Wound healing occurs as a response to disruption of the epidermis and dermis. It is an intricate and well-orchestrated response with the goal to restore skin integrity and function. However, in hundreds of millions of patients, skin wound healing results in abnormal scarring, including keloid lesions or hypertrophic scarring. Although the underlying mechanisms of hypertrophic scars and keloid lesions are not well defined, evidence suggests that the changes in the extracellular matrix are perpetuated by ongoing inflammation in susceptible individuals, resulting in a fibrotic phenotype. The lesions then become established, with ongoing deposition of excess disordered collagen. Not only can abnormal scarring be debilitating and painful, it can also cause functional impairment and profound changes in appearance, thereby substantially affecting patients' lives. Despite the vast demand on patient health and the medical society, very little progress has been made in the care of patients with abnormal scarring. To improve the outcome of pathological scarring, standardized and innovative approaches are required.

### A scoping review of the methodology used in studies of genetic influences on the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children after acute wounding [^1112ryBS]. Advances in Wound Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

Studies of the association between genetic variants and the development of hypertrophic or keloid scarring can increase understanding of which individuals are at risk of developing these types of scars following acute wounding. This review focuses on the methodology used in the small number of studies conducted to date and makes recommendations that will strengthen future research in the area.

### Genetics and epigenetics of keloids [^111q5vr7]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Significance: Keloid scarring is cosmetically disfiguring, psychosocially distressing, and can be physically disabling. The pathophysiology of keloid formation is poorly understood and subsequently, treatment options are ill defined, limited, and largely unsatisfactory. Therefore, in view of its unsatisfactory and recalcitrant management, keloid therapy is often seen as a financial burden affecting both patients and the health care systems. Recent Advances: Increased research on the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in keloids has broadened our understanding of keloid pathobiology. Epigenetic mechanisms, mainly DNA methylation, histone modification, and noncoding RNAs, are currently being widely investigated. Advances in genetic sequencing technology and reduced cost have aided this endeavor. Studies on blood and patient-derived keloid tissue are being done with therapeutic agents targeting epigenetic and genetic markers with the shared goal of identifying the pathways underlying the initiation and maintenance of keloids. These advances have informed us of multiple complex molecular pathways implicated in keloids, which are yet to be fully elucidated. Critical Issues: Improved understanding of the genetic and epigenetic causes implicated in keloids will enhance our knowledge of this enigmatic disorder and likely lead to the development of therapeutic targets based on the available clinical and experimental studies. Due to the incomplete knowledge of molecular targets involved in keloid scarring pathways, therapeutics is still lagging for this clinically and scientifically important condition. Future Directions: Focused research on the identification of molecular targets and mechanistic pathways implicated in keloids is required to generate novel antifibrotic therapeutic options to decrease or eradicate recurrence of the disease as well as associated morbidity and improve the quality of life of those affected with keloids.

### Keloids and hypertrophic scars [^114MN6P4]. Dermatologic Clinics (2023). Medium credibility.

Keloids are an exuberant response to skin wound healing in which abundant scar tissue grows beyond the boundaries of the inciting insult. Age, race, location, family history and personal history of keloids are relevant factors concerning the risk of developing keloids. Because keloids are prone to recurrence after surgical excision, post-operative management plays an important role in the treatment of keloids. There are many modalities that can be used to treat keloids or prevent their recurrence; a multimodal approach is often necessary in difficult cases.

### Hypertrophic scars and keloids: advances in treatment and review of established therapies [^117CrT1H]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertrophic scars and keloids can have significant detrimental effects on patients both psychosocially and functionally. A careful identification of patient risk factors and a comprehensive management plan are necessary to optimize outcomes. Patients with a history of dystrophic scarring should avoid unnecessary procedures and enhance the wound-healing process using various preventive strategies. As there is no single, fully efficacious treatment modality, prevention remains the best approach in reducing aberrant scar formation. When prevention therapies fail, keloids have been shown to be respond to a variety of therapies including topical and injectable corticosteroids, 5-fluorouracil, radiotherapy, lasers, and surgical excision, all with varying efficacies. As such, management should be tailored to the individual patient's risk factors with the use of combination therapies to reduce recurrence rates. Still, keloid and hypertrophic scar therapies are widely diverse with novel treatment modalities providing alternatives for recurring lesions. Laser-assisted drug delivery, skin priming, and novel topical therapies may provide alternative options for the management of hypertrophic scars and keloids.

### Effect of keloid properties on treatment efficacy: a systematic review [^1127F4YM]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The strengths of this systematic review include the use of a comprehensive database search, inclusion of RCTs with no limitation of publication date, and a critical methodologic quality assessment using the ROB 2.0. Limitations of this review include the low number of eligible studies and the heterogeneity of outcome measures and scales, which precludes a meta-analysis. Moreover, the study populations were generally small, which makes it difficult to detect differences in efficacy between keloid properties.

In conclusion, only a minority of studies performed subanalyses for specific keloid properties and even fewer studies found clinically relevant keloid properties. The authors' results suggest that keloid duration prior to treatment, location, size, history of recurrence, and severity influence treatment efficacy. Nonetheless, more high quality head-to-head RCTs using validated outcome measures should report on the potentially relevant keloid properties. These further investigations are crucial to corroborate the authors' findings, establish a clinically relevant keloid classification, and ultimately develop an evidence-based treatment algorithm for clinical practice that takes these properties into account.

### Animal models for studies of keloid scarring [^1136gR1P]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Significance: Keloid scarring is a disfiguring fibroproliferative disorder that can significantly impair the quality of life in affected individuals. The mechanisms that initiate keloid scarring are incompletely understood, and keloids remain one of the most challenging skin conditions to treat. Keloids are unique to humans; thus, the lack of adequate animal models has hindered research efforts aimed at prevention and effective therapeutic intervention. Recent Advances: In the absence of a suitable animal model, keloid researchers often rely on studying excised keloid scar tissue and keloid-derived cultured cells. Recently, in vivo models have been described that involve transplantation to mice of reconstructed skin containing keloid-derived fibroblasts and/or keratinocytes. These mouse-human hybrid animal models display some similarities with keloids and may enable investigation of novel therapies, although no model yet recapitulates all the features of human keloid scarring. Critical Issues: Differences in skin physiology and modes of healing contribute to challenges in modeling keloids in laboratory animals. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that cells of the immune system contribute to keloid pathology. The need to use immunodeficient hosts for transplanted human keloid cells in recently described animal models precludes studying the role of the immune system in keloid scarring. Future Directions: Future animal models may take advantage of humanized mice with immune systems reconstituted using human immune cells. Such models, when combined with grafted tissues prepared using keloid-derived cells, might enable investigation of complex interactions between systemic and local factors that combine to promote keloid scar formation and may aid in the development of novel therapies.

### Hypertrophic scars and keloids: etiology and management [^116z8Fc7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Keloid and hypertrophic scars have affected patients and frustrated physicians for centuries. Keloid and hypertrophic scars result from excessive collagen deposition, the cause of which remains elusive. Clinically, these scars can be disfiguring functionally, aesthetically, or both. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical nature of the scar can help define the most appropriate treatment strategy. Although many articles have been published on the management of hypertrophic and keloid scars, there is no universally accepted treatment protocol. Prevention of keloid and hypertrophic scars remains the best strategy; therefore, those patients with a predisposition to develop excessive scar formation should avoid nonessential surgery. Once a scar is present, there are many treatments from which to choose. Hypertrophic scars and keloids have been shown to respond to radiation, pressure therapy, cryotherapy, intralesional injections of corticosteroid, interferon and fluorouracil, topical silicone or other dressings, and pulsed-dye laser treatment. Simple surgical excision is usually followed by recurrence unless adjunct therapies are employed. Biologic agents that are directed towards the aberrant collagen proliferation that characterizes keloid and hypertrophic scars might be an important addition to the current armamentarium of modalities in the near future.

### A scoping review of the methodology used in studies of genetic influences on the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children after acute wounding [^115Nv9vv]. Advances in Wound Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope of the Review and its Significance

This scoping review (a type of research synthesis that aims to map the literature on a particular topic) focuses on the methodology used in studies of the association of genetic variants and the development of hypertrophic or keloid scarring following acute wounding. It considers the study designs used, characteristics of included participants and methods used to assess scarring. It is the first review to address these issues. The review brings together and provides an overview of the small body of evidence in the area and makes recommendations for the conduct of future studies.

### The role of chemokines in fibrotic wound healing [^112YuTQA]. Advances in Wound Care (2015). Low credibility.

Significance: Main dermal forms of fibroproliferative disorders are hypertrophic scars (HTS) and keloids. They often occur after cutaneous wound healing after skin injury, or keloids even form spontaneously in the absence of any known injury. HTS and keloids are different in clinical performance, morphology, and histology, but they all lead to physical and psychological problems for survivors. Recent Advances: Although the mechanism of wound healing at cellular and tissue levels has been well described, the molecular pathways involved in wound healing, especially fibrotic healing, is incompletely understood. Critical Issues: Abnormal scars not only lead to increased health-care costs but also cause significant psychological problems for survivors. A plethora of therapeutic strategies have been used to prevent or attenuate excessive scar formation; however, most therapeutic approaches remain clinically unsatisfactory. Future Directions: Effective care depends on an improved understanding of the mechanisms that cause abnormal scars in patients. A thorough understanding of the roles of chemokines in cutaneous wound healing and abnormal scar formation will help provide more effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for dermal fibrosis as well as for other proliferative disorders.

### Keloid and hypertrophic scar formation, prevention, and management: standard review of abnormal scarring in orthopaedic surgery [^114qcgVf]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Keloid and hypertrophic scar formation after orthopaedic surgical closure is a complex issue. The nature and location of procedures maximize wound tension, leave foreign bodies, and diminish dermal supply, all potentiating keloid formation. There is little discussion regarding the pathophysiology and management of this recurrent problem in orthopaedic literature. Keloid formation is a fibroproliferative disorder resulting in extensive production of extracellular matrix and collagen, but prevention and treatment is poorly understood. Patient and surgical factors contributing to the development of this condition are discussed. The treatments include both medical and surgical therapies that work at a biologic level and attempt to produce a cosmetic and complication-free management strategy. Medical options that have been investigated include combinations of intralesional steroid therapy, laser therapy, and biologics. Preventive surgical closure and excision remain mainstays of treatment. Radiation therapy has also been used in refractory cases with mixed results. Despite medical therapies and surgical excision aimed at treating the resulting scar, recurrence rate is very high for all modalities that have been studied to this point. Future work is being done to better understand the pathophysiology leading to keloid and hypertrophic scar formation in an effort to find preventive methods as compared to treatment strategies.

### The management of keloids: hands-on versus hands-off [^117SG2ry]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Keloids are benign fibrous growths that appear in scar tissue. The lesions can be severely disfiguring and early recognition of genetic lesions is crucial. This case report outlines and reviews the important management strategies for these lesions and the requirement for extensive counseling for the patient and their family. Many potential medical and surgical interventions exist. Unfortunately, these lesions tend to recur and overall outcomes remain poor. Given patient susceptibility to disfiguring results, surgical intervention should be used with extreme caution.

### Inhibition as a novel therapeutic target for keloid disease [^112Xvdtp]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Problem Addressed

Over several decades, no single treatment option has been advocated and none of them produced consistent and effective therapeutic results, and high rates of recurrence are common after surgery alone. Many authors have proposed numerous treatment options, but none of them clearly successfully eradicated keloid disease. These findings reflect the current lack of knowledge regarding the exact molecular mechanisms and pathogenic mechanisms that underlie keloid formation. The PARP1 inhibitor, rucaparib is a recently FDA-approved therapy for ovarian cancer. In the current study, we would like to reveal the in vitro effect of pharmacological inhibition with rucaparib in terms of cell migration, proliferation, and expression of fibrosis-related markers. We further analyze its effect in vivo using patient-derived keloid xenograft model.

### Keloids: an update on medical and surgical treatments [^111XsxV5]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Keloids are the result of an overgrowth of dense fibrous tissue that usually develops after healing of a skin injury. Despite their common occurrence, keloids remain one of the most challenging dermatologic conditions to successfully treat. They are often symptomatic, do not usually regress spontaneously, and tend to recur after excision. Prevention of keloids is essential. A previous history of keloid development should be elicited. Wound closure with minimal tension and application of adjunctive therapies before abnormal healing is paramount. Education regarding wound care should be given in order to prevent infection and foreign body reactions. Elective surgery should be avoided in patients predisposed to developing keloids. In this article, we review recent advances in medical and surgical treatment of keloids.

### Keloids and hypertrophic scars: pathophysiology, classification, and treatment [^111cxKZ6]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Keloid and hypertrophic scars represent an aberrant response to the wound healing process. These scars are characterized by dysregulated growth with excessive collagen formation, and can be cosmetically and functionally disruptive to patients.

Objective

Objectives are to describe the pathophysiology of keloid and hypertrophic scar, and to compare differences with the normal wound healing process. The classification of keloids and hypertrophic scars are then discussed. Finally, various treatment options including prevention, conventional therapies, surgical therapies, and adjuvant therapies are described in detail.

Materials and Methods

Literature review was performed identifying relevant publications pertaining to the pathophysiology, classification, and treatment of keloid and hypertrophic scars.

Results

Though the pathophysiology of keloid and hypertrophic scars is not completely known, various cytokines have been implicated, including interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and IL-10, as well as various growth factors including transforming growth factor-beta and platelet-derived growth factor. Numerous treatments have been studied for keloid and hypertrophic scars, which include conventional therapies such as occlusive dressings, compression therapy, and steroids; surgical therapies such as excision and cryosurgery; and adjuvant and emerging therapies including radiation therapy, interferon, 5-fluorouracil, imiquimod, tacrolimus, sirolimus, bleomycin, doxorubicin, transforming growth factor-beta, epidermal growth factor, verapamil, retinoic acid, tamoxifen, botulinum toxin A, onion extract, silicone-based camouflage, hydrogel scaffold, and skin tension offloading device.

Conclusion

Keloid and hypertrophic scars remain a challenging condition, with potential cosmetic and functional consequences to patients. Several therapies exist which function through different mechanisms. Better understanding into the pathogenesis will allow for development of newer and more targeted therapies in the future.

### Biopsychosocial impact of keloids on quality of life [^115ugUru]. JAAD Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Keloids affect patients' physical health, emotional well-being, and social interactions. As demonstrated in this review, the domains of pain and itch, mobility, visibility, gender and age, psychosocial, stigma, and cosmetic, reflect the impact of keloids on patients' lives and overall well-being, and the interplay of these factors multiplies keloid disease burden. Despite the scope and significance of these effects, most keloid research focuses on treatment, and QoL improvement remains significantly understudied. When viewed by society and by policymakers as a purely cosmetic condition, keloids may be deemed of lower priority not only for research studies, but also may not be reimbursed by insurers as a medical condition. By shifting the context and focusing on improving QoL metrics, health care professionals can raise the priority of keloids in health policy decision-making, allowing higher-quality treatment options and easier access to patient resources.

Given the paucity and limitations of keloid QoL research to date, larger epidemiologic studies in more diverse patient populations are needed. However, this review underscores the need to prioritize the development of robust QoL instruments in the keloid population that are not only valid and reproducible across patient phenotypes (age, gender, race/ethnicity, keloid location, etc), but also accurately capture the spectrum of biopsychosocial factors that impact QoL in these patients. Standardization of future studies to utilize these validated keloid-specific QoL instruments will provide data to support the expansion of insurer coverage for keloid treatments as medical conditions. In addition, these studies will hopefully drive the development of novel therapeutics specifically targeting improvement in QoL metrics, with a significant impact on patient lives. Finally, a better understanding of the economic impact of poor keloid-associated QoL is warranted, especially because keloids are often refractory to treatment and pose a chronic burden to the health care system. With increased awareness of the negative impact of keloids on QoL, clinicians will be able to refine their treatment approaches to holistically improve patient lives across the biopsychosocial domains.

### A scoping review of the methodology used in studies of genetic influences on the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children after acute wounding [^111DEtuV]. Advances in Wound Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary

This article reports the findings of a scoping review of the methodology used in studies of genetic influences on the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children. A small body of evidence was identified in burns and surgical patients, and mostly relating to hypertrophic scarring.

Further studies are needed, especially of keloid scarring, and in a wider range of populations, including patients with wounds caused by trauma. Future studies should recruit large and ethnically diverse populations and follow up participants for at least 12–36 months to allow for adequate scar maturation. The methodological literature supports the use of a prospective cohort design to reduce the risk of bias in the findings. Further research to achieve consensus on how scar quality should be defined and measured is also needed.

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms of repair in acute and chronic wound healing [^112iSeZX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

What causes wound scarring?

One of the mysteries in the field of tissue regeneration and repair is the heterogeneity among diverse organisms: some animals, including axolotls, can perfectly regenerate injured tissues and organs as complex as limbs, whereas others, like humans, replace damaged tissue with a connective tissue characterized by densely bundled orientated collagen fibrils called a scar. The degree of fibrosis after damage varies across organs and tissues and between individuals. In humans, perfect scar-free tissue repair has been described in fetal skin. Postnatal human liver, the haematopoietic system and, to a lesser degree, the gut and skin represent tissues that maintain the highest regenerative capacity.

In human skin, two types of scarring following injury are distinguished: hypertrophic scars and keloids (Fig. 3). Aesthetically disturbing hypertrophic scars develop after surgery or from other trauma, particularly burns. Keloids differ from hypertrophic scars in that they extend beyond the margins of the original tissue damage, and they do not regress spontaneously (hypertrophic scars generally partially regress within 6 months). Moreover, keloids tend to show a genetic predisposition, with particular association with darker-skinned populations. Keloids and hypertrophic scars can also be histologically distinguished by their different arrangement of collagen fibres, presence of α-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts, and extent of angiogenesis. Scarring can cause functional disability, for example if extended over a joint, or may cause patient discomfort and psychological stress.

### Biopsychosocial impact of keloids on quality of life [^113FXBak]. JAAD Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Keloids are a benign dermal fibroproliferative disorder resulting from an abnormal wound healing response. Although their pathophysiology is not fully elucidated, keloids form due to prolonged inflammation, leading to fibroblast proliferation and excess collagen production. The development of keloids is multifactorial, involving environmental triggers and genetic predisposition. Although they may develop spontaneously, most keloids arise from sites of trauma, including the earlobes after piercing, the extremities after lacerations or burns, and postacne keloidal scars.

Clinically, keloids are firm, raised, smooth proliferations of scar tissue that can present in a variety of colors and sizes. In contrast to hypertrophic scars, keloids extend beyond the boundary of the original wound, are unlikely to spontaneously regress, and may continue to grow years after the initial insult. Keloids are present across all ethnicities but affect darker-skinned individuals at a higher rate, with an incidence of 4% to 16% in Black and Hispanic people. Black and Asian populations also have a more severe keloid phenotype in terms of size and number of lesions. Although keloids are one of the most prevalent dermatologic diseases, they are relatively understudied. Keloids have been receiving more attention recently, along with growth in the body of skin and color research. Yet, a major understudied feature of keloids is their impact on patients' quality of life (QoL). Skin diseases as a whole negatively affect QoL to a degree comparable with or exceeding that of life-threatening illnesses, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure, and studies have shown that QoL deterioration attributed to keloids is comparable with that of patients with chronic skin conditions such as psoriasis. Keloids are challenging to treat not only because there is no gold standard for treatmentbut also because current interventions still carry a high risk of recurrence.

As more studies are performed to develop better treatment options for keloids, we believe that it is just as important to shed light on the significant impact keloids have on patients' QoL. Keloid therapies are often considered cosmetic and are not covered by insurance. As such, by highlighting the significant negative impact of keloids on QoL, we can better advocate for expanded coverage of treatments that target QoL across biopsychosocial domains. Furthermore, enhanced understanding of keloid impact on QoL by clinicians and researchers will encourage holistic patient-centered care and drive the development of efficacious therapies that improve patient lives.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^112xHzT4]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

In 2010, this Journal published my comprehensive review of the literature on hypertrophic scars and keloids. In that article, I presented evidence-based algorithms for the prevention and treatment of these refractory pathologic scars. In the ensuing decade, substantial progress has been made in the field, including many new randomized controlled trials. To reflect this, I have updated my review.

Methods:

All studies were evaluated for methodologic quality. Baseline characteristics of patients were extracted along with the interventions and their outcomes. Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and comprehensive reviews were included if available.

Results:

Risk factors that promote hypertrophic scar and keloid growth include local factors (tension on the wound/scar), systemic factors (e.g. hypertension), genetic factors (e.g. single-nucleotide polymorphisms), and lifestyle factors. Treatment of hypertrophic scars depends on scar contracture severity: if severe, surgery is the first choice. If not, conservative therapies are indicated. Keloid treatment depends on whether they are small and single or large and multiple. Small and single keloids can be treated radically by surgery with adjuvant therapy (e.g. radiotherapy) or multimodal conservative therapy. For large and multiple keloids, volume- and number-reducing surgery is a choice. Regardless of the treatment(s), patients should be followed up over the long term. Conservative therapies, including gel sheets, tape fixation, topical and injected external agents, oral agents, and makeup therapy, should be administered on a case-by-case basis.

Conclusions:

Randomized controlled trials on pathologic scar management have increased markedly over the past decade. Although these studies suffer from various limitations, they have greatly improved hypertrophic scar and keloid management. Future high-quality trials are likely to improve the current hypertrophic scar and keloid treatment algorithms further.

### Effect of keloid properties on treatment efficacy: a systematic review [^11321rV9]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of keloid treatment in randomized studies is highly variable. However, no systematic review has been performed to evaluate the effect of different keloid properties on treatment efficacy.

Objective

To identify clinically relevant keloid properties that may influence treatment efficacy.

Materials and Methods

An electronic database search was conducted. Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and performed a methodologic quality assessment using the Cochrane risk-of-bias 2.0 tool.

Results

One thousand five hundred twenty studies were screened, and 16 RCTs, involving 1,113 patients, were included. The authors found lower efficacy in older keloids (n = 3), keloids located on the chest, extremities, pinna, and shoulder (n = 3), larger keloids (n = 2), lower baseline Vancouver Scar Scale score (n = 1), and keloids with history of recurrence (n = 1). Overall, most studies had a high risk of bias.

Conclusion

Only a minority of studies specifically addressed keloid properties, which makes comparisons between studies challenging. The authors' results suggest that keloid location, duration prior to treatment, size, history of recurrence, and severity are clinically relevant keloid properties that affect treatment efficacy. Further studies are crucial to corroborate the authors' findings, establish a clinically relevant keloid classification, and ultimately develop an evidence-based treatment algorithm that takes these properties into account.

### Keloid or hypertrophic scar: the controversy: review of the literature [^116oDppj]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Keloid and hypertrophic scars are 2 types of excessive scarring observed clinically that require different therapeutic approaches. The clinical course and physical appearance define keloids and hypertrophic scars as separate entities; however, they are often confused because of an apparent lack of morphologic differences. Nevertheless, clinical differences between hypertrophic scars and keloids have long been recognized by plastic surgeons and dermatologists. Yet, translating these differences into morphologic or biochemical distinctions has prompted much conflict in the literature. The present report is an attempt to clarify the longstanding controversy regarding these 2 similar yet separate and nonidentical entities by highlighting the reported points of differentiation as well as the similarities.

### The role of the JAK / STAT pathway in the pathogenesis and treatment of keloids: a systematic review [^112ihRyf]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Keloid scars impact 4.5% to 16% of the population, causing pain, pruritus, and disfigurement. They are a common, recurrent complication in dermatologic surgery, with limited treatment options. The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway has been implicated in keloid formation, presenting a potential therapeutic target.

Objective

To review the literature published on the role of the JAK/STAT pathway in keloid pathogenesis and treatment.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of clinical and experimental studies was conducted on October 21, 2024, using PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science, following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies examining JAK/STAT signaling in keloids were independently reviewed.

Results

Of 109 retrieved articles, 23 met inclusion criteria (one clinical trial, 22 basic science studies). A trial of tofacitinib, a JAK1/3 inhibitor, showed reduced scar thickness, pruritus, and pain. Preclinical studies demonstrated that JAK2 and STAT3 inhibition reduced fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition. Systemic side effects remain a concern.

Conclusion

The JAK/STAT pathway plays a key role in keloid fibrogenesis. Although JAK inhibitors show promise, further research is needed to confirm efficacy, refine specificity, and minimize systemic risks. Targeted JAK/STAT inhibition may improve keloid treatment in dermatologic surgery.

### Biopsychosocial impact of keloids on quality of life [^116rM2aW]. JAAD Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Keloids are a prevalent, although understudied, dermatologic condition commonly affecting people of color. In the clinical setting, keloids negatively impact many aspects of patient quality of life (QoL), but this area has not been comprehensively characterized. This review identifies and summarizes studies in which the QoL impact of keloids has been measured utilizing validated survey and questionnaire instruments, including the SCAR-Q and Dermatology Life Quality Index. Study findings are grouped into physical and emotional factors that together comprise 7 biopsychosocial domains: pain and itch, mobility, visibility, gender and age, psychosocial, stigma, and cosmetic. These domains interact in a complex network that negatively impacts QoL of patients with keloid. Enhanced understanding of the significance of these domains will pave the way for the performance of large, rigorous epidemiologic studies that will lead to the development of efficacious keloid therapies that improve not only physical but also psychosocial functioning, enabling clinicians to provide holistic care that enhances patient QoL.

### Updated international clinical recommendations on scar management: part 2 – algorithms for scar prevention and treatment [^1164Aa9T]. Dermatologic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In 2002, an international advisory panel was convened to assess the scientific literature and develop evidence-based guidance for the prevention and treatment of pathologic scarring. Emerging clinical data, new treatment options, and technical advances warranted a renewed literature search and review of the initial advisory panel recommendations.

Objective

To update the management algorithm for pathologic scarring to reflect best practice standards at present.

Materials and Methods

Management recommendations were derived from clinical evidence amassed during a comprehensive literature search and from the clinical experience and consensus opinion of advisory panel members.

Results

A combination approach using multiple modalities provides the maximum potential for successful treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids. The advisory panel advocates a move toward more aggressive initial management of keloids, including earlier application of 5-fluorouracil. A growing body of clinical research supports a place in therapy for newer agents (e.g., bleomycin, onion extract, imiquimod, mitomycin C) and laser therapy (pulsed-dye, fractional) for scar management.

Conclusion

Prevention and treatment of pathologic scarring requires individualized care built upon the principles of evidence-based medicine and continues to evolve in step with technological and scientific advances.

### Endothelial dysfunction in keloid formation and therapeutic insights [^114rKMwu]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Keloids are benign fibroproliferative tumors that cause significant physical and mental morbidity owing to their disfiguring appearance, chronic symptoms, and resistance to treatment. Although fibroblast hyperproliferation and excessive extracellular matrix deposition have been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to the role of vascular dysregulation and endothelial dysfunction (ED) in keloid pathogenesis. Emerging evidence highlights abnormal angiogenesis, vascular irregularities, and endothelial injury as critical drivers of fibrosis in keloids. This review explores the direct and indirect mechanisms of ED in keloid progression, including endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, inflammation, immune cell crosstalk, and hypoxia. In addition, various treatment strategies targeting angiogenesis and ED, such as drugs, radiotherapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, compression, and laser treatments, are comprehensively reviewed. This review explores keloids through the lens of vasculature and endothelium, emphasizing the critical roles of vascular dysregulation and ED. It aims to provide insights into the mechanisms of keloid formation and serve as a reference for developing future therapeutic strategies.

### Clinical implications of single-versus multiple-site keloid disorder: a retrospective study in an Asian population [^112X6rYU]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is strong evidence of genetic susceptibility in individuals with keloid disorder. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the clinical relevance of our proposed variables on the multiplicity of keloids by further investigating the presence of other keloids and a family history.

Methods

This was a retrospective review, using institutional review board-approved questionnaires, of patients with keloids who were seen at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital between December 2002 and February 2010. Eight hundred sixty-eight patients were included in our study. Comparisons between the 2 groups were made using Mann-Whitney tests for continuous variables and χ² tests for categorical variables.

Results

In our patient group, younger age of onset and the presence of family history were significantly associated with the occurrence of keloids at multiple sites. The locations of extra-auricular keloids, in order of frequency, included the shoulder; anterior chest, including the breasts; deltoid; trunk and pubic area; upper extremities; lower extremities; and other sites. As compared to secondary keloids, primary keloids were significantly associated with both a lower degree of recurrence and the presence of other keloids. The presence or absence of family history was significantly associated with the presence or absence of other keloids and primary or secondary keloids.

Conclusions

Keloid disorder is one of the most frustrating problems in wound healing and advances in our understanding of the differences of occurrence at a single site versus multiple sites might help in understanding pathogenesis and improving treatment.

### Association of hidradenitis suppurativa and keloid formation: a therapeutic challenge [^116UCd3T]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Keloid formation in patients with HS likely results from chronic tissue inflammation. Management of keloids in HS patients can be difficult given the chronicity of the skin inflammation and the formation of deep tunnels and tracts. We recommend treatment with intralesional triamcinolone or immunosuppressive therapy including other biologics. Patients require counselling regarding scar formation from HS, particularly in those prone to keloid formation. Further studies are necessary to understand the pathogenesis of keloids in the setting of HS.

### Epigenetic modification mechanisms involved in keloid: current status and prospect [^1131cKVV]. Clinical Epigenetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Even more interesting is the possibility of preventing disadvantageous epigenetic modifications for therapeutic purposes. The most relevant epigenetic modifications that play a critical role in keloid formation, are a source of potential therapeutic targets. The current experimental evidence regarding the role of epigenetic regulators including histone deacetylases proposes the therapeutic implication of these regulators in the keloid treatment. It also has confirmed that TSA, a classical HDAC inhibitor partly reverses TGF-β1 induced collagen synthesis and promotes apoptosis in KFs. The result supports the epigenetically altered program in KFs, especially an altered pattern of histone acetylation, which provides novel and ponderable insights for keloid treatment. The epigenetic modification based on ncRNA also shows great application potential during keloid treatment. An exciting study found that EB irradiation inhibited autophagy in KFs by reducing miR-21–5p, which has already been confirmed to be closely involved in keloid progression, thereby indicating the significance of miR-21–5p-targeting therapy in controlling the keloid recurrence. Furthermore, in a double-blinded, placebo-randomized, within-subject controlled clinical trial of single and multiple ascending doses of remlarsen in normal healthy volunteers, Gallant-Behm et al. found that miR-29b mimic (remlarsen) repressed ECM expression and the development of fibroplasia. These results suggest that miR-29b mimics might be an effective therapeutic to prevent the formation of keloid. Since the complex interaction mechanism involving chromatin structure and ncRNA has not been fully elucidated, it is necessary to explore the value of combined therapy to produce synergistic and optimized effects, which is of great significance in future research, especially in clinical research.

### Effect of keloid properties on treatment efficacy: a systematic review [^1122BJWc]. Dermatologic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Keloid, derived from "cheloides", the Greek word for "crab's claw", is a fibroproliferative scar that expands beyond the initial border of injury and rarely shows spontaneous regression. These pathologic scars can cause severe pain, pruritus, and functional or aesthetic complaints, which can decrease patients' quality of life.

The reported clinical efficacy of keloid treatments is highly variable and may strongly depend on keloid and patient characteristics. However, reaching consensus on a standardized keloid classification system based on the most relevant clinical properties remains challenging. Ideally, this classification should be based on high level evidence that shows the impact of specific properties on treatment efficacy. This could be a crucial step towards developing evidence-based guidelines for selecting the most efficacious treatment for individual keloid patients.

However, to date, no systematic review has been performed to evaluate the evidence regarding the impact of different keloid properties on treatment efficacy. This systematic review aimed to assess the impact of the various keloid properties on treatment efficacy.

### Up-to-date approach to manage keloids and hypertrophic scars: a useful guide [^114TKaN7]. Burns (2014). Low credibility.

Keloids and hypertrophic scars occur anywhere from 30 to 90% of patients, and are characterized by pathologically excessive dermal fibrosis and aberrant wound healing. Both entities have different clinical and histochemical characteristics, and unfortunately still represent a great challenge for clinicians due to lack of efficacious treatments. Current advances in molecular biology and genetics reveal new preventive and therapeutical options which represent a hope to manage this highly prevalent, chronic and disabling problem, with long-term beneficial outcomes and improvement of quality of life. While we wait for these translational clinical products to be marketed, however, it is imperative to know the basics of the currently existing wide array of strategies to deal with excessive scars: from the classical corticotherapy, to the most recent botulinum toxin and lasers. The main aim of this review paper is to offer a useful up-to-date guideline to prevent and treat keloids and hypertrophic scars.

### Novel targets and therapies for keloid [^112ymsZq]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Keloids are the result of aberrant tissue scarring typically occurring in injured skin, and are caused by the overgrowth of granulation tissue or collagen type III during the healing process. There is a genetic component, thus a predisposition can be genetically transmitted. Keloids are difficult to treat because of their postexcisional recurrence, and they have an impact on patient quality of life due to psychological distress caused by cosmetic concerns and functional disability. Treatment ranges from classic corticosteroid therapy to multimodal approaches such as injections, cryotherapy, laser, radiation, radiofrequency ablation and extracorporeal shockwave therapy. Recent discoveries into the pathogenesis of keloid have enabled clinicians to expand the therapeutic options for treatment. The aim of this paper was to review the literature, clarify the general concept of keloid development, and assess emerging treatment options such as stem cell therapy, mitomycin C, bleomycin, interferon, botulinum toxin type A, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and fat grafting, and the evolutionary advancement towards epigenetic modifications and gene therapy.

### Concomitant use of isotretinoin and lasers with implications for future guidelines: an updated systematic review [^115SdiAr]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

It is generally believed that intervention on skin while on isotretinoin or within 6 to 12months after treatment can lead to prolonged healing and abnormal scarring. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the body of evidence on concomitant use of isotretinoin and lasers for adverse events as a consequence of treatment. A PRISMA-compliant systematic review (Systematic Review Registration Number: CRD42017056492) of 12 electronic databases was conducted for the terms "laser" and "isotretinoin" or associated brand names from inception until June 2020. Subsequent reference search of studies meeting predefined inclusion criteria were conducted, and all articles were evaluated for bias and assigned levels of evidence to facilitate data synthesis. The search strategy produced 29 studies. Of 871 patients included in the studies of interest, 12 experienced transient adverse effects that resolved spontaneously, and only two presented with keloid formation, both from case reports. This systematic review suggests the risk associated with concomitant isotretinoin and laser use is small to absent. Further studies are needed, but these results suggest that current contraindications may be overly cautious.

NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PAST DECADE

The past decade has seen a remarkable growth in our understanding of how hypertrophic scars and keloids develop and progress. Consequently, hypertrophic scars and keloids are now known to be caused by chronic inflammation in the reticular dermis. Risk factors associated with hypertrophic scar and keloid development and aggravation have been identified, thereby aiding treatment optimization and effectiveness. Several major advancements in preventing and treating hypertrophic scars and keloids have been made, as follows. First, deprodone propionate (a stronger steroid) plaster was found to both prevent and treat hypertrophic scars and keloids very effectively. Second, surgical methods have been optimized for each body region, thereby improving cosmetic and functional outcome, safety, and recurrence rates. Third, the postoperative radiotherapy protocol has been fine-tuned, making it safer while remaining equally effective. The previous algorithm has been greatly improved by the inclusion of these modalities. I anticipate that further high-quality evidence for these modalities, and additional new modalities, will emerge in the next decade.

### A scoping review of the methodology used in studies of genetic influences on the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children after acute wounding [^116heJm8]. Advances in Wound Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Study selection

Titles and abstracts identified by the searches were screened by one reviewer (P.D.) and those that were clearly irrelevant were excluded. A random sample of 200 abstracts were selected and screened independently by a second reviewer (A.Y.). Full-text reports were obtained for all remaining references and assessed against the inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers (P.D. and A.Y.). Disagreements were resolved by discussion or, where agreement could not be reached, by consultation with a third reviewer. The selection process is shown in a PRISMA study selection flow diagramin Fig. 1.

Figure 1.
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram.

Data extraction

Data were extracted using a standardized data extraction form by one reviewer (P.D.). Any items of uncertainty were referred to a second reviewer (A.Y.).

Data were extracted on the following: study details (author, year, country, setting, study design, length of follow up, study dates); population (sample size, inclusion/exclusion criteria, method of identification and recruitment, race, age, sex, details of wound e.g. size, depth, cause of wound or burn, length of time to healing, details of treatments received e.g. dressings, topical agents, surgical interventions); type of scarring (keloid or hypertrophic), including details of any measurement tool/instrument used and cutoff thresholds; candidate genes investigated and genotyping methods used; other prognostic factors for scarring considered.

As this is a scoping review, our primary aim was to provide an overview of research in the area as opposed to providing estimates of the strength of association between genetic variants and the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring. We did not, therefore, conduct risk of bias assessment of identified studies.

Synthesis

Studies were grouped by population and a narrative overview was conducted of the amount and types of evidence available, populations considered, and scarring assessments made.

keloid Treatment

Keloid treatment starts with determining the keloid number and size (Fig. 2): this indicates the strength of the patient's keloid risk factors. If there is one keloid or the keloids are small, skin tension is probably the cause. However, if there are multiple or large keloids, genetic and systemic factors should be considered, especially when keloids are on different body regions. Single or small keloids can be treated with conservative therapy. Thick, large, multiple keloids should be assessed for surgery plus adjuvant therapy because they respond poorly to topical drugs. Physicians must carefully discuss therapeutic options with the patient and establish treatment goals.

Keloid inflammation generally worsens over time. Because scar massage, ablative lasers, and surgical monotherapy provoke inflammation and worsen keloids, they should be avoided.

Gel Sheets

Corticosteroid Injection

Many studies show that intralesional corticosteroid injections induce keloid regression. – However, combining corticosteroid injections with 5-fluorouracil, pulsed-dye laster, or cryotherapy has better outcomes than corticosteroid injections alone.

### Multi-ancestry meta-analysis of keloids uncovers novel susceptibility loci in diverse populations [^111t4HeS]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Keloids are raised scars that expand beyond the original wound boundaries and encroach on the surrounding skin –. They are characterized by fibroproliferative derangement of the wound-healing process involving excessive deposition of collagen and overactive cell proliferation, though the precise etiology is not well-understood. The most common symptoms of keloids are pruritus (itchiness) and pain. More extensive or persistent keloids can cause disfigurement, and mobility issues may arise if keloids develop on joints. Notably, they have a tendency to recur after surgical excision and are frequently refractory to alternative treatments, necessitating an improved understanding of biological factors associated with susceptibility to excess scarring.

Keloids are most likely to affect darker-skinned individuals, particularly those of African or Asian descent. A sociodemographic study of keloids in the United States (US), with cases identified using structured and unstructured sources, documented a numerically higher proportion of Asian or Black patients with keloids. In the US, keloids occur in about 1 in 30 Black individuals, approximately a 20-fold increase in risk compared to White individuals. A recent study of excess scarring in the United Kingdom found prevalence estimates of 1.1%, 2.4%, and 0.4% for Asian, Black, and White patients, respectively. Other fibroproliferative diseases such as hypertension, sarcoidosis, and uterine fibroids display similar increased prevalence, and it has been suggested these conditions share biology with keloids –.

### Association of hidradenitis suppurativa and keloid formation: a therapeutic challenge [^113nmTRH]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present the largest series of keloids developing in the setting of HS. HS is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by inflamed painful nodules, tracts, and scars. Medical treatment of HS consists of antimicrobial and biologic medications, but none are curative; consensus guidelines have recently been generated. It is thought that medical therapy combined with surgical therapy will lead to the most effective outcomes. Patients often do not respond consistently to a single treatment modality; the presence of keloids in the setting of HS lesions presents a greater therapeutic dilemma.

The etiology of keloids is far better understood than HS. There are several theories linking keloid formation to fibroblast dysfunction with an overproduction of type-I procollagen and higher levels of growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, transforming growth factor β1 and β2, and platelet-derived growth factor. Keloid fibroblasts have lower rates of apoptosis and show a downregulation of apoptosis-related genes, including p53. Neutrophils and macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, which increase the level of reactive oxygen species and lead to extracellular matrix and cell damage. This process of keloid formation occurs at the site of tissue injury as an exaggerated response to scar formation.

The relationship between HS and keloid formation is unknown. HS, however, is associated with extensive scar formation and sinus tracts; thus, we hypothesize that the pathway underlying tissue destruction and scar formation in HS triggers keloid formation. HS has been associated with upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1, similar to keloids, which may also play a role in scar formation. It is uncertain whether the scarring pathways overlap or represent 2 distinct pathways with the HS scarring cascade triggering keloid formation.

Treating a patient with both HS and keloids within the same area is complex. In the setting of no residual HS inflammation, but only HS scar with keloid formation, it is likely that these lesions may respond to traditional keloid therapeutic modalities such as intralesional corticosteroid injection. However, keloids that occur in the chronically inflamed HS lesions require a different approach that targets not only keloid reduction and prevention but also addresses the underlying HS process leading to scar formation. In patients with active HS, intralesional steroids are commonly used in the management of localized flares. However, the impact of intralesional steroids in the setting of combined keloids and HS has yet to be studied.

### CD201fascia progenitors choreograph injury repair [^1122WwaC]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

These results have important clinical implications, as alterations in this differentiation process could result in pathologies such as impaired wound healing and fibrotic scarring. In particular, the manipulation of individual steps along the trajectory opens new roads to modulate different wound fibroblasts to obtain disease-tailored therapies. Treatments of wounds (such as surgical and keloid wounds, and burns) could be modulated to restrain myofibroblasts to prevent excessive scarring and contraction without compromising the proinflammatory role needed during the inflammatory phase, and treatments tailored for modulating the early progenitors would be beneficial for inflammatory skin diseases.

### A scoping review of the methodology used in studies of genetic influences on the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children after acute wounding [^111NpPo4]. Advances in Wound Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Some potential limitations of our review should be acknowledged. First, the review was limited to English language publications for pragmatic reasons. Conference abstracts were also excluded as these would not have contained sufficient information about study methodology. It is possible therefore that a complete set of studies was not identified. Second, only 15% of references were screened by two reviewers. However, interrater reliability for the dual screened references was high, indicating a strong degree of confidence in the selection process.

Finally, our review was hampered by the quality of reporting in the included studies, many of which did not report details such as numbers eligible, detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria, power calculations, or treatments received by participants to reduce or prevent scarring. It is important that studies are reported fully and transparently. It is recommended that researchers consult the STrengthening the REporting of Genetic Association Studies (STREGA) guidelinesfor the reporting of genetic association studies when publishing their studies.

### Update on keloid management: clinical and basic science advances [^114jZeHu]. Advances in Wound Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Keloids are benign, fibroproliferative lesions that represent abnormal healing resulting in excessive fibrosis. They are composed of mainly type III (early) or type I (late) collagen. Some of the symptoms include pruritus, tenderness, and pain. Often, they are very difficult to treat and prevent from recurrence. In contrast to hypertrophic scars, keloids extend beyond the margin of the wound.

The Problem

There is very limited evidence on the best wound management for minimizing scarring. Multiple available therapeutic modalities have been used for the treatment of keloids; however, high-recurrence rates continue to be reported. Unsuccessful treatment of keloids leads to psychological impact on the patients and increased economic burden.

Basic/Clinical Science Advances

Currently, there are biological and antineoplastic agents that can potentially treat and prevent excessive scar formation. Some of them have been used as "off label" therapies, and others are still in the experimental phase such as interferon alpha (IFN-α), imiquimod, and transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1). The use of IFN-α2b showed 18% recurrence rate when applied to postsurgical excised keloids. Imiquimod 5% can lower recurrence rate on postshaved keloids to 37.5% at 6-month and to 0% at a 12-month follow-up period. TGF-β1 oligonucleotides have shown effective and long-lasting inhibition of TGF-β-mediated scarring in vitro as well as in animal models. Daily injections of neutralizing antibodies against TGF-β1 and -β2 have shown successful reductions in scarring.

Conclusion

Latest discoveries in the use of novel agents suggest therapeutic alternatives for the prevention of recurrences of hypertrophic scars and postexcision keloid lesions.

### Association of hidradenitis suppurativa and keloid formation: a therapeutic challenge [^114BQug4]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

For patients with isolated keloid scars in the absence of significant inflammation, surgical excision, intralesional injection (corticosteroids, 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, and interferon), topical therapy (imiquimod, corticosteroids), plus physical modalities (compression, cryotherapy, radiation, silicon sheeting, and laser radiofrequency or light-based therapies) are appropriate. Optimal treatment of patients with HS and keloids requires further investigation.

Recurrence rates after keloid excision alone range from 45% to 100%. We believe that the development of keloids in HS patients is caused by underlying tissue inflammation triggered by HS. Ongoing inflammation makes management of keloids in HS patients daunting because scars and keloids continue to remodel during the course of the disease. It is important to counsel the patient on the importance of controlling HS to prevent further scarring and contractures. Longer wound healing and more inflammation tends to result in more pathologic scars and scar formation. In active HS, we recommend a trial of multimodal therapies including intralesional triamcinolone concomitant with systemic antibiotic, biologics, and surgical therapy targeting the microbiome in early diagnosed cases, depending on their disease severity, to shorten the time to healing. Surgery should be used in medically optimized patients, whereas radiation should be reserved for refractory progressive keloids, given the potential for skin cancer development within HS lesions. Scars and contractures from HS have a significant impact on patient quality of life, causing social isolation and embarrassment as well as pain and itching. Clinicians need to be cognizant of scar and keloid formation risk in these patients and provide adequate counseling and support.

### A scoping review of the methodology used in studies of genetic influences on the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children after acute wounding [^114bSKKW]. Advances in Wound Care (2021). Medium credibility.

All of the studies relied on subjective methods to assess scarring (based on observer or patient opinion). Objective measurement tools such as imaging devices have been developed but studies to evaluate their accuracy and reliability are scarce. Most studies used rating scales, such as the VSSand POSAS, to determine scarring, but there was considerable heterogeneity in how scales were operationalized.

Comparability of studies would be increased by using the same outcome definition and measurement sale. However, there is currently no consensus on which scar scale is best, what score on a scale constitutes clinically relevant hypertrophic or keloid scarring, or even how hypertrophic and keloid scarring are defined. Most scar scales rely on clinicians' judgment rather than the patients' opinion. Consequently, their focus is on a relatively narrow range of features that do not incorporate patient-observed issues such as pain and itchand the cosmetic, functional, and psychological sequalae of scarring.

Scar quality is affected by length of follow-up, which was short in many studies, particularly in those involving burns patients. Improvements in scar quality have been observed in the 12–36 months following both burnsand incisional scars. A shorter length of follow-up may therefore have resulted in the misclassification of scarring in some included studies.

This scoping review has established several gaps in the literature. First, no studies were identified involving patients with acute wounds due to trauma. Second, very few studies of keloid scarring were identified. Finally, the majority of participants in the included studies were white/Caucasian, which may limit the generalizability of their findings to other ethnic groups. Epigenetic and environmental factors may also play a role in the development of hypertrophic or keloid scarring. These were not the focus of this review.

### Management of keloids and hypertrophic scars [^117BCCSj]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Keloids and hypertrophic scars represent an exuberant healing response that poses a challenge for physicians. Patients at high risk of keloids are usually younger than 30 years and have darker skin. Sternal skin, shoulders and upper arms, earlobes, and cheeks are most susceptible to developing keloids and hypertrophic scars. High-risk trauma includes burns, ear piercing, and any factor that prolongs wound healing. Keloid formation often can be prevented if anticipated with immediate silicone elastomer sheeting, taping to reduce skin tension, or corticosteroid injections. Once established, however, keloids are difficult to treat, with a high recurrence rate regardless of therapy. Evidence supports silicone sheeting, pressure dressings, and corticosteroid injections as first-line treatments. Cryotherapy may be useful, but should be reserved for smaller lesions. Surgical removal of keloids poses a high recurrence risk unless combined with one or several of these standard therapies. Alternative postsurgical options for refractory scars include pulsed dye laser, radiation, and possibly imiquimod cream. Intralesional verapamil, fluorouracil, bleomycin, and interferon alfa-2b injections appear to be beneficial for treatment of established keloids. Despite the popularity of over-the-counter herb-based creams, the evidence for their use is mixed, and there is little evidence that vitamin E is helpful.

### A scoping review of the methodology used in studies of genetic influences on the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children after acute wounding [^112SBhRT]. Advances in Wound Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Significance: Keloid and hypertrophic scarring are common following acute wounds. However, the variability in scarring outcomes between individuals and in particular, the association between genetic factors and scarring, is not well understood. This scoping review aims to summarize the methodology used in studies of genetic influences on the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children after acute wounding. The objectives were to determine the study designs used, the characteristics of participants included, the tools used to assess scarring and the length of follow-up after wounding.

Recent Advances: The review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Medline, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Web of Science, Biosciences Information Service (BIOSIS), Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), The Human Genetic Epidemiology (HuGE) Navigator (database of genetic association studies), and the genome-wide association study Catalog were searched from January 2008 to April 2020. Cohort studies and case–control studies that examined the association between one or more genetic variations and the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring were eligible for inclusion. A narrative synthesis that grouped studies by wound type was conducted.

Critical Issues: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria (five in burns, four surgical wounds, and none in other types of acute wounds). Seven assessed hypertrophic scarring, one keloid scarring, and one both scar types. Seven studies used a prospective cohort design. All studies used subjective methods (clinician or patient observation) to assess scarring. There was considerable variation in how scar scales were operationalized.

Future Directions: This review identified a small body of evidence on genetic susceptibility to scarring after acute wounding. Further studies are needed, and in a wide range of populations, including patients with wounds caused by trauma.

### Multi-ancestry meta-analysis of keloids uncovers novel susceptibility loci in diverse populations [^117UUtkA]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Keloids are raised scars that grow beyond original wound boundaries, resulting in pain and disfigurement. Reasons for keloid development are not well-understood, and current treatment options are limited. Keloids are more likely to occur in darker-skinned individuals of African and Asian descent than in Europeans. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) examining keloid risk across and within continental ancestry groups, incorporating 7837 cases and 1,593,009 controls. We detected 26 loci in the multi-ancestry analysis, 12 of which replicated in an independent dataset. Heritability estimates were 6%, 21%, and 34% for the European, East Asian, and African ancestry analyses, respectively. Genetically predicted gene expression and colocalization analyses identified 27 gene-tissue pairs, nine in skin and fibroblasts. Pathway analyses implicated integrin signaling and upstream regulators involved in cancer, fibrosis, and sex hormone signaling. This investigation nearly quintuples the number of keloid-associated risk loci, illuminating biological processes in keloid pathology.

### Keloids and hypertrophic scars: pathophysiology, classification, and treatment [^114fPYMm]. Dermatologic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on keloids and hypertrophic scars:

- **Definition**: Keloids and hypertrophic scars are cutaneous fibroproliferative disorders resulting from abnormal wound healing, characterized by excessive collagen deposition. In keloids, abnormal proliferation of the dermal layer extends beyond the original wound borders, while in hypertrophic scars, it remains within the original wound boundaries.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of keloids and hypertrophic scars is not fully understood but involves dysregulation of wound healing phases, excessive fibroblast activity, and collagen deposition. Injury to the reticular dermis from surgery, burns, or trauma is a key trigger, while minor injuries like folliculitis or insect bites can induce keloids in susceptible individuals. Hypertrophic scars and keloids develop in predisposed individuals following injury to the reticular dermis, including surgical incisions, burns, or trauma. In highly susceptible individuals, minor injuries, such as folliculitis or insect bites, may also lead to keloid formation. Multiple cell types, including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, keratinocytes, melanocytes, mast cells, and endothelial cells, contribute to scarring. Endothelial dysfunction during inflammation increases vascular permeability, promoting prolonged inflammation and fibrosis. Pathologic scars involve elevated cytokines and growth factors, such as transforming growth factor beta, VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor, IL-6, and IL-8.
- **Epidemiology**: Keloids and hypertrophic scars most commonly appear between ages 10 and 30 years. The epidemiology of keloids varies, with reported annual incidence ranging from 0.09% in England and 0.15% in Taiwan to as high as 4.5% and 16% in African and Hispanic populations. The incidence of hypertrophic scars is reported at 40–70% after surgery and over 90% after burns.
- **Risk factors**: Inciting factors include various dermal injuries, especially surgery, trauma, and burns. Risk factors include genetic predisposition, family history, African, Hispanic, and Asian origin, young age (10–30 years), and pregnancy.
- **Disease course**: Hypertrophic scars and keloids appear as firm, raised, erythematous lesions with a glossy surface, typically red in White individuals and purple to black in Black individuals. Keloids commonly form unique shapes, influenced by local tension forces. Hypertrophic scars typically grow for 3–6 months before stabilizing and regressing, particularly in patients with a lower risk of pathologic scarring. Pain and itching are prominent symptoms of keloids and are often more intense than in hypertrophic scars.

### Multi-ancestry meta-analysis of keloids uncovers novel susceptibility loci in diverse populations [^112FoAyd]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Through this large multi-ancestry meta-analysis of keloids risk, we identified several genomic risk loci contributing to keloid development. Some had evidence of impacts on gene expression in keloid-relevant tissues like skin and fibroblasts. Many of the genes identified have previously documented roles in fibrosis and wound healing, with dysregulation affecting cellular functions contributing to diverse disease phenotypes. Our findings also offer preliminary support for genetic risk factors that vary based on ancestry, with stark differences in heritability indicating heterogenous genetic susceptibility to keloid scarring depending on the ancestral population. Our discovery dataset was limited to European, East Asian, and African groups, but we were able to extend results to additional populations in the replication analysis. Six SNPs had evidence of replication in the Admixed American group, encouraging future work in affected populations. An expanded understanding of the genetic architecture of keloids may assist in the identification of alternative treatments for scar management. This investigation may also serve to encourage future functional research examining mechanisms of keloids and highlight opportunities for studies of fibroproliferative disease.

### Biological agents for controlling excessive scarring [^114Wmgcw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

The potential of various biological agents to reduce or prevent excessive scar formation has now been evaluated in numerous in-vitro studies, experimental animal models and preliminary clinical trials, in some cases with particularly promising results. Perhaps prominent among this group of biological agents, and, to some degree, possibly representing marketed compounds already being used 'off label' to manage excessive scarring, are the tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonist etanercept, and immune-response modifiers such as IFNalpha2b and imiquimod. Additional assessment of these novel agents is now justified with a view to reducing or preventing hypertrophic scars, keloid scars and the recurrence of post-excision keloid lesions.

LONG-TERM POSTTREATMENT FOLLOW-UP OF HYPERTROPHIC SCARS AND KELOIDS

Treated hypertrophic scar and keloid patients should be educated about scar management and followed-up over the long-term. Close follow-up allows early detection and treatment of small recurrences that respond well to steroid tape, plaster, or injection. Thus, patients should be followed up for greater than 18 to 24 months. Follow-up can stop when the scar is flat and soft.

Hypertrophic scar and keloid patients often experience psychological stress that may aggravate their scars. They may benefit from makeup or camouflage therapies – because they improve cosmetic appearance and promote beneficial physiologic changes.

Prevention of postsurgical Hypertrophic scars and keloids

Patients with a hypertrophic scar and keloid history are at high risk, as are patients with one or more of the following risk factors (special care must be taken during and after surgery).

Risk Factors

Local

Hypertrophic scars and keloids occur frequently on sites that are frequently stretched by daily body movements, including the major joints, anterior chest, scapula, and lower abdomen. By contrast, hypertrophic scars and keloids occur rarely on the scalp and anterior lower leg, where stretching tension is low. This is because stretching a wound prolongs and worsens its inflammation, thereby provoking hypertrophic scar and keloid formation. –

To prevent hypertrophic scar and keloid formation after surgery on susceptible body regions, surgical techniques that limit dermal tension should be used, namely, flaps, Z-plasties, and subcutaneous and deep fascial tensile-reduction sutures. Moreover, postsurgical wound stretching should be limited by fixation materials such as paper tape, gel sheets, gels, or compression bandages and garments. All are supported by meta-analyses/randomized controlled trials. Regarding paper tape, a randomized controlled trialdemonstrated that paper tape fixation reduced the hypertrophic scar risk after cesarean section by 13.6-fold. Regarding gel sheets, a meta-analysis on 20 trialsconcluded that silicone gel sheets may prevent hypertrophic scar and keloid formation in scar-prone people with newly healed wounds; however, they commented that trial quality was poor. A recent review on 10 trials had similar conclusions. Regarding gels, a randomized controlled trialshowed that silicone gel reduces sternotomy scar pigmentation, erythema, hardness, height, and pain and itchiness. This was confirmed by a review. Regarding compression therapy, a meta-analysis of 12 trials confirmed that 15- to 25-mmHg compression therapy reduces burn scar thickness, erythema, and hardness.

All patients undergoing surgery on susceptible body areas should be monitored closely for hypertrophic scars and keloids for 3 to 12 months. If induration is observed, steroid tape and plaster should be started and replaced with steroid injection if the induration prevails.

### Low decorin expression along with inherent activation of ERK1, 2 in ear lobe keloids [^114p23Ws]. Burns (2009). Low credibility.

Over production of collagen and its abnormal assembly is the hallmark of abnormal scars such as keloids, a condition which reflects fibrosis of the skin. Fibrotic conditions of organs such as liver, lungs and eyes are characterized by low levels of decorin, a member of the small leucine proteoglycan family, which is an indispensable modulator of collagen assembly. Involvement of decorin in keloids is not well described, therefore, its expression in keloids was studied here. We showed low decorin levels in the total tissue extract of keloids as compared to normal skin. Further, we showed that this low level is due to reduced transcription of decorin by keloid fibroblasts. As decorin can also act as an intermediate signaling molecule involved in the ERK1,2 pathway, levels of both ERK1,2 and its activated counterpart were studied and found to be up-regulated in keloids. Through this study a novel attempt has been made to understand the implications of decorin expression and a possible cause of over production of collagen and its aberrant assembly in keloids is suggested.

### International clinical recommendations on scar management [^115r4D8Z]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Many techniques for management of hypertrophic scars and keloids have been proven through extensive use, but few have been supported by prospective studies with adequate control groups. Several new therapies showed good results in small-scale trials, but these have not been repeated in larger trials with long-term follow-up. This article reports a qualitative overview of the available clinical literature by an international panel of experts using standard methods of appraisal. The article provides evidence-based recommendations on prevention and treatment of abnormal scarring and, where studies are insufficient, consensus on best practice. The recommendations focus on the management of hypertrophic scars and keloids, and are internationally applicable in a range of clinical situations. These recommendations support a move to a more evidence-based approach in scar management. This approach highlights a primary role for silicone gel sheeting and intralesional corticosteroids in the management of a wide variety of abnormal scars. The authors concluded that these are the only treatments for which sufficient evidence exists to make evidence-based recommendations. A number of other therapies that are in common use have achieved acceptance by the authors as standard practice. However, it is highly desirable that many standard practices and new emerging therapies undergo large-scale studies with long-term follow-up before being recommended conclusively as alternative therapies for scar management.

### Inhibition as a novel therapeutic target for keloid disease [^114RvabM]. Advances in Wound Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Keloid disease, which is caused by impaired appropriate stop signals in wound healing processes, results in aberrant proliferation of dermal fibroblasts, inflammation, and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. The term "keloid" was coined in 1806 to describe the crab claw-like appearance of the scar and is strictly defined as scars that spread beyond the boundaries of the original wound and that do not regress spontaneously. In addition to a genetic predisposition, other factors such as skin tension, deregulated wound healing, immune dysfunction, abnormal apoptosis, and sebaceous gland density have been implicated in the etiology of keloid scarring. These pathogenic processes are mediated by complex signal transduction cascades that form crosstalk networks between many different signaling pathways, including the transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1)-Smad3 pathway, interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway, insulin-like growth factor pathway, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

The complexity of the wound-healing process and the lack of proper animal models for keloid scar formation have also restricted progress in research aimed at revealing these mechanisms. However, recent studies validated reliable humanized keloid implantation models using immunocompromised or immunocompetent animals. Considering that immune network between host and microenvironment is an important factor responsible for keloid disease, immunocompromised animal models lacking T cell or B cell immune responses may not recapitulate that of the original keloid immune response. Therefore, we adopted patient-derived keloid xenograft models with immunocompetent murine models to provide a more accurate reflection in this study.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases-1 (PARP-1) is the molecule involved in DNA repair, balance of cellular energetic pools, which culminates with necrosis and cell dysfunction, and expression of proinflammatory genes. In fact, overactivation of PARP-1 has been found in many physiological conditions, such as inflammatory injury, which are triggered by oxidative stress and DNA damage. Recently, therapeutic usefulness of PARP-1 has been implicated in several fibrotic conditions, such as liver, kidney, and lung, where PARP-1 inhibitors attenuate the disease progress and fibrotic detrimental effects.

### Molecular features of hypertrophic scars after thermal injury: is there a biologic basis for laser therapy? [^112dcey5]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Significance: Hypertrophic scars (HTS) and keloids are common after thermal injuries and other trauma to deep regions of dermis of the skin. These abnormal scars can cause contractures and the thick masses of scar tissue that result in functional and cosmetic impairment. Management of these dermal fibrotic conditions includes a wide range of medical and surgical treatments, which can be time consuming, only partially effective, and often uncomfortable for patients. Recent Advances: The molecular pathophysiology of HTS has become more understood over the past two decades, where thermal injury to the reticular dermis results in an inflammatory response, fibrogenic growth factor release, and the formation of a dermal scar with increased collagen and proteoglycan composition in an abnormal morphology. Lasers are becoming a widely used form of treatment for these types of scars; however, the evidence for the beneficial effects of laser treatments and the understanding of their mechanism of action are still evolving. Critical Issues: Paradoxically, laser delivery of thermal energy to the skin is suggested to improve scar remodeling and wound healing, yet HTS is a well-recognized complication of excessive thermal energy delivered by laser treatments. This review aims to examine the current evidence for the use of lasers for HTS, and to investigate the molecular mechanisms where re-injury of a burn scar from laser treatment could result in overall improvements in scar quality. Future Directions: Improved design of clinical trials for the treatment of scarring in the future will evolve from new methodology and models of HTS in animals and humans.

hypertrophic scar and keloid diagnosis

Differential Diagnosis

Hypertrophic scars and keloids are fibroproliferative disorders in the reticular dermis layer: this layer exhibits continuous inflammation, excessive angiogenesis, and abundant collagen accumulation. Compared to classic hypertrophic scars, classic keloids spread aggressively, rarely resolve spontaneously, and, at the histologic level, contain keloidal collagen, whereas hypertrophic scars only have nodules. However, many scars bear the clinical and pathologic features of both classic keloids and hypertrophic scars. This suggests that classic hypertrophic scars and keloids are polar manifestations of the same skin disorder, between which lies a spectrum of intermediate scars.

The clinical and histologic differences between classic hypertrophic scars and keloids probably reflect differences in the intensity and duration of reticular dermis inflammation. These differences in turn may reflect the presence and severity of local, systemic, genetic, and lifestyle risk factors.

International Differences in Hypertrophic Scar and Keloid Diagnosis

Classic keloids are strongly driven by genetics. – This partly explains ethnic differences in keloid susceptibility: keloids are common in Africans (5 to 10 percent are affected), less common in Asians (0.1 to 1 percent), and rare in Europeans/North Americans (< 0.1 percent).

These ethnic differences mean that physicians in certain regions have more experience with keloids than others. It is my impression, gained through attending many international scar conferences, that this can influence physician diagnoses. Thus, in Western countries, most abnormal scars are classic hypertrophic scars: consequently, Western physicians often diagnose scars as keloids if they exhibit minor spreading. However, African physicians see many patients with classic keloids: consequently, they often diagnose all scars as hypertrophic scars unless they grow rapidly. This should be taken into account when reviewing international literature.

Differential Diagnosis of Hypertrophic Scars and Keloids from Similarly Appearing Diseases

Hypertrophic scar and keloid diagnosis is often based on clinical features alone. However, malignant tumors such as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans – and giant-cell fibroblastomacan be misdiagnosed clinically as keloids. Moreover, analysis of 378 hypertrophic scars and keloids showed that 1.06 percent were other diseases. Thus, biopsy is warranted if malignancy is suspected. –

### Lesion site is the key prognostic factor for keloid patients receiving surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy [^117DbDBz]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

There is no well-established mechanism of keloid formation so far; as a consequence, this study assumes some hypotheses to explain why tumor location might play a role in keloid tumor recurrence. First, tension is known to be a risk factor for keloid formation. Ogawa et alpresented the recurrence rate of 38.3% in high-tension areas with adjuvant electron beam radiotherapy and 5.7% to 17.3% in other areas, which also provides clinical evidence that tension might play a role in diversity of recurrence. Second, different thickness of reticular dermis over different locations might affect keloid recurrence, because reticular dermis is where keloid-genic inflammatory cellular activities take place, and different thicknesses of reticular dermis might contain different amounts of keloid fibroblasts. Third, different properties of ECM or inflammation cells might have some impact on keloid recurrence. According to a study by Butzelaar et al, mechanical properties of skin vary with anatomic location and depend largely on composition of ECM. These differences are also found in vascularization and resident immune cell populations, and site-specific variations in ECM properties as well as macrophage numbers exist. They also found that predilection sites for keloid formation contain larger amounts of collagen compared with nonpredilection sites.

All the aforementioned reasons might play a role in the mechanism of keloid formation. Finally, different activity of fibroblasts from different body sites might affect keloid recurrence. Previous studies have shown that keloid fibroblast is more sensitive to inflammatory factors than normal skin fibroblast. To find whether different activity of fibroblasts from different body sites exists, we compared cell survival of keloid fibroblasts from our patients with normal fibroblast by the MTT method after irradiation to culture medium, which showed higher survival rate for normal fibroblast. Keloid fibroblasts were found to be more radiosensitive than normal fibroblasts, indicating that difference of radiosensitivity exists between fibroblasts. The authors are now collecting keloid fibroblasts from different body sites in an attempt to determine whether fibroblasts from different body sites play a role in keloid recurrence while also trying to find the specific proper radiation dose for keloid over different body sites.

### Combining scar-modulating agents for the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a systematic review [^115pvsCj]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Injury to the skin can cause abnormal wound healing and continuous inflammation that leads to the formation of hypertrophic scars and keloids. These lesions often cause significant negative impact on a patient's life due to aesthetic, physical, social, and psychological consequences. Numerous treatment modalities exist for these hypertrophic scars and keloids, which include silicone sheeting, pressure garments, intralesional injection/topical application of scar-modulating agents, laser therapy, and surgical excision. Due to increased efficacy, an evolving treatment paradigm encourages the use of multiple treatment modalities instead of one treatment modality. However, no gold standard treatment exists for these lesions, leaving many people with unsatisfactory results. Adding scar-modulating agents such as 5-Fluorouracil, bleomycin, or Botulinum Toxin A to triamcinolone monotherapy has emerged as a potential drug combination for treating hypertrophic scars and keloids. We sought to critically analyze the evidence that exists for the use of more than one scar-modulating agent. This was done by conducting a systematic review to determine the efficacy of these combined drug regimens. We found that many of these combinations show evidence of increased efficacy and fewer/similar adverse events to triamcinolone monotherapy. Triamcinolone and 5-Fluorouracil showed the strongest and most consistent evidence out of all combinations. With this review, we intend to encourage more research into unique drug combinations that may improve outcomes for patients with symptomatic hypertrophic scars or keloids.

### Cellular and molecular mechanisms of repair in acute and chronic wound healing [^116MR8ks]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Figure 3
Excessive fibrosis. Scars, formed in part as a consequence of inflammatory signals, are comprised of collagen deposited in thick orientated bundles rather than the basket-weave-like fibrils found in normal dermis. Hypertrophic scars have excessive collagen deposition, leading to a raised surface that partially resolves over time. In contrast, keloid scars have thicker collagen bundles, extend beyond the original wound margin and rarely regress. Contractile myofibroblasts are prevalent in hypertrophic scarring but all but are absent in keloid tissue. Keloids can also be characterized by occluded blood vessels. OPN, osteopontin; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β.

Both hypertrophic scars and keloids are major therapeutic challenges for surgeons and dermatologists. Although multiple treatment regimens are practised, including silicone gel sheeting, pressure therapy, corticosteroids, cryotherapy, 5-fluorouracil, laser therapy and radiation, none of these is optimal and effective, and therapeutics based on molecular targets have not yet gone beyond clinical trials. Novel therapies for the treatment of cutaneous pathological scarring can potentially be extrapolated from clinical trials targeting fibrosis in other organs including lung, liver and kidney. Although tissue-specific features of fibrogenesis appear to exist, there is increasing appreciation of common pathways of fibrosis that are conserved among tissues, including TGF-β, connective tissue growth factor, interleukins 4 and 13, platelet-derived growth factor and osteopontin. Perhaps the closest to therapeutic treatments for blocking scarring in the skin have been the various approaches used to modulate TGF-β1/2 signalling immediately following wounding, either by blocking receptor activation or by addition of the competing ligand TGF-β3 to the wound. Approaches such as these will eventually lead to scar-blocking therapeutics in the clinic.

### Levels of evidence for the treatment of keloid disease [^114NcND7]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Keloid disease presents a significant burden for patients and a significant therapeutic challenge for clinicians. Multiple treatments have been proposed, but with the increasing drive towards effective use of resources, therapeutic options need to be evaluated in terms of the levels of evidence supporting their use.

Aim

To retrieve and review the primary clinical studies evaluating keloid disease therapy over the last 25 years and assign levels of evidence for the treatment modalities evaluated.

Method

A Medline search was conducted to identify all primary clinical studies evaluating the treatment of keloid disease, published in English since 1980 (excluding single case reports). Studies were assigned a level of evidence (LOE-1, highest quality to LOE-5, lowest) adapted from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine.

Results

13 (12%) of 112 studies retrieved were assigned LOE-2, 99 (88%) assigned LOE-4. There were no LOE-1 studies. Ten of the LOE-2 studies evaluated silicone-based therapy or laser therapy. Most studies evaluating steroids, cryosurgery, laser therapy and post-surgical adjuvant therapy provide level 4 evidence.

Conclusion

High quality research in evaluating keloid therapy is lacking. There is a definite need for well designed and properly reported randomised controlled trials, to provide clinicians with a sound body of evidence on which to inform decision making.

### Adjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy improves outcomes for resected complex keloids [^116N9PEs]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Keloids are cutaneous lesions formed from abnormal wound healing secondary to excessive fibroblast function, resulting in excess tissue proliferation and disorganized collagen. Although benign, keloids may be physically disfiguring, symptomatic, debilitating, and have a significant psychologic impact, especially in the head and neck region. Keloids differ from other scars in their propensity to extend beyond the borders of the initial injury. Although monotherapy, including surgical resection, laser ablation, intralesional injections, and pressure therapy can be effective, many patients experience local recurrence despite these interventions.

For multiple recurrent keloids, the combination of resection/ablation and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) can dramatically reduce recurrence rates from nearly 100% to as low as 15%. Large and anatomically complex keloids present a technical challenge, with traditional superficial radiation techniques resulting in unfavorable radiation dose distribution, with resultant undercoverage of the target volume and/or excess dose to adjacent organs at risk. For these patients, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can provide homogeneous conformal coverage of the target volume while maximally sparing normal tissue. Here we report our experience with IMRT in the treatment of complex keloids following resection or ablation.

### Association of hidradenitis suppurativa and keloid formation: a therapeutic challenge [^111SiUZR]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Biologic therapy may also play a role in the management of keloid in the setting of HS. TNF-α induces nuclear factor κB, which is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of keloids by stimulating fibroblast proliferation. Intralesional etanercept (anti–TNF-α) has been shown to reduce pruritus and size of keloids. However, the role of biologics in reduction of keloid size could be linked to early control of inflammation, which will decrease the risk of keloid formation and also help decrease the bulk of keloid mass containing inflammatory lesions.

While this article is, to our knowledge, the largest study described in the literature, our ability to make concrete treatment recommendations for combined HS and keloid lesions is difficult. We recommend a trial of biologic therapy and/or intralesional corticosteroid injection especially in the setting of ongoing inflammation. We hypothesize that the HS-triggered acute inflammation, which leads to scar formation and subsequent keloid, may resolve.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids: a 2020 update of the algorithms published 10 years ago [^114uoaKk]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In 2010, this Journal published my review on hypertrophic scars and keloids and the treatment and prevention algorithms for these refractory scars. Since then, many randomized controlled trials on pathologic scar management and guidelines – have been published. To reflect these considerable advancements, I have reprised my review and the algorithms (Figs. 1 and 2).

Fig. 1.
Treatment algorithm for hypertrophic scars (HSs). The scar should first be assessed for the degree of scar contracture. If the contracture is severe, surgery that releases the contracture is the first choice. If the contracture is mild, the scar can be resected completely; however, nonsurgical multimodal therapy is also a choice.

Fig. 2.
Treatment algorithm for keloids. The selected treatment method for keloids depends on whether the keloids are small and single or large and multiple. Small and single keloids can be treated radically by surgery with adjuvant therapy (including radiation therapy); alternatively, they could be treated with nonsurgical multimodal therapy. For large and multiple keloids, volume- and number-reduction surgery is a choice.

### New uses of abobotulinumtoxinA in aesthetics [^115CEUXx]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The precise mechanisms underlying the formation of HS and keloids are not fully understood, and this makes their management difficult. Facial scarring can have profound psychological effects on patients. In one US study, 91% of patients said that they would value even small improvements in scarring. Conventional options for the management of HS and keloids include intralesional corticosteroid injections, surgery, cryotherapy, pressure therapy, radiotherapy, laser therapy, and application of silicone gel sheeting.

### A scoping review of the methodology used in studies of genetic influences on the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children after acute wounding [^111k1RsU]. Advances in Wound Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Risk factors for hypertrophic scarring include young age, bacterial wound infection, anatomical area, skin tension, and the size and depth of the injury. Some studies have also reported a greater risk of hypertrophic scarring in individuals with darker skin. Keloids usually present in younger patientsand are more common in individuals of African, Hispanic, and Asian descent. The varied incidence in ethnic populations, evidence of familial heritability, and presence in twins suggest that there may be a genetic susceptibility to keloid scarring.

Genetic epidemiology is the study of the role of inherited factors in disease etiology. Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have identified genetic variants that are associated with the development of disease in clinical areas, including type 2 diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and schizophrenia. To date, there has only been a small body of research on the genetic variants of scarring.

This scoping review aims to identify and summarize the methodology used in studies of genetic associations with the development of keloid or hypertrophic scarring in adults and children after acute wounding.

### Epigenetic modification mechanisms involved in keloid: current status and prospect [^113EKQJA]. Clinical Epigenetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, there still are some challenges to the epigenetics modification in keloid. Firstly, the current studies mainly focus on the expression verification of clinical samples and in vitro cellular experiments, lacking enough in vivo animal studies. As keloid is unique to humans, adequate animal models will benefit the research aimed at prevention and effective therapeutic intervention. However, the existing animal models, including keloid scar implantation models and rabbit ear hyperplastic scar models, cannot totally, accurately reflect the disease characteristics of human keloid. The differences in human skin physiology and healing methods pose challenges to the keloid modeling of laboratory animals. Future animal models may utilize humanized mice with an immune system reconstructed using human immune cells, which might enable investigation of complex interactions between systemic and local factors that combine to promote keloid scar formation.

It is now explicit that mechanobiology forces are important in the degree of keloid formation, keloid contracture, and abnormal keloid progression. Additionally, the scientific basis and clinical evidence supporting the perspective that high mechanical loading resulting in ECM misalignment, proliferation and activation of fibroblasts, and, ultimately, excessive collagen production. For example, previous research by Dohi et al. has determined that keloid tends to occur in specific anatomical regions with high mechanical loading, including the anterior chest, shoulder, scapular, and suprapubic regions. Through establishing a novel stretched scar model in rats, Zhou et al. found that scars could be generated by repeatedly and continuously applying mechanical forces on the edge of an incisional wound, and higher mechanical strain-induced significantly severer keloid progression. Interestingly, we believe that epigenetics modification is involved in the mechanical regulation of keloid progression and functions. For example, Wang et al. found that wound edges treated by miR-21 antagomir have obvious wound contraction defects with impaired collagen deposition in the early stage of wound healing. The study by Chen et al. also confirmed that the miR-21 could preserve the fibrotic mechanical memory in cells cultured on stiff substrates through regulating the acutely mechanosensitive myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A/MLK-1). The above results provided direct evidence that miR-21 might be a mechanical sensitivity regulator in wound closure and the formation of keloids. However, in addition to miR-21, in terms of the direct relationship of epigenetic factors and mechanobiology factors in the keloid, there still seems to be a lack of enough evidence. It is still a research gap worthy of further investigation, which will help a comprehensive understanding of the process of wound healing, hypertrophic scar formation, and skin regeneration. Therefore, the mechanical force, epigenetics modification, and keloid formation, the relationship among the three is meaningful to be discussed in-depth in future research.

### Blaschkoid hyperkeratotic plaques in a hemi-distribution since infancy [^1127Tuy3]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 3: The patient noted difficulty healing and that upon injury to the lesion, wounds would heal thicker, rougher, and darker. What is the significance of this statement?
A. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation
B. Koebner phenomenon
C. Keloid formation
D. Scar formation
E. SCC
Answers:
A. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation – Incorrect. Common reaction of body to inflammation or injury however does not commonly result in thicker and rougher lesions.
B. Koebner phenomenon – Correct. The Koebner phenomenon is defined as spreading of the lesion to uninvolved skin through trauma, dermatoses, or therapeutics. The patient most likely was experiencing spread of her linear porokeratosis after trauma to unaffected skin. The Koebner phenomenon has been described in many dermatologic disease, one of which includes porokeratosis of Mibelli and disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis. No reported cases of Koebnerization have been reported with linear porokeratosis, but this is likely a phenomenon as with other subtypes of porokeratosis.
C. Keloid formation – Incorrect. Keloids are overgrowth of scar tissue that exceeds the scar margins. Keloids can heal thicker and darker but are typically smooth and firm in nature. Our patient did not have any history of keloid formation.
D. Scar formation – Incorrect. Scar formation is a definite possibility, but usually scars are not initially pigmented or rough.
E. SCC – Incorrect. SCCs are more likely to result in those patients with linear porokeratosis; however, the description does not coincide with a typical description of SCC. SCCs have multiple presentations but usually present as a hyperkeratotic, erythematous papule or nodule that may ulcerate.

### Promoted activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in keloid fibroblasts and increased expression of MMP-2 in collagen bundle regions: implications for mechanisms of keloid progression [^116Kiosx]. Histopathology (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Keloid is characterized by excessive deposition of collagen, resulting from aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) production and degradation. The aim was to investigate the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in pathological wound healing in keloids.

Methods and Results

Semiquantitative analysis of 60 keloid tissue samples and 25 mature scar tissue samples demonstrated significantly increased expression of MMP-2, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 in keloids compared with mature scars. Within keloid regions, MMP-2 expression was significantly higher in collagen bundle regions than in non-collagen bundle regions. Double immunofluorescence revealed that keloid fibroblasts between collagen bundles exhibited MMP-2, TIMP-2 and membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) co-expression, whereas only MMP-2 expression was evident on the edge of collagen bundles. Western blot analysis and gelatin zymography of 13 keloid-derived fibroblasts (KFbs) and six normal skin dermal-derived fibroblasts (NFbs) demonstrated that unstimulated KFbs exhibited significantly increased MMP-2 activity and expression compared with NFbs under the same conditions.

Conclusions

These results together indicate that MMP-2 activity can be promoted in keloid fibroblasts between collagen bundles in cooperation with TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP. This could contribute to remodelling of collagen bundle regions and invasion of fibroblasts into peripheral normal regions through promoted degradation of ECM.

### Management of chest keloids [^1179ZbaY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Keloid formation is one of the most challenging clinical problems in wound healing. With increasing frequency of open heart surgery, chest keloid formations are not infrequent in the clinical practice. The numerous treatment methods including surgical excision, intralesional steroid injection, radiation therapy, laser therapy, silicone gel sheeting, and pressure therapy underscore how little is understood about keloids. Keloids have a tendency to recur after surgical excision as a single treatment. Stretching tension is clearly associated with keloid generation, as keloids tend to occur on high tension sites such as chest region. The authors treated 58 chest keloid patients with surgical excision followed by intraoperative and postoperative intralesional steroid injection. Even with minor complications and recurrences, our protocol results in excellent outcomes in cases of chest keloids.

### Laser therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars [^113FMBuS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertrophic and keloid scars are common skin conditions resulting from abnormal wound healing. They can cause itching, pain and have a negative physical and psychological impact on patients' lives. Different approaches are used aiming to improve these scars, including intralesional corticosteroids, surgery and more recently, laser therapy. Since laser therapy is expensive and may have adverse effects, it is critical to evaluate the potential benefits and harms of this therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars.

Objectives

To assess the effects of laser therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars.

Search Methods

In March 2021 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL EBSCO Plus and LILACS. To identify additional studies, we also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses, and health technology reports. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for treating hypertrophic or keloid scars (or both), comparing laser therapy with placebo, no intervention or another intervention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted the data, assessed the risk of bias of included studies and carried out GRADE assessments to assess the certainty of evidence. A third review author arbitrated if there were disagreements.

Main Results

We included 15 RCTs, involving 604 participants (children and adults) with study sample sizes ranging from 10 to 120 participants (mean 40.27). Where studies randomised different parts of the same scar, each scar segment was the unit of analysis (906 scar segments). The length of participant follow-up varied from 12 weeks to 12 months. All included trials had a high risk of bias for at least one domain: all studies were deemed at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel. The variability of intervention types, controls, follow-up periods and limitations with report data meant we pooled data for one comparison (and only two outcomes within this). Several review secondary outcomes - cosmesis, tolerance, preference for different modes of treatment, adherence, and change in quality of life - were not reported in any of the included studies. Laser versus no treatment: We found low-certainty evidence suggesting there may be more hypertrophic and keloid scar improvement (that is scars are less severe) in 585-nm pulsed-dye laser (PDL) -treated scars compared with no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11 to 3.45; two studies, 60 scar segments). It is unclear whether non-ablative fractional laser (NAFL) impacts on hypertrophic scar severity when compared with no treatment (very low-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether fractional carbon dioxide (CO₂) laser impacts on hypertrophic and keloid scar severity compared with no treatment (very low-certainty evidence). Eight studies reported treatment-related adverse effects but did not provide enough data for further analyses. Laser versus other treatments: We are uncertain whether treatment with 585-nm PDL impacts on hypertrophic and keloid scar severity compared with intralesional corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), intralesional Fluorouracil (5-FU) or combined use of TAC plus 5-FU (very low-certainty evidence). It is also uncertain whether erbium laser impacts on hypertrophic scar severity when compared with TAC (very low-certainty evidence). Other comparisons included 585-nm PDL versus silicone gel sheeting, fractional CO₂ laser versus TAC and fractional CO₂ laser versus verapamil. However, the authors did not report enough data regarding the severity of scars to compare the interventions. As only very low-certainty evidence is available on treatment-related adverse effects, including pain, charring (skin burning so that the surface becomes blackened), telangiectasia (a condition in which tiny blood vessels cause thread-like red lines on the skin), skin atrophy (skin thinning), purpuric discolorations, hypopigmentation (skin colour becomes lighter), and erosion (loss of part of the top layer of skin, leaving a denuded surface) secondary to blistering, we are not able to draw conclusions as to how these treatments compare. Laser plus other treatment versus other treatment: It is unclear whether 585-nm PDL plus TAC plus 5-FU leads to a higher percentage of good to excellent improvement in hypertrophic and keloid scar severity compared with TAC plus 5-FU, as the certainty of evidence has been assessed as very low. Due to very low-certainty evidence, it is also uncertain whether CO₂ laser plus TAC impacts on keloid scar severity compared with cryosurgery plus TAC. The evidence is also very uncertain about the effect of neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser plus intralesional corticosteroid diprospan plus 5-FU on scar severity compared with diprospan plus 5-FU and about the effect of helium-neon (He-Ne) laser plus decamethyltetrasiloxane, polydimethylsiloxane and cyclopentasiloxane cream on scar severity compared with decamethyltetrasiloxane, polydimethylsiloxane and cyclopentasiloxane cream. Only very low-certainty evidence is available on treatment-related adverse effects, including pain, atrophy, erythema, telangiectasia, hypopigmentation, regrowth, hyperpigmentation (skin colour becomes darker), and depigmentation (loss of colour from the skin). Therefore, we are not able to draw conclusions as to how these treatments compare. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of laser therapy for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars. The available information is also insufficient to perform a more accurate analysis on treatment-related adverse effects related to laser therapy. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, conflicting results, study design issues and small sample sizes, further high-quality trials, with validated scales and core outcome sets should be developed. These trials should take into consideration the consumers' opinion and values, the need for long-term follow-up and the necessity of reporting the rate of recurrence of scars to determine whether lasers may achieve superior results when compared with other therapies for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars.

### New therapies for the management of keloids [^116rLd33]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

A broad range of therapeutics is currently available for the treatment of keloids, but none have been shown to be completely effective in flattening existing keloids, reducing associated symptoms or preventing recurrence. Therefore, newer treatments not routinely used for keloids have been examined more recently, including laser therapy, intralesional interferon and imiquimod, which have had variable success as therapies for keloids. This article briefly reviews such experimental data and presents recommendations for management of keloids as well.

### The most current algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids [^113kA6wz]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Previous reports on the treatment of hypertrophic scars and keloids have not described clear algorithms for multimodal therapies. This article presents an evidence-based review of previous articles and proposes algorithms for the treatment and prevention of hypertrophic scars and keloids.

Methods

The methodologic quality of the clinical trials was evaluated, and the baseline characteristics of the patients and the interventions that were applied and their outcomes were extracted.

Results

Important factors that promote hypertrophic scar/keloid development include mechanical forces on the wound, wound infection, and foreign body reactions. For keloids, the treatment method that should be used depends on whether scar contractures (especially joint contractures) are present and whether the keloids are small and single, or large and multiple. Small and single keloids can be treated radically by surgery with adjuvant therapy (which includes radiation or corticosteroid injections) or by nonsurgical monotherapy (which includes corticosteroid injections, cryotherapy, laser, and antitumor/immunosuppressive agents such as 5-fluorouracil). Large and multiple keloids are difficult to treat radically and are currently only treatable by multimodal therapies that aim to relieve symptoms. After a sequence of treatments, long-term follow-up is recommended. Conservative therapies, which include gel sheeting, taping fixation, compression therapy, external and internal agents, and makeup (camouflage) therapy, should be administered on a case-by-case basis.

Conclusions

The increase in the number of randomized controlled trials over the past decade has greatly improved scar management, although these studies suffer from various limitations. The hypertrophic scar/keloid treatment algorithms that are currently available are likely to be significantly improved by future high-quality clinical trials.

### Effects of dupilumab on keloid stabilization and prevention [^115nDUVZ]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

These cases demonstrate improvement in symptoms of keloids (itch, pain) and allowed our first patient's keloids to be more amenable to intralesional triamcinolone treatment. Our second patient with ongoing acne was able to prevent new keloids from forming with the addition of dupilumab. To our knowledge, this is the first case where dupilumab was used as an adjunctive therapy to radiation (Patient 1). It is also, according to our understanding, the first reported case of keloid prevention with the use of dupilumab (Patient 2). Patient 1 has been treated for over 11 months with no relapses. This is the longest treatment time with dupilumab for keloids that we are aware of, and patients continue to be monitored at follow ups.

Many questions remain following these cases. As Wong and Songnoted in their case report, the duration of treatment with dupilumab for keloids is yet to be determined. It is uncertain if the atopic dermatitis dosing regimen is optimal for keloids. Perhaps a different dosing schedule would be more appropriate based on keloid severity, patient ethnicity, duration of keloids, or prior radiation.

Interestingly, both patients report that if they are noncompliant with their injections, they quickly begin feeling symptoms of pain and pruritus within a week of missing their dose. This is similar to the sudden onset of pruritus felt in our atopic dermatology population after a missed dose. Further research needs to be conducted to determine the optimal duration of dupilumab and the likelihood of symptoms returning upon discontinuation. Both of our patients are continuing to improve and have no desire to change their injections at this time.

Additional research is also needed to determine who might benefit from Th2 inflammation suppression for keloid prevention. With the initiation of dupilumab, our second patient stopped making new keloids even though her acne periodically flared. If used prior to surgery in high-risk areas or those prone to keloids, could we prevent keloid formation? And, for how long would the dupilumab need to be continued?

Clinical trials are currently being conducted to evaluate the use of dupilumab in reducing keloid size and distensibility. This research protocol will also sample the non-lesional skin of its subjects to begin developing a better understanding of preventing new keloid lesion formation. We encourage researchers to continue seeking an understanding of Th2 inflammation. It is encouraging that new approaches to the unmet need for keloid treatment and prevention are finding new life in this novel pathway.

### Management of chest keloids [^112D9C44]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Keloids are relatively resistant to treatment, with high recurrence rates using a single treatment modality. Keloids have a tendency to recur after surgical excision as a single treatment, with rates approximately up to 80–100%. Keloids can arise from skin trauma and must be removed through skin truma. Therein lies the challenge of treatment, where recurrence would seem inevitable. Surgical excision is considered as a kind of skin trauma and it promotes additional collagen synthesis, resulting in regrowth and even larger keloids. This is why we were focused on the article recently published in your esteemed journal by Patel et al. that dealt with the challenging topic of chest keloids.

### Is there an ideal animal model to study hypertrophic scarring? [^116GHEV7]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2008). Low credibility.

Wound healing in hypertrophic scarring and keloid animal models presents significant differences when compared with humans. A brief review is presented about hypertrophic scarring in animal models during the last 5 years. Models were described by animals and scientific artifices to cause hypertrophic scarring. They were divided into 1) heterologous hypertrophic scarring or keloid implants in immunodeficient animals (athymic mice and rats); 2) heterologous hypertrophic scarring or keloid implant in immune privileged site (hamster cheek pouch); 3) hypertrophic scarring or keloid induction via chemically mediated injury (guinea pigs); 4) hypertrophic scarring or keloid induction in anatomic specific site (rabbit ear); and the 5) porcine model. The ideal model would allow to research pathophysiology, histology, and molecular events during time and to test prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for humans. Some of these animals were useful to study specific steps of the scarring process and better understand abnormal wound healing, but none of them have a widespread use. Most recently, the female red Duroc pigs were validated as a new model, demonstrating its similarity to human conditions in different ways. Full-thickness human skin grafts in nude mice also represent improvement in the search of an ideal hypertrophic scarring animal model.

### Multi-omics analysis to explore the molecular mechanisms related to keloid [^113x3qeD]. Burns (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Keloid is a benign skin tumor that result from abnormal wound healing and excessive collagen deposition. The pathogenesis is believed to be linked to genetic predisposition and immune imbalance, although the precise mechanisms remain poorly understood. Current therapeutic approaches may not consistently yield satisfactory outcomes and are often accompanied by potential side effects and risks. The high recurrence rate and refractory nature of keloid nodules present significant challenges and uncertainties in their management. Given the lack of effective treatment strategies, it is essential to identify key molecular pathways and potential therapeutic targets for keloid.

Objective

This study aimed to identify the potential pathogenic mechanisms, hub genes, and immune cell involvement in keloid formation, with the goal of providing novel insights for targeted therapies.

Methods

We utilized a combination of bulk RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression profiles in keloid tissues. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and subjected to pathway enrichment analysis to reveal key biological processes involved in keloid pathogenesis. Mendelian randomization was performed to investigate the causal relationship between genetic factors and keloid formation, identifying potential hub genes. Immune infiltration analysis was conducted to determine the role of specific immune cells in keloid development. Subsequently, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) were performed to investigate the functional pathways associated with the hub genes. Network analysis was employed to identify transcription factors, miRNAs, and potential drugs in the Connectivity Map associated with the hub genes. Single-cell RNA sequencing was also used to identify cell-specific expression patterns of these genes.

Results

Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted the association of keloid pathogenesis with cell proliferation and division, providing insights into the molecular processes involved. Mendelian randomization revealed that DUSP1 acts as an inhibitor of keloid formation, while HOXA5 promotes keloid pathogenesis. Immune infiltration analysis suggested that mast cells and macrophages play critical roles in the disease's progression. Based on hub gene analysis, the IL17 signaling pathway emerged as a key pathway implicated in keloid development. Further drug prediction models identified 9-methyl-5H-6-thia-4, 5-diaza-chrysene-6, 6-dioxide, zebularine, temozolomide and valproic acid targeting these hub genes.

Conclusion

DUSP1 and HOXA5 are hub genes in keloid pathogenesis, with DUSP1 acting as an inhibitor and HOXA5 as a promoter of disease progression. Targeting the regulatory networks associated with these genes could provide novel therapeutic strategies. Mast cells and macrophages are identified as critical immune cell types involved in the disease process. Additionally, the IL17 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in keloid development, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. These findings suggest that a multi-target approach focusing on these pathways could offer effective treatment options for keloid patients.

### The interplay of mechanical stress, strain, and stiffness at the keloid periphery correlates with increased caveolin-1 / ROCK signaling and scar progression [^116pRqZ8]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fibroproliferative disorders result in excessive scar formation, are associated with high morbidity, and cost billions of dollars every year. Of these, keloid disease presents a particularly challenging clinical problem because the cutaneous scars progress beyond the original site of injury. Altered mechanotransduction has been implicated in keloid development, but the mechanisms governing scar progression into the surrounding tissue remain unknown. The role of mechanotransduction in keloids is further complicated by the differential mechanical properties of keloids and the surrounding skin.

Methods

The authors used human mechanical testing, finite element modeling, and immunohistologic analyses of human specimens to clarify the complex interplay of mechanical stress, strain, and stiffness in keloid scar progression.

Results

Changes in human position (i.e., standing, sitting, and supine) are correlated to dynamic changes in local stress/strain distribution, particularly in regions with a predilection for keloids. Keloids are composed of stiff tissue, which displays a fibrotic phenotype with relatively low proliferation. In contrast, the soft skin surrounding keloids is exposed to high mechanical strain that correlates with increased expression of the caveolin-1/rho signaling via rho kinase mechanotransduction pathway and elevated inflammation and proliferation, which may lead to keloid progression.

Conclusions

The authors conclude that changes in human position are strongly correlated with mechanical loading of the predilection sites, which leads to increased mechanical strain in the peripheral tissue surrounding keloids. Furthermore, increased mechanical strain in the peripheral tissue, which is the site of keloid progression, was correlated with aberrant expression of caveolin-1/ROCK signaling pathway. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for keloid progression.

### Comorbidities of keloid and hypertrophic scars among participants in UK biobank… [^1144fdhA]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance This cross-sectional study validated comorbidities of excessive scarring in UKB with comprehensive coverage of health outcomes. It also documented additional phenome-wide associations that will serve as a reference for future studies to investigate common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. Keloids and hypertrophic scars are chronic disfiguring manifestations of excessive cutaneous wound healing considered prototypic of skin fibrosis. 1–3 Whether they are distinct entities or a quantitative extreme of normal wound scars remains an active area of debate. 4 Both conditions involve excess extracellular matrix deposition and raised scar tissue, but unique to keloids are horizontal expansion of scars and absence of clinical regression. Common to both are high symptom burden5, 6 and lack of universally effective treatment. 7, 8.

In this study, we comprehensively assessed disease associations of keloids or hypertrophic scars in UK Biobank, a multicenter population-based longitudinal observational study of more than 500 000 participants including more than 950 with a diagnosis of excessive scarring. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses for previously studied comorbidities across several ethnic groups and carried out a phenome-wide association study over a wide range of systematically defined diseases. Finally, to formally assess these differences, we fitted a full logistic regression model incorporating an interaction between excessive scarring status and ethnicity, finding statistical evidence for ethnicity-specific effect sizes in the case of hypertension in Black participants. 54 The association of keloid with skin cancer has been previously reported.

10 Although plausible reasons have been proposed, including similar bioenergetics 55, 56 and signaling pathways including TGFβ/Smad57–59 and Wnt/beta-Catenin, 60–63 this finding is interpreted cautiously, again considering the risk of ascertainment bias. The associations with musculoskeletal disorders may support the observation of chondrogenic misdifferentiation in keloids64 and the shared significance of TGFβ in joint pathologies. 65, 66 Interestingly, associations with pain symptoms spanned disease categories.

### Clinical genetics of familial keloids… [^115aeU7K]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

The pattern of inheritance observed in these families is consistent with an autosomal dominant mode with incomplete clinical penetrance and variable expression. This is the most comprehensive collection of keloid families described to date, and it allows for the first time the elucidation of the clinical genetic characteristics of the familial form of this wound-healing disorder. KELOIDS ARE proliferative fibrous growths that result from an excessive tissue response to skin trauma. Keloids frequently persist at the site of injury, often recur after excision, 1 and always overgrow the boundaries of the original wound manifested by invasion of clinically normal skin.
2. In some cases, histological specimens from keloids of affected family members were obtained. Here, the clinical diagnosis was confirmed histologically, using standard hematoxylin-eosin staining procedures. Keloids contain large, thick collagen fibers composed of numerous fibrils closely packed together.

The collagen fibers in keloids appear thicker and more irregular than in normal dermis. We collected venous blood samples, extracted genomic DNA, and performed linkage analysis as previously described.
8. Another hypothesis suggests that further mutations, in addition to the inherited predisposition, are required for the formation of keloids. Somatic mutations in the tumor suppressor p53, for instance, have been identified in sporadic keloids. 23 This implies that the inherited predisposition for keloids might also contribute to the formation of malignancies. The clinical severity of keloid formation differs between families, as well as within a family. We frequently found the variation in severity to range from small earlobe keloids to severe keloids affecting large areas of the body. Some individuals within a single family developed keloids on a single site, whereas others presented with multiple keloids affecting mainly the chest and shoulder region.

Interestingly, individuals with very large keloids were seen only in the African American families. The high incidence of keloids in different populations, variable onset of disease, variable expression, and variable responses to different treatments suggest that more than 1 gene might be involved in keloid pathogenesis. These genes might be part of the same or of different pathways involved in proliferation or apoptosis. Possible locus heterogeneity represents an additional challenge to any efforts to identify keloid gene mutations, but the number of pedigrees described here and the size of some of them should make it possible to map several loci for keloids.
