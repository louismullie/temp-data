## Question

New diabetes treatment guidelines

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the new diabetes treatment guidelines, with emphasis on the 2025 ADA Standards of Care and related consensus updates. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative sources and confirm the scope of "new" in 2025. Then, I should verify foundational principles that persist versus what has changed. Next, I will examine type 2 diabetes pharmacotherapy, including first-line therapy, combination strategies, and cardiorenal-driven selections. After that, I need to check glycemic targets and individualization, including older adults. Then, I will review type 1 diabetes updates, technology, and monitoring. Finally, I should consider special populations, implementation, and synthesize a practical clinical algorithm with attention to cost and equity, while double-checking areas of controversy and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the primary sources and scope. The 2025 ADA Standards of Care in Diabetes is the anchor document updated annually by the ADA Professional Practice Committee, and it explicitly integrates pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment, individualized care, and cardiorenal risk stratification, which frames the "new" elements clinicians should apply now [^111Va9kA] [^116uW7GJ]. I should also cross-check with the 2022 ADA/EASD consensus and the 2023 ESC cardiovascular guidance, since these shape cardiometabolic-first strategies and are reflected in the 2025 Standards, and I will keep in mind the VA/DoD 2023 CPG for U.S. system-level practice patterns and target ranges [^112k5cHt] [^116dSSUe] [^114PdFx9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to verify what is truly new versus enduring. The core principles persisting include metformin as foundational therapy when not contraindicated, lifestyle and DSMES as first-line, shared decision-making, and individualized A1C targets, which remain unchanged in essence but are continually refined in emphasis and operationalization [^117H4U9h] [^114JZZer]. What is new is a stronger push for early combination therapy to shorten time-to-target, explicit integration of cardiorenal benefit into initial agent selection, routine assessment of cost and social determinants, and a more structured approach to deintensification and hypoglycemia risk mitigation, all of which are codified in the 2025 Standards and related ADA publications [^116WNWFw] [^115JRcg9] [^11173599].

> I will now examine type 2 diabetes pharmacotherapy initiation. Wait, let me verify the first-line stance: metformin remains preferred initial therapy unless contraindicated, with the rationale of efficacy, safety, low hypoglycemia, weight neutrality, and cost-effectiveness, and this is reinforced by AACE and the Canadian 2024 update as well as ADA 2025 [^117H4U9h] [^111qNBNG]. But I should confirm the shift toward combination starts; yes, ADA 2025 supports considering combination therapy at initiation to reach individualized goals faster, and Diabetes Canada recommends combination when A1C is markedly elevated, which operationalizes early dual therapy in practice [^116WNWFw] [^112Vy4C8].

> Next, I should review cardiorenal-driven therapy selection. For established ASCVD or high risk, a GLP-1 RA with proven cardiovascular benefit or an SGLT2 inhibitor is recommended independent of baseline A1C, and for CKD or heart failure, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is prioritized; these are longstanding positions from 2018–2022 consensus that are reiterated and operationalized in 2025, and the ESC 2023 guidance aligns by individualizing A1C while prioritizing agents with cardiorenal benefit [^114rkHe5] [^116dSSUe] [^113ayVRd]. Let me double-check the scope of eligibility; CDC modeling suggests roughly 82% of U.S. adults with T2D could meet criteria for GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor use under these risk-based recommendations, underscoring broad applicability but also the cost barrier that guidelines now explicitly address [^1122m9GD].

> I need to ensure I articulate the role of foundational agents beyond metformin. Metformin should be continued as long as tolerated and not contraindicated, including in combination with newer agents, given its favorable risk–benefit and potential microbiome-mediated effects; thiazolidinediones and sulfonylureas remain options, particularly when cost is a barrier, but with attention to edema/heart failure risk for TZDs and hypoglycemia risk for sulfonylureas, which ADA 2025 acknowledges in its cost-conscious recommendations [^117H4U9h] [^115Kx4cT]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied sulfonylureas are broadly de-emphasized; that's too strong — ADA still includes them among lower-cost options, but guidelines advise minimizing hypoglycemia-prone regimens when possible, which is the more precise statement [^115Kx4cT] [^11173599].

> Let me consider insulin therapy and deintensification. ADA 2025 advises that when insulin is initiated, background glucose-lowering agents with cardiometabolic or renal benefits should generally be continued unless contraindicated, and that regimens with higher hypoglycemia risk should be reassessed and down-titrated when harms outweigh benefits within individualized goals, which operationalizes a safety-first approach during intensification and deintensification cycles [^114osk1i] [^116heVy6]. I should confirm that this applies across T2D stages; yes, the guidance is framed for adults with T2D and dovetails with AACE's emphasis on minimizing hypoglycemia and weight gain while maximizing cardiorenal benefit [^117H4U9h].

> Now, I should review glycemic targets and individualization. ADA continues to endorse an A1C target around 7% for many nonpregnant adults, while urging individualization based on comorbidities, diabetes duration, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences; VA/DoD suggests a range of 7.0–8.5% for most, and ESC 2023 similarly individualizes targets by comorbidity and life expectancy, reflecting the same evidence base interpreted with different risk tolerances [^114PdFx9] [^116dSSUe]. Hold on, I should verify the T1D angle; ADA 2025 allows pursuit of A1C below 7% in T1D if it can be achieved safely without significant hypoglycemia, which is consistent with technology-enabled tighter control in appropriate candidates [^113eP4Uv].

> I will now examine older adults and frailty. The Endocrine Society recommends designing regimens to minimize hypoglycemia, with glycemic targets tailored to health status and functional capacity, and most contemporary guidelines support less stringent A1C targets in frail or complex older adults; ADA 2025 operationalizes this by advising deintensification of hypoglycemia-prone agents when risk exceeds benefit, which is especially pertinent in geriatric care [^117Sq499] [^115D4r6u] [^11173599]. Let me reconsider whether any 2025 update contradicts this; I see no contradiction, only reinforcement of function-based individualization and explicit hypoglycemia risk mitigation.

> Next, I should review type 1 diabetes updates. ADA 2025 continues to recommend intensive insulin therapy with either multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous infusion for most adults, with periodic reassessment every 3–6 months to align regimen with goals and life circumstances; continuous glucose monitoring is embedded in standard care, and metformin may be considered off-label in overweight T1D adults to reduce insulin dose, though benefits are modest and patient selection matters [^112jAm3o] [^115aTE5K] [^114awPKo]. I should confirm that these positions are unchanged from prior years; yes, the emphasis on CGM-enabled intensification and structured follow-up is consistent with recent standards [^notfound].

> I need to check special populations and implementation. For early-onset T2D, evidence remains limited and guidelines generally extrapolate from adult data while emphasizing lifestyle, engagement, and equity-focused care processes; for CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors with renal benefit are prioritized and metformin is adjusted by eGFR, consistent with KDOQI and ADA CKD guidance; and across settings, guidelines urge addressing cost and social determinants, with explicit use of lower-cost agents when access barriers exist, which is a notable operational addition in 2025 [^117RzfkP] [^114rkHe5] [^115JRcg9]. But wait, what if cost precludes cardiorenal agents? ADA 2025 advises collaborative strategies to improve access and explicitly includes lower-cost options like metformin, sulfonylureas, TZDs, and human insulin within individualized risk–benefit discussions, which helps translate guidance into feasible care plans [^115Kx4cT].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical algorithm and double-check alignment. For new T2D, start metformin unless contraindicated, initiate lifestyle and DSMES, and consider early combination therapy if A1C is markedly elevated or goals are not met promptly; layer in a GLP-1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor for ASCVD/CKD/HF risk independent of A1C; continue background agents when starting insulin; reassess every 3–6 months for efficacy, hypoglycemia, weight, kidney function, and patient preferences; and deintensify hypoglycemia-prone therapy when risk outweighs benefit, all within shared decision-making and cost-conscious care [^116WNWFw] [^114rkHe5] [^114osk1i] [^11173599] [^115JRcg9]. For T1D, use MDI or pump with CGM, reassess regularly, and consider adjunct metformin selectively in overweight adults; for older adults, prioritize hypoglycemia avoidance and functional goals, adjusting A1C targets accordingly [^112jAm3o] [^115aTE5K] [^117Sq499].

> Finally, I should acknowledge controversies and evidence gaps so we do not overstate certainty. Some experts argue for GLP-1 RAs as first-line in select high-risk patients given their pathophysiologic and outcomes advantages, but head-to-head data against metformin are limited and cost remains a major barrier; ADA and EASD continue to position metformin as foundation therapy while supporting early addition of cardiorenal-protective agents in appropriate patients, which reflects a pragmatic, evidence-informed balance rather than a binary shift [^116wj3RU] [^1176EGq9] [^112k5cHt]. I should double-check that this nuance is reflected in the 2025 Standards; yes, the emphasis is on timely, risk-stratified combination therapy rather than replacing metformin outright, which accurately captures the current consensus trajectory [^116WNWFw].

The new diabetes treatment guidelines emphasize **individualized care** [^116uW7GJ] and **cardiorenal protection** [^113ayVRd], with metformin remaining first-line unless contraindicated [^111qNBNG] [^117H4U9h]. For patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD), **prioritize GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors** regardless of A1c [^114rkHe5] [^116dSSUe]. Combination therapy is recommended for patients with marked hyperglycemia (A1c > 1.5% above target) [^112Vy4C8]. A1c targets should be individualized based on comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^116dSSUe] [^112TuB2h]. The guidelines also highlight the importance of addressing social determinants of health, cost-related barriers, and shared decision-making to improve adherence and outcomes [^115JRcg9] [^111BMTFs].

---

## General principles of diabetes management

- **Individualized care**: Treatment plans should be tailored to patient-specific factors, including comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^116uW7GJ] [^111GZpNN].

- **Cardiorenal protection**: Emphasis on selecting medications that provide cardiovascular and renal benefits, particularly in patients with ASCVD, HF, or CKD [^113ayVRd] [^114rkHe5].

- **Social determinants of health**: Address financial barriers, access to care, and other social factors that impact diabetes management [^115JRcg9] [^111BMTFs].

---

## Pharmacologic treatment recommendations

### First-line therapy

Metformin remains the **preferred initial pharmacologic therapy** for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated [^111qNBNG] [^117H4U9h].

---

### Second-line therapy

Second-line therapy should be selected based on **comorbidities and patient-specific factors**:

| **Comorbidity** | **Recommended medication class** |
|-|-|
| ASCVD or high risk | GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors [^114rkHe5] [^1122m9GD] |
| Heart failure | SGLT2 inhibitors [^114rkHe5] [^1122m9GD] |
| Chronic kidney disease | SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists [^114rkHe5] [^1122m9GD] |

---

### Combination therapy

Combination therapy is recommended for patients with **markedly elevated A1c** (more than 1.5% above target) [^112Vy4C8].

---

### Insulin therapy

Insulin therapy should be initiated when **non-insulin therapies fail to achieve glycemic targets** or in patients with severe hyperglycemia [^1168trzw].

---

## Glycemic targets

A1c targets should be **individualized** based on patient-specific factors, including comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences [^116dSSUe] [^112TuB2h]. For most nonpregnant adults, a reasonable A1c target is **less than 7% (53 mmol/mol)** if it can be achieved safely [^116dSSUe] [^112TuB2h].

---

## Special populations

### Older adults

In older adults, **individualized targets** should be based on functional status, comorbidities, and hypoglycemia risk [^117Sq499] [^115D4r6u]. Hypoglycemia risk should be minimized by selecting medications with lower hypoglycemia risk and adjusting regimens as needed [^117Sq499] [^11173599].

---

### Pregnant patients

During pregnancy, **tight glycemic control** is recommended to reduce the risk of maternal and fetal complications.

---

## Non-pharmacologic interventions

Non-pharmacologic interventions include **lifestyle modifications** — dietary changes, physical activity, and weight management — which remain foundational to diabetes care [^114JZZer] [^113tKjX8]. Diabetes self-management education and support (**DSMES**) should be provided to improve adherence and outcomes [^114JZZer] [^113HvNGo].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring should include **A1c checks**, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and renal function tests [^117RzfkP]. Ongoing reassessment should be conducted regularly to adjust therapy based on patient response and changing clinical conditions [^115aTE5K].

---

## Emerging therapies and technologies

Continuous glucose monitoring (**CGM**) is recommended for patients with type 1 diabetes and for selected patients with type 2 diabetes [^notfound]. Digital health tools may be used to enhance patient engagement, adherence, and glycemic control [^notfound].

---

## Implementation challenges and barriers

Key implementation challenges include **cost and access**, as financial barriers significantly impact patient adherence and outcomes [^115JRcg9] [^1122m9GD]. Clinician and patient education is essential to support effective implementation of new guidelines [^113HvNGo].

---

The new diabetes treatment guidelines emphasize **individualized care**, **cardiorenal protection**, and addressing social determinants of health. Metformin remains first-line, with GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors prioritized for patients with ASCVD, HF, or CKD. Combination therapy is recommended for marked hyperglycemia, and A1c targets should be individualized.

Objective

The objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of diabetes in older adults.

Conclusions

Diabetes, particularly type 2, is becoming more prevalent in the general population, especially in individuals over the age of 65 years. The underlying pathophysiology of the disease in these patients is exacerbated by the direct effects of aging on metabolic regulation. Similarly, aging effects interact with diabetes to accelerate the progression of many common diabetes complications. Each section in this guideline covers all aspects of the etiology and available evidence, primarily from controlled trials, on therapeutic options and outcomes in this population. The goal is to give guidance to practicing health care providers that will benefit patients with diabetes (both type 1 and type 2), paying particular attention to avoiding unnecessary and/or harmful adverse effects.

Grading of scientific evidence.

There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines. Accordingly, we developed a classification system to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.

Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence (Table 1). Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations in which there is as yet no evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence. Recommendations with an "A" rating are based on large well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses. Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population to which they are appropriate. Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported. The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses after a given recommendation.

Of course, evidence is only one component of clinical decision-making. Clinicians care for patients, not populations; guidelines must always be interpreted with the needs of the individual patient in mind. Individual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, patients' values and preferences, must also be considered and may lead to different treatment targets and strategies. Also, conventional evidence hierarchies, such as the one adapted by the ADA, may miss some nuances that are important in diabetes care. For example, while there is excellent evidence from clinical trials supporting the importance of achieving glycemic control, the optimal way to achieve this result is less clear. It is difficult to assess each component of such a complex intervention.

ADA will continue to improve and update the Clinical Practice Recommendations to ensure that clinicians, health plans, and policymakers can continue to rely on them as the most authoritative and current guidelines for diabetes care. Our Clinical Practice Recommendations are also available on the Association's website at.

### Advances and counterpoints in type 2 diabetes. what is ready for translation into real-world practice, ahead of the guidelines [^116eaHkz]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

This review seeks to address major gaps and delays between our rapidly evolving body of knowledge on type 2 diabetes and its translation into real-world practice. Through updated and improved best practices informed by recent evidence and described herein, we stand to better attain A1c targets, help preserve beta cell integrity and moderate glycemic variability, minimize treatment-emergent hypoglycemia, circumvent prescribing to "treatment failure", and prevent long-term complications. The first topic addressed in this review concerns updates in the 2023 and 2024 diabetes treatment guidelines for which further elaboration can help facilitate integration into routine care. The second concerns advances in diabetes research that have not yet found their way into guidelines, though they are endorsed by strong evidence and are ready for real-world use in appropriate patients. The final theme addresses lingering misconceptions about the underpinnings of type 2 diabetes-fundamental fallacies that continue to be asserted in the textbooks and continuing medical education upon which physicians build their approaches. A corrected and up-to-date understanding of the disease state is essential for practitioners to both conceptually and translationally manage initial onset through late-stage type 2 diabetes.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^1166XBdv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy. While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient. Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target. In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe. Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

### Current antihyperglycemic treatment guidelines and algorithms for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113tKjX8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle interventions such as medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed physical activity remain cornerstones of disease prevention and treatment, most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require pharmacotherapy for glycemic control. Fortunately, many of these patients are able to achieve desired glycemic targets with the use of currently available antihyperglycemic agents. Both not-for-profit disease-specific organizations and healthcare specialty societies have provided guidance about the appropriate selection of these therapies. Type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines and algorithms have been developed, taking into account a combination of evidence-based information and expert opinions, with various groups offering diverse glucose goals and approaches to hyperglycemia management. Virtually all recognize that type 2 diabetes is a multifaceted disease, necessitating an integrated yet individualized approach to patient care.

The escalating global epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus has focused attention on the devastating consequences of protracted hyperglycemia. Early and effective intervention to control blood glucose is a fundamental principle of treatment guidelines, requiring assiduous use of current therapies. However, many patients do not achieve or maintain glycemic targets, emphasizing the need for further therapies. This narrative review assesses the available medicinal options to address hyperglycemia and the opportunities to develop novel agents.

### The place of sulfonylureas in guidelines: why are there differences? [^113U7DHS]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The four main internationally recognised guidelines or consensus reports for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)/American Diabetes Association (ADA), Diabetes Canada, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Of these, EASD/ADA is the most popular despite it being only a consensus report, and not meeting the Institute of Medicine requirements for trustworthy guidelines. The current article describes the place of sulfonylureas (SUs) within current international guidelines for the management of T2DM, and critically examines the quality of the guideline development process and of the evidence to support those recommendations. This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by the authors.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — objective and scope — states that "The objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of diabetes in older adults". The conclusions note that "Diabetes, particularly type 2, is becoming more prevalent in the general population, especially in individuals over the age of 65 years", that "The underlying pathophysiology of the disease in these patients is exacerbated by the direct effects of aging on metabolic function", and that "Similarly, aging effects interact with diabetes to accelerate the progression of many common diabetes complications". The guideline explains that "Each section in this guideline covers all aspects of the etiology and available evidence, primarily from controlled trials, on therapeutic options and outcomes in this population", and that "The goal is to give guidance to practicing health care providers that will benefit patients with diabetes (both type 1 and type 2), paying particular attention to avoiding unnecessary and/or harmful adverse effects".

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1123awg6]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Diabetes guidelines and organizations typically advocate a target glycated hemoglobin (A1C) value of 6.5–7.0% but highlight that glycemic management must be individualized. Whereas individualization of both glycemic targets and management is appealing to the clinician as a way of potentially maximizing benefit while minimizing risk, there is little evidence that such an approach will bring more patients to target. It may be argued that this approach could contribute to fewer patients attaining optimal glycemic targets. Nonetheless, the results of recent large outcome trials clearly highlight the fact that individual glycemic target achievement varied markedly, with some patients apparently deriving more clinical benefit and others deriving more harm. At the same time, there is ongoing evidence of a treatment gap in many surveys of clinical practice and a suggestion that algorithm-driven protocols may be more effective. Collectively, therefore, the currently available evidence suggests that algorithm-driven protocols that incorporate individualized targets based on patient characteristics designed to preserve a sound balance between the benefits and risk of good glycemic control may be an appropriate way of getting more patients to target in a safe and effective manner.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^113jySzk]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Process

The guidelines and algorithm that follow are derived from two sources. One source is the clinical trials that address the effectiveness and safety of the different modalities of therapy. Here, the writing group reviewed a wide variety of studies related to the use of drugs as monotherapy or in combination to lower glycemia. Unfortunately, the paucity of high-quality evidence in the form of well-controlled clinical trials that directly compare different diabetes treatment regimens remains a major impediment to recommending one class of drugs, or a particular combination of therapies, over another.

The second source of material that informed our recommendations was clinical judgement, that is, our collective knowledge and clinical experience, which takes into account benefits, risks, and costs in the treatment of diabetes. As in all clinical decision making, an evidence-based review of the literature must also be supplemented by value judgements, where the benefits of treatment are weighed against risks and costs in a subjective fashion. While we realize that others may have different judgements, we believe that the recommendations made in this new iteration of our treatment algorithm will guide therapy and result in improved glycemic control and health status over time.

To develop the 2020 Standards, the ADA Professional Practice Committee, comprising physicians, adult and pediatric endocrinologists, diabetes educators, registered dietitians, epidemiologists, pharmacists, and public health experts, continuously searched MEDLINE (English language only) from 15 October 2018 through August-September 2019 for pertinent studies, including high-quality trials that addressed pharmacologic management of type 2 diabetes. The committee selected and reviewed the studies, developed the recommendations, and solicited feedback from the larger clinical community.

Recommendations

This synopsis focuses on guidance relating to the pharmacologic treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes. Recommendations address oral and noninsulin injectable therapies, insulin treatment, and combination injectable therapies. Results of recent large trials with cardiovascular and renal outcomes are emphasized.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^116qZT8W]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available, mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications. Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making, and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for diabetes and CKD: 2012 update [^112i3C78]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The 2012 update of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is intended to assist the practitioner caring for patients with diabetes and CKD. Substantial high-quality new evidence has emerged since the original 2007 KDOQI guideline that could significantly change recommendations for clinical practice. As such, revisions of prior guidelines are offered that specifically address hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) targets, treatments to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) treatment in diabetic patients with and without albuminuria. Treatment approaches are addressed in each section and the stated guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and specific suggestions are provided for future research.

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below. In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications. The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

### Current type 2 diabetes guidelines: individualized treatment and how to make the most of metformin [^115Eo33y]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines provide the premise for the delivery of quality care to preserve health and prevent disabilities and premature death. The systematic gathering of observational, mechanistic and experimental data contributes to the hierarchy of evidence used to guide clinical practice. In the field of diabetes, metformin was discovered more than 100years ago, and with 60years of clinical use, it has stood the test of time regarding its value in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Although some guidelines have challenged the role of metformin as the first-line glucose-lowering drug, it is important to point out that the cardiovascular-renal protective effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists were gathered from patients with type 2 diabetes, the majority of whom were treated with metformin. Most national, regional and international guidelines recommend metformin as a foundation therapy with emphasis on avoidance of therapeutic inertia and early attainment of multiple treatment goals. Moreover, real-world evidence has confirmed the glucose-lowering and cardiovascular-renal benefits of metformin accompanied by an extremely low risk of lactic acidosis. In patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15–30mL/min/1.73 m²), metformin discontinuation was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular-renal events compared with metformin persistence. Meanwhile, it is understood that microbiota, nutrients and metformin can interact through the gut-brain-kidney axis to modulate homeostasis of bioactive molecules, systemic inflammation and energy metabolism. While these biological changes contribute to the multisystem effects of metformin, they may also explain the gastrointestinal side effects and vitamin B12 deficiency associated with metformin intolerance. By understanding the interactions between metformin, foods and microbiota, healthcare professionals are in a better position to optimize the use of metformin and mitigate potential side effects. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study and the Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Program commenced 40years ago provided the first evidence that type 2 diabetes is preventable and treatable. To drive real-world impact from this evidence, payors, practitioners and planners need to co-design and implement an integrated, data-driven, metformin-based programme to detect people with undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes (intermediate hyperglycaemia), notably impaired glucose tolerance, for early intervention. The systematic data collection will create real-world evidence to bring out the best of metformin and make healthcare sustainable, affordable and accessible.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^116Tc2ws]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Over 280 million people worldwide are known to have diabetes, and this number is projected to grow to 438 million by 2030. Current diabetes treatment guidelines encourage a multifaceted therapeutic approach. Central to these recommendations is early diagnosis and active intervention to realize and maintain glycemic control, with the aim of stopping the development of microvascular complications, reducing the risk of macrovascular events, and ameliorating the symptoms of acute hyperglycemia (,–).

The prognostic significance of A1C in regard to the incidence of diabetes complications, and the risk reductions associated with improvements in A1C, have been documented in both type 1 and type 2 (–,) diabetes. These have led to the underscoring of the importance of A1C target achievement. Many organizations around the world including the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Canadian Diabetes Association, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the International Diabetes Federation, and the U.K. National Institute for Clinical Excellence currently advocate a general target level for A1C of 6.5–7.0%. They also all say that the targets of therapy must be individualized. Recently, a joint position statement from the American College of Cardiology, ADA, and the American Heart Association released in response to the premature discontinuation of the glycemic intervention in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial recommended that although an appropriate A1C target is generally < 7.0%, individualized glycemic targets may be appropriate for some patients. For example, they stated that higher A1C targets may be more appropriate for those patients who are older, have longer duration of diabetes, have a history of severe hypoglycemia, exhibit advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, or present with extensive comorbidities. Others have noted that where glucose control closer to normal, or in the normal range, is easily attained, the care necessary to achieve it should be offered to the individual concerned.

### Pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes integrating findings from cardiovascular outcome trials: an expert consensus in the UK [^113Yd2BJ]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

What's new?

Following positive cardiovascular outcome trial results, many national and international guidelines on the management of people with Type 2 diabetes have been updated for those also at high risk of cardiovascular disease. However, not all countries have updated their guidelines, notably England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
This review shares a consensus on clinical recommendations for use of glucagon‐like peptide 1 receptor agonists and sodium–glucose co‐transporter 2 inhibitors in people with Type 2 diabetes.
Although some countries have not yet updated their guidelines, we recommend consideration of each person's cardiovascular risk when selecting their diabetes therapy, to improve long‐term outcomes and cost‐effectiveness.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^117BKQM2]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Since metformin was approved by the FDA in 1994 it has quickly risen to front-line therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin has been associated with improvement in glycemic control, weight neutrality, and low cost as well as low risk for hypoglycemia. However, recent GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2 inhibitor outcomes trials have impacted the guidelines for diabetes management.

Appropriately, diabetes management has recently become more outcomes-focused, shifting from concentrating exclusively on glycemic control to considering the impact these medications have on complications from diabetes. Results from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials are already influencing current guidelines. The ADA Standards of Care still recommends metformin as first-line therapy while considering GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c in high-risk patients. Alternatively, the EASD recently recommended considering GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors as the first line for patients who have certain comorbidities, such as cardiovascular and renal disease. The difference in the optimal diabetes treatment in high-risk, drug-naïve patients will not resolve until we have more data from a head-to-head trial comparing metformin with newer glycemic-lowering medications or conclusive evidence from previous cardiovascular outcomes trials suggesting that metformin mitigates the beneficial effects of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors.

While they might seem different, the two guidelines are actually similar in recommending diabetes medications with beneficial cardiovascular effects for certain high-risk patients as early as possible. Despite the current recommendations, there is still only a small portion of eligible patients who are receiving these cardio-protective medications, probably due to cost and clinical inertia. Our focus should be on expanding the use of optimal medication with cardiovascular benefits.

In summary, there are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c, yet cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

### Developing services to support the delivery of care to people with early-onset type 2 diabetes [^117RzfkP]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

3 ARE SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR EARLY‐ONSET TYPE 2 DIABETES NEEDED?

Despite such an adverse risk profile for early‐onset type 2 diabetes, current guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes in adults, make no age‐related treatment recommendations. There are guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes in paediatric populations but these are broadly consensus‐based and currently limited in drug choice by licensing of available medications. With the exception of a few small studies that have specifically investigated treatment response in paediatric populations, there is a paucity of data providing sufficient granularity regarding the most effective medications at this age or indeed, if existing treatments show differences in efficacy based on age‐at‐onset, although this may change as further studies of glucose‐lowering therapies in children report outcomes. For adults, deriving signals from existing drug trials is also problematic as, in most large randomised controlled cardiovascular outcome trials, the median age of recruitment is in the 5th or 6th decade. The aspiration to provide age‐specific medication guidelines is, therefore, not currently achievable.

Data from the National Diabetes Audit for England and Wales (NDA) does, however, highlight areas for improvement. Each year, eight care processes on every individual coded with diabetes in GP records are submitted for audit; HbA 1c, blood pressure, cholesterol, creatinine, urine albumin to creatinine ratio, BMI, smoking and a foot check (the ninth important care process, retinal screening, was only recently included, due to prior problems of data flow in England). Greater achievement of care processes has further been associated with a reduction in mortality in people with type 2 diabetes. An analysis of the 2019–2020 dataset demonstrates that 33% of people with type 2 diabetes currently aged < 40 years receiving all 8 care processes, in contrast to 47% of those aged 40–59 years and 59% of those aged 60–79 years. In the absence of evidence supporting broader medication choices for younger people, more targeted approaches, that address lifestyle choices, psychological well‐being and engagement with healthcare providers are likely to be beneficial given the over‐representation of those from socioeconomically deprived and from minority ethnic groups, to support greater completion of these care processes.

### Diagnosis and management of diabetes: synopsis of the 2016 American diabetes association standards of medical care in diabetes [^1135EmjL]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) published the 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (Standards) to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with the components of diabetes care, general treatment goals, and tools to evaluate the quality of care.

Methods

The ADA Professional Practice Committee performed a systematic search on MEDLINE to revise or clarify recommendations based on new evidence. The committee assigns the recommendations a rating of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence. The E rating for expert opinion is assigned to recommendations based on expert consensus or clinical experience. The Standards were reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care professionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from the larger clinical community was incorporated into the 2016 revision.

Recommendations

The synopsis focuses on 8 key areas that are important to primary care providers. The recommendations highlight individualized care to manage the disease, prevent or delay complications, and improve outcomes.

### Metformin – the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us? [^117H2PAq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal. T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

Consensus statement.

A comprehensive examination by a panel of experts (i.e. consensus panel) of a scientific or medical issue related to diabetes. A consensus statement is typically developed immediately following a consensus conference at which presentations are made on the issue under review. The statement represents the panel's collective analysis, evaluation, and opinion at that point in time based in part on the conference proceedings. The need for a consensus statement arises when clinicians or scientists desire guidance on a subject for which the evidence is contradictory or incomplete. Once written by the panel, a consensus statement is not subject to subsequent review or approval and does not represent official Association opinion. A list of recent consensus statements is included on p. S96 of this supplement.

The Association's Professional Practice Committee is responsible for reviewing ADA technical reviews and position statements, as well as for overseeing revisions of the latter as needed. Appointment to the Professional Practice Committee is based on excellence in clinical practice and/or research. The committee comprises physicians, diabetes educators, and registered dietitians who have expertise in a range of areas, including adult and pediatric endocrinology, epidemiology, and public health, lipid research, hypertension, and preconception and pregnancy care. All members of the Professional Practice Committee are required to disclose potential conflicts of interest (listed below).

### Prototype of an evidence-based tool to aid individualized treatment for type 2 diabetes [^117Sqmpf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Current standards of medical care for type 2 diabetes (T2D) promote individualized treatment according to co‐morbidities, individual preferences and treatment goals. 1, 2, 3 The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care guidelines offer examples of important considerations for selecting a T2D therapy for any particular individual, including: the estimated reduction in HbA1c; adverse‐event profile; risk of hypoglycaemia; impact on body weight; ease and frequency of administration; cost and availability; adherence to and persistence with therapy; and prevalent complications and co‐morbidities. 1 The updated (2020) consensus report by the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes further emphasizes co‐morbidities such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) as key priorities for individualized care. 3 All these resources promote shared decision‐making between patient and physician. 1, 2, 3 Clinical practice guidelines clarify how treatment selection can be directed by high‐risk co‐morbidities, such as established ASCVD, CKD or HF, 1, 2, 3 but are less clear on how patient characteristics, treatment goals and preferences should direct treatment selection, and how this may vary among individuals. Another challenge is the lack of data to help predict potential outcomes in a specific individual. Current guidelines offer summaries of the efficacy, risk of hypoglycaemia, effect on body weight, and cardiovascular (CV) and renal events of the major classes of glucose‐lowering treatment, but these are based on pooled outcomes from intention‐to‐treat analyses, so do not represent expected outcomes for a specific individual. 4 An expert perspective on precision medicine in T2D emphasized that for most people without high‐risk co‐morbidities, there is often no clear choice to suggest the 'best' antihyperglycaemic medication. 4

Clinical tools for individualized care have been developed and implemented for other diseases. For example, the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score allows for the input of a range of patient‐specific characteristics, and provides a risk score for developing heart disease over the next 10 years, with associated indications for different preventative strategies. 5 Drawing inspiration from tools such as this, we have developed a prototype tool to estimate patient‐specific outcomes via a user‐friendly web interface.

### How can we prevent cardiovascular disease in diabetes [^1172QbMR]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Evidence based goals for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis in diabetes are given in international and national guidelines. The importance of optimal control of lipids and blood pressure has been shown in several studies. With available drugs and behavioural modifications the treatment goals can be reached in most cases. However, only a few patients with diabetes are treated optimally today. A major possibility to reduce cardiovascular disease in diabetes is to treat patients according to guidelines. New treatment targets may include specific treatment of the dyslipidaemia, manifested in high levels of small dense LDL and low HDL, active anti-inflammatory treatments, specific reduction of inflammatory activity in adipose tissue, reduced volume of adipose tissue, antioxidants and reduction of advanced glycosylation endproducts production. Possible strategies for these treatments are available, and should be evaluated in clinical trials.

### Is It time to change the type 2 diabetes treatment paradigm? No! metformin should remain the foundation therapy for type 2 diabetes [^1176EGq9]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Most treatment guidelines, including those from the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the International Diabetes Federation, suggest metformin be used as the first-line therapy after diet and exercise. This recommendation is based on the considerable body of evidence that has accumulated over the last 30 years, but it is also supported on clinical grounds based on metformin's affordability and tolerability. As such, metformin is the most commonly used oral antihyperglycemic agent in the U.S. However, based on the release of newer agents over the recent past, some have suggested that the modern approach to disease management should be based upon identification of its etiology and correcting the underlying biological disturbances. That is, we should use interventions that normalize or at least ameliorate the recognized derangements in physiology that drive the clinical manifestation of disease, in this circumstance, hyperglycemia. Thus, it is argued that therapeutic interventions that target glycemia but do not correct the underlying pathogenic disturbances are unlikely to result in a sustained benefit on the disease process. In our field, there is an evolving debate regarding the suggested first step in diabetes management and a call for a new paradigm. Given the current controversy, we provide a Point-Counterpoint debate on this issue. In the point narrative that precedes the counterpoint narrative below, Drs. Abdul-Ghani and DeFronzo provide their argument that a treatment approach for type 2 diabetes based upon correcting the underlying pathophysiological abnormalities responsible for the development of hyperglycemia provides the best therapeutic strategy. Such an approach requires a change in the recommendation for first-line therapy from metformin to a GLP-1 receptor agonist. In the counterpoint narrative below, Dr. Inzucchi argues that based on the medical community's extensive experience and the drug's demonstrated efficacy, safety, low cost, and cardiovascular benefits, metformin should remain the "foundation therapy" for all patients with type 2 diabetes, barring contraindications.-William T.

To examine the current treatment guidelines for the emergency management of hypoglycaemia and the evidence underpinning recommendations.

Methods

International diabetes agencies were searched for hypoglycaemia treatment guidelines. Guidelines were assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument. An electronic database search was conducted for evidence regarding emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia in adults, and relevant articles were critically appraised.

Results

Of the international diabetes agencies, six sets of guidelines were deemed relevant and of sufficient detail for appraisal by AGREE II. The evidence search returned 2649 articles, of which 17 pertaining to the emergency management of hypoglycaemia were included. High-quality evidence for the management of hypoglycaemia was lacking, limiting treatment recommendations. In general, guidelines and studies were somewhat concordant and recommended 15–20 g of oral glucose or sucrose, repeated after 10–15 min for treatment of the responsive adult, and 10% intravenous dextrose or 1 mg intramuscular glucagon for treatment of the unresponsive adult. No evidence was found for other treatment approaches.

Conclusion

Evidence for the emergency treatment of hypoglycaemia in adults is limited, is often low grade and mostly pre-dates contemporary management of diabetes. Guideline recommendations are limited by the lack of randomized trials. Further high-quality studies are required to inform the optimum management of this frequently occurring emergency condition.

This document represents the official position of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology. Where there were no randomized controlled trials or specific U.S. FDA labeling for issues in clinical practice, the participating clinical experts utilized their judgment and experience. Every effort was made to achieve consensus among the committee members. Position statements are meant to provide guidance, but they are not to be considered prescriptive for any individual patient and cannot replace the judgment of a clinician.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111SjetJ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Type 2 diabetes is epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

Summary

The guidelines and treatment algorithm presented here emphasize the following:
Achievement and maintenance of near normoglycaemia (A1C < 7.0%)
Initial therapy with lifestyle intervention and metformin
Rapid addition of medications, and transition to new regimens, when target glycemic goals are not achieved or sustained
Early addition of insulin therapy in patients who do not meet target goals

### Guideline recommendations and the positioning of newer drugs in type 2 diabetes care [^113ayVRd]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk have led to remarkable advances in our understanding of the effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors to reduce cardiorenal events. In 2019, the American Diabetes Association (ADA), European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published updated recommendations for the management of such patients. We are concerned that ongoing discussions focusing on the differences between the endocrinologists' consensus report from the ADA and EASD and cardiologists' guidelines from the ESC are contributing to clinical inertia, thereby effectively denying evidence-based treatments advocated by both groups to patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiorenal disease. A subset of members from the writing groups of the ADA-EASD consensus report and the ESC guidelines was convened to emphasise where commonalities exist and to propose an integrated framework that encompasses the views incorporated in management approaches proposed by the ESC and the ADA and EASD. Coordinated action is required to ensure that people with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease are treated appropriately with an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist. In our opinion, this course should be initiated independent of background therapy, current glycaemic control, or individualised treatment goals.

### Clinical guidelines for type 1 diabetes mellitus with an emphasis on older adults: an executive summary [^117Lm1F5]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

We present a summary of a guideline produced by an international group of experts for managing type 1 diabetes in adults with an emphasis on the special needs of older people with this condition. The rationale for delivering high-quality diabetes care for adults with type 1 diabetes, why it is important to include older people in our considerations, and the key underpinning principles of the guideline are included. The structure of the recommendations given is described and consists of 'general' recommendations followed by 'specific' recommendations according to three categories depending on the characteristics of adults addressed, such as functional level or self-management ability. Recommendations are provided in the areas of: clinical diagnosis, establishing management plans and glucose regulation, diabetes self-management education, nutritional therapy, physical activity, exercise and lifestyle modification, insulin treatments and regimens, use of technology in diabetes management, hypoglycaemia, managing cardiovascular risk, management of microvascular risk, and inpatient management of type 1 diabetes and ketoacidosis.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^1151qPSn]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Today's guidelines not only generally have the proviso that patients who do not meet the A1C goal be followed every 2–3 months to enable adjustment of the ongoing treatment regimen, but also indicate that clinical judgment should be individually tailored. However, this case-by-case approach may not be the best practice tactic for the vast majority of patients, since the progressive nature of diabetes demands prompt and consistent therapeutic attention.

A well-controlled A1C of < 7.0% with oral monotherapy for up to 3 years is typically achieved by ~50% of type 2 diabetic patients. It has been suggested that this unsatisfactory outcome is partly the consequence of first-line therapy being begun only after A1C reaches levels higher than those at which the expected glucose-lowering from monotherapy could be expected to return glucose control to target levels. This result has been attributed in part to physicians — both specialists and those in primary care — not being well prepared for early interventions and therefore often missing the critical window to launch effective management. Despite poor and worsening A1C, many people are kept on the same medications, thus aggravating their glycemic burden and risking worsening health problems. Interestingly, a recent survey of awareness and attitudes in eight countries found that 51% of patients had never heard of A1C and that > 10% of physicians measured it less than once a year.

Before the recent enhanced focus on more structured guidelines with specific recommended A1C targets, diabetes management with antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy was often inadequate, with appropriate changes in medical regimens implemented only when A1C levels were > 9.0% and/or several months to years after ascertaining that A1C readings were higher than acceptable. As a result of incremental treatment not keeping abreast with degenerating glycemic status (Fig. 2) and most individuals who managed to successfully achieve recommended A1C targets demonstrating an inability to maintain glycemic status, glycemic burden was unnecessarily extended in parallel with a substantial increase in CV risk. For example, Alvarez Guisasola et al. reported that 26% of the 2,025 people that they monitored from seven European countries had an average A1C of 7.2% after 2.6 years of metformin-sulfonylurea or metformin-thiazolidinedione combinations. After 5 years, 20% of the 176 patients with A1C assessments were under control (mean A1C 7.4%), with 30% of this subgroup on insulin, resonating the often-observed temporal decline in glycemic management.

### Should A1c targets be individualized for all people with diabetes? Arguments for and against… [^116PsnRM]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

PROS AND CONS

In summary, there is excellent clinical evidence that good glycemic control significantly reduces the risk of diabetes complications and particularly the microvascular complications. At the same time, stringent pharmacotherapeutic management to reach an A1C < 6.5% or even 7.0% may be inadvisable or impractical in some patients. Treatment must therefore be individualized over time to maintain an appropriate balance between the benefits and risk of good glycemic control, taking into account the specific features of the patient (e.g. presence or absence of prior CV disease, duration of diabetes, etc.) and the agents used (e.g. risk of hypoglycemia).

It is also evident from the available data that a major problem in achieving targets continues to be persistent delays in appropriate use of oral agents and insulin. To ensure across the board attainment and maintenance of guidelines-recommended A1C levels, it would appear that physicians and other members of the health care team at all levels need to be presented with well-structured directives, with feedback and audit mechanisms that outline safe therapy intensification processes and do not allow them the excuse of "individualized" therapy.

### Glycemic control and type 2 diabetes mellitus: the optimal hemoglobin A1c targets. A guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^115brj8g]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

This guidance statement is derived from other organizations' guidelines and is based on an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the available guidelines. We used the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation in Europe (AGREE) appraisal instrument to evaluate the guidelines from various organizations. On the basis of the review of the available guidelines, we recommend: STATEMENT 1: To prevent microvascular complications of diabetes, the goal for glycemic control should be as low as is feasible without undue risk for adverse events or an unacceptable burden on patients. Treatment goals should be based on a discussion of the benefits and harms of specific levels of glycemic control with the patient. A hemoglobin A1c level less than 7% based on individualized assessment is a reasonable goal for many but not all patients. STATEMENT 2: The goal for hemoglobin A1c level should be based on individualized assessment of risk for complications from diabetes, comorbidity, life expectancy, and patient preferences. STATEMENT 3: We recommend further research to assess the optimal level of glycemic control, particularly in the presence of comorbid conditions.

### Using clinical guidelines designed for older adults with diabetes mellitus and complex health status [^112rTysT]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Increasingly, adults are living to an advanced age. While many enjoy good health, nearly 50% of adults older than 65 years have 3 or more chronic medical conditions. Furthermore, within any age-sex cohort, older adults exhibit widely heterogeneous health status — ranging from robust to frail. This heterogeneity and individual medical complexity makes care for older patients particularly challenging and requires both careful medical judgment and a clear understanding of the patient's personal values and goals. Most current health care guidelines are disease-specific and do not address this complexity and heterogeneity, thus limiting their utility for guiding physicians in the care of older adult patients. The "Guidelines for Improving the Care of Older Persons With Diabetes Mellitus" are the first guidelines to specifically address this complexity and provide guidance to physicians who must prioritize therapies and goals for older adults with diabetes, comorbid medical conditions, and geriatric syndromes. By providing a rationale for prioritizing recommendations and the inclusion of geriatric syndromes that impact the patient's overall health and diabetic care, these guidelines may serve as a model for the development of other guidelines targeting older adults with complex health status.

The consensus algorithm for the medical management of type 2 diabetes was published in August 2006 with the expectation that it would be updated, based on the availability of new interventions and new evidence to establish their clinical role. The authors continue to endorse the principles used to develop the algorithm and its major features. We are sensitive to the risks of changing the algorithm cavalierly or too frequently, without compelling new information. An update to the consensus algorithm published in January 2008 specifically addressed safety issues surrounding the thiazolidinediones. In this revision, we focus on the new classes of medications that now have more clinical data and experience.

### Consensus recommendations for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [^112JRWZ1]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

The recent American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes guideline mentioned glycaemia management in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); however, it did not cover the treatment approaches for patients with T2DM having a high risk of CVD, and treatment and screening approaches for CVDs in patients with concomitant T2DM. This consensus guideline undertakes the data obtained from all the cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) to propose approaches for the T2DM management in presence of CV comorbidities. For patients at high risk of CVD, metformin is the drug of choice to manage the T2DM to achieve a patient specific HbA1c target. In case of established CVD, a combination of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist with proven CV benefits is recommended along with metformin, while for chronic kidney disease or heart failure, a sodium-glucose transporter proteins-2 inhibitor with proven benefit is advised. This document also summarises various screening and investigational approaches for the major CV events with their accuracy and specificity along with the treatment guidance to assist the healthcare professionals in selecting the best management strategies for every individual. Since lifestyle modification and management plays an important role in maintaining the effectiveness of the pharmacological therapies, authors of this consensus recommendation have also briefed on the patient-centric non-pharmacological management of T2DM and CVD.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes, 2018. A consensus report by the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^114rkHe5]. Diabetes Care (2018). Low credibility.

The American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes convened a panel to update the prior position statements, published in 2012 and 2015, on the management of type 2 diabetes in adults. A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

Wilderness Medical Society Clinical Practice Guidelines for Diabetes Management — background on diabetes mellitus outlines disease mechanisms, prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and treatment distinctions with implications for activity in wilderness settings. Diabetes mellitus is described as a metabolic disease characterized by elevated blood glucose from a lack of insulin secretion, reduced insulin sensitivity, or both, with type 2 diabetes the most common form (90% of individuals with diabetes have type 2 diabetes). Type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in children or young adults and results from autoimmune destruction of islet cells causing insulin deficiency; people with type 1 diabetes require treatment with subcutaneous insulin, whereas those with type 2 diabetes may or may not require insulin treatment. The text notes that strenuous exercise and wilderness environments can complicate glycemic control, and that exercise and environmental stressors may interact with commonly used medications, glucose monitoring, and medication delivery.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^111ZXfet]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should continue to be the first choice for therapy as other anti-hyperglycemic medications exhibit additional advantages in certain populations. Despite a long-standing history of metformin use, there are limited cardiovascular outcomes data for metformin. Furthermore, the available studies fail to provide strong evidence due to either small sample size or short duration. Recent data from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials demonstrated additional protection from diabetes complications for some high-risk patients, which has impacted the guidelines for diabetes management. Post-hoc analyses comparing hazard ratios for participants taking metformin at baseline versus not taking metformin are inconclusive for these two groups. There are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c. However, cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

### Guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of foot infection in persons with diabetes (IWGDF 2019 update) [^115KJ172]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

The International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) has published evidence-based guidelines on the prevention and management of diabetic foot disease since 1999. This guideline is on the diagnosis and treatment of foot infection in persons with diabetes and updates the 2015 IWGDF infection guideline. On the basis of patient, intervention, comparison, outcomes (PICOs) developed by the infection committee, in conjunction with internal and external reviewers and consultants, and on systematic reviews the committee conducted on the diagnosis of infection (new) and treatment of infection (updated from 2015), we offer 27 recommendations. These cover various aspects of diagnosing soft tissue and bone infection, including the classification scheme for diagnosing infection and its severity. Of note, we have updated this scheme for the first time since we developed it 15years ago. We also review the microbiology of diabetic foot infections, including how to collect samples and to process them to identify causative pathogens. Finally, we discuss the approach to treating diabetic foot infections, including selecting appropriate empiric and definitive antimicrobial therapy for soft tissue and for bone infections, when and how to approach surgical treatment, and which adjunctive treatments we think are or are not useful for the infectious aspects of diabetic foot problems. For this version of the guideline, we also updated four tables and one figure from the 2016 guideline. We think that following the principles of diagnosing and treating diabetic foot infections outlined in this guideline can help clinicians to provide better care for these patients.

### Pharmacological treatment for type 2 diabetes integrating findings from cardiovascular outcome trials: an expert consensus in the UK [^114ALJGY]. Diabetic Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In people with Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus, as well as controlling glucose, reducing the risk of cardiovascular events is a key goal. The results of cardiovascular outcome trials have led to updates for many national and international guidelines. England, Wales and Northern Ireland remain exceptions, with the most recent update to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines published in 2015. We reviewed current national and international guidelines and recommendations on the management of people with Type 2 diabetes. This article shares our consensus on clinical recommendations for the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in people with Type 2 diabetes and established or at very high risk of cardiovascular disease in the UK. We also consider cost-effectiveness for these therapies. We recommend considering each person's cardiovascular risk and using diabetes therapies with proven cardiovascular benefits when appropriate to improve long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

### Is It time to change the type 2 diabetes treatment paradigm? Yes! GLP-1 RAs should replace metformin in the type 2 diabetes algorithm [^116wj3RU]. Diabetes Care (2017). Low credibility.

Most treatment guidelines, including those from the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the International Diabetes Federation, suggest metformin be used as the first-line therapy after diet and exercise. This recommendation is based on the considerable body of evidence that has accumulated over the last 30 years, but it is also supported on clinical grounds based on metformin's affordability and tolerability. As such, metformin is the most commonly used oral antihyperglycemic agent in the U.S. However, based on the release of newer agents over the recent past, some have suggested that the modern approach to disease management should be based upon identification of its etiology and correcting the underlying biological disturbances. That is, we should use interventions that normalize or at least ameliorate the recognized derangements in physiology that drive the clinical manifestation of disease, in this circumstance, hyperglycemia. Thus, it is argued that therapeutic interventions that target glycemia but do not correct the underlying pathogenic disturbances are unlikely to result in a sustained benefit on the disease process. In our field, there is an evolving debate regarding the suggested first step in diabetes management and a call for a new paradigm. Given the current controversy, we provide a Point-Counterpoint debate on this issue. In the point narrative below that precedes the counterpoint narrative, Drs. Abdul-Ghani and DeFronzo provide their argument that a treatment approach for type 2 diabetes based upon correcting the underlying pathophysiological abnormalities responsible for the development of hyperglycemia provides the best therapeutic strategy. Such an approach requires a change in the recommendation for first-line therapy from metformin to a GLP-1 receptor agonist. In the counterpoint narrative that follows Drs. Abdul-Ghani and DeFronzo's contribution, Dr. Inzucchi argues that, based on the medical community's extensive experience and the drug's demonstrated efficacy, safety, low cost, and cardiovascular benefits, metformin should remain the "foundation therapy" for all patients with type 2 diabetes, barring contraindications.-William T.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1127KKBA]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is growing at epidemic proportions in the United States and worldwide. Most alarming is the steady increase in type 2 diabetes, especially among young and obese people. An estimated 7% of the US population has diabetes, and because of the increased longevity of this population, diabetes-associated complications are expected to rise in prevalence. Foot ulcerations, infections, Charcot neuroarthropathy, and peripheral arterial disease frequently result in gangrene and lower limb amputation. Consequently, foot disorders are leading causes of hospitalization for persons with diabetes and account for billion-dollar expenditures annually in the US. Although not all foot complications can be prevented, dramatic reductions in frequency have been achieved by taking a multidisciplinary approach to patient management. Using this concept, the authors present a clinical practice guideline for diabetic foot disorders based on currently available evidence, committee consensus, and current clinical practice. The pathophysiology and treatment of diabetic foot ulcers, infections, and the diabetic Charcot foot are reviewed. While these guidelines cannot and should not dictate the care of all affected patients, they provide evidence-based guidance for general patterns of practice. If these concepts are embraced and incorporated into patient management protocols, a major reduction in diabetic limb amputations is certainly an attainable goal.

### Optimal management of type 2 diabetes: the evidence [^111oZQ9e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the evidence in relation to the optimal target for HbA1c and outlines a global treatment algorithm for people with type 2 diabetes. While most guidelines recommend a general HbA1c target of 7%, recent large scale intervention studies have examined the potential benefits of lower targets. These studies have generally shown that lower HbA1c targets provide no macrovascular benefits and limited effects on microvascular complications while increasing rates of hypoglycaemia. Overall these studies do not support a general HbA1c target lower than 7.0%. However an individual's HbA1c target should be set and reviewed taking into account treatment benefits, safety, and tolerability. This may mean that an HbA1c target lower than 7% is appropriate for some when it can be easily and safely achieved but equally a higher HbA1c target may be appropriate in others. Clinicians and consumers are fortunate in having a wide range of pharmacological agents available to treat hyperglycaemia, however access to many of these options is limited in many middle and low income countries. Developing treatment algorithms is complex for several reasons. The major limitation is the limited evidence base for choosing particular treatment options or combinations of medications. However it is possible to derive a generic evidence-informed consensus algorithm which considers availability, access and cost of medications which can be adapted for local country use.

Relevance of guideline and implications

The importance of managing PMG to improve overall glycaemic control in diabetes is now fairly widely recognized in guidelines from professional associations. As the research base continues to expand, the answers to other relevant questions are eagerly anticipated, such as whether there is a causal association between PMG and macrovascular complications and the role of SMBG in individuals who are not on insulin therapy. Until that time, logic and clinical judgment preside when interpreting the evidence presented in the guideline and deciding on an optimal management plan. Management strategies should depend on a practical evaluation of how best to integrate the recommendations into modern practice, with consideration to locally available therapies and resources.

### The early treatment of type 2 diabetes [^111toY7V]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The growing epidemic of type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of premature morbidity and mortality worldwide, mainly due to the micro- and macrovascular complications associated with the disease. A growing body of evidence suggests that although the risk of developing complications is greater with glucose levels beyond the established threshold for diagnosis — increasing in parallel with rising hyperglycemia-individuals with glucose levels in the prediabetic range are already at increased risk. Early intervention, ideally as soon as abnormalities in glucose homeostasis are detected, is of great importance to minimize the burden of the disease. However, as the early stages of the disease are asymptomatic, diagnosing prediabetes and early overt type 2 diabetes is challenging. The aim of this article is to discuss these challenges, the benefits of early intervention — with emphasis on the prevention trials showing that progression to type 2 diabetes can be delayed by addressing prediabetes — and the existing evidence-based guidelines that have been drawn to optimize the standards of care at the prediabetes and overt type 2 diabetes stages.

Type 2 diabetes — antihyperglycemic pharmacotherapy principles and initial therapy: The goal of antihyperglycemic treatment is to achieve clinical and laboratory targets with minimal adverse effects and reduce diabetes-related complications, and minimizing the risks of hypoglycemia and weight gain and maximizing cardiovascular and renal benefits should be priorities. As monotherapy, most noninsulin agents reduce A1C by 0.5% to 2.0%. Metformin is often the preferred initial therapy for most persons with new-onset type 2 diabetes and, once initiated, should be continued as long as it is tolerated and not contraindicated; it can be used in combination with virtually all other antihyperglycemic agents, including insulin, when monotherapy does not reach the glycemic target.

### What role for metformin in type 1 diabetes? [^114awPKo]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Tight glycaemic control is key to reducing the risk of cardiovascular and microvascular complications in people with type 1 diabetes. 1 Standard treatment involves optimising insulin therapy to achieve an HbA 1c level of 48mmol/mol (6.5%) or lower. Although not licensed for use in type 1 diabetes, metformin is included in some clinical guidelines as adjuvant therapy for people with type 1 diabetes who are overweight and wish to improve glycaemic control while minimising the dose of insulin. 1,2 The REMOVAL study is the largest trial to date that has investigated the longer-term effects of metformin in people with type 1 diabetes. 3 Here, we consider the role of metformin in individuals with type 1 diabetes in light of these results and other study findings.

### The trials and tribulations of determining hbAtargets for diabetes mellitus [^112TuB2h]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) is considered the gold standard for predicting glycaemia-associated risks for the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus over 5–10 years. The value of HbA 1c in the care of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is unassailable, yet HbA 1c targets remain contentious. Guidelines from diabetes care organizations recommend conflicting HbA 1c targets - generally between 6.5% and 8%. However, all such organizations advocate for individualization of HbA 1c targets, leaving both health-care providers and their patients confused about what HbA 1c target is appropriate in an individual patient. In this Review, we outline the landmark T1DM and T2DM trials that informed the current guidelines, we discuss the evidence that drives individualized HbA 1c targets, we examine the limitations of HbA 1c, and we consider alternatives for monitoring glycaemic control. Ultimately, in synthesizing this literature, we argue for an HbA 1c target of < 7% for most individuals, but emphasize the importance of helping patients determine their own personal goals and determinants of quality of life that are independent of a particular glycaemic target. We also recognize that as newer technologies and anti-hyperglycaemic therapies emerge, glycaemic targets will continue to evolve.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^112nAFox]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The epidemic of type 2 diabetes and the recognition that achieving specific glycemic goals can substantially reduce morbidity have made the effective treatment of hyperglycemia a top priority. While the management of hyperglycemia, the hallmark metabolic abnormality associated with type 2 diabetes, has historically taken center stage in the treatment of diabetes, therapies directed at other coincident features, such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, hypercoagulability, obesity, and insulin resistance, have also been a major focus of research and therapy. Maintaining glycemic levels as close to the nondiabetic range as possible has been demonstrated to have a powerful beneficial effect on diabetes-specific microvascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, in the setting of type 1 diabetes; in type 2 diabetes, more intensive treatment strategies have likewise been demonstrated to reduce microvascular complications. Intensive glycemic management resulting in lower A1C levels has also been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications in type 1 diabetes; however, current studies have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of intensive diabetes therapy on CVD in type 2 diabetes.

The development of new classes of blood glucose–lowering medications to supplement the older therapies, such as lifestyle-directed interventions, insulin, sulfonylureas, and metformin, has increased the number of treatment options available for type 2 diabetes. Whether used alone or in combination with other blood glucose–lowering interventions, the increased number of choices available to practitioners and patients has heightened uncertainty regarding the most appropriate means of treating this widespread disease. Although numerous reviews on the management of type 2 diabetes have been published in recent years, practitioners are often left without a clear pathway of therapy to follow. We developed the following consensus approach to the management of hyperglycemia in the nonpregnant adult to help guide health care providers in choosing the most appropriate interventions for their patients with type 2 diabetes.

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) glycemic targets — We suggest an HbA1c range of 7.0–8.5% for most patients, if it can be safely achieved (Weak for | Not reviewed, Amended). We suggest setting an individualized HbA1c target range based on the clinician's appraisal of the risk benefit ratio, patient characteristics, presence or absence of T2DM, comorbidities, and life expectancy. The discussion notes intensive control as targets such as HbA1c < 7.0%. Supporting evidence cited includes a Cochran review of 20 trials (n = 29,986) reporting no significant difference between intensive and conventional glucose control for all-cause mortality but reduced risk of amputation and microvascular diseases in the intensive treatment arm, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low.

Key points
- Health care providers play a crucial role in helping patients prevent or delay type 2 diabetes and manage all types of diabetes.
- They are often the first line in screening and referring patients to a type 2 diabetes prevention program or diabetes self-management education and support services. Preventing type 2 diabetes About 1 in 3 American adults has prediabetes, which increases their risk for developing type 2 diabetes. More than 8 in 10 of them don't know they have prediabetes. As a health care provider, you're often the first line in screening and referring patients to a type 2 diabetes prevention program. Refer your patients with prediabetes to the CDC-led National Diabetes Prevention Program lifestyle change program. Research shows that the program can cut the risk of type 2 diabetes by more than half.

This yearlong program, delivered by a trained Lifestyle Coach, will teach your patients how to eat healthy, increase physical activity, manage stress, and stay motivated. They can also lower their risk of a heart attack or stroke and improve their overall health. Already delivering the lifestyle change program. Managing diabetes Stay up to date on the latest Diabetes Standards of Care to ensure your patients are receiving timely, equitable, and high-quality care. These guidelines include screenings and management for diabetes and related complications, such as cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. Your patients manage their diabetes care with regular guidance and support from their health care team.

### Use of new diabetes medicines… [^1122m9GD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Recent guidelines from the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend newer types of diabetes medications.
- CDC researchers found that most Americans living with type 2 diabetes are eligible under these new guidelines. What did this study examine. In 2022, the ADA and EASD jointly released new medication recommendations for adults with type 2 diabetes. They recommended newer types of diabetes medications as first-line treatment for adults with type 2 diabetes who also have:

- A heart disease called atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
- Heart failure.
- Kidney disease.
- High risk for ASCVD. This study examined how many US adults with type 2 diabetes would meet the recommended criteria to use these medications. Terms to know Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, or GLP-1s, are a type of medicine for people with diabetes.

They lower blood sugar levels, can help with weight loss, and protect the heart and kidneys. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, or SGLT-2s are a type of medicine for people with diabetes. Similar to GLP-1s, they lower blood sugar levels, can help with weight loss, and protect the heart and kidneys. Because GLP-1s and SGLT-2s work in different ways, they can be taken together. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, also known as ASCVD, is a type of heart disease where blood vessels are narrowed or damaged. People at high risk of ASCVD were defined as being over age 55 and having 2 or more risk factors:

- Obesity
- Hypertension
- High cholesterol
- Kidney disease
- Current smoking. Study results CDC researchers studied 1, 330 nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes between 2017 and 2020. Researchers estimate that with new ADA and EASD guidelines, 82% of US adults with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take a GLP-1, or SGLT-2, or both.

They also estimate that almost all Medicare beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes may be eligible to take these medicines. Very few US adults were taking GLP-1s or SGLT-2s during the study timeframe. This is because they were not yet approved for first-line treatment. Only 9% were already taking either a GLP-1 or an SGLT-2 medication. What's important about this study. This study showed that over 8 in 10 US adults with type 2 diabetes are eligible for new, effective diabetes medicines. These medicines are not just beneficial for blood sugar management. They also help reduce risk for diabetes complications by protecting the heart and kidneys, and help people lose weight if needed. Currently, these medicines are expensive, and cost may be a barrier for many people with type 2 diabetes. More research on cost-effectiveness can help guide diabetes interventions at a sustainable cost.

### ADA / EASD updated guidelines: glycemic control is only… [^112k5cHt]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question What are the current recommendations from the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Bottom Line The management of type 2 diabetes continues to move away from glycemic goals and toward a more holistic approach to patient care that considers medications, weight management, attention to cardiovascular risk factors, and kidney protection. Metformin is recommended for most patients, although the new classes of medications that affect the heart and kidneys should be considered for many patients. Sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, and insulin, all of which have little effect except to lower blood glucose levels, are distinctly de-emphasized. Synopsis The guidelines were developed by a working group composed of members from two professional societies and included endocrinologists and researchers. Most of the working group members had substantial relationships with the pharmaceutical industry. The group systematically reviewed the evidence and assessed its quality. Rather than strict goals, the guidelines continue to move away from an emphasis on markers of glucose control and toward an emphasis on modifiable risk factors to prevent complications and optimize quality of life. However, they recommend an A1C goal of less than 7% in most adults with a life expectancy of 10 years or more. The authors suggest principles of care that are more holistic, including emphasis on social determinants, psychosocial factors, and shared decision-making. The four categories of care include weight management, medications for glycemia management, attention to cardiovascular risk factors, and kidney protection.

Metformin remains a mainstay of treatment, although the authors suggest treatment that controls glycemia and offers cardiorenal protection, such as a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, alone or in combination. Insulin should be used when needed to provide further control of blood sugar.
