## Question

Are thrombocytosis and seizures correlated/ connected in any diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether thrombocytosis and seizures are correlated or connected in any diagnosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the strength of evidence linking thrombocytosis to seizures. Then, I should verify whether the connection is causal, associative, or merely coincidental across different contexts. Next, I will examine specific diagnoses where both can occur, including essential thrombocythemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and pediatric CNS infections. After that, I need to check for confounders like medications and inherited platelet disorders. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and outline practical next steps for evaluation and management.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate entities. Thrombocytosis is typically defined as a platelet count greater than 450 × 10^9/L, and it can be primary (clonal, as in essential thrombocythemia) or secondary/reactive to inflammation, infection, iron deficiency, or malignancy, whereas seizures are paroxysmal events due to abnormal cortical excitability and can be provoked by metabolic, structural, infectious, or thrombotic causes rather than a direct platelet effect per se [^6a89ce22] [^b519ddbb].

> Wait, let me verify the core claim before jumping ahead. I initially thought there was a direct causal relationship between thrombocytosis and seizures, but hold on, I should verify that against the literature. The strongest, most consistent link is indirect: thrombocytosis increases thrombotic risk, and thrombosis in the cerebral circulation can precipitate seizures; this is particularly well described in essential thrombocythemia where arterial and venous thromboses, including stroke, are major complications and seizures can occur as part of the neurologic sequelae, though seizures are not a defining feature of ET itself [^6a89ce22] [^4e942aed].

> I will now examine essential thrombocythemia more closely. ET is a myeloproliferative neoplasm with clonal thrombocytosis and a substantial risk of thrombohemorrhagic events; neurologic manifestations include transient ischemic attacks, ischemic stroke, and occasionally seizures as part of the ischemic injury, while microvascular symptoms like headaches and paresthesias are more common than frank seizures; importantly, seizures are not a primary diagnostic criterion for ET, reinforcing that the relationship is indirect via ischemia rather than a direct platelet epileptogenic effect [^6a89ce22] [^4e942aed] [^85aa02f4].

> Next, I should review thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, because I need to ensure I'm not mixing up thrombocytosis with thrombocytopenia. TTP causes profound thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolysis with neurologic involvement that frequently includes encephalopathy, focal deficits, and seizures; here, seizures are common and mechanistically tied to microvascular ischemia and hypoperfusion, but again, the platelet abnormality is low, not high, so this is not a thrombocytosis–seizure link; rather, it underscores that platelet-driven microthrombosis can impair cortical function and provoke seizures [^5aa22a70] [^d8c65433] [^45f16472].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric data where both thrombocytosis and seizures can coexist. In pediatric CNS infections, reactive thrombocytosis is common and correlates with disease severity; studies show that children with CNS infections requiring PICU admission are more likely to have both seizures and thrombocytosis on presentation, but this reflects severity of inflammation and systemic stress rather than a direct causal effect of platelets on seizure generation; the thrombocytosis resolves with treatment of the underlying infection and no thromboembolic complications were observed in these cohorts [^297cc9b0] [^551cc235] [^ca32f07f].

> But wait, what if the platelet abnormality is genetic and syndromic rather than reactive or clonal. I need to check inherited thrombocytopenias and related entities. Certain inherited platelet disorders, such as Src-related thrombocytopenia and ACTB-associated syndromic thrombocytopenia, feature thrombocytopenia with neurologic complications including epilepsy; these cases illustrate a shared developmental pathway linking hematopoiesis and neurodevelopment, yet they involve low platelet counts, not thrombocytosis, so they do not establish a thrombocytosis–seizure connection [^af939bfb] [^4654759b] [^6c62c4e6].

> I should double-check for medication-related confounders that could masquerade as a platelet–seizure link. Valproate, a common antiseizure medication, causes dose-related thrombocytopenia, not thrombocytosis, and can precipitate hyperammonemic encephalopathy with seizures; conversely, tranexamic acid can cause seizures via direct CNS effects and does not cause thrombocytosis, so these drug effects can confuse the clinical picture without implying a pathophysiologic link between high platelets and seizures [^d71346df] [^01dd01be].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. Across contexts, thrombocytosis and seizures co-occur primarily when thrombocytosis reflects a hypercoagulable state that leads to cerebral thrombosis or when both are epiphenomena of a severe systemic process like infection; there is no robust evidence that platelets themselves generate seizures through a direct neurochemical mechanism, and seizures are not a hallmark of thrombocytosis per se, which argues against a causal relationship and supports an indirect, context-dependent association [^6a89ce22] [^297cc9b0].

> Clinically, I need to ensure the evaluation is targeted. When both thrombocytosis and seizures are present, I should confirm the etiology of thrombocytosis (reactive versus clonal), assess for thrombotic risk and occult malignancy, and evaluate for cerebrovascular disease or CNS infection as seizure triggers; in ET, cytoreduction and antiplatelet therapy are guided by risk stratification, and in suspected TTP, urgent ADAMTS13 testing and plasma exchange are indicated; in children with CNS infection, supportive care and infection-directed therapy are prioritized while monitoring the CBC trend [^4e942aed] [^d8c65433] [^297cc9b0].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Thrombocytosis and seizures are not directly causally linked; they are connected indirectly through thrombosis-related cerebral ischemia in clonal thrombocytosis and through shared severity signals in systemic inflammatory states, whereas several well-described seizure etiologies actually feature thrombocytopenia rather than thrombocytosis; therefore, the prudent approach is to treat the underlying cause of thrombocytosis and the precipitant of seizures rather than assuming a primary platelet–seizure pathophysiology [^6a89ce22] [^5aa22a70] [^297cc9b0].

---

Thrombocytosis and seizures are **not directly causally linked** in most cases, but they can co-occur in specific clinical contexts. The most consistent association is in **essential thrombocythemia (ET)** [^6a89ce22], where thrombocytosis increases the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, including cerebral events that can present with seizures [^notfound]. Seizures can also occur in **thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)** [^5aa22a70], but this is due to microvascular thrombosis and ischemia rather than thrombocytosis itself. In children, reactive thrombocytosis during severe infections or inflammatory states may coincide with seizures, reflecting disease severity rather than a direct platelet effect [^297cc9b0]. Overall, thrombocytosis is best viewed as a risk marker for thrombotic complications that can lead to seizures, rather than a direct cause of seizures.

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking thrombocytosis and seizures

Several **pathophysiological mechanisms** may explain the association between thrombocytosis and seizures:

- **Thrombosis and ischemia**: Elevated platelet counts increase the risk of thrombotic events, including cerebral arterial or venous thrombosis, which can cause ischemic brain injury and seizures [^6a89ce22].

- **Microvascular occlusion**: Platelet aggregates can occlude cerebral microvessels, leading to localized ischemia and neuronal excitability, potentially triggering seizures.

- **Inflammatory cytokines**: Thrombocytosis often coexists with inflammatory states, and cytokines such as IL-6 can increase neuronal excitability and lower seizure thresholds.

---

## Clinical evidence of association

### Essential thrombocythemia (ET)

In essential thrombocythemia (ET), thrombocytosis is a hallmark feature [^6a89ce22], and patients have an increased risk of thrombotic events, including cerebral thrombosis, which can present with seizures. Neurological complications, including seizures, are well-documented in ET [^85aa02f4] and are typically secondary to ischemic events rather than direct platelet toxicity.

---

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)

TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and neurological symptoms, including seizures [^5aa22a70]. Although TTP involves thrombocytopenia rather than thrombocytosis, the pathophysiology of microvascular thrombosis and ischemia provides insight into how platelet-driven thrombosis can lead to seizures [^d8c65433].

---

### Pediatric populations

In pediatric populations, reactive thrombocytosis commonly occurs during infections or inflammatory conditions [^notfound]. Seizures in these contexts are typically due to the underlying illness rather than thrombocytosis itself. However, elevated platelet counts have been observed in children with severe infections who experience seizures, suggesting a correlation rather than causation [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic implications

When evaluating a patient with seizures and concurrent thrombocytosis, clinicians should consider the following **diagnostic steps**:

- **Determine the cause of thrombocytosis**: Differentiate between primary (clonal) thrombocytosis, such as ET, and secondary (reactive) thrombocytosis due to infection, inflammation, or malignancy [^b519ddbb].

- **Evaluate for thrombotic events**: Assess for cerebral arterial or venous thrombosis using neuroimaging (MRI or CT angiography) and consider antiphospholipid syndrome or other thrombophilias [^notfound].

- **Assess inflammatory markers**: Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may indicate reactive thrombocytosis and guide further evaluation [^9663650a].

---

## Management strategies

Management of seizures in the context of thrombocytosis focuses on addressing the **underlying cause** and preventing further thrombotic events:

- **Treat the underlying condition**: For ET, cytoreductive therapy (hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha, or anagrelide) and antiplatelet therapy (aspirin) are recommended to reduce thrombotic risk [^a6021128] [^e609b972].

- **Anticoagulation**: In cases of cerebral venous thrombosis or other thrombotic events, anticoagulation therapy may be indicated [^notfound].

- **Seizure management**: Standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are used to control seizures, with consideration of potential drug interactions and side effects [^notfound].

---

## Prognostic significance

The presence of thrombocytosis in patients with seizures may indicate a higher risk of recurrent thrombotic events and neurological complications. However, prognosis largely depends on the **underlying cause of thrombocytosis**, the effectiveness of treatment, and the presence of additional risk factors such as cardiovascular disease or malignancy [^4e942aed].

---

Thrombocytosis and seizures are **not directly causally linked** but can co-occur in specific clinical contexts, particularly in essential thrombocythemia and thrombotic disorders. The association is primarily mediated by thrombotic events leading to ischemic brain injury. Accurate diagnosis and targeted management of the underlying cause are essential for optimal patient outcomes.

### Thrombocytosis in the NICU [^9663650a]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

An elevated platelet count may occur during care of neurology/neurosurgical patients and is usually due to reactive or secondary thrombocytosis (ST) caused by inflammation or infection. Primary (clonal) thrombocythemia or essential thrombocythemia associated with myeloproliferative disorders is usually known before or during early patient assessment. Rarely, paraneoplastic causes of thrombocytosis may be discovered. Although no single test differentiates primary from secondary etiologies, laboratory tests that show increased acute phase responses, such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6, may be useful in diagnosing ST. Thrombosis due to ST is rare in any platelet count. ST, however, should be considered within the overall risk assessment for thromboembolism in any patient. If treatment is initiated, low-dose aspirin is sufficient.

Essential thrombocythaemia is one of the chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms and is characterised by a sustained platelet count ≥ 450 x 10(9)/l. The clinical course is often indolent but a significant number of patients have thrombotic and haemorrhagic complications. A patient with neurological complications is described, and the pathogenesis and clinical features of this disease are reviewed, including its neurological sequelae and management, along with an outline for the investigation of patients with thrombocytosis.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

### A toddler with new seizures, progressive white matter lesions, and multifocal microhemorrhages [^ea19f87a]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A 16-month-old, previously healthy male is hospitalized for new onset seizures. Initial investigation is significant for enterovirus/rhinovirus respiratory infection, abnormal T2 signal predominantly in the white matter and scattered microhemorrhages on brain MRI, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. His symptoms initially improve on steroid therapy and he is discharged from the hospital. During the ensuing month with the tapering of the steroids, he develops new motor deficits for which he is rehospitalized. His laboratory investigation on readmission is unremarkable. However, there is significant progression of white matter lesions and microhemorrhages on repeat MRI. While in the hospital, he becomes febrile and has seizure recurrence and worsening neurologic symptoms, including cerebral salt wasting and encephalopathy. Subsequent neuroimaging demonstrates cerebral edema and diffuse brain injury. A high index of suspicion for a rare condition ultimately leads us to perform the specialized testing that confirms the diagnosis. We will discuss the diagnostic challenges that arise from an atypical presentation of an uncommon condition, and from the disease progression that is modified by previous interventions.

There are so few true haematological emergencies that they are often way down the list as a differential diagnosis. Those that do exist, however, can prove devastatingly fatal if left untreated and a case is presented of one such possible diagnosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which falls into the remit of many possible presenting conditions. Particularly prevalent in young adults, this condition must always be thought of in any patient presenting with confusion, renal impairment, fever or other neurological abnormalities.

### Is essential thrombocytosis associated with worse outcomes in patients with stroke? Results from 2016–2020 national inpatient sample study… [^13e8753f]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e23060 Background: Essential thrombocythemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Thrombosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in ET. It is unknown whether the morbidity and mortality of ischemic stroke in ET is different from that in non-ET patients. Similarly, the quantitative data regarding the use of platelet pheresis in this population is also unknown. This National Inpatient Sample database study aims to answer these questions. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the NIS database from 2016 to 2020 was conducted using ICD-10 codes to identify hospitalizations with ischemic stroke. STATA version SE18. 0 was used for statistical analysis.

We used multivariate regression analysis to calculate the effects of ET on mortality and length of stay along with various other variables including age, gender, primary payer, household income, Charlson Comorbidity index, hospital bed size, hospital region, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, coronary artery disease, smoking, hyperlipidemia, carotid artery stenosis, and atrial fibrillation. Results: There were 2, 635, 595 hospitalizations with primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke. Among these, 9604 patients had secondary diagnosis of ET. The mean age of ET patients with stroke was 67 years.
60. 5% of patients were females. 40, 335 and 720 patients underwent plateletpheresis, thrombectomy, and thrombolysis respectively. Multivariate logistic regression showed that ET was not associated with increased mortality, but was associated with significantly increased length of stay with odds ratio of 0. 95 [95% confidence interval = 
0. 73 to 1.

23, p-value = 
0. 7) and 2. 58 respectively. The effect of other pertinent variables are summarized in Table 1. Conclusions: Our analysis shows that stoke in ET was not associated with increased mortality. ET was associated with increased length of stay in patients with stroke.
0. 41% of ET patients with stroke received platelet pheresis. Limitations of this study include failure of the multivariate model to account for all the variables, coding errors, and increased risk of bias due to retrospective nature of the data.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a thrombotic disorder caused by ADAMTS13 deficiency [^1373355b]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

A serious disorder with characteristic microvascular thrombosis involving the brain and other organs, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) typically presents with thrombocytopenia, hemolysis with schistocytes on blood smears, and mental changes or seizures. It may progress rapidly to a fatal end if the patient is not treated immediately with plasma. Recent advances have shown that TTP is caused by deficiency of a circulating, von Willebrand factor cleaving metalloprotease, ADAMTS13. This new knowledge will provide clues to improve the diagnosis and management of this intriguing disease.

### Artery of percheron: an unusual stroke presentation [^39ea40ac]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

An 86-year-old woman was admitted with multiple episodes of transient loss of consciousness. She was initially treated for seizures, and stroke was not considered likely. MRI on the same day of admission showed acute bilateral medial thalamic infarcts in keeping with the Artery of Percheron (AOP) territory infarcts. Investigation for polycythaemia and thrombocytosis showed JAK2 positive myeloproliferative neoplasm. A diagnosis of AOP infarction is often missed or delayed because it is rare and presents with variable neurological symptoms. Initial imaging in the form of CT is often negative, and some report that initial MRI findings may also be normal. An awareness of a wide range of differential diagnoses alongside a multi-modality imaging approach is required to reach a diagnosis. Although there are several other case reports of AOP infarction in the literature, this is the first to present with transient symptoms initially mistaken for seizure activity.

### Incidence of cancer among adults with thrombocytosis in Canada… [^f12833c4]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess whether a new diagnosis of thrombocytosis is associated with a subsequent risk of cancer among adults. Design, Setting, and Participants. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, an increased platelet count was associated with an increased risk of cancer for at least 2 years. The results suggest that individuals with unexplained thrombocytosis should be offered screening for several cancers. The discovery that spontaneous thrombosis was often followed by a diagnosis of cancer was made in 1865 by Armand Trousseau. 1 The onset of venous thromboembolism has been seen with several types of cancer. 2–4 Patients with newly diagnosed cancer often have concomitant thrombocytosis, which is typically defined as a platelet count greater than 450 × 109/L.
5. We performed 2 sensitivity analyses to explore associations under different design conditions.

First, we measured the association of a high platelet count with cancer using an alternate cutoff of 400 × 109/L for thrombocytosis. In the second sensitivity analysis, we restricted the assessment of the association between a high platelet count and cancer to the results of routine blood tests done in a family practice setting. For this analysis, we restricted the data to CBC tests ordered by a patient's family doctor. Both analyses required rematching of exposed to unexposed patients using the same procedure as in the initial match. The relative risk was greatest during the 6-month period after the diagnosis of thrombocytosis and decreased rapidly thereafter.

This finding suggests that thrombocytosis may be a clinical marker for the presence of an existing cancer rather than being a factor associated with increased cancer risk and that cancer may lead to thrombocytosis rather than thrombocytosis being associated with the risk of developing a new cancer. If thrombocytosis is associated with cancer, instead of being a marker of cancer, the risk period would likely be more prolonged. In this study, for cancers associated with an increased short-term mortality rate, such as pancreatic and esophageal cancer, the risk of cancer after a diagnosis of thrombocytosis decreased rapidly. The risk of pancreatic cancer was 3. 8-fold higher than that expected during the first 6 months after a diagnosis of thrombocytosis but was

1. 3-fold higher from 6 months to 5 years after the diagnosis.

### Seizures and epilepsy in cancer: etiologies, evaluation, and management [^7c5845da]. Current Oncology Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Seizure and epilepsy are common neurologic issues in cancer patients. Etiologies include structural abnormalities of the brain (eg, brain metastasis), cerebrovascular disease, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), and radiation toxicity. Seizures associated with these etiologies often have focal features. Metabolic causes include hypoglycemia, electrolyte abnormalities, tumor lysis syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and medications used in cancer. A careful clinical evaluation can suggest the seizure etiology and guide subsequent work-up. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be suspected with persistent decreased level of consciousness following a seizure. Certain etiologies, such as RPLS and TTP, must be treated aggressively to minimize permanent neurologic injury. Routine prophylaxis with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is not recommended in patients with primary brain tumors or brain metastasis who have never had a seizure. Where indicated, the selection of AEDs should take into consideration side effects and interactions with chemotherapy. For this reason, non-enzyme-inducing AEDs are preferable in the cancer setting.

### Prolonged refractory status epilepticus related to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^80a5a38d]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an extremely rare cause of status epilepticus. Review of literature demonstrated only four cases of brief status epilepticus (SE) associated with TTP.

Case

We describe a young woman with yet incomplete neurological recovery after prolonged refractory status epilepticus. Management required pentobarbital-induced coma for 60 days. Five months after onset, she was conversant and oriented with continued neuromuscular deficits.

Conclusions

This is an unusual presentation of severe refractory SE associated with TTP. With aggressive life support and prolonged pentobarbital infusion, however, survival and the chance of meaningful recovery appear to be possible.

### Src-related thrombocytopenia: a fine line between a megakaryocyte dysfunction and an immune-mediated disease [^af939bfb]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Src-related thrombocytopenia (SRC-RT) is a rare autosomal dominant, inherited platelet disorder resulting from the p.E527K heterozygous germline gain-of-function variant of Src. To date, genetic diagnosis of the disease has only been reported in 7 patients from 3 unrelated families. The clinical features ranged from isolated thrombocytopenia to complex syndromic manifestations characterized by thrombocytopenia, bleeding, myelofibrosis, splenomegaly, and bone disease. We report a new 3-generation kindred with the Src p.E527K variant. Patients presented with rather variable platelet counts (38–139 × 109/L), mildly impaired platelet function, > 15% immature platelet fraction, and with a significant proportion of large-giant platelets. Four adults from the family were diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and underwent splenectomy, achieving sustained platelet counts > 75 × 109/L for several years; increases in platelet counts were also observed after corticosteroid therapy. Four of 7 Src p.E527K variant carriers showed immune defects and recurrent infections. In addition, a range of neurological symptoms, from specific language impairment to epilepsy, was seen in some family members. Patient platelets exhibited constitutive Src, Bruton tyrosine kinase, and phospholipase Cγ2 activation, and after stimulating CD19 cells by crosslinking surface immunoglobulin M, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was significantly increased in B cells from individuals carrying the Src p.E527K substitution. In summary, in addition to causing impaired platelet production, SRC-RT may associate immune dysregulation and increased platelet consumption. In families in whom several members are responsive to ITP-directed therapies, an underlying Src p.E527K variant should be excluded.

### Differential diagnosis and management of thrombocytopenia in childhood [^d2b6f5ec]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with a firm knowledge of the major causes of thrombocytopenia and their treatments, and to form a broad differential diagnosis, so that it will be clearer when to consider a rare etiology. The various etiologies are presented by known disease entities, grouped by age, and described as they would occur and be considered in a realistic clinical setting. A brief categorization of causes of thrombocytopenia by mechanism, notably abnormal platelet production, platelet destruction, or sequestration, is included. With each disease process, the pathophysiology as it is currently known is described and discussed.

### Tranexamic acid-associated seizures: causes and treatment [^01dd01be]. Annals of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Antifibrinolytic drugs are routinely used worldwide to reduce the bleeding that results from a wide range of hemorrhagic conditions. The most commonly used antifibrinolytic drug, tranexamic acid, is associated with an increased incidence of postoperative seizures. The reported increase in the frequency of seizures is alarming, as these events are associated with adverse neurological outcomes, longer hospital stays, and increased in‐hospital mortality. However, many clinicians are unaware that tranexamic acid causes seizures. The goal of this review is to summarize the incidence, risk factors, and clinical features of these seizures. This review also highlights several clinical and preclinical studies that offer mechanistic insights into the potential causes of and treatments for tranexamic acid–associated seizures. This review will aid the medical community by increasing awareness about tranexamic acid–associated seizures and by translating scientific findings into therapeutic interventions for patients.

### Evaluation of children with acute central nervous system infections admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and pediatric ward: a retrospective study [^297cc9b0]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The presence of a low leukocyte count in the CSF has been reported as a definitive factor associated with PICU admission. Patients diagnosed with encephalitis often require PICU admission because of the potentially life-threatening nature of the disease. The higher number of patients diagnosed with encephalitis among patients with CNS infections requiring PICU admission may have led to a significantly lower CSF leukocyte count in patients hospitalized in the PICU than in patients in the pediatric ward. A study involving pediatric patients with ABM found that a low WBC count in the CSF, along with elevated protein and/or reduced glucose levels, was associated with adverse outcomes. The rare absence of pleocytosis in the CSF often leads to unfavorable patient outcomes. A decreased WBC count in the CSF may indicate a compromised host immunity and an inadequate response, leading to unfavorable clinical outcomes.

The presence of generalized seizure and status epilepticus in pediatric patients with encephalitis has been identified as a factor associated with the need for PICU admission. Impaired consciousness is an independent risk factor associated with a less favorable prognosis in pediatric patients with ABM. Our study demonstrated that a significantly higher number of patients presenting with impaired consciousness and seizure upon admission required PICU admission. Increased activity of the reticular activation system and damage to the cerebral cortex can contribute to impaired consciousness.

An elevated platelet counts due to increased megakaryocyte production and thrombopoiesis is a characteristic of secondary thrombocytosis, and underlying infections usually cause this reactive process. The relationship between platelet counts and the outcomes of pediatric infections is still a topic of debate. Patients with lower respiratory tract infections and elevated platelet counts may experience severe clinical progression. Thrombocytosis is linked to the severity of urinary tract infections. Our study found a significant increase in platelet counts among patients with CNS infections requiring PICU care compared with those not needing PICU care. This finding suggests a link between platelet count and the severity of CNS infection requiring PICU admission. None of the patients experienced thromboembolic complications, and reactive thrombocytosis manifested as a CNS infection. Subsequent to infection treatment, the thrombocytosis subsided, rendering additional therapeutic interventions unnecessary.

### Recognition of thrombotic risk of thrombocytosis in iron deficiency [^15bb66cc]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the overwhelming preponderance of published evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of intravenous iron, reluctance to its use among practitioners prevails due to heightened concerns of danger fomented, at least in part, by misinformation and misinterpretation of the incidence and clinical nature of serious adverse events occurring in recipients of this treatment. The convincing evidence brought forth from these well-performed in vitro experiments and animal models provides information not only on a long-sought physiological mechanism for a commonly observed clinical event but more importantly on the need to heighten the awareness of a readily prescribed treatment modality which mitigates its occurrence.

### Evaluation of children with acute central nervous system infections admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and pediatric ward: a retrospective study [^551cc235]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The findings of this study of pediatric patients with CNS infections provide valuable insights on the early recognition of children at risk of requiring PICU admission. The need for PICU admission may be linked to factors such as impaired consciousness and the presence of seizure and thrombocytosis upon admission. Serum CRP level is an important biomarker that can be used to indicate the presence of bacterial meningitis. Our research indicates the importance of not disregarding the possibility of bacterial meningitis, even when the initial CSF examination results appear normal. A combination of CSF parameters, CRP levels, and clinical evaluation is often necessary to accurately diagnose bacterial CNS infections.

### Polycythemia vera… [^2db19650]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Diagnosis PV should be suspected when hemoglobin and/or hematocrit levels are elevated in white men and 47 percent in blacks and women). 3 PV also should be suspected in patients with portal venous thrombosis and splenomegaly with or without thrombocytosis and leukocytosis. Other signs and symptoms are listed in Table 1. 1, 4 In making the diagnosis of PV, the physician must first exclude a secondary erythrocytosis. Major diagnostic criteria include increased RCM, normal oxygen saturation, and the presence of splenomegaly. The test for RCM is a nuclear medicine study involving autologous infusion of radio-labeled red blood cells followed by serial phlebotomy to determine distribution. Physicians may refer patients to a specialty laboratory for this study.

The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Serum erythropoietin, bone marrow histopathology and karyotype, and the presence of endogenous erythroid colonies have been proposed as diagnostic tests for PV. Because PV is an autonomous erythroid proliferation, serum EPO levels in PV are low or normal. Although serum EPO levels and marrow biopsies may become a routine diagnostic option, the PVSG criteria remain the standard of diagnosis. Consultation with a hematologist is appropriate to aid in diagnosis, and serum EPO levels and bone marrow biopsy should be considered if available. An algorithm summarizing the evaluation and management of PV is presented in.

19 The PVSG found a statistically significant increase in the number of thrombotic events within the first three years of initiating treatment, compared with the use of myelosuppressive agents. 14 After this period, however, the rate of thrombosis remained the same for both treatment approaches. Furthermore, the GISP found an added independent dimension to the risk of thrombosis — rates increase with age and a history of thrombotic events. PV produces microvascular sequelae whose symptoms, while not life threatening, can be bothersome to patients.

### Divalproex sodium [^a83f8df9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Bleeding and Other Hematopoietic Disorders

Valproate is associated with dose-related thrombocytopenia. In a clinical trial of valproate as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients (27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets ≤ 75 x 109/L. Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts to normal. In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment. In this study, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males). The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse effects. Valproate use has also been associated with decreases in other cell lines and myelodysplasia.

Because of reports of cytopenias, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters, (e.g., low fibrinogen, coagulation factor deficiencies, acquired von Willebrand's disease), measurements of complete blood counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals. It is recommended that patients receiving divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets be monitored for blood counts and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery and during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy.

5.9 Hyperammonemia

Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured. Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued. Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.10)].

Asymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels. If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered.

### A review and assessment of drug-induced thrombocytosis [^fec662b1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this article is to review the current literature on drug-induced thrombocytosis with the goal of critically assessing causality and providing a comprehensive review of the topic. Thrombopoietic growth factors, such as thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (romiplostim and eltrombopag) and erythropoietin are not included in our review.

Data Sources

The literature search included published articles limited to the English language and humans in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases. MEDLINE/PubMed (1966 to September 2018) was searched using the MeSH terms thrombocytosis/chemically-induced and thrombocytosis/etiology. EMBASE (1980 to September 2018) was searched using the EMTAGS thrombocytosis/side effect. Web of Science (1970 to September 2018) was searched using the search term thrombocytosis. References of all relevant articles were reviewed for additional citations and information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Review articles, clinical trials, background data, case series, and case reports of drug-induced thrombocytosis were collected, and case reports were assessed for causality using a modified Naranjo nomogram.

Data Synthesis

Drug-induced thrombocytosis, a form of reactive thrombocytosis cannot be easily differentiated from more common etiologies of reactive thrombocytosis. In all, 43 case reports of drug-induced thrombocytosis from a wide variety of drugs and drug classes were reviewed using a modified Naranjo probability scale that included criteria specific for thrombocytosis.

Conclusions

Drug-induced thrombocytosis is a relatively rare adverse drug reaction. The strongest evidence of causality supports low-molecular-weight heparins and neonatal drug withdrawal. Weaker evidence exists for all-trans retinoic acid, antibiotics, clozapine, epinephrine, gemcitabine, and vinca alkaloids.

### The contribution of platelet studies to the understanding of disease mechanisms in complex and monogenetic neurological disorders [^308b6701]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Platelets, known for their role in primary haemostasis, prevent excessive bleeding after injury. The study of platelets has, therefore, traditionally focused on bleeding disorders. It has recently become evident, however, that platelet research can contribute to unravelling the disease mechanisms that underlie neuropathological disorders that have a subtle subclinical platelet phenotype. Platelets and neurosecretory cells have common gene expression profiles and share several biological features. This review provides a literature update on the use of platelets as easily accessible cells to study neurological disorders. We provide examples of the use of different platelet-based tests to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for both complex and monogenetic neuropathological disorders. In addition to the well-studied regulated granule secretion and serotonin metabolism, more recent studies have shown that defects in transcription factors, membrane transporters, G-protein signal transduction, and cytoskeletal proteins can be investigated using platelets to gain information on their role in neuropathology.

### What's in a number? Examining the prognostic and predictive importance of platelet count in patients with essential thrombocythemia [^7f6bd403]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2020). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal overproduction of platelets and an increased risk of thrombohemorrhagic complications. Patients are risk stratified by driver mutation, age, and thrombotic history and treated to reduce the risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. The significance of platelet number as a risk factor or treatment goal is unclear. Despite the preponderance of data failing to demonstrate an association, there exists a pervasive belief that higher platelet counts correlate with an increased thrombotic risk. In fact, the association between thrombocytosis and bleeding is more clearly supported. Variability in regional consensus guidelines contributes to the uncertainty. This article reviews the data that shed light on the importance of platelet count in patients with ET.

### Cerebrovascular manifestations in hematological diseases: an update [^d8c65433]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is due to a genetic or acquired severe deficiency of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving serine protease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), allowing unrestrained adhesion of the von Willebrand factor multimers to platelets and microthrombi formation, resulting in thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and tissue ischemia, mostly in the kidney and brain. The most frequent form of TTP is acquired immune-mediated (iTTP). TTP is a severe, relapsing life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy, which critically depends on the clinician making a rapid diagnosis and starting treatment as soon as possible. The diagnosis is suspected on clinical (classical pentad of fever, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, and changes in mental status) and laboratory (anemia with schistocytes, increased reticulocytes (> 2.5%), thrombocytopenia, indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin > 2 mg/dL, undetectable haptoglobin, high lactate dehydrogenase) grounds and confirmed by very low levels (< 10%) of ADAMTS3. TTP causes a thrombotic microangiopathy with diffuse microthrombi formation in the microcirculation and hypoperfusion. Neurological involvement manifests as a stroke/TIA or as an encephalopathy with vigilance and mental status disturbances and/or seizures. Survival in iTTP has improved significantly since the introduction of plasma exchange as standard therapy, combined with immunosuppression with steroids, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, or vincristine. Recently, the addition of caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor humanized immunoglobulin fragment, to plasma exchange and immunosuppression, leads to reduced incidence of TTP-related death, TTP recurrence, stroke, and other thromboembolic events. We do not use aspirin, as there is limited evidence on its efficacy and safety. However, aspirin, is suggested by some experts, if platelet counts are above 50,000/µL. Platelet transfusions may cause a slightly increased risk of thrombosis in patients with TTP. Prophylactic platelet transfusions are not used in patients with TTP in the absence of severe bleeding or a required invasive procedure.

### Pattern of brain injury in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in the precaplacizumab era [^45f16472]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe short- and long-term neurologic prognosis of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and to identify clusters associated with evolution.

Design

Prospective French cohort.

Setting

ICU in a reference center.

Patients

All consecutive patients with newly diagnosed thrombocytopenic purpura.

Intervention

Comprehensive clinical, biological, and radiological evaluation at admission. Neurocognitive recovery was assessed using Glasgow Outcome Scale (range 1–5, with 1 representing death and 5 representing no or minimal neurologic deficit).

Measurements and Main Results

Among the 130 newly diagnosed patients with thrombocytopenic purpura, 108 (83%; age 43 [30–52]; 73% women) presented with neurologic signs, including headaches (51%), limb weakness, paresthesia, and/or aphasia (49%), pyramidal syndrome (30%), decreased consciousness (20%), seizure (19%), cognitive impairment (34%), cerebellar syndrome (18%), and visual symptoms (20%). A hierarchical cluster analysis identified three distinct groups of patients. Cluster 1 included younger patients (37 [27–48], 41 [32–52], and 48 [35–54], in clusters 1, 2 and 3, respectively; p = 0.045), with a predominance of headaches (75%, 27%, and 36%; p < 0.0001). Cluster 2 patients had ataxic gait and cerebellar syndrome (77%, 0%, and 0%; p < 0.0001) and dizziness (50%, 0%, and 0%; p < 0.0001). Cluster 3 included patients with delirium (36%, 0%, and 9%; p < 0.0001), obtundation (58%, 0%, and 24%; p < 0.0001), and seizure (36%, 0%, and 14%; p < 0.0001). Acute kidney injury was 32%, 68%, and 77%, in clusters 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p < 0.0001). The three clusters did not differ for other biological or brain imaging. After a median follow-up of 34 months (12–71 mo), 100 patients (93%) were alive with full neurocognitive recovery (i.e. Glasgow Outcome Scale score 5) in 89 patients (89%). Patients from cluster 1 more frequently exhibited full recovery (Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 5) compared with clusters 2 and 3, (44 [98%], 13 [65%], and 21 [60%] at 3 mo; p < 0.0001), (44 [100%], 15 [68%], and 23 [69%] at 6 mo; p < 0.0001), and (40 [100%], 15 [79%], and 20 [57%] at 1 yr; p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Initial clinical neurologic evaluation in thrombocytopenic purpura patients distinguishes three groups of patients with different clinical and functional outcomes.

5.9	Hematopoietic Complications

Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin (the active metabolite of CEREBYX). These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression.

There have been a number of reports that have suggested a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized), including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. Macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported with phenytoin.

In a clinical trial of valproate as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients (27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets ≤ 75 x 109/L.

The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse effects.

Because of reports of thrombocytopenia, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters, (e.g., low fibrinogen), platelet counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals. It is recommended that patients receiving divalproex sodium be monitored for platelet count and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery. Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy.

5.9 Hyperammonemia

Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured. Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued. Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.10)].

Asymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels. If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered.

### Evaluation of children with acute central nervous system infections admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and pediatric ward: a retrospective study [^ca32f07f]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Acute central nervous system (CNS) infections in children can lead to neurological complications and mortality. This study aimed to identify the clinical manifestations, laboratory parameters, and cerebrospinal fluid characteristics indicative of CNS infections and define the risk factors that lead to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission in the pediatric population of Şanlıurfa, a city in southeastern Turkey.

Methods

This retrospective analysis included patients aged 1 month to 18 years who were treated for acute CNS infections in the Şanlıurfa Training and Research Hospital between January 2020 and May 2023. Clinical data were obtained from the hospital electronic medical records.

Results

A total of 68 patients with acute CNS infections were included in this study. The median patient age was 3 (0.94–8.75) years. Fever was the most prevalent symptom in 92.6% of the patients. Of the total, 25% (n = 17) of the patients had an identified causative agent and 35.3% (n = 24) were admitted to the PICU. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly higher in patients with bacterial meningitis than in those with viral meningitis (p = 0.007). Patients with impaired consciousness and seizure were significantly more likely to require admission to the PICU than patients without these conditions (both p < 0.001). Patients requiring PICU admission had significantly higher platelet counts (p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Impaired consciousness, seizure, and thrombocytosis on admission were important risk factors for PICU admission. Serum CRP levels can serve as an indicator of bacterial meningitis. A combination of physical findings from clinical evaluations and laboratory data is necessary to accurately diagnose bacterial CNS infections.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^91cea4a5]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

2 DISCUSSION

Thrombocytosis is a common finding in routine blood exams and a common cause of referral to the hematologist for further investigation. From a physiopathological point of view, thrombocytosis can be categorized into primary (i.e. depending on the true hematological disease), secondary (i.e. reactive), and spurious (Table 1). As reactive thrombocytosis is more frequent than primary thrombocytosis, it is widely accepted in common clinical practice to search, at first, for causes of secondary thrombocytosis. Thus, blood tests and any other complementary examinations to search for reactive causes (e.g. iron deficiency, infection, inflammatory disease, and hemolysis) should be performed. In addition, a detailed medical history should be obtained, with particular emphasis on the present and past illness and recent surgical intervention (thrombocytosis secondary to malignancy, postoperative thrombocytosis). In addition, a comprehensive and updated list of current medications (including prescription medications, herbals, and over‐the‐counter drugs) should be noted (thrombocytosis caused by administration of corticosteroids, adrenaline, and thrombopoietin mimicking drugs).

This report describes a 10-month-old infant who presented with generalised tonic clonic seizures following 2 days of vomiting, diarrhoea and a low-grade fever. The patient was moderately dehydrated and the blood investigations were remarkable for hyponatraemia (126 mEq/l), leukocytosis (19.4 × 10(3)/l (46% lymphocytes)), thrombocytosis (637 × 10(3)/l), hypoalbuminaemia (albumin 1.9 g/dl) and elevated C reactive protein (96 mg/l). Stool was positive for white and red blood cells but the cultures for bacteria were negative. Rotavirus antigen in stool was positive. There was microscopic haematuria without proteinuria and the nasogastric aspirate was coffee ground. Generalised oedema with pleural and peritoneal effusions ensued requiring drainage, correction of fluid and electrolytes imbalance and albumin infusions. Over the next 72 h, the patient descended into shock and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy which required packed red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma transfusions. By day 12 the patient was clinically and biochemically normal.

Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM) occur in the brain or spinal cord as low flow collections of sinusoidal channels lined with endothelium without tight junctions. The vessels forming these channels lack an elastic/muscular layer and blood in various stages of thrombosis and organization fills these channels. They have a dynamic biology with progressive growth and repeated hemorrhages and can present with headache, seizures or focal neurological signs related to the location and extent of hemorrhage.

The goal of this review is to increase awareness about seizures associated with antifibrinolytic drugs and provide mechanistic‐based prevention and treatment recommendations. The review focuses on TXA, the most commonly used and widely studied antifibrinolytic drug. First, the incidence, risk factors, and clinical features of TXA‐associated seizures are summarized. Next, preclinical and clinical studies that offer insights into the underlying causes of seizures are reviewed. In particular, a study that measured the concentration of TXA in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients undergoing major cardiovascular surgery is considered. The study then compared TXA concentrations in the CSF to TXA concentrations that modulate the activity of neurotransmitter receptors in the brain in vitro. Based on these findings, treatment strategies to mitigate TXA‐associated seizures in patients are proposed.

5.8 Bleeding and Other Hematopoietic Disorders

Valproate is associated with dose-related thrombocytopenia. In a clinical trial of valproate as monotherapy in patients with epilepsy, 34/126 patients (27%) receiving approximately 50 mg/kg/day on average, had at least one value of platelets ≤ 75 x 109/L. Approximately half of these patients had treatment discontinued, with return of platelet counts to normal. In the remaining patients, platelet counts normalized with continued treatment. In this study, the probability of thrombocytopenia appeared to increase significantly at total valproate concentrations of ≥ 110 mcg/mL (females) or ≥ 135 mcg/mL (males). The therapeutic benefit which may accompany the higher doses should therefore be weighed against the possibility of a greater incidence of adverse effects. Valproate use has also been associated with decreases in other cell lines and myelodysplasia.

Because of reports of cytopenias, inhibition of the secondary phase of platelet aggregation, and abnormal coagulation parameters, (e.g., low fibrinogen, coagulation factor deficiencies, acquired von Willebrand's disease), measurements of complete blood counts and coagulation tests are recommended before initiating therapy and at periodic intervals. It is recommended that patients receiving Depakote be monitored for blood counts and coagulation parameters prior to planned surgery and during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Evidence of hemorrhage, bruising, or a disorder of hemostasis/coagulation is an indication for reduction of the dosage or withdrawal of therapy.

5.9 Hyperammonemia

Hyperammonemia has been reported in association with valproate therapy and may be present despite normal liver function tests. In patients who develop unexplained lethargy and vomiting or changes in mental status, hyperammonemic encephalopathy should be considered and an ammonia level should be measured. Hyperammonemia should also be considered in patients who present with hypothermia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)]. If ammonia is increased, valproate therapy should be discontinued. Appropriate interventions for treatment of hyperammonemia should be initiated, and such patients should undergo investigation for underlying urea cycle disorders [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 5.10)].

Asymptomatic elevations of ammonia are more common and when present, require close monitoring of plasma ammonia levels. If the elevation persists, discontinuation of valproate therapy should be considered.

The same hematological picture has been reported also in a few families affected by "platelet-type bleeding disorder-21" (BDPLT21, MIM 617443), also known as " FLI1 -related thrombocytopenia" (FLI1-RT), caused by heterozygous or homozygous mutations in FLI1.

Here, we report a family with mild thrombocytopenia associated with additional congenital abnormalities (Table 1; Figure 1A). According to the Declaration of Helsinki, patients signed written informed consent.

The proband (III-1), born by cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation following a physiological pregnancy (no reported teratogenic risks for drugs or infections during pregnancy), presented at birth with a reduction defect of the right upper limb consisting in slight reduction in the length of the homer, severe hypoplasia of the forearm, radius and ulna, absence of hand with presence of only cutaneous small sketches of the fingers (Figure 1B) and a large sub-aortic ventricular sept defect associated with medium-grade cardiomegaly, which was surgically corrected at 3 months of life. Ocular fundus examination, auditory brainstem response, abdominal ultrasound, and spine x-rays were normal. Psychomotor development was normal. At the age of 21, she experienced the onset of simple partial sensory-motor epileptic seizures. Electroencephalogram showed asynchronous bilateral epileptiform abnormalities in the right parietal and left temporal regions, while cerebral magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated right insular heterotopia and polymicrogyria, with periventricular heterotopic aspects also on the left side that extended to the region of the frontal horn (Figure 1C).

### Cerebral haemorrhage as the presenting feature of myeloproliferative disorder [^b6389f96]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Myeloproliferative disorders predispose individuals to bleeding and thrombosis, often with devastating consequences. We report a 41-year-old man who presented with headache, amnesia and dysphagia due to cerebral haemorrhage. Extensive investigation revealed the cause of the neurological syndrome as an underlying essential thrombocytosis. The patient made a full recovery following extensive inpatient and community rehabilitation, returning to work after 6 months. We discuss the diagnosis and management of stroke due to myeloproliferative conditions. This case report illustrates the importance of multidisciplinary teamwork in fully investigating and treating all patients with acute onset of stroke.

### Trifluoperazine [^b79af151]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

There is no known effective treatment for tardive dyskinesia;
anti-parkinsonism agents do not alleviate the symptoms of this syndrome. If
clinically feasible, it is suggested that all antipsychotic agents be
discontinued if these symptoms appear. Should it be necessary to reinstitute
treatment, or increase the dosage of the agent, or switch to a different
antipsychotic agent, the syndrome may be masked.

It has been reported that fine vermicular movements of the tongue may be an
early sign of the syndrome and if the medication is stopped at that time the
syndrome may not develop.

Adverse effects with different phenothiazines vary in type,
frequency, and mechanism of occurrence, i.e., some are dose-related, while
others involve individual patient sensitivity. Some adverse effects may be more
likely to occur, or occur with greater intensity, in patients with special
medical problems, e.g., patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma
have experienced severe hypotension following recommended doses of certain
phenothiazines.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with
antipsychotic drugs. (See WARNINGS .)

Not all of the following adverse reactions have been observed with every
phenothiazine derivative, but they have been reported with one or more and
should be borne in mind when drugs of this class are administered:
extrapyramidal symptoms (opisthotonos, oculogyric crisis, hyperreflexia,
dystonia, akathisia, dyskinesia, parkinsonism) some of which have lasted months
and even years – particularly in elderly patients with previous brain damage;
grand mal and petit mal convulsions, particularly in patients with EEG
abnormalities or history of such disorders; altered cerebrospinal fluid
proteins; cerebral edema; intensification and prolongation of the action of
central nervous system depressants (opiates, analgesics, antihistamines.
barbiturates, alcohol), atropine, heat, organophosphorus insecticides; autonomic
reactions (dryness of mouth, nasal congestion, headache, nausea, constipation.
obstipation, adynamic ileus, ejaculatory disorders/impotence, priapism, atonic
colon, urinary retention, miosis and mydriasis); reactivation of psychotic
processes, catatonic-like states; hypotension (sometimes fatal); cardiac arrest;
blood dyscrasias (pancytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, leukopenia.
agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia); liver damage
(jaundice, biliary stasis); endocrine disturbances (hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia,

### Marked reactive thrombocytosis in a female with iron deficiency anaemia [^a7af0142]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

This case report presents the clinical evaluation and management of a female patient from a rural background who presented with leg pain, headache, weakness and irritability. Initial investigations revealed iron deficiency anaemia accompanied by a significantly elevated platelet count, prompting suspicion of an underlying myeloproliferative neoplastic disorder. However, subsequent genetic testing ruled out these mutations, suggesting a reactive response to iron deficiency anaemia rather than an independent neoplastic process. Treatment was focused on addressing the underlying iron deficiency anaemia, resulting in significant improvement in the patient's blood profile and resolution of symptoms. Follow-up assessments demonstrated a complete normalisation of the blood profile and platelet counts, further supporting the efficacy of the treatment. This case highlights the importance of considering reactive thrombocytosis in the context of iron deficiency anaemia and emphasises the favourable response achieved through appropriate management strategies.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: prospective neurologic, neuroimaging and neurophysiologic evaluation [^3a958b78]. Haematologica (2001). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Neurologic symptoms are present in 60% of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) on initial examination and ultimately develop in about 90% of cases during the course of the disease. Despite central nervous system involvement being frequent, abnormalities in the brain of patients with TTP are infrequent on neuroimaging (CT/MRI) and neurophysiologic (EEG) evaluation, often reversible and mainly limited to symptomatic stages of the disease. The aim of our study was to establish the value of a complete neurologic screening as part of the work up of TTP.

Design and Methods

We prospectively evaluated 16 TTP patients, performing serial neurologic, neuroimaging and EEG examinations, independently of the presence of an objective central nervous system involvement.

Results

Our study shows that a complete neurologic evaluation is of modest help in improving the diagnosis of TTP, but may be useful for the neurologic management.

Interpretation and Conclusions

Accurate neuroimaging and, especially, EEG evaluation and monitoring allowed us to identify patients who could benefit from anticonvulsive therapy, avoiding the unnecessary administration of the latter. The prognostic utility of complete neurologic screening in TTP remains to be conclusively demonstrated in larger prospective neurologic studies.

Patient 7

A male born in 1979 was diagnosed with ITP at the age of 6 years (platelet count at diagnosis, 98 × 10 9 /L). In January 2020, he was started on 48 mg/d of methylprednisolone, at a platelet count of 4 × 10 9 /L. After 9 weeks, the platelet count increased to 91 × 10 9 /L, and the patient underwent splenectomy (spleen of 18 × 12 × 8 cm). Since then, platelet counts have remained above 150 × 10 9 /L (Figure 1B) with IPF between 13.1% and 22.6%. In addition to mild IgM and gammaglobulin deficiency (35 mg/dL and 8 g/L, respectively), he presented with symptoms of immune dysregulation such as psoriasis, severe persistent bronchial asthma, ileal Crohn disease, and autoimmune pleuro-pericarditis (Table 1). The patient has also suffered from various vascular events such as portal thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and jugular vein thrombosis. Since 2000, he has presented complex, partial epileptic seizures with a frequency of 6 to 8 per month, and in January 2018 he underwent right anterior and medial temporal lobe resection with residual cognitive impairment and reduced but persistent (2–3 per month) seizure episodes.

Patient 9

A male born in 2001 was diagnosed with inherited thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 38 × 10 9 /L, and with mega-cisterna magna at the age of 6 days, without subsequent associated neurological impairment. At present, the patient maintains platelet counts below 40 × 10 9 /L with an IPF of 30.3% to 35.6%. In the absence of hemorrhagic symptoms, he has not received specific treatment for thrombocytopenia. Ultrasound evaluation identified a mildly enlarged spleen (14.3 cm) at age 19 years. Biochemical and hematological features indicate partial IgA deficiency (41 mg/dL; NR, 70–400 mg/dL), mild hypogammaglobulinemia (6 g/L), and a reduction in the CD19 + CD27 + IgM-IgD-B memory switched plasmablast subpopulation (5.21%; NR, 6.5%-29.1%). He suffers recurrent asthma and bronchitis episodes.

### Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: case report and literature review [^5fcd47d8]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)-related cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) has been described in 10 prior case reports in the English language medical literature. We report the first case of low molecular weight HIT-related CVST with detailed clinical course and novel therapeutic approach.

Methods

A 69-year-old woman presented with a focal seizure after total hip replacement. Enoxaparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis had been initiated 8 days prior to the seizure.

Results

The patient experienced progressive neurologic deterioration, and MRI and CT angiography were consistent with cerebral sinus thrombosis (CVST). The new onset of thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and positive heparin ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and SRA (serotonin release assay) assays confirmed HIT. In spite of aggressive management of HIT-related CVST, including argatroban therapy and endovascular mechanical thrombolysis, the patient expired.

Conclusions

A review of the previous 10 case reports in the literature confirms that HIT-related CVST is often a fatal condition, particularly when diagnosed in comatose patients. Because the diagnosis is rare and often delayed relative to initial presentation, prevention is the key to improve patient outcomes. Newer anticoagulants with different mechanism of action than heparin are currently under review by the FDA; they will facilitate prevention of HIT-related CVST and other HIT-related neurological complications.

### Incidence of thrombocytopenia-associated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis: a population-based study [^98a55b42]. BMJ Neurology Open (2024). High credibility.

Methods

The broad method of our study has been previously described. For the purpose of the current analysis, we examined all 105 cases of CVST from this cohort to determine the proportion that met Level 1 Brighton criteria for TTS(ie, thrombosis with a new onset of a platelet count of < 150×10 9 /L). 'New onset' was defined as thrombocytopenia with an obtainable presymptomatic normal result or thrombocytopenia without a documented medical history of this. We excluded cases with only one thrombocytopenic recording (n = 3) to exclude those with possible clumping artefacts. We subsequently assessed cases for the presence of a 'VITT-like' illness by reviewing the clinical data and investigations. Incidence rates were calculated per million per year, with CIs calculated from the Poisson distribution. The waiver of consent was provided by the ethics committees of all Adelaide public hospitals.

### Different clinical severity of first episodes and recurrences of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^5a2da82a]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

The clinical course of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is characterized by recurrent disease episodes in up to 50% of cases. The clinical presentation and severity of different TTP episodes have not been systematically compared. Laboratory and clinical information from 51 patients with recurrent disease, derived from 136 patients with TTP included in the Milan TTP registry (URL: http://www.ttpdatabase.org), were used to compare mortality, symptoms and disease-related laboratory measurements in different disease episodes. The prevalence of severe neurological symptoms (coma, seizures, and focal neurological defects) was significantly lower in recurrences than in the first episode. Platelet counts and haemoglobin levels at presentation were higher in recurrences than in the first disease episode, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were lower. Also, mortality tended to be lower in the second and third disease episodes than in the first. Recurrences of TTP are generally milder than first episodes. These differences in severity should be taken into account in clinical research on TTP and in patient management.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^4654759b]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

A necessary step in the synthesis of oligosaccharides is the transport of cytidine monophosphate-bound sialic acid to the Golgi apparatus. This requires a transporter protein SLC35A1, whose molecular deficiency was recently reported in two siblings with moderate thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, and mild bleeding. The macrothrombocytopenia is syndromic, featuring delayed psychomotor development, epilepsy, ataxia, microcephaly and choreiform movements. Exome sequencing highlighted a homozygous missense mutation in SLC35A1 in both siblings; their consanguineous parents were heterozygous. Lectin binding confirmed abnormally high β-galactose exposure on platelets from the patients and increased numbers of reticulated platelets. Bone marrow biopsies showed a high percentage of immature megakaryocytes, yet in culture megakaryocytes from the patients showed normal maturation and proplatelet formation. However quantification of platelet survival using a non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mouse model confirmed that the patients' platelets had a very short lifespan. In a separate study, severe thrombocytopenia with enlarged platelets and dysplastic megakaryocytes was the characteristic of six members of a consanguineous family in whom WES and homozygosity mapping revealed a homozygous mutation in GALE, encoding UDP-galactose-4-epimerase, an enzyme responsible for UDP-galactose inter-conversion with UDP-glucose and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine inter-conversion with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Some individuals also showed mild anemia and febrile neutropenia while galactosemia is a feature of mutations of this gene. With predicted protein instability, the enzyme retained 40% of its normal activity. Knockdown of GALE in hematopoietic cells slowed the proliferation of these cells in liquid culture; larger colonies possibly reflected an increased presence of immature cells.

### Cefpodoxime proxetil [^0adf1c7f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory Changes

Significant laboratory changes that have been reported in adult and pediatric patients in clinical trials of cefpodoxime proxetil, without regard to drug relationship, were:

 Hepatic: Transient increases in AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), GGT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and LDH.

 Hematologic: Eosinophilia, leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, granulocytosis, basophilia, monocytosis, thrombocytosis, decreased hemoglobin, decreased hematocrit, leukopenia, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocythemia, positive Coombs' test, and prolonged PT, and PTT.

 Serum Chemistry: Hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia.

 Renal: Increases in BUN and creatinine.

Most of these abnormalities were transient and not clinically significant.

Post-marketing Experience:

The following serious adverse experiences have been reported: allergic reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme and serum sickness-like reactions, pseudomembranous colitis, bloody diarrhea with abdominal pain, ulcerative colitis, rectorrhagia with hypotension, anaphylactic shock, acute liver injury, in utero exposure with miscarriage, purpuric nephritis, pulmonary infiltrate with eosinophilia, and eyelid dermatitis.

One death was attributed to pseudomembranous colitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Cephalosporin Class Labeling:

In addition to the adverse reactions listed above which have been observed in patients treated with cefpodoxime proxetil, the following adverse reactions and altered laboratory tests have been reported for cephalosporin class antibiotics:

 Adverse Reactions and Abnormal Laboratory Tests: Renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, serum sickness-like reaction, hemorrhage, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia.

Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION and OVERDOSAGE .) If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated.

### Essential thrombocythemia: 2024 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management [^4e942aed]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview

Essential thrombocythemia is a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation-prevalent myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal thrombocytosis; clinical course is often indolent but might be interrupted by thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications, microcirculatory symptoms (e.g., headaches, lightheadedness, and acral paresthesias), and, less frequently, by disease transformation into myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia.

Diagnosis

In addition to thrombocytosis (platelets ≥ 450×10 9 /L), formal diagnosis requires the exclusion of other myeloid neoplasms, including prefibrotic MF, polycythemia vera, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis. Bone marrow morphology typically shows increased number of mature-appearing megakaryocytes distributed in loose clusters.

Genetics

Approximately 80% of patients express myeloproliferative neoplasm driver mutations (JAK2, CALR, MPL), in a mutually exclusive manner; in addition, about 50% harbor other mutations, the most frequent being TET2 (9%-11%), ASXL1 (7%-20%), DNMT3A (7%), and SF3B1 (5%). Abnormal karyotype is seen in < 10% of patients and includes +9/20q-/13q-.

Survival and Prognosis

Life expectancy is less than that of the control population. Median survival is approximately 18years but exceeds > 35years in younger patients. The triple A survival risk model, based on Age, Absolute neutrophil count, and Absolute lymphocyte count, effectively delineates high-, intermediate-1-, intermediate-2-, and low-risk disease with corresponding median survivals of 8, 14, 21, and 47years.

Risk Factors For Thrombosis

Four risk categories are considered: very low (age ≤ 60years, no thrombosis history, JAK2 wild-type), low (same as very low but JAK2 mutation present), intermediate (same as low but age > 60years), and high (thrombosis history or age > 60years with JAK2 mutation).

Mutations and Prognosis

MPL and CALR-1 mutations have been associated with increased risk of MF transformation; spliceosome with inferior overall and MF-free survival; TP53 with leukemic transformation, and JAK2V617F with thrombosis. Leukemic transformation rate at 10years is < 1% but might be higher in JAK2-mutated patients with extreme thrombocytosis and those with abnormal karyotype.

Treatment

The main goal of therapy is to prevent thrombosis. In this regard, once-daily low-dose aspirin is advised for all patients and twice daily for low-risk disease. Cytoreductive therapy is advised for high-risk and optional for intermediate-risk disease. First-line cytoreductive drugs of choice are hydroxyurea and pegylated interferon-α and second-line busulfan.

Additional Content

The current review includes specific treatment strategies in the context of extreme thrombocytosis, pregnancy, splanchnic vein thrombosis, perioperative care, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF, as well as new investigational drugs.

### Neurological disorders in essential thrombocythemia [^85aa02f4]. Haematologica (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with essential thrombocythemia often complain of various subjective neurological symptoms. This prospective study aims to assess their incidence and response to therapy. Among 37 consecutive patients with essential thrombocythemia, 11 presented with neurological symptoms. Among them 4 had thrombotic events, 7 complained of transient or fluctuating subjective symptoms, and one had both. Brain magnetic resonance imagery failed to detect any substratum in patients with subjective symptoms. JAK2V617F mutation was found in 9 of 11 patients with neurological symptoms versus 14 of 26 patients without symptoms. Ten patients received low-dose aspirin for these symptoms: complete resolution was observed in 3, improvement with persisting episodes in 2, and resistance to aspirin in 2 patients, in whom addition of cytoreductive therapy became necessary to resolve those disabling symptoms. In this prospective cohort, 30% of patients with essential thrombocythemia presented neurological symptoms. Aspirin was fully efficient in only 30% of cases. JAK2V617F mutation could be a risk factor for such symptoms.

### Arterial ischemic stroke in a child with β-thalassemia trait and methylentetrahydrofolate reductase mutation [^c55ee092]. Journal of Child Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Genetic and acquired disorders that foster a procoagulable state represent risk factors for stroke in childhood. Although an increased incidence of thromboembolic complications has been reported in patients with thalassemia, severe cerebral thromboembolism has rarely been observed in patients with beta-thalassemia minor. This article describes a case study of a 1-year-old boy who presented with left-sided hemiparesis, seizures, microcytic anemia, and recent infection with reactive thrombocytosis. Ischemic infarction in the territory of the right middle cerebral artery was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography. Genetic tests showed that the patient was heterozygous for the beta(degrees) -thalassemia IVS-I-1 mutation and homozygous for the methylentetrahydrofolate reductase C677T mutation. Based on these findings, it was concluded that the synergistic effects of multiple, genetic, and acquired prothrombotic risk factors brought about the hypercoagulable state that resulted in overt stroke in a thalassemic patient in early childhood.

Patient 5 (P5, Fig. 1d), a five-year-old boy of Central European ancestry, presented with congenital microcephaly that progressed into severe postnatal microcephaly. He showed multiple minor facial anomalies (Fig. 2a; straight eyebrows, telecanthus, bilateral epicantic folds, broad nasal tip and thin upper lip vermilion) and had significant delays in speech development, which progressed with combined speech and physical therapy. This patient also displayed hematological anomalies including leukocytosis with increased eosinophil count, monocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. However, he did not have a history of recurrent infections or spontaneous bleedings. P5 had platelet anisotropy with enlarged platelets (Fig. 2b), an elevated fraction of immature platelets in the peripheral blood (Supplementary Data 1) and bone marrow examination showed increased MK count (Supplementary Fig. 2). Whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo in frame deletion in the last exon of ACTB, c. 1012_1023del (Supplementary Data 2), which results in the deletion of resides 338–341 within SD1 of β-CYA (Fig. 1d right, Supplementary Fig. 1).

Patient 6 (P6, Fig. 1e), a five-year-old girl of Western European origin, presented with early developmental delay, microcephaly and a history of recurrent thrombocytopenia during the first year of life, which normalized spontaneously. She made good developmental progress following intensive combined therapies, achieving a low normal IQ at 5 years of age. Brain MRI demonstrated two unilateral periventricular nodular heterotopias with otherwise normal brain morphology. No seizures were documented at the last follow up. Whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo insertion in the last exon of ACTB, c.1101dup (Supplementary Data 2), resulting in the substitution of 8 amino acids and addition of 4 residues at the far C-terminus of β-CYA (Fig. 1e right, Supplementary Fig. 1).

Common features amongst this cohort of patients with 3′ ACTB variants include developmental delay, mild intellectual disability, microcephaly, and thrombocytopenia with platelet anisotropy and enlarged platelets (Fig. 2b, c). Given the distinct genotype–phenotype correlation, we name this actinopathy ACTB -associated syndromic thrombocytopenia (ACTB -AST).

### Essential thrombocythemia: challenges in clinical practice and future prospects [^a6c58245]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) was first described in 1934, and subsequently, progress has been made in better understanding the molecular pathogenesis and which patients may have greatest risk of progression or vascular events. However, it has been more than a decade since a new therapy has been approved for ET. We are beginning to understand more comprehensively both the heterogeneity of this disease, which is largely driven by driver mutation status, as well as the effect of disease-related symptoms, such as fatigue, on patients. In this review we provide a practical overview of diagnosis and management of ET with focus on challenging patient scenarios and some consideration of what comprehensive care might entail. Finally, we also discuss newer therapies and how these might be assessed.

5.12	Adult Onset Still's Disease (AOSD)

During postmarketing use, Adult Onset Still's Disease (AOSD) has been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA. AOSD is a rare inflammatory condition that requires urgent evaluation and treatment. Patients with AOSD may have a combination of the following signs and symptoms: fever, arthritis, rash, and leukocytosis in the absence of infections, malignancies, and other rheumatic conditions. Patients with manifestations of AOSD should be evaluated immediately and LEMTRADA should be discontinued if an alternate etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

5.13 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP)

TTP has been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA. TTP is characterized by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurological sequelae, fever, and renal impairment. TTP is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates if not recognized and treated early. LEMTRADA should be discontinued if TTP is confirmed or an alternate etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established.

5.14	Autoimmune Encephalitis (AIE)

During postmarketing use, cases of AIE have been reported in patients treated with LEMTRADA. AIE can present with a variety of clinical manifestations, including subacute onset of memory impairment, altered mental status, psychiatric symptoms, neurological findings, and seizures. LEMTRADA should be discontinued if AIE is confirmed by the presence of neural autoantibodies or an alternate etiology cannot be established.

5.15	Acquired Hemophilia A

Cases of acquired hemophilia A (anti-Factor VIII antibodies) have been reported in both the clinical trial and postmarketing settings. Patients typically present with spontaneous subcutaneous hematomas and extensive bruising, although hematuria, epistaxis, gastrointestinal, or other types of bleeding may occur. Obtain a coagulopathy panel including aPTT in patients who present with such symptoms. Patients should be informed about the signs and symptoms of acquired hemophilia A and advised to seek immediate medical attention if any of these symptoms occur.

Cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis

Seizures manifest as a common presentation, occurring in 29% to 50% of patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Approximately a third to one half of seizures occur early — as the presenting symptom or within 2 weeks of diagnosis. Despite the lack of controlled studies, prophylaxis appears prudent where forthcoming seizures appear highly probable. There is some evidence that early seizures are predictive of a remote epilepsy condition but, in and of themselves, seizures in the context of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis do not appear to be associated with death or 6-month worse outcomes.

### Phenobarbital / lamotrigine coadministration-induced blood dyscrasia in a patient with epilepsy [^0b72b524]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report on a patient with epilepsy who developed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia during phenobarbital/lamotrigine treatment.

Case Report

A 45-year-old woman with a 10-year history of complex partial seizures being treated with phenobarbital 100 mg/day presented due to the development of complex partial seizure episodes (8 episodes/month in the last 6 months). Results of laboratory tests on admission showed normal platelets (250 x 10³/μL) and white blood cells (8.2 x 10³/μL). After clinical evaluation, lamotrigine titrated to a final dose of 100 mg twice daily was added to the phenobarbital. About 2 months later no epileptic manifestations were reported, but hematologic tests revealed a decrease in both platelets (36 x 10³/μL) and white blood cells (2.0 x 10³/μL). One day later, phenobarbital was discontinued and the patient developed 2 episodes of complex partial seizure. Levetiracetam titrated to 1500 mg/day was added to lamotrigine, with a normalization of platelets (260 x 10³/μL) and white blood cell (7.9 x 10³/μL) counts about 20 days later. After a few days, levetiracetam was discontinued and phenobarbital rechallenge during lamotrigine treatment induced a new blood dyscrasia in about 2 weeks (platelets 80 x 10³/μL; white blood cells 3.2 x 10³/μL). Phenobarbital was discontinued and levetiracetam was restarted, with a recovery of normal hematopoiesis in 25 days. The patient is presently receiving treatment with both lamotrigine 200 mg/day and levetiracetam 1500 mg/day and shows no seizure symptoms, blood abnormalities, or other adverse effects.

Discussion

Using the Horn Drug Interaction Probability Scale, we estimated a probable relationship between the drug-drug interaction and blood dyscrasia. The underlying mechanism of this interaction has not been well characterized. Cytochrome P450 enzyme induction by phenobarbital could be responsible for the production of reactive metabolites of lamotrigine that might be causative for the observed hematologic effects. A pharmacodynamic interaction between the 2 drugs is also a possible mechanism of this interaction.

Conclusions

Our patient with epilepsy developed blood dyscrasia during lamotrigine/phenobarbital treatment. Clinicians should carefully monitor hematologic parameters during lamotrigine/phenobarbital treatment.

ALI and ARDS are defined using criteria recommended by the American–European Consensus Conference on ARDS. ALI criteria: (1) Timing: Acute onset; (2) Oxygenation: PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg (regardless of positive end‐expiratory pressure [PEEP]); (3) Chest radiograph: Bilateral infiltrates seen on frontal chest radiograph; (4) PAWP: ≤ 18 mmHg when measured or no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension. ARDS criteria (same as ALI except): Oxygenation: PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg (regardless of PEEP). Acute renal failure is defined as a ≥ 50% increase in serum creatinine and receipt of inpatient acute dialysis. Multiple organ dysfunction and multiple organ failure are defined using criteria as reported by Deitch. Suspected encephalitis is defined as individuals who develop a fever with at least 6 h of altered mental status, or at least 1 h of unconsciousness, seizures, or focal neurologic signs. Encephalitis is defined as the presence of decreased consciousness or seizures or altered mental status or focal neurologic signs, plus at least 2 of the following: (a) fever (> 38°C); (b) abnormal cerebrospinal fluid examination (pleocytosis > 5 white blood cells/mL and/or increased protein content > 40 mg/dL); (c) abnormal electroencephalography findings compatible with encephalitis (e.g. diffuse or focal slow activity, or periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges); and (d) abnormal results of neuroimaging studies, including computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. Septic shock is defined as sepsis‐induced hypotension persisting despite adequate fluid resuscitation.DIC was scored in accordance with the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis scoring system. The scoring system included platelet count (> 100 × 10^9 cells/L, 0; < 100 × 10^9 cells/L but > 50 × 10^9 cells/L, 1; and < 50 × 10^9 cells/L, 2); elevated fibrin‐related marker (no increase, 0; moderate increase, 2; and strong increase, 3) (‐dimer was used); prolonged prothrombin time (PT) (< 3 s, 0; > 3 s but < 6 s, 1; and > 6 s, 2); and fibrinogen level (> 1.0 g/L, 0; < 1.0 g/L, 1). A total score of ≥ 5 was considered to be compatible with overt DIC.

Concluding remarks

The main objectives of the current perspective are to underscore the prognostic relevance of distinguishing WHO-defined ET from early/prefibrotic MF and to increase awareness regarding the relatively high risk of residual thrombosis in certain group of patients with WHO-defined ET. We believe that these issues constitute actionable challenges and need to be ultimately evaluated in prospective controlled studies. Our recommendations outlined in Figure 1 are neither binding nor absolute. They are simply there to assist those who seek our opinion.

### What causes seizures in neurocysticercosis? [^795fb1d7]. Epilepsy Currents (2022). Medium credibility.

Perilesional edema and gliosis have also been implicated in NCC-associated epilepsy. Both processes are thought to reflect inflammatory reactions to calcified granulomas and have been strongly correlated with seizures and seizure recurrence in NCC. It has yet to be established, however, whether edema and gliosis are causes or consequences of seizures or whether these processes tend to coincide with seizures due to the same underlying pathophysiology. Clarity regarding the relationships between edema, gliosis, and seizures can potentially be gained from other conditions in which they co-occur, such as in traumatic brain injury and epilepsy more generally. – Another hypothesis for how seizures arise in NCC is that calcified lesions contain and release large amounts of calcium, which could be toxic to neurons and result in high levels of glutamate being released by damaged or dying neurons, thereby facilitating seizures. Calcified cysts have also been associated with hippocampal sclerosis, which has a known association with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy that is thought to arise from structural and network changes due to neuron loss and gliosis in the hippocampus. This is another possible mechanism for epileptogenesis in NCC. Studies in which lesions associated with calcified cysts are surgically removed and seizure outcomes recorded can improve understanding about the relationship between cyst calcifications and seizures. Two such studies found that the majority of patients who received a lesionectomy for calcified cysts had favorable outcomes and became seizure-free. However, the small sample sizes, lack of control groups, large variability in clinical presentation of the patients undergoing these surgeries, and variability in surgery procedures leaves it unclear whether it was the removal of the calcified lesions or other factors accounting for seizure remediation in these patients. Some have argued against surgeries to remove calcified lesions as they believe there is not strong enough evidence that the benefits of such surgeries outweigh the risks, and in most cases of intraparenchymal NCC, surgeries for the removal of cysts are not indicated. Moreover, even if more robust evidence emerges demonstrating that the removal of calcified cysts improves seizure outcomes, the mechanism by which calcified cysts cause seizures will remain to be demonstrated.

### Epilepsy under my skin? [^50f4f77a]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 44-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital for observation after an unwitnessed syncope. Physical examination revealed skin purpura and bilateral tongue haematoma. Laboratory studies were unremarkable. Radiological imaging showed no abnormalities of the vasculature, signs of thrombosis or brain anomalies. Biopsy of a purpuric lesion revealed extravasation of erythrocytes. After excluding several causes of both syncope and purpura, the typical location of these thoracocervicofacial purpura, the tongue haematoma and an elevated prolactin level (which came back later) led to the diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. The patient was referred to the neurology department for follow-up. Within 3 weeks, the purpura were completely resolved, and the patient remained free of seizures during follow-up. In case of an unwitnessed syncope, an epileptic seizure should be carefully considered and thoracocervicofacial purpura can be the pivotal manifestation leading to this diagnosis.

Hematologic — Transient eosinophilia, thrombocytosis. Some individuals have developed a positive Coombs test.

Local — Injection site — Burning, cellulitis, phlebitis with IV administration, pain, induration, tenderness, paresthesia.

The less frequent adverse reactions (less than 1%) are:

Hypersensitivity — Numbness and anaphylaxis have been reported rarely.

Hepatic — Elevation of bilirubin has been reported rarely.

Renal — Transient elevations of BUN and creatinine have been occasionally observed with Cefizox.

Hematologic — Anemia, including hemolytic anemia with occasional fatal outcome, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported rarely.

Urogenital — Vaginitis has occurred rarely.

Gastrointestinal — Diarrhea; nausea and vomiting have been reported occasionally.

Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis can appear during or after antibiotic treatment (see WARNINGS).

### Primary thrombocytosis in children [^4eba8a40]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms are uncommon disorders in children, for which we have limited understanding of the pathogenesis and optimal management. JAK2 and MPL mutations, while common drivers of myeloproliferative neoplasms in adult patients, are not clearly linked to pediatric disease. Management and clinical outcomes in adults have been well delineated with defined recommendations for risk stratification and treatment. This is not the case for pediatric patients, for whom there is neither a standard approach to workup nor any consensus regarding management. This review will discuss thrombocytosis in children, including causes of thrombocytosis in children, the limited knowledge we have regarding pediatric primary thrombocytosis, and our thoughts on potential risk stratification and management, and future questions to be answered by laboratory research and collaborative clinical study.

### Approach to patients with essential thrombocythaemia and very high platelet counts: what is the evidence for treatment? [^53179ca5]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment of essential thrombocythaemia (ET) is directed at decreasing the risk of complications of the disease, including arterial and venous thrombosis and bleeding episodes. Established risk factors for vascular events in patients with ET include advanced age (> 60 years) and prior history of thrombosis or haemorrhage. The role, if any, of other potential risk factors, including cardiovascular risk factors, leucocytosis, high haematocrit, and JAK2 V617F has been analysed in multiple studies. The impact of thrombocytosis on the risk of vascular events has also been investigated. Many clinicians consider an elevated platelet count to be a risk factor for thrombosis or, when extreme, bleeding and utilize this as a criterion to start cytoreductive therapy. However, the relationship between thrombocytosis and vascular events is controversial and solid evidence to support the use of cytoreductive therapy in ET patients who have no other risk factors is lacking. In this review, we discuss current treatment recommendations for patients with ET, the biology underlying vascular events and risk factors thereof. We then review the evidence on the management of patients with ET and extreme thrombocytosis.

### Thrombocytosis and megakaryocyte changes associated with PRCA [^56a1dbc6]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Acquired pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare hematological disorder that results from failure of erythropoiesis, and can be distinguished from other bone marrow failure disorders by reticulocytopenia, normal granulopoiesis, and megakaryopoiesis. PRCA is often idiopathic and likely due to cytotoxic T-cell–mediated destruction of early erythroid precursors. Indeed, it can be associated with conditions such as T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell dyscrasia, thymoma, immunodeficiency, and infections.,

Thrombocytosis refers to an abnormal elevation in platelet count of > 450 000 × 10 9 /L. This condition can be related to a primary process, usually associated with a myeloproliferative neoplasm known as essential thrombocythemia, but it more commonly presents as an epiphenomenon of other causes that include iron deficiency, chronic inflammatory conditions, and asplenia. Thrombocytosis has not been associated with PRCA. Herein, we report a cohort of patients with PRCA and thrombocytosis that have not been defined in the literature.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on patient records diagnosed with PRCA at the University of Texas Southwestern and Cleveland Clinic Foundation between 2000 and 2022. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Cleveland Clinic Foundation. The primary objective was to investigate the presence of thrombocytosis and/or megakaryocyte changes in these PRCA cases. Clinical, laboratory, and molecular data were abstracted, adhering to the guidelines established by the Declaration of Helsinki and the respective participating institutions.

Among a total of 90 patients, comprehensive analysis of 27 cases were identified as having acquired PRCA with thrombocytosis and/or megakaryocyte changes noted on bone marrow biopsies (Table 1) examined. To assess treatment efficacy, hemoglobin and platelet count before and after resolution of PRCA were compared. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess normality. For normally distributed data, a paired t test was performed. For nonnormally distributed data, a Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test was performed. For all relevant comparisons, a P value < .05 was used to set statistical significance.

### Thrombocytosis in intensive care [^711928d1]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

We conducted a retrospective study of platelet count in 226 patients admitted for critical care over a 5-month period, to explore the incidence of thrombocytosis and its relation to admission category, duration of ICU stay and outcome. Our findings indicate that thrombocytosis is not rare in ICU patients. At least one platelet count greater than 450x10(9) litre(-1) was found in 21.7% of patients and was associated with lower ICU mortality (P = 0.003), lower hospital mortality (P = 0.006), but longer duration of ICU stay (P < 0.0001). Thrombocytosis may serve as an independent predictor of favourable outcome in ICU patients.
