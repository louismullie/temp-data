## Question

Two men held-up a liquor store in a city. During the robbery, one of the participants shot and killed the owner of the store. Over a year later, police detectives arrested a defendant after obtaining reliable information that the defendant was the robber who was responsible for killing the store's owner. Afterward, the defendant was taken to the station house where he was booked for the crime and then incarcerated. The next day, the prosecuting attorney made a decision to delay indictment until he could discover the identity of the defendant's accomplice. The defendant was then released from police custody. In this jurisdiction the statute of limitations for murder is five years. Five months later, the prosecuting attorney, after unsuccessfully attempting to secure information on the defendant's cohort, indicted the defendant, charging him with felony murder. Shortly before trial, the only eyewitness to the crime died. He would have testified that the defendant did not participate in the robbery. The defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment because of the delay between the date of the crime and the date of the indictment will most probably be

Answer Choices:
A. granted, because the prosecutor is constitutionally required to press charges, if at all, within a reasonable time after probable cause is established.
B. granted, because the delay in prosecuting the defendant actually prejudiced him.
C. denied, because pre-indictment delay does not violate the Constitution, as long as it does not exceed an applicable statute of limitations.
D. denied, because the delay was not excessive and was for a permissible purpose.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which answer choice correctly predicts how a court would rule on a motion to dismiss an indictment for pre-indictment delay in a felony-murder case, given that the only exculpatory eyewitness died before trial and the indictment came five months after arrest but well within the five-year statute of limitations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the legal standard governing pre-indictment delay claims. Then, I should verify whether the statute of limitations has any bearing on constitutional claims. Next, I will examine whether the defendant can show actual prejudice from the delay. Finally, I will consider whether the prosecution's reason for delaying indictment was legitimate and whether the delay was excessive, before concluding which option aligns with the law.

> Let me first confirm the governing legal principle. Pre-indictment delay is not per se unconstitutional; a due process violation requires two things: actual prejudice to the defendant and that the delay was an intentional device to gain a tactical advantage or was otherwise unjustifiable, and critically, the mere loss of evidence is not enough without showing the prosecution's bad faith or gross negligence, which is a high bar. I should double-check that this framework is consistent with Supreme Court precedent and lower-court applications, and yes, that is the standard.

> Wait, let me verify the role of the statute of limitations. I initially thought the five-year limit might automatically defeat the motion, but hold on, I should not conflate statutory deadlines with constitutional due process. The statute of limitations sets a legislative time limit beyond which prosecution is barred, but a defendant can still assert a due process claim for pre-indictment delay even within the limitations period if they can prove actual prejudice and governmental misconduct; however, courts are generally reluctant to find such violations when the indictment is timely under the statute, absent compelling facts. So, while the indictment here is timely, that does not by itself end the constitutional inquiry, though it makes success less likely.

> Next, I should review whether the defendant suffered actual prejudice. The death of the only eyewitness who would have testified the defendant did not participate sounds prejudicial at first glance, but I need to check whether the defendant can link that loss to the prosecution's delay. The problem is that the witness died shortly before trial, not during the five-month pre-indictment delay, and there is no indication the prosecution delayed indictment to wait for the witness to die or that the witness was unavailable to the defense earlier; moreover, the defense would need to show the witness's testimony was material and that the delay caused the loss, which is not established here. Therefore, I should conclude there is no proven actual prejudice attributable to the pre-indictment delay itself.

> I will now examine the prosecution's reason for delay and whether it was excessive. The prosecutor delayed indictment to investigate and identify the accomplice, which is a legitimate law-enforcement purpose, and a five-month delay after arrest but well within the five-year statute is not considered excessive under due process precedents. I should confirm that courts routinely uphold reasonable delays for ongoing investigations, and yes, that is the case when there is no showing of bad faith or tactical advantage.

> Putting this together, I should conclude the motion will most probably be denied. The indictment is within the statute of limitations, the defendant has not demonstrated actual prejudice caused by the pre-indictment delay, and the prosecution had a permissible reason for the delay. Option C captures the first point but is too categorical because pre-indictment delay can violate due process even within the limitations period if prejudice and misconduct are proven; Option D better reflects the totality of the analysis here, emphasizing both the non-excessive delay and the permissible purpose, and the absence of proven prejudice. Therefore, the best answer is D.

---

The defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment will most probably be **denied** because the pre-indictment delay did not violate due process: the delay was within the five-year statute of limitations, the prosecution had a legitimate reason (to identify the accomplice), and the defendant failed to show actual prejudice from the delay [^notfound]. The death of the exculpatory eyewitness shortly before trial is not attributable to the pre-indictment delay, so there is no constitutional violation [^notfound].

---

## Legal framework governing pre-indictment delay

The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause protects defendants from **undue pre-indictment delay** [^notfound]. However, not every delay violates due process; courts apply a two-part test:

- **Actual prejudice**: The defendant must show that the delay caused substantial prejudice, such as lost evidence, faded witness memories, or unavailable witnesses [^notfound].
- **Governmental misconduct**: The delay must have been an intentional tactic to gain an advantage or otherwise unjustifiable [^notfound].

If either element is absent, the due process claim fails [^notfound].

---

## Application to the present case

### Actual prejudice

The defendant argues prejudice from the death of the only exculpatory eyewitness. However, **prejudice must be linked to the delay** [^notfound]. Here, the witness died shortly before trial — more than a year after the pre-indictment delay — so the death cannot be attributed to the five-month delay. Thus, the defendant has not shown actual prejudice from the delay [^notfound].

---

### Governmental misconduct

The prosecution delayed indictment to identify the accomplice, a **legitimate investigative purpose** [^notfound]. There is no evidence of bad faith or an attempt to gain a tactical advantage, so there is no governmental misconduct [^notfound].

---

### Statute of limitations

The indictment was filed within the five-year statute of limitations for murder, which further supports that the delay was **not excessive or unjustified** [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The defendant's motion to dismiss will most probably be **denied** because the pre-indictment delay was reasonable, within the statute of limitations, and not motivated by misconduct, and the defendant failed to demonstrate actual prejudice attributable to the delay [^notfound].

---

The correct answer is **D. denied, because the delay was not excessive and was for a permissible purpose**.

### Therapeutic value of drugs granted accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization in the US and Europe from 2007 to 2021 [^2f6ab77f]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Results

From 2007 to 2021, 146 drug indications (94 first indications, 52 supplemental indications) were granted accelerated approval by the FDA and 58 (all first indications) received conditional marketing authorization by the EMA, with use of both pathways increasing over time (Figure). Most of these approved indications targeted cancer (122 [83.6%] in the US; 40 [69.0%] in the EU). In Switzerland, 13 drug indications (all first indications only) were granted temporary authorization. As of December 2021, 48 accelerated approvals (32.9%) and 21 conditional marketing authorizations (35.0%) were converted to regular approval.

Trends in Accelerated Approval and Conditional Marketing Approvals From 2007 to 2021

A, Total drug indications granted accelerated approval and conditional marketing authorization in the US and Europe. B, Proportion of drugs (first indications) granted accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization among total approved drugs. C, Proportion of cancer drugs (first indications) granted accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization among total approved cancer drugs. EMA indicates European Medicines Agency; FDA, US Food and Drug Administration.

Of the 146 drug indications granted accelerated approval, 33 (22.6%) were also conditionally approved in the EU. Fifty-four (37%) were granted regular approval, 2 (1.4%) were approved through an expedited pathway, 5 (3.4%) were refused, 3 (2%) had applications withdrawn, and 49 (33.6%) were still under review or had not been submitted to the EMA. Of the 58 drug indications conditionally approved in the EU, most (33 [56.9%]) were also granted accelerated approval; 14 (24.1%) were granted at least 1 expedited review program (but not accelerated approval), 4 (6.9%) were approved through the regular pathway, 2 (3.4%) were refused, and 5 (8.7%) were still under review or had not been submitted to the FDA by the end of our data collection process.

### Therapeutic value of drugs granted accelerated approval or conditional marketing authorization in the US and Europe from 2007 to 2021 [^e59377ee]. JAMA Health Forum (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

From 2007 to 2021, the number of new drug indications granted accelerated approval in the US or conditional marketing authorization in the EU increased, with many of these indications approved for the treatment of cancer. However, only 38.9% of drugs granted accelerated approval in the US and 37.5% granted conditional marketing authorization in the EU were rated as providing moderate or greater therapeutic value compared with existing therapies. This proportion was substantially lower for cancer than for other indications.

The value assessments by the German, French, and Canadian health technology assessment agencies serve as a basis for price negotiations and reimbursement in those countries. In addition, the value scores that the agencies assign may help guide physicians and patients in treatment selection. In December 2021, the EU adopted a new regulation to harmonize value assessment of new medicines across the EU starting in 2025, with cancer drugs to be among the first therapies subjected to this centralized assessment. However, the increasing use of accelerated and conditional approval pathways may complicate the work of these health agencies charged with assessing the value of new therapies. Prior studies have highlighted the inherently limited and uncertain evidentiary basis on which many drugs are granted accelerated approval and conditional marketing authorization, with questions about the validity of the surrogate measures and biomarkers used to support such approvals.

### Factors in time to full approval or withdrawal for anticancer medicines granted accelerated approval by the FDA [^0234a24f]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What factors are associated with the fast conversion of accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval of cancer drugs to regular approval?

Findings

In this cohort study of 102 cancer drug indications granted accelerated approval from 1992 to 2022 and converted to regular approval by August 2024, low clinical benefit or safety concerns at accelerated approval were associated with delayed regular approval, while high clinical benefit in confirmatory trials correlated with faster conversion.

Meaning

These results suggest that the most beneficial accelerated-approval drugs tend to complete confirmatory trials soonest, indicating that delayed completion should be a cautionary signal for patients and oncologists considering these drugs.

### Regulating new drugs in India needs to be improved [^e4d7836e]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Unfortunately, these statements are problematic and might cause confusion, for three reasons. First, the state regulators do not give market approvals or permissions, but they issue licences for manufacture, distribution, and sale. It is the function of CDSCO to give prior permission for marketing, before a state can give a manufacturing licence. Second, the need for CDSCO's approval applies to 'new drugs' as defined in the legislation. The third reason is perhaps the most important, or at least has been. Until March 2019, demonstrating safety and effectiveness was legally required for central approval, and thus for 'new drugs'; it was not legally required for state licences. The authors quite rightly note the limited technical capacity of the states, but that is beside the point here, because they have never had the legal duty to assess safety and effectiveness before granting licences. It is well known that states have granted numerous licences for 'new drugs' without the prior approval of CDSCO and therefore without evaluation of safety and effectiveness. As well as posing a threat to public health, this is unlawful, and was so since 1961. These details were fully explained in a legal analysis which was published in 2015 as supporting information to a paper referenced by the authors. However, the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules 2019 introduced new rules to govern central approval and declared the previous rules–including the safety and effectiveness requirement–to be no longer applicable. As a result, the threshold standard for new drug approvals is now unspecified and unclear, which is both extremely worrying and unsatisfactory.

### Health, quality of life, social network and use of health care: a comparison between those granted and those not granted disability pensions [^5fb70eef]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim was to compare self-rated health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), social networks and health care utilisation of those granted disability pension (DP) and those not granted disability pension (nDP).

Method

Demographic data and medical diagnoses were obtained from the records of the social insurance office. Data concerning self-reported health, HRQoL social networks, and use of health care were collected by a postal questionnaire. The nDP group included all those not granted full DPs between 1999 and 2000 (n = 99). The DP group were a random sample of those granted full DPs, during the same period (n = 197).

Results

The nDP group had more often multiple diagnoses, and lower self-reported health and HRQoL compared to those granted DP. In particular, their average scores were lower on the SF-36 scales social functioning, role limitations due to physical problems and mental health. The nDP group also had significantly smaller social networks.

Conclusions

Contrary to expectations, those not granted a disability pension do not seem to have better health, but rather to suffer from more sickness than those who were granted a disability pension.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Amyloid plaque-lowering monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) — FDA/CMS status and diagnostic workflow: In June 2021 the FDA granted accelerated approval for aducanumab (Aduhelm), in January 2023 the FDA granted accelerated approval for lecanemab (Leqembi), and this was followed in July 2023 by the traditional (full) FDA approval of lecanemab; on July 2, 2024 the FDA gave traditional approval for donanemab (Kisunla). In October 2023 CMS eliminated the national coverage determination for amyloid PET, making it reimbursable in clinical practice for Medicare beneficiaries, and several new cerebrospinal fluid assays for amyloid and tau have received FDA clearance. For treatment planning, an MRI may need to be repeated and APOE testing may need to be obtained for treatment planning (not for diagnostic evaluation purposes).

### Confidentiality in the care of adolescents: policy statement [^de40e846]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Key issues and contemporary considerations — federal and state confidentiality and consent frameworks for adolescents: Federal laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, the confidentiality regulations for substance use disorder programs (42 CFR Part 2), and the Title X Family Planning Program, provide a foundation for adolescent confidentiality protections, with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and the 21st Century Cures Act identified as additional federal laws with profound implications. At the state level, minor adolescents are typically granted the right to consent to care related to specific health issues such as reproductive health, substance use, and often mental health, although the ages and limits (such as parental notification) vary from state to state. Minor adolescents may also consent to emergency care in many jurisdictions; however, except under certain well-defined circumstances (such as emancipation), they are not granted the right to consent for nonemergent, nonsensitive, routine health care services, with that right reserved for parents. The page notes an example that New York State has recently granted the right to consent to all services to runaway and homeless youth receiving services from programs approved by the Office of Children and Family Services. The right to consent to care often determines the right to control information from that care, although discordance can occur when state laws require or allow parental notification of minor adolescents seeking certain types of care.

### Clinical practice update: expert review on endoscopic bariatric Therapies [^314eebdf]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBTs) — best practice advice for clinical integration is as follows: Best Practice Advice 1: EBTs should be considered in patients with obesity who have been unsuccessful in losing or maintaining weight loss with lifestyle interventions. Best Practice Advice 2: EBTs can be used in patients with severe obesity as a bridge to traditional bariatric surgery. Best Practice Advice 3: Clinicians should use EBTs as part of a structured weight loss program that includes dietary intervention, exercise therapy, and behavior modification, in both the active weight loss phase and the long-term maintenance phase. Best Practice Advice 4: Clinicians should evaluate all potential EBT candidates with a comprehensive evaluation for medical conditions, comorbidities, and psychosocial or behavioral patterns that contribute to their condition before enrolling patients in a weight loss program that includes EBTs. Best Practice Advice 5: Clinicians incorporating EBTs into their clinical practice should follow up patients prospectively to capture the impact of the EBT on weight and weight-related comorbidities, and all related adverse outcomes. Best Practice Advice 6: Poor responders should be identified and offered a detailed evaluation and alternative therapy. Best Practice Advice 7: Institutions should establish specific guidelines that are applied consistently across disciplines for granting privileges in EBTs that reflect the necessary knowledge and technical skill a clinician must achieve before being granted privileges to perform these procedures.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to risk stratification, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to evaluate the risk of osteoporosis in all ≥ 50 years old postmenopausal females. View patients as being at very high fracture risk in the following situations:

- recent fracture (within the past 12 months)

- fractures while on approved osteoporosis therapy

- fractures while on drugs causing skeletal harm (such as long-term corticosteroids)

- multiple fractures

- very low T-score (such as < -3.0)

- high risk for falls or history of injurious falls

- very high fracture probability by FRAX (such as major osteoporosis fracture > 30%, hip fracture > 4.5%) or other validated fracture risk algorithm. (Grade B; BEL 1).

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^bc185d2a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods for estimating the due date — abstract directives — As soon as data from the last menstrual period, the first accurate ultrasound examination, or both are obtained, the gestational age and the estimated due date (EDD) should be determined, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. A pregnancy without an ultrasound examination that confirms or revises the EDD before 22 0/7 weeks of gestational age should be considered suboptimally dated. When determined from the methods outlined in this document for estimating the due date, gestational age at delivery represents the best obstetric estimate for the purpose of clinical care and should be recorded on the birth certificate, and for the purposes of research and surveillance, the best obstetric estimate, rather than estimates based on the last menstrual period alone, should be used as the measure for gestational age.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious and otherwise important adverse reactions are discussed in detail in another section of the labeling:

Hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4.1)]
Arrhythmias and QT Prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Hepatic Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of posaconazole cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical Trial Experience in Adults

Clinical Trial Experience with Posaconazole Delayed-Release Tablets for Prophylaxis

The safety of posaconazole delayed-release tablets has been assessed in 230 patients in clinical trials. Patients were enrolled in a non-comparative pharmacokinetic and safety trial of posaconazole delayed-release tablets when given as antifungal prophylaxis (Posaconazole Delayed-Release Tablet Study). Patients were immunocompromised with underlying conditions including hematological malignancy, neutropenia post-chemotherapy, GVHD, and post HSCT. This patient population was 62% male, had a mean age of 51 years (range 19 to 78 years, 17% of patients were 65 years of age), and were 93% white and 16% Hispanic. Posaconazole therapy was given for a median duration of 28 days. Twenty patients received 200 mg daily dose and 210 patients received 300 mg daily dose (following twice daily dosing on Day 1 in each cohort). Table 9 presents adverse reactions observed in patients treated with 300 mg daily dose at an incidence of ≥ 10% in Posaconazole Delayed-Release Tablet Study.

Table 9: Posaconazole Delayed-Release Tablet Study: Adverse Reactions in at Least 10% of Subjects Treated with 300 mg Daily Dose

The most frequently reported adverse reactions (> 25%) with posaconazole delayed-release tablets 300 mg once daily were diarrhea, pyrexia, and nausea.

The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation of posaconazole delayed-release tablets 300 mg once daily was nausea (2%).

### Ethics review in compassionate use [^3d7a7b68]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Table 1
Arguments for and against the independent ethical review of compassionate use

In many cases, despite not being a clinical trial, compassionate use involves (or at least should involve) some research aspects. For example, according to the Declaration of Helsinki, the most important biomedical research code, use of an unproven intervention in clinical practice "should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available" (Paragraph 37). The Declaration does not explicitly state that use of unproven intervention must be preceded by ethical review. However, the suggestion to include research aspects does seem to imply this, especially when one reads the Declaration as a whole (independent ethical review as a mandatory requirement for biomedical research involving humans is one of the most important questions discussed by the Declaration).

Walker et al. recently expressed a similar view to that of the Declaration of Helsinki. They reasoned that compassionate use might be ethical, provided that it contributes to our knowledge of investigational drugs. However, they acknowledged significant shortcomings of compassionate use as a source of data on the efficacy and safety of investigational drugs. Indeed, the value of data collected during the conduct of compassionate use is limited, especially compared to that of randomized controlled trials, the contemporary gold standard of drug efficacy and safety studies. Of the two major regulatory agencies, the FDA does not consider compassionate use to be a significant source of reliable safety and efficacy data; while adverse event reporting is required, this does not affect the FDA's decisions on eventual drug approval. The EMA allows safety data to be collected during compassionate use programs, while at the same time stressing that compassionate use cannot replace clinical trials for investigational purposes.

### National guideline clearinghouse is No more: keep calm and search on… [^4914f9f0]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

In July 2018, the National Guideline Clearinghouse lost funding, leaving fewer freely available online guideline collections. Based on the authors' experience of the 3 major guideline-focused databases that are currently available (Guidelines International Network, the Turning Research into Practice database, and Guideline Central) an easy to use resource with stringent inclusion criteria is currently lacking, though new resources are in development. These 3 resources vary in scope, and none stood out as an all-encompassing favorite. Regardless of the source used to find and access guidelines, clinicians must evaluate guideline quality and currency before using them in clinical practice.

### Does egg donation for mitochondrial replacement techniques generate parental responsibilities? [^fc5d0691]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2018). Low credibility.

Even though I have concluded that under the genetic/derivation account* an MRT egg donor is parentally responsible for the created child, this account, as a unified account of parental responsibilities, is flawed given that it is unable to assign parental responsibility in certain cases, for example, in the case of 'artificial gametes'. A researcher has been able to create human eggs and sperm from scratch, in the sense that she created them by using organic matter that did not originate in human organisms or cells. Let us specify that the genetic material of each gamete is a completely novel combination. Now imagine that she produces an embryo with these gametes and transfers it to herself, and that later a baby is born. Confronted with this case we have two options: a) we accept that no one is parentally responsible for such a child because the gametes were not derived from a human, which is absurd or b) we accept that the scientist has parental responsibilities towards the child. If we accept the latter, then it becomes even more clear that causation plays a large role in determining parental responsibilities. Thus, let us turn to causal accounts of parenthood.

Causal accounts of parental responsibilities

In the most general sense, a causal account holds that X is parentally responsible for Y if X caused Y to exist. The origin of this responsibility is grounded on the fact that we are morally responsible for what we cause, and in reproductive scenarios we cause the existence of a vulnerable needy being that requires sustained care and nurturing. Failure to provide, or see that others provide, such care would cause pain and harm for which we would be morally responsible. As Henry Sidgwick states, 'For the parent, being the cause of the child's existing in a helpless condition, would be indirectly the cause of the suffering and death that would result to it if neglected'. Given the breadth of causal accounts in the next subsections I will only focus on three of them and examine whether MRT egg donors are parentally responsible for the created children.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to follow-up, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain a baseline axial (lumbar spine and hip; 1/3 radius if indicated) DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years until findings are stable. Consider obtaining 1/3 radius DEXA as an alternative site if the lumbar spine/hip is not evaluable or as an additional site in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Consider repeating it every 1–2 years or at a less frequent interval, depending on clinical circumstances. (Grade B; BEL 2) Monitor serial changes in lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck bone mineral density. Consider monitoring with 1/3 radius site if the lumbar spine, hip, or both are not evaluable, recognizing that it is limited by a small area and a very large least significant change. (Grade B; BEL 1) Attempt monitoring patients in the same facility with the same DEXA system, provided the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation adhere to International Society for Clinical Densitometry DEXA best practices.

### Evaluation of oncology trial results reporting over a 10-year period [^90a8f87f]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Unreported clinical trial results represent a violation of human rights. Oncology trials account for nearly 30% of interventional biopharmaceutical clinical studies registered on ClinicalTrials.gov and are the most numerous among all disciplines.

Objective

To analyze the reporting of results among all interventional oncology trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov from 2007 through 2017.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study analyzed all clinical studies registered between June 1, 2007, and May 8, 2017, on ClinicalTrials.gov, the largest public clinical trial registry in the world. Trials with a recruitment status of completed or terminated and a primary completion date of on or before September 30, 2017, were selected. Data were analyzed between February 20, 2021, and February 26, 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was the percentage of trials that reported results either on ClinicalTrials.gov or in journal publications within 24 months of the primary completion date. Journal publication was ascertained by searching ClinicalTrials.gov for a link to the publication, PubMed using national clinical trial number, and Embase using national clinical trial number and filters.

Results

Of the 12 240 clinical trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, 7425 trials (60.7%; 95% CI, 60.0%-61.5%) reported results, with a 34.0% (95% CI, 30.3%-37.7%) increase in 24-month reporting rate from 2007 to 2017. Multivariable analyses confirmed that more recent trials (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.11 per year increase; 95% CI, 1.10–1.13) and trials with larger sample sizes (51–100 patients: adjusted HR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.09–1.24]; > 100 patients: adjusted HR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.33–1.54]) were more likely to report results. Terminated trials were less likely to report results compared with completed trials (adjusted HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.83–0.93). Compared with trials funded by industry, those funded by the National Institutes of Health were more likely to report results (adjusted HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.29–1.49), whereas those funded by other academic or nonprofit organizations were less likely to report results (adjusted HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.62–0.70). Among all 7425 trials, the results of 2807 trials (37.8%; 95% CI, 36.7%-38.9%) were posted only on ClinicalTrials.gov. These trials tended to be terminated early and to have small sample sizes (≤ 50 patients) compared with trials that published results in journals.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found a gradual improvement in results reporting among oncology trials over a 10-year period. Trial registries could serve as a results reporting platform for unpublished trials and as a data source of trial outcomes for future studies.

### Pathogenicity and treatment of Bartonella infections [^cab246db]. International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents (2014). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Bartonella quintana infection:

- **Definition**: Bartonella quintana infection, also known as trench fever, is a bacterial infection caused by the intracellular Gram-negative bacterium Bartonella quintana.
- **Pathophysiology**: Bartonella quintana, an intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium, is primarily transmitted by the body louse (Pediculus humanus humanus) through louse feces on altered skin. The bacterium invades endothelial cells and is released every 4–5 days, leading to relapsing fever. Bartonella quintana can also invade RBCs and persist for months, evading the host immune response and reducing the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for Bartonella quintana infection include immunocompromised states, such as HIV infection and organ transplantation, as well as homelessness and poor sanitation increasing the risk of exposure to body lice, the primary vector of Bartonella quintana.
- **Disease course**: Trench fever typically presents with recurrent febrile episodes, often following a 5-day fever pattern, followed by a week of resolution. It is usually accompanied by other symptoms such as headache, myalgia, bone pain, maculopapular rash, anorexia, and sweating. Severe complications of Bartonella quintana infection, such as endocarditis, bacillary angiomatosis, and neurological manifestations, can occur in immunocompromised patients.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Bartonella endocarditis is associated with a 9–12% mortality rate. Bacillary angiomatosis may be life-threatening if left untreated.

### Stopping trials early for commercial reasons: the risk-benefit relationship as a moral compass [^61a31bb7]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2005). Low credibility.

Decisions by industry sponsors to end clinical trials early for commercial reasons have been the subject of controversy. I argue that the principal consideration in assessing these decisions ought to be the way in which the termination would affect the trial's risk-benefit relationship. If there is not yet sufficient benefit to be gained from the study to offset the risks to which participants were exposed and it is expected that important scientific information would be obtained if the trial were continued, early termination constitutes an unethical alteration of the risk-benefit relationship. This violates the grounds on which permission is given to conduct human research, patients consent to participate, and investigators agree to conduct studies. These knowable and avoidable changes in risk-benefit relationship should generally be seen as impermissible.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^3d475008]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

The Puzzle of Missing Values

Missing items are common in questionnaires, resulting from different reasons. Typical examples are made by subjects who may inadvertently skip over some questions or may not have enough time to complete the test. Subjects would prefer not to answer if higher penalties are assigned to wrong than missing answers. Sometimes, some items are reserved to some respondents, for example, those who attempted in the past a given activity or have other characteristics such as sex or language.

When missing answers are found, the easiest and most practiced solution would be to transform scores into the percentage of the total score given by the answered items. For example, if a subject misses two items and totals seven on a questionnaire of 10 dichotomous items, the subject's "total score" is 87.5% (7/8). Note that this procedure is equivalent to the common "mean substitution" procedure, assigning the missing items the average score observed in the other items. This method relies on the (strong and unlikely) assumption that questionnaires' items are all indicators of the same quantity of the latent variable of interest and thus exchangeable (i.e. they all share the same difficulty level).

Table 2 provides an example showing why this solution does not work. Suppose 10 items again, each scored 0 or 1, aligned from left to right for increasing difficulty. The "x" symbol flags a missing response. According to traditional psychometrics, subjects A and B are assigned the same score. Subject C, providing two missing answers, is assigned a lower score. However, it seems that subject A's missing response should be given a higher score estimate, given that the subject passed five more difficult items. In contrast, subject B failed three items easier than the missed one. It is doubtful that subject C deserves a lower score than subject B: he/she passed four items more difficult than the missed items.

TABLE 2
Estimation of missing values, based on average scores across answered items

Presumably, subjects A and C were careless in their answers or had not enough time to complete the test.

This example is intentionally simplistic. The treatment of missing data is a complex research field, faced by the whole field of statistics. As far as psychometric statistics is concerned, RA provides a satisfactory answer to this problem.

### ACOG committee statement no. 9: ethical considerations for increasing inclusivity in research participants [^9e862a43]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Statement No. 9 — ethical considerations for increasing inclusivity in research participants emphasizes that "All people who could become pregnant, who could have become pregnant, who are lactating, or who identify as women should be presumed eligible for participation in research studies, and their recruitment and participation should be encouraged regardless of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, or socioeconomic status". It grounds this in justice, noting "Ethical principles mandate fair distribution of benefits and burdens of participation in research, underpinning the need for equitable inclusion in medical research of people who could become pregnant, who could have become pregnant, who are lactating, or who identify as women". Policy history is summarized: "Because of a history of systematic exclusion of women from research, in 1993, Congress directed that women were to be included in all federally funded clinical investigations unless inappropriate", and "Consequently, the NIH now requires that women and members of minoritized populations and their subpopulations be included in all NIH-funded research 'unless a clear and compelling rationale and justification establishes to the satisfaction of the relevant institute/center director that inclusion is inappropriate with respect to the health of the participants or the purpose of the research'". Regulatory context includes "In 1977, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) excluded people of 'childbearing potential' from early drug research", and "As of January 21, 2019, the federal government's Common Rule, which governs oversight of national human subjects research, no longer labeled pregnant people as 'vulnerable'. Participation data show, "In the 2022 fiscal year, of the 10.8 million research participants in NIH-sponsored studies, the people who could become pregnant, who could have become pregnant, and who identify as women numbered about 6 million (55.8%)". The statement further underscores that "Justice requires that people who could become pregnant, who could have become pregnant, who are lactating, or who identify as women be included in studies in sufficient numbers to determine whether their responses to treatment are different from others and whether treatment options derived from research are equivalently applicable to all individuals".

A moderate recommendation is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa) and the quality of evidence is good but not excellent (or is unobtainable)", implying "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a moderate recommendation but should remain alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on low-quality evidence) is defined as "A particular action is favored because anticipated benefits clearly exceed harms (or vice versa), but the quality of evidence is weak", with the implication "Clinicians would be prudent to follow a weak recommendation but should remain alert to new information and very sensitive to patient preferences". A weak recommendation (based on balance of benefits and harms) is defined as "Weak recommendation is provided when the aggregate database shows evidence of both benefit and harm that appear to be similar in magnitude for any available courses of action", implying "Clinicians should consider the options in their decision-making, but patient preference may have a substantial role".

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^4b9f5e4d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Methods for estimating the due date — recommendations — Ultrasound measurement of the embryo or fetus in the first trimester (up to and including 13 6/7 weeks of gestation) is the most accurate method to establish or confirm gestational age. If pregnancy resulted from assisted reproductive technology (ART), the ART-derived gestational age should be used to assign the estimated due date (EDD). For instance, the EDD for a pregnancy that resulted from in vitro fertilization should be assigned using the age of the embryo and the date of transfer. As soon as data from the last menstrual period (LMP), the first accurate ultrasound examination, or both are obtained, the gestational age and the EDD should be determined, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. Subsequent changes to the EDD should be reserved for rare circumstances, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record. When determined from the methods outlined in this document for estimating the due date, gestational age at delivery represents the best obstetric estimate for the purpose of clinical care and should be recorded on the birth certificate. For the purposes of research and surveillance, the best obstetric estimate, rather than estimates based on the LMP alone, should be used as the measure for gestational age.

### Changing perspectives in biobank research: from individual rights to concerns about public health regarding the return of results [^b6667455]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2009). Low credibility.

During the past decade, various guidelines that imply a duty for researchers to disclose information obtained through research to participants have emerged. The character and extent of this obligation have been debated extensively, with much attention devoted to the decisiveness of the validity and utility of the results in question. The aim of this paper is to argue that individual results from research on materials stored in large-scale biobanks, consisting of samples taken within the healthcare system or of altruistically donated materials, should not be returned. We will defend the thesis that medical research on these biobanks should be viewed as a collective project to improve public health, and that available resources should be utilized to pursue this goal. We argue that there is a need for a change of perspectives. Medical research should not primarily be viewed as a danger that individuals must be protected from, but rather be recognized as constituting a necessary defense against current and future diseases. Research that bears the prospect of advancing medicine and that can be carried out at no risk to individuals should be endorsed and facilitated. This calls for a shift of focus from autonomy and individual rights toward collective responsibility and solidarity.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage (2.3, 5.3).

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^ecd6a65a]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### The urgent need for clinical research reform to permit faster, less expensive access to new therapies for lethal diseases [^57327591]. Clinical Cancer Research (2015). Low credibility.

High costs of complying with drug development regulations slow progress and contribute to high drug prices and, hence, mounting health care costs. If it is exorbitantly expensive to bring new therapies to approval, fewer agents can be developed with available resources, impeding the emergence of urgently needed treatments and escalating prices by limiting competition. Excessive regulation produces numerous speed bumps on the road to drug authorization. Although an explosion of knowledge could fuel rapid advances, progress has been slowed worldwide by inefficient regulatory and clinical research systems that limit access to therapies that prolong life and relieve suffering. We must replace current compliance-centered regulation (appropriate for nonlethal diseases like acne) with "progress-centered regulation" in lethal diseases, where the overarching objective must be rapid, inexpensive development of effective new therapies. We need to (i) reduce expensive, time-consuming preclinical toxicology and pharmacology assessments, which add little value; (ii) revamp the clinical trial approval process to make it fast and efficient; (iii) permit immediate multiple-site trial activation when an eligible patient is identified ("just-in-time" activation); (iv) reduce the requirement for excessive, low-value documentation; (v) replace this excessive documentation with sensible postmarketing surveillance; (vi) develop pragmatic investigator accreditation; (vii) where it is to the benefit of the patient, permit investigators latitude in deviating from protocols, without requiring approved amendments; (viii) confirm the value of predictive biomarkers before requiring the high costs of IDE/CLIA compliance; and (ix) approve agents based on high phase I-II response rates in defined subpopulations, rather than mandating expensive, time-consuming phase III trials.

### American Geriatrics Society position statement: making medical treatment decisions for unrepresented older adults [^089ef4fe]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Clinical practice advice — medical decision-making for unrepresented older adults states that the process should not proceed on an ad hoc basis and that institutional policies should specify how decisions should be made, be consistent with state laws, and ensure protections including oversight by a legitimate body, transparency, and procedures for appealing and revising decisions. Historically, clinicians often relied on their own judgment with little to no oversight, and in one landmark study most life support decisions for unrepresented intensive care unit (ICU) patients were made without hospital or judicial oversight. Potential advantages of the clinician as decision-maker include knowledge of prognosis, a sense of professional obligation, and the ability to make timely decisions, but laws in several states prohibit clinicians from serving as informal surrogate decision-makers even when requested by the patient. Serious disadvantages include inadequate protection from clinician bias or conflicts of interest, variability between physicians in treatment decision-making, and clinicians' end-of-life care preferences that often differ significantly from those of patients and surrogates. For some incapacitated persons, courts appoint a legal guardian as a surrogate decision-maker; however, guardianship might not always be appropriate or available, may be restricted to medical decision-making or more global in scope, removes constitutional rights when global, and although indicated in some circumstances, is generally a last resort to be avoided through less restrictive alternatives whenever possible.

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^0aa46e05]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy due date estimation — conclusion and EDD adjustment guidance states that the best available data support adjusting the estimated due date (EDD) if the first ultrasonography is in the third trimester and suggests a discrepancy in gestational dating of more than 21 days. As soon as data from the last menstrual period (LMP) or the first accurate ultrasound examination are obtained, the gestational age and the EDD should be determined, discussed with the patient, and documented clearly in the medical record, and subsequent changes to the EDD should be reserved for rare circumstances. When determined from the outlined methods, gestational age at delivery represents the best obstetric estimate for the purpose of clinical care and should be recorded on the birth certificate, and for research and surveillance the best obstetric estimate, rather than estimates based on the LMP alone, should be used as the measure for gestational age. A pregnancy without an ultrasound examination that confirms or revises the EDD before 22 0/7 weeks of gestation age should be considered suboptimally dated. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine recognize the advantages of a single dating paradigm being used within and between institutions, and Table 1 provides guidelines for estimating the due date based on ultrasonography and the LMP with single-point cutoffs and ranges.

Standards of Care Version 8, Statement 2.3 — Health care providers: We recommend health care providers understand the impact of social attitudes, laws, economic circumstances, and health systems on the lived experiences of transgender and gender diverse people worldwide. TGD people's lived experiences vary greatly, depending on a range of factors, including social, cultural (including spiritual), legal, economic and geographic, and HCPs should be aware of the traditions and realities within which health care is available and provide support that is sensitive to the local needs and identities of TGD people and provide them with culturally competent and safe care. From a global perspective, the circumstances in which TGD people live are often challenging and can impact their health, and these include rights to education, health and protection from medical abuses, work and an adequate standard of living, housing, freedom of movement and expression, privacy, security, life, family, freedom from arbitrary deprivation of liberty, fair trial, treatment with humanity while in detention, and freedom from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; it is widely accepted that denial of rights can impact sexual and gender minority health and well-being. HCPs can play an important role in rights advocacy, including the right to quality gender-affirming health care that is appropriate, affordable, and accessible.

### Consent form reporting on clinicalTrials. Gov, 2013–2023 [^519ad41d]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Informed consent documentation is legally, ethically, and scientifically imperative for research and provides prospective trial participants key study information. Historically, consent documents have been difficult to obtain and not consistently publicly available. As of July 21, 2019, and after a 2-year voluntary period, the revised Common Rule required select federally funded interventional trials to publicly post consent forms no later than 60 days after the last participant visit. The revision intends to increase research transparency and inform consent development. Although transparency efforts addressing trial registrations and results are well studied, less is known about public availability of consent forms in the context of the revised rule's recent implementation. This cross-sectional analysis examined National Institutes of Health (NIH)–funded trial consent form availability on ClinicalTrials.gov.

### Committee opinion No 700: methods for estimating the due date [^1acb613b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Second trimester gestational age assessment by ultrasonography — dating accuracy and EDD changes: Gestational age assessment in the first part of the second trimester (between 14 0/7 weeks and 21 6/7 weeks of gestation, inclusive) is based on a composite of fetal biometric measurements and has an accuracy of ± 7–10 days; if scans performed between 14 0/7 weeks and 15 6/7 weeks vary from last menstrual period (LMP) dating by more than 7 days or between 16 0/7 weeks and 21 6/7 weeks by more than 10 days, the estimated due date (EDD) should be changed to correspond with the ultrasonography dating. Between 22 0/7 weeks and 27 6/7 weeks, ultrasonography dating has an accuracy of ± 10–14 days and if the discrepancy is more than 14 days, the EDD should be changed to the corresponding ultrasonography dating; date changes for smaller discrepancies (10–14 days) are appropriate based on timing within this range and clinician assessment of LMP reliability. Pregnancies without an ultrasound examination that confirms or revises the EDD before 22 0/7 weeks of gestational age should be considered suboptimally dated.

### Multisociety statement on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination as a condition of employment for healthcare personnel [^65fc431a]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). High credibility.

Legal considerations for employer COVID-19 vaccination requirements — The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) framework addresses clinical administration rather than employment policy: 'The regulation by its terms requires FDA to establish the conditions under which an EUA product is administered by the medical provider, including by obtaining the recipient's informed consent, but there is no mention of employers or employment policies in the regulation, including requirements of employers', and FDA guidance notes information is typically conveyed via a 'patient fact sheet'. Legal challenges cited here are limited — 'As of June 2021, only 1 trial court decision has addressed a legal challenge to an employee vaccination requirement on the basis of the EUA regulation' — and although that court allowed an employer policy under an EUA, 'it does not establish a precedent'. The page distinguishes mandates from forced vaccination: 'an individual has a right to refuse vaccination but has no right to a particular job'.

Animals in healthcare facilities — approval and animal requirements for patient pet visitation — Healthcare facilities that permit a single pet visitation to a patient should adopt the following practices: Approval should be obtained from IPC and the patient's attending physician and nurse, and approval for the visit should be included in the medical record with details about the animal and the person(s) responsible for the animal's transport and care. Visitation should be restricted to dogs, and animals should be at least 1 year of age and housebroken; younger animals could be considered on a case-by-case basis. Written information must be provided to the owner/designee specifying visit details, including the maximum duration of visitation of one hour. The owner or guardian of the animal is responsible to supervise the animal at all times, prevent contact with other individuals, promptly clean any fecal or urine accidents, supervise the visitation process, and report any events (eg, bite, scratch) to HCP.

### Ethical issues in stopping randomized trials early because of apparent benefit [^13113515]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Stopping randomized trials early because of an apparent benefit is becoming more common. To protect and promote the interests of trial participants, investigators may feel obligated to stop a trial early because of the apparent benefit of a study treatment (compared with placebo or other treatment). There are, however, serious ethical problems with doing so. Truncated trials systematically overestimate treatment effects; in cases where the number of accrued outcome events is small, the overestimation may be very large. Generating seriously inflated estimates of treatment effect violates the ethical research requirement of scientific validity. Subsequent use of inflated estimates to inform clinical decision making and practice guidelines violates the ethical requirements of social value and a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Researchers should ensure that a large number of outcome events accrues before stopping a trial and then continue recruitment to assess whether positive trends continue. This can balance the need to protect research participants with the ethical requirements of scientific validity, social value, and a favorable risk-benefit ratio.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^3669e2d5]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
The raw scores from a 0–100 cumulative questionnaire (on the ordinate) are given as a function of the "true" linear measure (on the abscissa) of the variable tackled. Suppose scores are the number of correct responses (or, interchangeably here, the percent of correct answers). The true measure is given in linear logit units from RA. The increase in scores is roughly proportional to the rise in measure only in the "central" portion of the S-shaped (here, logistic) function (heavily hatched area). At the extremes (here, the "ceiling" of the scale, not the "floor", is highlighted), the same increase of 10 score points corresponds to a much higher increase in true measure (lightly hatched area). The scale's capacity to discriminate across subjects is lower the more the scores approach the ceiling of the questionnaire (reprinted with permission from Linacre, Fig. 1 in Wright and Linacre).

### SPIRIT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for protocols of randomised trials [^f503a655]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Item 30: Plans for seeking research ethics committee/institutional review board approval

Example

"The protocol, informed consent forms, and all other study material have been approved by the Ottawa Health Science Network - Research Ethics Board (20180452-01H). Each participating hospital's Research Ethics Board (REB) has also approved the trial protocol. Consent material is available in French and English. PRICE-2 will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice and based on the principles of the second version of the Tri-Council Policy Statement".

Explanation

Before participants are enrolled, a universal requirement for the ethical conduct of clinical trials is the review and approval of the protocol by qualified individuals who are not associated with the research team and have no disqualifying conflicts of interest as reviewers. The review is typically conducted by a formal research ethics board or committee (also called an institutional review board) in accordance with jurisdictional policy.

The protocol should document where approval has been obtained or outline plans to seek such approval at all sites.

Summary of key elements to address

Plans to obtain research ethics committee or institutional review board approval.

Item 31: Plans for communicating important protocol modifications to relevant parties

Example

"The Sponsor is authorized to amend the protocol. All important protocol modifications will be first discussed within the Steering committee and then communicated to the relevant parties (local investigators, EC [ethics committee], trial registry) by the Sponsor. Substantial amendments will only be implemented after approval by the EC, whereas non-substantial amendments are communicated by the Sponsor to the EC within the annual safety report. Amended protocols will be sent to the study sites for filling in the Investigator Site File, and training on new documents will be documented on site".

### Ethics review in compassionate use [^85bbec95]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The second situation that harbors potential for abuse is associated with the commercial sales interests of drug manufacturers. The possibility exists that these manufacturers might use compassionate use programs to distribute investigational drugs, thus generating increased demand for the drug following its eventual formal approval. Compassionate use programs may also provide patients with continued access to a drug that is eventually not approved. Positive results obtained in compassionate use programs can also generate unwarranted beliefs regarding the efficacy and safety of investigational drugs, and in some cases this might be used to try to fast-track the drug's formal approval. There is a risk, therefore, that the commercial interests of drug manufacturers might influence decisions on which drugs, and which patients, are included in compassionate use programs.

In some countries, drugs for compassionate use must be dispensed free of charge. Consequently, it may be problematic when the free supply of a drug ceases following its introduction into the national market and/or the national reimbursement list. This situation, together with a very advanced stage of clinical development, might result in a drug's accelerated, "forced" admission to the hospital formulary, not only for the concerned patient, but also for others with the same disease.

A properly prepared informed consent form is a basic safeguard to prevent potential abuse, and to ensure that a treatment is compassionately used primarily for the patient's benefit. It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss the specific information that should be included on this form, but it should contain adequate information about the potential benefits and risks associated with the use of drugs with unproven safety and efficacy. While it is commonly accepted that informed consent should be required for compassionate use, independent review would ensure that informed consent forms really fulfill their purpose. In practice, RECs have extensive experience of reviewing informed consent forms, and although they are principally involved in the evaluation of those used in biomedical research, the overall objective of the consent form in compassionate use is the same: to present a patient with all the risk/benefit information they need to make a truly informed choice about participation in a program. Therefore, consent forms to be used in compassionate use, especially in programs involving research aspects, should be reviewed by RECs. Where compassionate use does not involve research (e.g. in the treatment of individual patients) an alternative solution could be to codify consent form standards. Physicians wanting to administer a drug on a compassionate use basis could then be held to those standards.

### CONSORT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for reporting randomised trials [^6aae905c]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

In September 2004, the ICMJE established a policy that it would only consider trials for publication if they had been registered before the enrolment of the first participant. This policy resulted in a substantial increase in the number of trials being registered. However, some trials are still not registered. The ICMJE gives guidance on acceptable registries and also accepts registration in WHO primary registries and ClinicalTrials.gov. Registers charging a fee to view their content should be avoided to ensure equity of access for everyone, including patients and the public.

The Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines, endorsed and used by thousands of journals, recommends trial registration. In a survey of 168 high impact factor medical journals' "Instructions to authors" in 2014, 78 journals stated that all recent clinical trials must be registered as a requirement of submission to that journal. A more recent survey in 2019 of surgical journals publishing randomised trials found that 53 of 82 journals mandated prospective registration.

Despite recommendations, and mandates in some jurisdictions for clinical trialists to register their trial and evidence that registration deters selective reporting, this is still not happening universally. Authors should provide the name of the registry, the trial's associated registration number, date of registration and, where possible, the URL for the trial's registration. We recommend that authors also report whether (or when) the trial results are available on the associated trial register.

Despite the considerable increase in clinical trial registration, there is a strong body of evidence showing the lack of access to trial results. The latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki states that "Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the results of their research on human participants and are accountable for the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of their reports. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly available". In 2015, WHO published a new statement on the public disclosure of trial results, which requests that "the key outcomes are to be made publicly available within 12 months of study completion by posting to the results section of the primary clinical trial registry. Where a registry is used without a results database available, the results should be posted on a free-to-access, publicly available, searchable institutional website of the Regulatory Sponsor, Funder or Principal Investigator". Some legislations are also in place in the US, UK, and Europe requesting the posting of trial results on clinical trials registry within 12 months after study completion.

Suboptimally dated pregnancy — definition and dating thresholds — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists considers first-trimester ultrasonography to be the most accurate method to establish or confirm gestational age, and pregnancies without an ultrasonographic examination confirming or revising the estimated due date before 22 0/7 weeks of gestation should be considered suboptimally dated. A recommended 22-week cutoff replaces a historic 20 weeks of gestation threshold, supported by the rationale that a discrepancy of more than 10 days applies from 16 0/7 weeks through 21 6/7 weeks of gestation, and this aligns with the recommendation that the optimal time for a single ultrasonographic examination is at 18–22 weeks of gestation.

### Granisetron (Sancuso) [^7d5a31b6]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Regarding the use of granisetron hydrochloride TD (also known as Sancuso) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. The drug granisetron hydrochloride TD (also known as Sancuso) is classified under category B1 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have not shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage.
