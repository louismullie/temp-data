## Question

acog mammo screening

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ACOG's current mammography screening recommendations for average-risk women, including when to start, how often to screen, when to stop, and how to handle dense breasts and high-risk scenarios, with attention to shared decision-making and how ACOG compares with USPSTF and ACS. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, up-to-date ACOG source. Then, I should verify the exact age to initiate screening and whether this is a new change. Next, I will review screening intervals and the rationale for annual versus biennial strategies. After that, I need to check the stopping age and the role of life expectancy. I will then examine dense-breast management and whether supplemental imaging is advised. I should also confirm the stance on clinical breast examination and breast self-exam. Finally, I will compare ACOG with USPSTF and ACS and close with practical counseling points and a concise summary.

> Let me first confirm the most current ACOG guidance. Wait, I initially thought Practice Bulletin 179 from 2017 was the latest, but hold on, I should verify whether there has been a more recent update. The 2024 JAMA Network news report indicates ACOG now recommends that all individuals at average risk begin screening mammography at age 40, reflecting rising incidence in the 40s and aligning with a broader shift toward earlier initiation, so I should prioritize that as the most current ACOG position while still anchoring detailed interval and stopping guidance in PB 179 and related ACOG documents [^111AeshD] [^114PTzJb] [^111VgZPM].

> I will now examine the age to initiate screening. ACOG's current recommendation is to begin routine screening mammography at age 40 for average-risk women, and if screening is not started in the 40s, it should begin by no later than age 50; this represents a change from the 2017 framing that emphasized offering screening at 40 with stronger emphasis on starting by 50, now made explicit as a start-at-40 directive in 2024, which I should double-check against the news summary and the 2017 bulletin to ensure consistency with shared decision-making language [^111AeshD] [^11263qBB].

> Next, I should review screening intervals. ACOG supports screening every 1 to 2 years based on shared decision-making that weighs benefits (earlier detection) against harms (false positives, callbacks, overdiagnosis); after age 55, biennial screening can be considered to reduce harms, provided patients are counseled that less frequent screening may modestly reduce benefits, so I need to ensure I capture both the flexibility and the trade-offs in counseling [^114PTzJb] [^114vEFQE].

> Hold on, I should verify the stopping age and the role of life expectancy. ACOG advises continuing routine screening until at least age 75, and beyond 75 decisions should be individualized via shared decision-making based on health status and longevity rather than age alone; this means screening can continue if a woman is healthy with a reasonable life expectancy, and I should confirm that this aligns with the 2017 bulletin and subsequent summaries [^114L13HJ] [^111VgZPM] [^117Bxvku].

> Let me consider dense breasts next. Women with dense breasts have a modestly increased cancer risk and reduced mammography sensitivity, but ACOG does not recommend routine adjunctive imaging (ultrasound or MRI) for asymptomatic average-risk women with dense breasts because evidence does not show improved outcomes; instead, clinicians should comply with state density notification laws and use shared decision-making if additional testing is considered, so I need to be careful not to overstate any role for supplemental screening in this group [^115ngBc3] [^112d9WvS].

> I should confirm the stance on clinical breast examination and breast self-exam. ACOG does not recommend routine clinical breast examination for average-risk, asymptomatic women because of limited benefit and increased false positives; instead, ACOG promotes breast self-awareness, encouraging women to report any changes promptly, and I need to ensure I distinguish this from teaching formal breast self-examination, which is discouraged [^114JefHQ] [^117Lz4FM] [^1159oiMR].

> Next, I should review risk stratification and high-risk pathways. ACOG emphasizes periodic risk assessment and further evaluation for women with potentially increased risk; those with strong family histories or other red flags should be referred for genetic counseling and consideration of BRCA testing, and high-risk women may start earlier with annual mammography and consider supplemental MRI per risk-based guidelines, so I need to ensure I flag this as distinct from average-risk recommendations [^1114ESAQ] [^116cVp4T] [^117XwTA4].

> But wait, what about pregnancy and lactation. I should double-check imaging safety in these states. Mammography and ultrasound are safe during pregnancy and lactation, and women should not delay indicated imaging; MRI with gadolinium is generally avoided in pregnancy unless benefits clearly outweigh risks, and lactation may reduce MRI sensitivity, so counseling on timing and technique matters, and I need to state this clearly to avoid unnecessary delays in diagnosis [^112fowSL].

> I will now compare ACOG with other major guidelines to contextualize differences. The USPSTF recommends biennial screening from ages 40 to 74 and concludes evidence is insufficient for women 75 and older, reflecting a more conservative balance of benefits and harms; the ACS recommends annual screening at 45 to 54 and biennial thereafter, with the option to start at 40, and also bases continuation on health and life expectancy, so ACOG's start-at-40 and individualized continuation beyond 75 sit between ACS and USPSTF in terms of initiation and stopping thresholds [^112uZgBu] [^1128s8yR] [^111u9eL9] [^112SjnVL].

> Let me synthesize practical counseling points. I need to ensure discussions cover the mortality benefit of screening starting at 40, the trade-offs of annual versus biennial intervals, the lack of benefit from routine CBE or self-exam, the implications of breast density without routine supplemental imaging, and the need to individualize screening beyond 75 based on health and preferences; shared decision-making tools and risk calculators can support these conversations, and I should confirm that ACOG endorses this approach [^117XwTA4] [^111yv62t].

> Final check and concise summary: ACOG currently recommends routine screening mammography to begin at age 40 for average-risk women, with screening every 1 to 2 years based on shared decision-making, consideration of biennial intervals after 55 to reduce harms, continuation until at least age 75, and individualized decisions beyond 75 guided by health status and life expectancy; routine adjunctive imaging is not advised for dense breasts in average-risk women, clinical breast examination is not recommended for screening, and breast self-exam should not be taught, with breast self-awareness encouraged instead [^111AeshD] [^114PTzJb] [^114L13HJ] [^115ngBc3] [^114JefHQ] [^117Lz4FM].

ACOG recommends **routine screening mammography every 1–2 years** [^114PTzJb] for average-risk women starting at age 40, with shared decision-making to weigh benefits and harms [^117XwTA4]. If screening is not started in the 40s, begin by age 50 [^11263qBB]. Continue screening until at least age 75 [^114L13HJ], and beyond that based on health and life expectancy [^111VgZPM]. For women with dense breasts, ACOG does not recommend routine adjunctive imaging [^115ngBc3] in the absence of additional risk factors [^112d9WvS]. Clinical breast examination is not recommended for routine screening [^111n8qAY], and breast self-exam is not advised [^114JefHQ]; instead, promote breast self-awareness [^117Lz4FM].

---

## Age to initiate screening

- **Start at age 40**: Offer screening mammography starting at age 40 for average-risk women [^11263qBB] [^111AeshD].
- **By age 50**: If not started in the 40s, begin by age 50 [^114mMcvf].
- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss benefits (mortality reduction) and harms (false positives, overdiagnosis) to align screening with patient values [^117XwTA4] [^111yv62t].

---

## Screening interval

Regarding the screening interval, **annual or biennial** screening every 1–2 years is recommended, with shared decision-making to tailor the interval to patient preferences and risk tolerance [^114PTzJb] [^114vEFQE]. After age 55, **biennial screening** may be preferred to reduce false positives and overdiagnosis, provided the patient understands the potential reduction in benefit [^114PTzJb] [^117XwTA4].

---

## Age to discontinue screening

Continue screening until **at least age 75** [^114L13HJ]; beyond 75, base continuation on health status, life expectancy, and patient preference through shared decision-making [^111VgZPM] [^117Bxvku].

---

## Special considerations

### Dense breasts

In women with dense breasts, **no routine adjunctive imaging** — ACOG does not recommend routine MRI or ultrasound in asymptomatic women with dense breasts and no additional risk factors, as evidence does not show improved outcomes [^115ngBc3] [^112d9WvS]. For **shared decision-making**, consider supplemental imaging only when overall risk is elevated and after discussing false positives and limited evidence of benefit [^112JVtgo].

---

### Clinical breast examination and breast self-examination

For clinical breast examination (CBE) and breast self-examination (BSE), **CBE not recommended** — routine CBE is not advised for average-risk women [^112MVT8d] [^111n8qAY]. For **BSE not advised** — do not teach BSE due to false positives and lack of benefit; promote breast self-awareness instead [^114JefHQ] [^1159oiMR].

---

## Comparison with other guidelines

| **Organization** | **Age to start** | **Interval** | **Age to stop** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ACOG | 40 (offer) | 1–2 years | ≥ 75 (individualize) |
| USPSTF | 40 (biennial) | 2 years | 74 (insufficient evidence ≥ 75) |
| ACS | 45 (strong); 40–44 (option) | Annual 45–54; biennial ≥ 55 | Continue if ≥ 10-year life expectancy |

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Start at 40**: Offer screening mammography at age 40; if not started, begin by 50 [^11263qBB] [^114mMcvf].
- **Interval**: Every 1–2 years, with shared decision-making [^114PTzJb].
- **Stop**: Continue to at least 75; individualize beyond 75 [^114L13HJ] [^111VgZPM].
- **Dense breasts**: No routine adjunctive imaging without additional risk factors [^115ngBc3] [^112d9WvS].
- **CBE/BSE**: Not recommended; promote breast self-awareness [^114JefHQ] [^117Lz4FM].

ACOG's guidance emphasizes **shared decision-making** to balance benefits and harms, with routine mammography from age 40 and individualized decisions about intervals and stopping based on health, risk, and preferences [^117XwTA4] [^111yv62t].

### ACOG committee opinion no. 593: management of women with dense breasts diagnosed by mammography [^112d9WvS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Women with dense breasts have a modestly increased risk of breast cancer and experience reduced sensitivity of mammography to detect breast cancer. However, evidence is lacking to advocate for additional testing until there are clinically validated data that indicate improved screening outcomes. Currently, screening mammography remains the most useful tool for breast cancer detection and has consistently demonstrated a reduction in breast cancer mortality. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend routine use of alternative or adjunctive tests to screening mammography in women with dense breasts who are asymptomatic and have no additional risk factors. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that health care providers comply with state laws that may require disclosure to women of their breast density as recorded in a mammogram report.

### Practice bulletin number 179: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^117XwTA4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death in American women (1). Regular screening mammography starting at age 40 years reduces breast cancer mortality in average-risk women (2). Screening, however, also exposes women to harm through false-positive test results and overdiagnosis of biologically indolent lesions. Differences in balancing benefits and harms have led to differences among major guidelines about what age to start, what age to stop, and how frequently to recommend mammography screening in average-risk women (2–4). Breast cancer risk assessment is very important for identifying women who may benefit from more intensive breast cancer surveillance; however, there is no standardized approach to office-based breast cancer risk assessment in the United States. This can lead to missed opportunities to identify women at high risk of breast cancer and may result in applying average-risk screening recommendations to high-risk women. Risk assessment and identification of women at high risk allow for referral to health care providers with expertise in cancer genetics counseling and testing for breast cancer-related germline mutations (eg, BRCA), patient counseling about risk-reduction options, and cascade testing to identify family members who also may be at increased risk. The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to discuss breast cancer risk assessment, review breast cancer screening guidelines in average-risk women, and outline some of the controversies surrounding breast cancer screening. It will present recommendations for using a framework of shared decision making to assist women in balancing their personal values regarding benefits and harms of screening at various ages and intervals to make personal screening choices from within a range of reasonable options. Recommendations for women at elevated risk and discussion of new technologies, such as tomosynthesis, are beyond the scope of this document and are addressed in other publications of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) (5–7).

Recommendations of other organizations for breast cancer screening — The American Cancer Society "recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years" and "suggests that women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually", that those "55 years or older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually", may "begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years", and should continue "as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer". The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists "recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer should be offered screening mammography starting at age 40 years", and if not initiated in their 40s, "by no later than age 50 years", with screening "every 1 or 2 years" and continued "until at least age 75 years", with decisions "Beyond age 75 years" based on shared decision-making. The American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging "recommend annual screening mammography beginning at age 40 years for women at average risk", advise continuing "past age 74 years, without an upper age limit, unless severe comorbidities limit life expectancy", and the American College of Radiology "also recommends breast cancer risk assessment by age 25 years for all individuals". The American Academy of Family Physicians "supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on screening for breast cancer".

Early detection of breast cancer has been shown to decrease the mortality rate (1). Technology continues to evolve to improve the accuracy of detection. In addition, the process of individual risk assessment is evolving, and new factors that affect risk are being identified. The purpose of this document is to clarify the rationale for current breast cancer screening guidelines and evaluate the evidence regarding screening techniques. It also focuses on mammography and other detection techniques as screening tools to identify nonpalpable lesions; the use of mammography for diagnostic purposes when a lesion is palpated is addressed briefly.

Screening mammography facilitates the early diagnosis of breast carcinoma in women. Timely follow-up can optimize the diagnosis and treatment of women with abnormal screening test results. When test results reveal that additional studies are needed, no barriers should prohibit testing during the screening mammography visit.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 356: routine cancer screening [^111ztV3d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Obstetrician-gynecologists serve as primary care physicians for many women. Because the obstetrician-gynecologist may be the only physician providing routine care, clinicians should be able to provide recommendations for routine cancer screenings, including those for nongynecologic cancers. This document summarizes recommendations of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for routine cancer screening for the average-risk American woman. The obstetrician-gynecologist should discuss both benefits and limitations of screening tests with the patient.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering screening clinical breast examination in asymptomatic, average-risk females in the context of an informed, shared decision-making approach recognizing the uncertainty of additional benefits and the possibility of adverse consequences of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography. Consider using intervals of every 1–3 years in females aged 25–39 years and annually in females aged ≥ 40 years if it is performed. Perform clinical breast examination as part of evaluation in high-risk females and females with symptoms.

Obstetrician-gynecologists are in a favorable position to diagnose breast disease in their patients. Obstetrician-gynecologists are more likely to encounter a patient with breast cancer than a patient with any gynecologic cancer. The American College of Obstetricians and gynecologists (ACOG) has adopted the goals of assisting in educating obstetrician-gynecologists in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and in reducing mortality from breast cancer. To help meet these goals, ACOG has developed recommendations for the early diagnosis of breast disease.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to obtain screening mammography every 1 or 2 years based on an informed, shared decision-making process including a discussion of the benefits and harms of annual and biennial screening and incorporating patient values and preferences in females at average risk of breast cancer. Consider obtaining biennial screening mammography, particularly after age 55 years, to reduce the frequency of harms, as long as patient counseling includes a discussion that with decreased screening comes some reduction in benefits.

### Guideline-inconsistent breast cancer screening for women over 50: a vignette-based survey [^115H9ZQC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Professional organizations have issued guidelines recommending breast cancer screening for women 50 years of age.

Objective

This study examines the percent of U.S. primary care physicians who report breast cancer screening practices that are not consistent with guidelines, and the characteristics of physicians who reported offering extra test modalities.

Design

We analyzed a subset of a 2008 cross-sectional Women's Health Care survey sent to primary care physicians randomly selected from the national American Medical Association (AMA) Physician Masterfile. A subset of physicians received a survey that presented a vignette of a health maintenance visit for an asymptomatic 51-year-old woman who was not at high risk for breast cancer. Responses were weighted to represent physicians nationally.

Participants

1,654 U.S. family physicians, general internists, and obstetrician-gynecologists under age 65, who practiced in office or hospital based settings (62.8% response rate). After exclusions, 553 study physicians remained for analysis.

Main Measure

Physician self-report of breast cancer screening practices that are not consistent with the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), and the American Cancer Society (ACS), defined as almost always offering mammography.

Key Results

36.0% (95% CI: 31.8%-40.5%) of physicians reported offering breast cancer screening tests inconsistent with national guidelines, with most offering extra tests (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and/or ultrasound) (33.2%, 95% CI 29.1%-37.6%). In adjusted analysis, risk-averse physicians and those who believed in the clinical effectiveness of MRI were more likely to offer extra breast cancer screening tests.

Conclusions

Physicians often report offering breast cancer screening test modalities beyond those recommended for a 51-year-old woman. Strategies, such as academic detailing regarding appropriate use of technology and provision of clinical decision support for breast cancer screening, could decrease overuse of resources.

### Breast cancer screening: common questions and answers [^113AKxYP]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer in women and accounts for 30% of all new cancers in the United States. The highest incidence of breast cancer is in women 70 to 74 years of age. Numerous risk factors are associated with the development of breast cancer. A risk assessment tool can be used to determine individual risk and help guide screening decisions. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommend against teaching average-risk women to perform breast self-examinations. The USPSTF and AAFP recommend biennial screening mammography for average-risk women 50 to 74 years of age. However, there is no strong evidence supporting a net benefit of mammography screening in average-risk women 40 to 49 years of age; therefore, the USPSTF and AAFP recommend individualized decision-making in these women. For average-risk women 75 years and older, the USPSTF and AAFP conclude that there is insufficient evidence to recommend screening, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Cancer Society state that screening may continue depending on the woman's health status and life expectancy. Women at high risk of breast cancer may benefit from mammography starting at 30 years of age or earlier, with supplemental screening such as magnetic resonance imaging. Supplemental ultrasonography in women with dense breasts increases cancer detection but also false-positive results.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to offer screening mammography starting at age 40 years in females at average risk of breast cancer. Offer screening mammography no earlier than age 40 years in females at average risk of breast cancer. Begin screening mammography by no later than age 50 years in females not initiated screening in their 40s. Make the decision about the age to begin mammography screening through a shared decision-making process taking into account information about the potential benefits and harms.

### Congruence of cancer screening recommendations between the USPSTF and the top ten US cancer centers: a cross sectional study [^116wLvND]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 6
Cancer centers whose websites included a discussion of the potential harms associated with screening, stratified by cancer type.

Furthermore, there is a lack of clarity regarding the development process of the recommendations from each cancer center. While some centers directly referenced the USPSTF or other professional society guidelines, many did not. It is likely that the consensus of treating providers at the cancer centers played a significant role in the development of these recommendations; however, the extent of this involvement is not clearly described. Indeed, some of the discrepancies between the Top Ten US Cancer Centers and the USPSTF can be explained by guidelines from other bodies with conflicting recommendations. Although guidelines from both professional societies and the USPSTF are based on available evidence, they are reviewed and updated on different timelines. For example, the American College of Radiology and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) advise annual mammography starting at age 40. NCCN further advises a clinical breast examination every 1–3 years from age 25 to 40, and annually afterwards. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises mammograms every 1–2 years starting at age 40, with consideration of biannual mammograms after age 55. ACS advises that mammograms should initially be completed annually starting at age 45, though may be done biannually after the age of 55. Similarly for prostate cancer, the AUA recommends consideration for initiating testing for average-risk men between 45 and 50 years with PSA as first line screening test at a personalized screening interval. They also advise that DRE may be used alongside PSA to establish the risk of clinically significant prostate cancer. ACS recommends considering PSA testing at 50 years old, with timing for subsequent testing interval dependent on the value of the initial test.NCCN recommends considering PSA testing at 45 years old with consideration for baseline DRE, and further testing interval dependent on the initial baseline value. For cervical cancer, ACOG, Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology have all endorsed the USPSTF guidelines. However, ACS recommends initiating screening with hrHPV alone every 5 years starting at 25 years through 65. Thus, just as it is difficult for patients to know what to do with so much conflicting guidance, the same can be true for the individual cancer centres and providers trying to consolidate conflicting advice from multiple guidelines to provide advice for their patients. Healthcare providers, who ultimately have the discretion to recommend a specific screening strategy for their individual patient, may not rely on one resource but rather try to merge all the available evidence and guidelines with their clinical experience, and the context of patient and system factors in which they practice.

Recommendations for Oncolactation Management in Breast Cancer Patients

Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis during Pregnancy and Lactation

Lactational status affects breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Pregnancy and lactation induce physiological changes in the breast, altering its imaging appearance. Therefore, examinations must be interpreted contextually, and lactating women may require supplemental imaging modalities. While statements by the American College of Radiology (ACR)and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)describe the safety of breast imaging during pregnancy and lactation, delays in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment may occur due to avoidance of imaging during these periods and lack of clinical suspicion for malignancy. It is crucial that women not forgo or delay indicated imaging owing to pregnancy or lactational status, particularly given the aggressive nature of PPBC. Key recommendations are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Key recommendations for breast cancer screening and diagnostic evaluation in pregnant or lactating patients

Imaging Modalities

Mammography and ultrasonography are safe during pregnancy and lactation. Contrary to past recommendations, the ACR now advises against the use of fetal shielding, because it causes scatter and increases fetal radiation dose; without a shield, the exposure is otherwise negligible. There are no data on contrast-enhanced mammography in these patient populations. Because iodinated contrast is known to cross the placenta but fetal safety is unknown, ACOG recommends avoiding contrast in pregnant patients unless its use would significantly impact management.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium is not recommended by the ACR during pregnancy, because gadolinium crosses the placenta and may be teratogenic. Given the paucity of fetal safety data, the ACOG acknowledges that the use of gadolinium in pregnancy is controversial and advises that its use be reserved for patients for whom "the benefits clearly outweigh the possible risks". Lactation may reduce the sensitivity of breast MRI, but it is a safe and effective screening and diagnostic modality in the postpartum population.

To optimize sensitivity, patients should breastfeed or express breastmilk (e.g. pump) immediately prior to breast imaging. They can breastfeed normally after any study, including MRI with gadolinium contrast and mammography with intravenous iodinated contrast.

### Cancer screening in the United States, 2010: a review of current American cancer society guidelines and issues in cancer screening [^111Hh4Gr]. CA (2010). Low credibility.

Each year the American Cancer Society (ACS) publishes a summary of its recommendations for early cancer detection, a report on data and trends in cancer screening rates, and select issues related to cancer screening. In 2010, the ACS updated its guidelines for testing for early prostate cancer detection, and during 2009 there were several newsworthy updates in the cancer screening guidelines from other organizations. In this article, the current ACS guidelines and recent issues are summarized, updates of guidelines for testing for early breast cancer detection by the US Preventive Services Task Force and for prevention and early detection of cervical cancer from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists are addressed, and the most recent data from the National Health Interview Survey pertaining to participation rates in cancer screening are described.

### Practice bulletin number 179: breast cancer risk assessment and screening in average-risk women [^115A4m3m]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ductal carcinoma in situ, more specifically with respect to breast cancer screening, average-risk females, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering screening clinical breast examination in asymptomatic, average-risk females in the context of an informed, shared decision-making approach recognizing the uncertainty of additional benefits and the possibility of adverse consequences of clinical breast examination beyond screening mammography. Consider using intervals of every 1–3 years in females aged 25–39 years and annually in females aged ≥ 40 years if it is performed. Perform clinical breast examination as part of evaluation in high-risk females and females with symptoms.

### The effect of the controversial US preventive services task force recommendations on the use of screening mammography [^1134oHMC]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The 2009 release of updated US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations on screening mammography differed sharply from those of the American Cancer Society, the ACR, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The aim of this study was to ascertain the effect of these recommendations on the utilization of screening mammography in the Medicare population.

Methods

The Medicare Part B Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary Master Files from 2005 through 2010 were used to determine the annual utilization rate of screening mammography from 2005 to 2010. A utilization trend line was plotted for those years.

Results

The utilization rate of screening mammography per 1,000 women in the Medicare population was 311.6 in 2005 and increased gradually each year to 322.9 in 2009 (a compound annual growth rate of 0.9%). However, after the USPSTF recommendations were issued in late 2009, this rate decreased abruptly to 309.1 (-4.3%) in 2010.

Conclusions

The abrupt decrease in the utilization of screening mammography in 2010 was in sharp contrast to the previous slow annual increases in its utilization from 2005 to 2009. Because there are no other factors to explain a decrease of this magnitude, it would seem that the USPSTF recommendations and the ensuing publicity resulted in a decrease in the utilization of screening mammography in the Medicare population in the first year after issuance of the new recommendations.

### Screening for the major malignancies affecting women: current guidelines [^111Bue87]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Throughout their lifetimes, many women rely on the obstetrician-gynecologist to provide them with regular health care. Therefore the obstetrician-gynecologist should be able to provide comprehensive information regarding consensus screening recommendations for the major malignancies that occur in women. Additionally, a woman's health care provider should continually refine his or her cancer risk — assessment skills and should remain apprised of high-risk habits, family histories, and other cancer-predisposing factors that allow identification of those women in whom heightened surveillance or intervention may be appropriate. This article reviews the epidemiologic and risk factors associated with the major malignancies that affect women today and provides screening guidelines.

### Obstetrician-gynecologists' knowledge and opinions about the United States preventive services task force (USPSTF) committee, the women's health amendment, and the affordable care act: national study after the release of the USPSTF 2009 breast cancer screening recommendation statement [^115Nkhrw]. Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Investigate the knowledge and opinions of obstetrician and gynecologists (ob-gyns) regarding the USPSTF committee and statement, and to assess their reactions to healthcare legislation.

Methods

A national cross-sectional survey study of ob-gyns was conducted six months after a controversial USPSTF recommendation statement was released in November 2009. Ob-gyns' opinions about the Women's Health Amendment (WHA) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were also assessed.

Results

A total of 54% of ob-gyns knew that the USPSTF recommendations do not represent the position of the U.S. government and 40% knew that the USPSTF is not comprised of federal employees. A majority (60%) thought that the USPSTF was influenced by potential costs more than guidelines should be. When examining ob-gyns opinions about new national health policies, 88% support the mammography coverage provided by the WHA but support for the ACA varied.

Conclusion

This study provides a snapshot of ob-gyns' knowledge and opinions about the USPSTF and breast cancer screening guidelines at a controversial point in time. Our findings are a unique contribution to larger efforts to understand health and political policy as the culture of medicine continues to evolve.

### Use of mammograms among women aged ≥ 40 years – United States, 2000–2005 [^115K35A9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death (after lung and bronchial cancer) among women in the United States. In 2002, at least 182,125 women in the United States had a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer, and 41,514 died from the disease. Screening mammography can reduce mortality from breast cancer by approximately 20%-35% in women aged 50–69 years and approximately 20% in women aged 40–49 years. Organizations including the American Medical Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and American Cancer Society support mammography screening beginning at age 40 years, although these groups vary in their recommendations regarding intervals for rescreening. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of private-sector experts in prevention and primary care convened by the Department of Health and Human Services, recommends that women aged ≤ 40 years be screened for breast cancer with a mammogram every 1–2 years. Although mammogram use increased substantially during the 1990s, results from a recent cohort study of health maintenance organization members revealed declining screening rates during 1999–2002. This report describes Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) findings that indicate a similar decreasing trend in self-reported use of mammograms among women aged ≤ 40 years during 2000–2005. Continued declines in mammography use might result in increased breast cancer mortality.

### ACOG clinical updates summary: incidental radiologic findings: primary and preventive care review [^115nsXQr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Over the past several decades, the use of cross-sectional imaging has steadily increased largely because of increasing refinements in imaging technology. The progressive improvement in both spatial and temporal resolution of imaging modalities over the years has enabled radiologists to diagnose and characterize disorders with increasing accuracy. However, improved resolution has led to the increased detection of imaging findings that may or may not be clinically relevant. Such incidental findings or "incidentalomas" may be difficult to differentiate from clinically relevant lesions. Radiologists may provide disparate recommendations regarding incidental or indeterminate findings when interpreting results of gynecologic and obstetric imaging examinations in routine clinical practice. Vague recommendations pose challenges for referring clinicians who are unable to determine the clinical relevance of such lesions. Therefore, a general awareness of incidental lesions for any given abdominal or thoracic organ is important for obstetrician-gynecologists involved in the management of patients who require imaging studies. The aim of this monograph is to aid obstetrician-gynecologists in the detection, characterization, and management of incidentally detected lesions that may be encountered on routine women's imaging examinations.

### Financial conflicts of interest among authors of clinical practice guidelines for routine screening mammography [^112AMJ1u]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Financial conflicts of interest (FCOIs) may influence or undermine the credibility of clinical practice guidelines or society recommendations. Given the wide regard of such publications, understanding the prevalence and extent of FCOIs among their authors is essential.

Methods

The most current guidelines containing recommendations for breast cancer screening from the US Preventive Services Task Force, American Cancer Society, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, International Agency for Research on Cancer, ACR, and American College of Physicians were retrieved from their respective organizational websites. Industry payments received by authors were then extracted using CMS Open Payments database (OPD), and the values and types of these payments were evaluated. Finally, financial disclosures were compared with open payments.

Results

Among a total of 43 authors and 7 guideline documents, 14 authors (33%) received at least one industry payment according to OPD payment records, whereas a majority of 29 authors (67%) had none. The median total payment from all sources across all breast imaging guidelines was $0 (interquartile range, $0-$84). Four authors (9%) declared at least one significant FCOI, five (12%) received more than $5,000 from a single company in a single year, and one author had a significant FCOI (2%) identified from OPD records but not disclosed within the guideline document.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that FCOIs likely have little to no influence on the adoption of consensus recommendations regarding routine screening mammography for all cohorts of women.

The American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends the first visit to the obstetrician-gynecologist take place between the ages of 13 and 15 years. This visits will provide health guidance, screening, and preventive health care services and provide an excellent opportunity for the obstetrician-gynecologist to start a physician-patient relationship. This visit generally does not include an internal pelvic examination.

### American Society of Breast Surgeons and society of breast imaging 2025 guidelines for the management of benign breast fibroepithelial lesions [^117SDA4U]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Benign breast conditions guidelines scope and development — These guidelines are intended for use by general and subspecialist surgeons, radiologists, advanced practice practitioners, obstetricians/gynecologists, primary care professionals (internal medicine/family practice), and trainees. The guideline scope is limited to management of the benign condition at time of diagnosis, not the diagnostic process preceding the diagnosis of the condition, and concordance is assumed when biopsy pathology explains imaging results; age-appropriate screening refers to consideration of age and other breast cancer risk factors. A modified Delphi consensus methodology was used, with a consensus panel including ASBrS (n = 12), the Society of Breast Imaging (n = 2), a breast pathology representative (n = 1), and a patient advocate (n = 1), and recommendations were developed by conducting 2 rounds of consensus panel ratings with a priori scoring methods; draft statements underwent public comment and were revised accordingly.

### Evidence to support screening women annually [^111MkTCD]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Radiology, American Cancer Society, and US Preventive Services Task Force agree that mammography screening beginning at age 40 saves more lives than any other strategy. Despite these seemingly concordant summaries of the benefits of screening mammography, there are persistent debates regarding when to start and how often women should participate. Costs of screening, both monetary and personal, comprise the foundation of arguments against screening. This article specifically explores the evidence related to screening intervals and attempts to answer the question: should women be screened annually or biennially?

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^112JVtgo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Mandatory breast density reporting has been enacted as legislation in an increasing number of states. Many patients receive letters notifying them of their breast density, and interpretation of these letters can be challenging for patients and health care providers. In early 2019, Congress authorized the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to amend the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992 to include mandatory breast density reporting at the federal level. The public comment period for the proposed changes to the legislation ended in June 2019, and final regulations should be forthcoming. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that health care providers comply with state laws that require disclosure of breast density in mammogram reports.

Younger women with dense breasts and no other risk factors can be counseled that dense breasts are very common in this age group, and supplemental screening methods are available. However, they are not specifically recommended, have significant risk of false positives, and have not been shown to change outcome. When mammographic density in combination with other risk factors places the woman at above-average risk, additional screening with ultrasonography may be warranted and a shared decision-making model can be applied. Some breast cancer risk calculators integrate breast density and can be used to assess overall risk in these women (see Appendix 5 for complete evidence summary).

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^111yv62t]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Because we anticipated that a literature search would find limited information specific to communicating risk of early-onset breast cancer, we deliberately conducted a broad search encompassing other aspects of breast cancer and other cancers and health conditions. Patient decision aids for colorectal cancer screening have been shown to improve knowledge and interest in screening compared with no information, but are no better than general colorectal cancer screening information. Healthwise Knowledge Base is an evidence-based interactive platform to inform patients about mammogram initiation that includes a shared decision making breast cancer screening tool for women aged 40–50 years (see Appendix 9, available online at), as well as a tool for assisting in decisions about BRCA testing. The user's concerns, desires, and fears are weighed in response to evidence provided about the risks and benefits of screening, and a score indicating preferences and readiness for screening is calculated. A decision analytic model was used to improve estimation of benefits and risks for patients undergoing thrombolysis, with the added benefit that this computerized decision aid can be embedded in an electronic health record. This approach could be translated to support integration of the Gail or Families SHARE model, for example, into a primary care or a woman's personal electronic health record.

There are no current major professional society or health services guidelines about communicating the risk for early-onset breast cancer. Shared decision making has been endorsed by ACOG for deciding the age at which to initiate breast cancer screening. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists acknowledges the importance of screening for social determinants of health in all patients, as these factors may influence decision making and communication.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guidelines do not address early-onset breast cancer risk, except to state that the recommended screening guidelines do not apply to women with prior chest radiation or known underlying genetic mutations such as BRCA1 or BRCA2. National Institute of Health Care Excellence guidelines recommend providing information and support for decision making, but do not recommend any specific tool or decision aid. National Institute of Health Care Excellence guidelines regarding familial breast cancer also recommend the use of shared decision making, materials, and decision aids as well as standardizing the discussion involved in counseling patients and families at risk for familial breast cancers(see Appendix 9 for complete evidence summary).

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^114fZu65]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

METHODS

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists convened an expert panel to identify the best evidence and practices from the literature, existing relevant society guidelines, and available validated specific or generalizable clinical tools. The panel was recruited from the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology to review and summarize the evidence. Panel members were required to have expertise in evidence review and synthesis. Subspecialty expertise in breast disease was also sought. Several of the panel members had completed subspecialty fellowship training in breast disease. The panel developed 10 separate research questions and used the PICO criteria (P = patient, problem, or population; I = intervention; C = comparison, control, or comparator; O = outcome[s]) to frame the literature review. These questions form the organizing basis for this executive summary.

Experts in literature searches from the ACOG Resource Center searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE through Ovid, and PubMed for references not indexed through MEDLINE from January 2010 to January 2019. Literature was organized by level of evidence. Published guidelines were categorized separately from references. A primary reviewer was assigned to each topic to review titles and abstracts, then the entire manuscript when appropriate. Panel members expanded the search criteria when necessary, either increasing the timeframe or broadening the search to other populations, particularly when inadequate evidence was found on the 18–45 years age group. Reference lists from papers found in the search were also reviewed. Internet searches with standard search engines were performed to seek guidelines, recommendations, and tools that might not have been published in peer-reviewed publications. Relevant information was compiled into an evidence summary template. Completed templates were then reviewed by a secondary reviewer and the primary and secondary reviewer worked together on revisions in response to the secondary reviewer's comments.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists convened the Early-Onset Breast Cancer Evidence Review Conference in Washington, DC, April 1–2, 2019, including the panel members and representatives from stakeholder professional and patient advocacy organizations (Table 1). Panel members presented their reviews to the convened group, which discussed each section. Comments from the discussion were integrated into the review summary by the primary reviewer. The revised summaries were sent to a tertiary reviewer for final review, and final revisions were made by the primary reviewer. The final reviews (see Appendices 1–10) were used to develop the educational material.

### Practice bulletin no. 164 summary: diagnosis and management of benign breast disorders [^112edudB]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Breast-related symptoms are among the most common reasons women present to obstetrician-gynecologists. Obstetrician-gynecologists are in a favorable position to diagnose benign breast disease in their patients. The purpose of a thorough understanding of benign breast disease is threefold: 1) to alleviate, when possible, symptoms attributable to benign breast disease, 2) to distinguish benign from malignant breast disease, and 3) to identify patients with an increased risk of breast cancer so that increased surveillance or preventive therapy can be initiated. Obstetrician-gynecologists may perform diagnostic procedures when indicated or may make referrals to physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of breast disease. The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to outline common benign breast disease symptoms in women who are not pregnant or lactating and discuss appropriate evaluation and management. The obstetrician-gynecologist's role in the screening and management of breast cancer is beyond the scope of this document and is addressed in other publications of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (1–3).

### Race and ethnicity-adjusted age recommendation for initiating breast cancer screening [^113coVNg]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In this large, population-based cross-sectional study, we provided an evidence-based recommendation for race and ethnicity–adapted starting ages of BC screening. In general, Black females had an increased risk of dying due to early-onset BC and so could be screened up to 8 years earlier than the recommended starting age of 50 years, whereas Asian and Pacific Islander females could be screened at an older age (ie, 61 years) than the recommended staring age of screening. Exclusion of deaths in year 2020 from our study period to avoid potential confounding on BC mortality of deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic did not change our main findings for Black females.

We also provided race and ethnicity–adapted starting ages of BC screening for other benchmark starting ages (40 and 45 years) given that mammography-screening guidelines have different recommended starting ages, ranging from age 40 to 50 years. For instance, the American Cancer Society recommends that women at mean risk levels should start annual mammography screening from age 45 years but have the opportunity to start from age 40 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends mammography in women from age 40 years and starting screening no later than age 50 years.

This study did not consider the harms associated with screening, but a sophisticated simulation modeling studythat considered these harms estimated that biennial mammograms for Black women starting at age 40 years would be associated with a 57% decrease in the gap in BC mortality in this populations compared with White women. Although Black women may experience disproportionate rates of false positives because of breast density, the added risk of false positives from earlier screenings may be balanced by the benefits associated with earlier BC detection in this group. To decrease the risk of false positives, one may use different screening modalities more suitable for individuals with higher breast density. Our study does not recommend any specific screening modality or interval. Our less sophisticated and more tangible study also supports earlier screening of Black females, starting from age 42 years. Additionally, we could provide race and ethnicity–adapted starting ages for other races and ethnicities in addition to Black females, which were lacking.

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^112v9vNP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

FAMILY HISTORY OF EARLY-ONSET BREAST CANCER

Assessment of family history is essential when evaluating young women accessing primary care. Understanding a woman's family history of breast cancer can identify individuals at elevated risk for hereditary breast cancer or women who would benefit from increased breast cancer surveillance. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the National Institute of Health Care Excellence, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network have published guidelines recommending assessment of family history and screening for patients at increased risk of breast cancer. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states that screening should include at minimum a personal cancer history and first- and second-degree relatives' cancer history that includes a description of the type of primary cancer, the age of onset, and the lineage of the family member. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical guidelines recommend genetic assessment for all patients with first- and second-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer younger than age 50 years. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening of women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer using one of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2). Women with positive screening results should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, BRCA testing. Genetic counselors can help determine which of the many available panels of genetic testing are most appropriate and cost-effective.

Objective

We sought to assess knowledge and adherence to the revised US Preventive Services Task Force breast cancer screening guidelines among gynecologic care providers.

Study Design

This was a cross-sectional descriptive study based on a survey conducted among gynecologic care providers.

Results

Forty providers completed the survey (80%). In response to the statement "The current recommended age to initiate breast cancer screening is… ", 48.7% of providers responded in accordance with revised guidelines. For the statement "Women between the age of 50 and 74 years old are recommended to have screening mammography", 46.2% of respondents answered in accordance. In response to the statement "The United States Preventative Services Task Force recommends teaching breast self-examination", 71.8% of providers responded in accordance. A total of 37 respondents (92.5%) stated that they were aware of the revised guidelines, but 17 (42.4%) stated that they were applicable to their patient population.

Conclusion

Knowledge of the revised guidelines appeared to be relatively low in our provider sample.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^111u9eL9]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening recommendations — average-risk women state that women should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (strong recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (qualified recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (qualified recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (qualified recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (qualified recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (qualified recommendation).

Most obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) physicians assist their patients at the time of a new breast cancer diagnosis. OB/GYN physicians can assure women that the tests being performed to map the individual features of the breast cancer follow a predictable and organized process. In many cases, it is appropriate to confidently reassure the patient of a good outcome based on the diagnostic mammography features. Regular attendance at interdisciplinary breast cancer conferences will help OB/GYN physicians develop the required knowledge to counsel women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^113hHMUa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention launched the Bring Your Brave campaign to increase knowledge about early-onset breast cancer, defined as breast cancer in women aged 18–45 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists convened a panel of experts in breast disease from the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology to review relevant literature, validated tools, best practices, and practice guidelines as a first step toward developing educational materials for women's health care providers about early-onset breast cancer. Panel members conducted structured literature reviews, which were then reviewed by other panel members and discussed at an in-person meeting of stakeholder professional and patient advocacy organizations in April 2019. This article summarizes the relevant literature, existing guidance, and validated tools to guide health care providers in the prevention, early detection, and special considerations of early-onset breast cancer. Substantive knowledge gaps were noted and summarized to provide guidance for future research.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^116ZTVC4]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) average-risk screening — older age, health, and life expectancy: Health and life expectancy, not simply age, must be considered in screening decisions, and a significant proportion of women 75 years and older are in good health and can be expected to live considerably longer than 10 or more years. Based on 2010 US Life Tables, approximately 50% of 80-year-old women and 25% of 85-year-old women will live at least 10 years, and an older woman's life expectancy exceeding 10 years is generally defined as having greater than a 50% probability of surviving 10 years. For women who are healthy and have at least a 10-year life expectancy, individualized decisions about screening mammography should be considered, and the GDG recommends that women should continue screening as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer.

### Breast cancer screening modalities, recommendations, and novel imaging techniques [^114bKLHp]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Among women, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Mammography remains the only validated screening tool to reduce breast cancer mortality. The American Society of Breast Surgeons recommends that average-risk women undergo breast cancer screening every year starting at age 40. This article reviews the fundamentals of mammography screening, current age-based mammography screening recommendations, supplemental breast cancer screening recommendations in high-risk women, and novel imaging technologies. This review summarizes recommendations from the American Society of Breast Surgeons and published guidelines from major societies to reflect a range of evidence-based perspectives regarding mammographic screening.

### The 2009 US preventive services task force (USPSTF) guidelines are not supported by science: the scientific support for mammography screening [^1133rx29]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Mammography screening is one of the major medical accomplishments of the past 40 years. In light of the downstream consequences of any screening test, it was critical that mammography screening be challenged. There have been many legitimate challenges, as well as many challenges that are not scientifically based but have gained credibility because of repetition. The latter have led to a great deal of confusion among women and their physicians. The aim of this review is to dispel many of the misunderstandings that have developed in the past 4 decades and, hopefully, reduce the confusion that has occurred. Mammography screening does not find all breast cancers and does not find all cancers early enough to result in a cure, but it is a major advance, and women should not be denied access to its benefits.

### Committee opinion no 609: colorectal cancer screening strategies [^113YCiHc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Each year, more than 24,000 women die from colorectal cancer, which makes it the third leading cause of cancer death in women after lung cancer and breast cancer. However, screening tests are underused for many segments of the population and are ordered in a manner inconsistent with guidelines. The primary goal of colorectal cancer screening is to reduce mortality through the reduction of advanced disease. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening every 10 years for average-risk women beginning at age 50 years and at age 45 years for African American women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends colonoscopy every 10 years as the most effective screening modality. Every screening method has advantages and limitations, which ultimately depend on the quality of the screening test, patient adherence, screening guidelines, and access to timely and appropriate follow-up. Colorectal cancer screening methods should be discussed with patients to identify the method they are most likely to accept and complete.

Study variables

We conducted separate analyses in the BCS-eligible group and a CCS-eligible (CCS) group (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Consort diagram

The criteria for cancer screening were based on the U.S Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines. In 2014, the USPSTF did not recommend routine screening for women aged 40–49, though other organizations continued to support screening for this age group, including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines. The USPSTF later updated their recommendations to support selective BCS screening for women aged 40–49 in 2016.

BCS-eligible women were aged 40–74, and CCS-eligible women were 30–64. BCS completion was defined as receipt of a mammogram within the last 2 years, and CCS completion was defined as receipt of a pap smear within the last 3 years or an HPV test within the last 5 years, or both.

The survivorship care module asks specifically about two components of survivorship care plans: instructions for follow-up care and summary of treatments. BRFSS defines follow-up instructions as instructions from a health professional about where to return and who to see for routine cancer check-ups after completing cancer treatment, and the summary of treatments as a written summary of all cancer treatments provided by a health professional. Additional questions are asked to determine those who received follow-up instructions, and whether this was received in a written format. Receipt of follow-up instructions included both written and unwritten instructions provided by a health professional. Receipt of a formal SCP was defined as patients who specifically received both written follow-up instructions and a written treatment summary. The BRFSS additionally asks the type of doctor providing the majority of the cancer survivors' health care, with choices including "Family Practitioner", "General Practitioner-Internist", "Cancer Surgeon", "Medical Oncologist", "Radiation Oncologist", Gynecologic Oncologist", "Urologist", "Plastic Surgeon", and "Other". These choices were consolidated into three categories: primary care physician (general and family practitioner), specialist (medical, surgical, radiation, or gynecologic oncologist, urologist or plastic surgeon) and other (not further specified in BRFSS). Demographic information regarding age, race and ethnicity, education, having insurance at time of survey and at time of treatment, employment, income, partner status, BMI, and smoking were collected.

FIGURE
Cervical cancer screening recommendations in effect, including major changes in 2009 and 2012, * and percentages of female Title X clients in receipt of cervical cancer screening, † chlamydia testing, § and clinical breast exams, and continued use or adoption of effective contraception among, by year — Family Planning Annual Report, †† 50 states and the District of Columbia, 2005–2015

Abbreviations: ACS = American Cancer Society; ACOG = American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; CBE = clinical breast exam; USPSTF = U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

* During 2005–2012, cervical cancer screening recommendations from ACS, ACOG, and USPSTF for women at average risk with a cervix varied in terms of starting age (within 3 years of first sex or age 21 years), stopping age (65–70 years), and interval (annually, every 2 years, or every 3 years), based on age, prior negative test results, or type of screening test (conventional or liquid cytology or co-testing using a combination of cytology plus human papillomavirus DNA testing [HPV co-test]). During this period, there were two major changes in screening recommendations that are notable. In 2009, ACOG updated its cervical cancer screening recommendation by raising the starting age for screening to 21 years. In 2012, cervical cancer screening recommendations from ACS (March 2012), USPSTF (March 2012), and ACOG (November 2012) were congruent. The recommendations were that screening start at age 21 years, that it occur at the following intervals using specific methods; 21–29 years: every 3 years using cytology alone; 30–65 years: every 3 years (cytology) or every 5 years (HPV co-test); > 65 years: stop screening if there is an adequate negative prior screening history, defined as two (co-test) or three (cytology) consecutive negative results within the past 10 years and the most recent test was performed within 5 years.

### Online screening and virtual patient education for hereditary cancer risk assessment and testing [^112orkrH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hereditary cancer risk assessment is an essential component of comprehensive women's health care delivery, identifying patients at increased genetic risk of breast, gynecologic, and other cancers who may benefit from a change in medical management.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines and others recommend routine hereditary cancer risk assessment to identify candidates for genetic testing. – Although approximately one-quarter of women are at increased risk of an identifiable breast or gynecologic cancer–associated mutation based on age at diagnosis and family history, many remain unidentified. ACOG asserts that obstetrician–gynecologists (ob-gyns) are qualified to counsel patients and to order genetic testing; however, many clinicians express a lack of time, tools, expertise, or confidence in genetic counseling. In addition, patient acceptance of genetic testing is low, with only 15–18% of guideline-eligible women completing testing, which may reflect gaps in patient understanding.

In a recent study, integration of refined, protocol-driven, clinic-specific hereditary cancer risk assessment processes resulted in a fourfold increase in genetic testing among patients in two U.S. community obstetrics and gynecology practices, which enabled detection of pathogenic variants that would not otherwise have been identified and helped clinicians better meet standard of care. The study also highlighted a need to improve patients' genetic literacy.

To address concerns about patient genetic literacy and to further improve genetic testing rates, we aimed to improve the provision of screening and testing to a general U.S. community obstetrics and gynecology practice population. We assessed the association between training each site on the use of an online screening tooland the identification of guideline-eligible patients who should be offered testing and evaluated the utility of virtual patient education for improving patients' understanding and completion of genetic testing.

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116hhKKD]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Other organizations' osteoporosis screening recommendations state that the 2021 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends bone mineral density (BMD) screening with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) beginning at age 65 years in all women and selective DXA screening in women younger than 65 years who have an increased risk of osteoporosis based on a formal clinical risk assessment tool, while the American Academy of Family Physicians follows the USPSTF's 2018 recommendation but specifically recommends against DXA screening in women younger than 65 years and in men younger than 70 years with no risk factors.

### Executive summary of the early-onset breast cancer evidence review conference [^113jWPfx]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Early-onset breast cancer is breast cancer occurring in women aged 18–45 years. From 2012 to 2016, early-onset breast cancer accounted for 10.3% of all new female breast cancer cases. Furthermore, 5.6% of breast cancer deaths in the United States occur in women younger than 45 years. Approximately 15% of breast cancer deaths result from breast cancers initially diagnosed before age 45 years. Because of the young age of onset, women with early-onset breast cancer have special survivorship issues, including contraception, management of menopausal symptoms, fertility conservation, and pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sponsored development of educational material on early-onset breast cancer. The educational material geared towards patients, Bring Your Brave, is available on the CDC website. The CDC awarded the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) a grant to develop accompanying health care provider material, available on line at.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously launched a campaign in collaboration with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to increase patient and clinician awareness of early-onset breast cancer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded the project with ACOG to include educational material for clinicians for early diagnosis and prevention of gynecologic cancers. Uterine cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer. There were 65,620 new cases (3.6% of all new cancer cases) and 12,590 deaths (2.1% of all cancer deaths) projected for 2020. Rates rose on average 1.3% per year from 2007 to 2016. Because of its effect on so many women, uterine cancer was chosen as the first gynecologic cancer for educational material development. To ensure these materials were based on the most current literature and guidelines, an extensive literature review was conducted. This article is the evidence summary, which is presented in detail in the Appendices 2–8, available online at. The health care professional educational material is available online at.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^112SjnVL]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society breast cancer screening guideline (2015) for average-risk women — Women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation), and women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation), and should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). The target population is women at average risk — women without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age.

USPSTF Recommendation: Screening for Cervical Cancer — other society guidance summarized here notes to continue screening for 20 years after the last abnormal test result, even if it extends screening beyond age 65 years. The ACSCP and SGO issued interim guidance in 2015 that recommended primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening starting at age 25 years as an alternative to cytology alone or cotesting. The American Academy of Family Physicians guidelines are in agreement with the USPSTF. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated in 2016 that primary HPV screening in women 25 years or older can be considered as an alternative to current cytology-based screening if performed per ACSCP and SGO interim guidance. A panel on opportunistic infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents issued guidance on screening for and management of HPV in patients living with HIV.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^111FYQwv]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Recommendation 2 — screening continuation in older women states that women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Breast cancer incidence continues to increase until ages 75 to 79 years, and 26% of breast cancer deaths each year are attributable to a diagnosis after age 74 years; none of the RCTs included women 75 years and older, although observational studies have observed a reduction in breast cancer mortality associated with mammographic detection among women aged 75 years and older. The guideline notes that the reduced life expectancy associated with being older decreases the likelihood of screening benefit in some women.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^114wf3dd]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) 2015 breast cancer screening for women at average risk — key age bands and modalities are: Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (Qualified Recommendation). Women should undergo regular screening mammography beginning at age 45 years (Strong Recommendation), and women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (Qualified Recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (Qualified Recommendation). Clinical breast examination is not recommended for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). All women should become familiar with the potential benefits, limitations, and harms associated with breast cancer screening. Average-risk women were defined as those without a personal history of breast cancer, a suspected or confirmed genetic mutation known to increase risk of breast cancer (eg, BRCA), or a history of previous radiotherapy to the chest at a young age. In contrast, ACS, 2003 guidance stated: Begin annual mammography screening at age 40 years; For women in their 20s and 30s, it is recommended that clinical breast examination be part of a periodic health examination, preferably at least every 3 years; Asymptomatic women aged 40 years and older should continue to receive a clinical breast examination as part of a periodic health examination, preferably annually.

### Breast cancer screening for women at average risk: 2015 guideline update from the American cancer society [^111n8qAY]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

American Cancer Society (ACS) average-risk screening — clinical breast examination (CBE): The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination (CBE) for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (Qualified Recommendation). The evidence review found a lack of evidence showing any benefit of a CBE alone or in conjunction with screening mammography, and there is moderate-quality evidence that adding CBE to mammography screening increased the false-positive rate; although the addition of CBE will detect a small number of additional breast cancers (ie, 2%-6%) compared with mammography alone, CBE is not recommended for breast cancer screening among average-risk, asymptomatic women at any age. Recognizing time constraints in a typical clinical visit, clinicians should use this time instead for ascertaining family history and counseling women regarding being alert to breast changes and the potential benefits, limitations, and harms of screening mammography.

### Inclusion of the US preventive services task force recommendation for mammography in state comprehensive cancer control plans in the US [^113EDy6G]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

In the US, comprehensive cancer control (CCC) plans are unique documents that include overall goals, measurable objectives, and evidence-based strategies to address the most common and most intervenable types of cancer in in each US state. These state CCC plans are often developed with multisector stakeholders for 4- to 6-year periods and should be updated on a regular basis. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding requires the inclusion of state cancer screening prevalence rates and specific objectives and strategies for cancer screening in CCC plans, in addition to other statistics that are aimed at improving cancer outcomes and motivating effort.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second-highest cause of cancer death among women in the US. Breast cancer can be detected by mammography at early stages, when fatality is lowest. A program of routine, high-quality screening has been shown to reduce mortality by 25% to 31% for women aged 50 to 69 years, and thus it is an effective intervention for this age-targeted group. Several organizations have evaluated the evidence and have sought consensus in guidelines for the use of mammography by women at average risk for breast cancer; these organizations include the American Cancer Society (2021; annual screening at 45–55 years of age and biennial screening at 55 years or older), the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (2016; biennial screening at 50–75 years of age), and at least 2 medical associations, the American College of Physicians (2019; biennial screening starting at 50 years until 10 years of life expectancy)and the American Academy of Family Physicians (2016; biennial screening at 50–75 years of age). The US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 stipulates required coverage of prevention services that are graded by the USPSTF as an "A" or "B" recommendation. Other federal legislation further ensures that there is no copay associated with mammography for screening among women aged 40 to 49 years.

### Screening for breast cancer in average-risk women: a guidance statement from the American College of Physicians [^112MVT8d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this guidance statement is to provide advice to clinicians on breast cancer screening in average-risk women based on a review of existing guidelines and the evidence they include.

Methods

This guidance statement is derived from an appraisal of selected guidelines from around the world that address breast cancer screening, as well as their included evidence. All national guidelines published in English between 1 January 2013 and 15 November 2017 in the National Guideline Clearinghouse or Guidelines International Network library were included. In addition, the authors selected other guidelines commonly used in clinical practice. Web sites associated with all selected guidelines were checked for updates on 10 December 2018. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to evaluate the quality of guidelines.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is all asymptomatic women with average risk for breast cancer.

Guidance Statement 1

In average-risk women aged 40 to 49 years, clinicians should discuss whether to screen for breast cancer with mammography before age 50 years. Discussion should include the potential benefits and harms and a woman's preferences. The potential harms outweigh the benefits in most women aged 40 to 49 years.

Guidance Statement 2

In average-risk women aged 50 to 74 years, clinicians should offer screening for breast cancer with biennial mammography.

Guidance Statement 3

In average-risk women aged 75 years or older or in women with a life expectancy of 10 years or less, clinicians should discontinue screening for breast cancer.

Guidance Statement 4

In average-risk women of all ages, clinicians should not use clinical breast examination to screen for breast cancer.

### Inclusion of the US preventive services task force recommendation for mammography in state comprehensive cancer control plans in the US [^116fBA1W]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Despite great public interest in detectingbreast cancer early, when it may be more effectively treated, state CCC plans are not uniformly providing complete USPSTF recommendations for mammography examinations for women at average risk. State plans may be improved by (1) emphasizing a single, consistent public health message for the general population (women at average risk, 50–74 years of age, and biennial screening) and (2) explicitly distinguishing women at average risk from various high-risk populations of women who may be screened at younger ages after discussion with their physician. The former will require national organization consensus building. The latter will enable more appropriate, evidence-based use of mammography and other breast cancer prevention tools.

### ACOG now recommends breast cancer screenings start at age 40… [^111AeshD]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Anderer S. ACOG Now Recommends Breast Cancer Screenings Start at Age 40. JAMA. 2024; 332: 1872–1873. doi: 10.1001/jama.2024.23048 All individuals with an average risk of breast cancer should begin screening mammography at 40 years of age, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated in a clinical practice update. Previously, ACOG recommended that clinicians begin offering mammography to anyone of average risk of breast cancer starting at age 40, though screenings weren't specifically advised until age 50. However, new cases of invasive breast cancer among women aged 40 to 49 years increased by an average of 2% a year from 2015 to 2019, which prompted the revised recommendation.

### Cancer screening guidelines… [^116pFV4o]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LOW-RISK PATIENTS CTFPHC recommends screening by mammography every year in women ages 50 to 69. Evidence suggests that such screening is associated with a significant decrease in mortality in this age group. 3 USPSTF recommends mammography every one to two years, with or without clinical breast examination, in women ages 50 to 69.
4. The American College of Radiology supports annual mammography and clinical breast examinations starting at age
40. 5 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends annual clinical breast examinations accompanied by mammography every one to two years in women from 40 to 50 years of age and annually after age 50. 6 The American Medical Association recommends mammograms and clinical breast examinations annually in women 50 years and older and mammography and clinical breast examinations every one to two years in women between 40 and 49 years of age.

7 The American Cancer Society recommends mammography annually after age 40; clinical breast examination is recommended every three years in women between 20 and 39 years of age and annually after age 40. 2 The American Academy of Family Physicians recommends mammography and clinical breast examination every one to two years in women ages 50 to 69.
8. ACS has no official guidelines for oral cancer detection; however, it encourages primary care physicians to perform an examination of the whole mouth as part of a routine cancer-related checkup.
8. SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HIGH-RISK PATIENTS ACS states that women with a high risk of epithelial ovarian cancer, such as those with a very strong family history of the disease, may be screened with transvaginal ultrasound and CEA-125. 8 CTFPHC indicates that evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against ovarian cancer screening in women who have more than one first-degree relative with the disease.
3.

25 A task force organized by the NIH and the National Human Genome Research Institute recommends ovarian cancer screening by means of annual or semiannual transvaginal ultrasound and serum CEA-125 levels beginning at ages 25 to 35 in BRCA 1 mutation carriers. The task force did not issue recommendations for or against elective oophorectomy in these patients.

1. 3 million cases of highly curable basal or squamous cell cancer are diagnosed each year.

### New recommendations for breast cancer screening-in pursuit of health equity… [^114PxDUQ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The US Preventive Services Task Force last released recommendations on breast cancer screening in 2016, when they recommended that most women be screened every 2 years starting at age 50 years. In their 2024 recommendations, 1–3 the USPSTF now recommends initiating screening mammography for all women at age 40 years and screening every 2 years until age 74 years. Similar to the 2016 recommendations, in their updated recommendations, 1–3 the USPSTF concludes that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening mammography in women aged 75 years and older and that evidence is insufficient to assess the role of supplemental screening for women with dense breasts.

Beyond the change in the recommended age to initiate screening, the new recommendations differ from prior recommendations in 2 critical and related ways: a deliberate focus on health equity and greater reliance on evidence from studies other than randomized clinical trials. For example, the USPSTF model identified a breast cancer mortality reduction from mammography of 30% for screening women aged 40 to 74 years, which is substantially higher than reductions from mammography observed in RCTs are modest for both Black women and the general population, particularly for women in their 40s, and the likelihood of false positives and overdiagnosis is high.

1–3 It was this modest ratio of benefits to harms that prompted the USPSTF's previous recommendations for an individualized approach to screening for women in their 40s, based on women's preferences and risk factors. Since the ratio of benefits to harms is more favorable for individuals at higher risk of developing breast cancer, 11, 12 many researchers and clinicians with expertise in breast cancer screening have advocated for risk-stratified screening based on established risk factors, such as family history.
13. Nonetheless, we believe that there is still a role for individualized risk assessment and shared decision-making in breast cancer screening. Given mammography screening's modest benefits, we feel that all women — and particularly those aged 40 to 49 years — should be counseled about the benefits and harms of mammography and supported in deciding whether the balance of benefits to harms fits with their priorities and values.
