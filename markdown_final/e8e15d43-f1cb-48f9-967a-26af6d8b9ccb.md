## Question

Whats the problem when a patient with severe aortic stenosis are hypertensive? How can I treat it?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage hypertension in severe aortic stenosis, including pathophysiology, diagnostic pitfalls, treatment principles, drug choices, monitoring, and special scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hemodynamic conflict between fixed outflow obstruction and systemic vascular resistance. Then, I should verify how hypertension alters the assessment of AS severity and what to do about it. Next, I will review guideline-based treatment principles and reconcile them with observational data. After that, I need to choose agents carefully, starting low and titrating slowly, and outline monitoring. Finally, I will consider special populations, perioperative management, and when to escalate to valve intervention, making sure I double-check any areas where evidence is limited or conflicting [^114RMN2v] [^115K6bqE].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic problem. Sever aortic stenosis imposes a fixed outflow obstruction, so cardiac output becomes pressure dependent across the valve; systemic hypertension increases afterload, which can worsen forward flow, reduce stroke volume, and precipitate hypotension or syncope when vasodilation is excessive, especially in low-flow states or with small, hypertrophied ventricles [^114RMN2v] [^112Vrk9n]. Hold on, I should verify the low-gradient physiology piece: hypertension can create a low-flow, low-gradient severe AS phenotype with preserved EF, where afterload mismatch and reduced arterial compliance obscure true stenosis severity and amplify symptoms like dyspnea and pulmonary hypertension, so I need to keep that in mind when interpreting gradients and valve area [^112GAbq5] [^113YNqbx].

> Next, I should review how hypertension distorts diagnostic assessment. Wait, let me verify the measurement caveat: echocardiographic severity indices recorded during hypertension may underestimate or, less commonly, overestimate stenosis severity; therefore, repeating Doppler or invasive measurements when blood pressure is better controlled helps avoid misclassification, particularly in low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with normal EF where afterload and small LV size confound severity grading [^116TBffK] [^111xZgM5] [^114Rknv8]. I need to ensure I also consider valvuloarterial impedance and systemic arterial compliance when discordance persists, because reduced compliance can independently worsen outcomes in AS even when valve parameters alone look "borderline" [^117EBNZy].

> Now, I will examine the clinical consequences of uncontrolled hypertension in severe AS. I should confirm that hypertension accelerates adverse LV remodeling, increases LV mass, worsens diastolic dysfunction, and is associated with worse prognosis; it also promotes pulmonary hypertension, which is common in severe AS and independently predicts higher perioperative risk and worse survival after AVR, so ignoring BP control is not benign [^114RMN2v] [^113Yo9t3] [^1179ggdC]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while some observational data suggest worse outcomes with very low BP targets, the balance still favors controlled hypertension over uncontrolled, with careful titration to avoid hypotension or syncope [^114RMN2v].

> I need to check guideline-based treatment principles. The 2023 ESH and 2024 ESC hypertension guidelines advise using the same BP thresholds and targets in AS as in the general population, but to titrate more cautiously in high-grade AS, especially with a history of syncope, to avoid excessive BP drops and recurrent syncope; ACC/AHA valvular guidance similarly recommends standard GDMT started low and titrated slowly with close monitoring [^112R9Ehg] [^1164R58L] [^115wcaEW] [^113tBnbV]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "avoid vasodilators", but that is outdated; contemporary guidance supports afterload reduction when applied judiciously, with RAS blockers considered in patients with a history of AS requiring BP lowering, recognizing the evidence base is largely observational [^112XjJ7i] [^112cGtai].

> Let me consider drug selection, and I should double-check areas of controversy. Observational data suggest RAS blockade (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) is associated with improved survival in AS and after TAVI, and ESC 2024 supports considering RAS blockers for BP lowering in patients with a history of AS; however, I must start at low dose and titrate slowly because excessive vasodilation can precipitate hypotension in fixed outflow obstruction [^112MwoQ5] [^114RMN2v] [^112cGtai]. Calcium channel blockers, particularly non-dihydropyridines, may be less favored in some observational analyses due to associations with worse outcomes, though causality is uncertain; if used, I should prefer dihydropyridines and monitor closely for hypotension and edema, especially in small LV cavities [^114RMN2v]. Beta-blockers can be reasonable in patients with concomitant CAD or arrhythmias, but I need to ensure I do not blunt contractility excessively in low-flow states; diuretics can worsen symptoms in small, hypertrophied ventricles and should be used sparingly, if at all, for resistant hypertension after optimizing afterload reduction [^114RMN2v]. But wait, what if the patient has chronic aortic regurgitation rather than stenosis? In that case, afterload-reducing agents are more clearly beneficial, so I should confirm the valve lesion before extrapolating drug choices [^111Fn1My].

> I should confirm practical implementation. Start one agent at a low dose, reassess symptoms, orthostatics, and renal function within 1–2 weeks, and titrate gradually toward a target of roughly 130–139/70–90 mmHg in most adults with severe AS, avoiding SBP below about 120 mmHg or symptoms of dizziness or syncope; in patients with prior syncope or low-flow physiology, I will accept higher interim targets and slow the titration further [^114RMN2v] [^1164R58L]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overgeneralizing: while some observational data suggest 130–139/70–90 mmHg as a "sweet spot", this is not from randomized trials, so I must individualize and prioritize symptom control and perfusion over rigid numeric targets [^114RMN2v].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. Home BP monitoring with frequent clinic follow-up early in titration is prudent, with explicit education to pause therapy and contact us if symptomatic hypotension, syncope, or worsening dyspnea occurs; I will also recheck echocardiography if symptoms evolve or if I suspect progression, because improved BP control can unmask true severe AS in previously low-gradient presentations [^116TBffK] [^111xZgM5]. I need to ensure I reassess for pulmonary hypertension periodically, as its presence modifies risk and may influence the urgency and modality of valve intervention [^116ucY6H].

> Let me think about special populations. In elderly patients with reduced arterial compliance and stiff vasculature, I should anticipate exaggerated BP responses and favor gentle titration, often with RAS blockade as first-line if tolerated; in patients with CKD, I must adjust ACEi/ARB dosing and coordinate with nephrology, recognizing that CKD accelerates AS progression and worsens outcomes after AVR, which argues for timely referral when indicated [^115QSu4J]. In pregnancy, severe AS is high risk; management is multidisciplinary with careful afterload control and avoidance of hypotension, and definitive therapy is individualized based on maternal-fetal risk [^114Tc3w6].

> I will now examine perioperative considerations. For elective noncardiac surgery, if the patient meets criteria for AVR, it is preferable to replace the valve first to reduce perioperative risk; if urgent surgery is required, balloon valvuloplasty can be considered as a bridge, and intraoperative management should avoid both hypotension and excessive hypertension or tachycardia, ideally with invasive monitoring and a heart team plan [^111eeLeB] [^111r99so]. Hold on, I should verify stress testing contraindications: dobutamine stress echocardiography is contraindicated in critical aortic stenosis, so I must not order it in that scenario, and exercise testing should be approached cautiously in symptomatic severe AS [^113tcmdB].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist despite "adequate" BP control? I should confirm true AS severity with repeat echocardiography under normotensive conditions, consider CT calcium scoring if discordant, and evaluate for low-flow physiology or pulmonary hypertension; if severe AS is confirmed and symptoms persist, guideline-directed referral for SAVR or TAVI is indicated, as medical therapy alone does not improve survival in symptomatic severe AS [^112b5Npi] [^114o4wSv]. I should double-check for paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient severe AS with preserved EF, because such patients often benefit from valve replacement even when resting gradients are "only" moderate, once afterload is optimized and true severity is established [^113im1FB].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed the diagnostic and therapeutic loop coherently. Hypertension in severe AS creates a vicious cycle of increased afterload, reduced output, and symptom amplification; careful, guideline-concordant BP lowering can improve symptoms and clarify severity, but must be balanced against hypotension risk, with therapy individualized, started low, titrated slowly, and monitored closely, while maintaining a low threshold to refer for valve replacement when severe symptomatic AS is confirmed or when high-risk features emerge despite optimization [^112R9Ehg] [^112b5Npi] [^114RMN2v].

Hypertension in severe aortic stenosis increases **afterload** and **myocardial oxygen demand**, worsening heart failure symptoms and accelerating disease progression [^114RMN2v]. It also **confounds echocardiographic assessment**, masking true stenosis severity and delaying intervention [^116TBffK]. Management should **start low and go slow** with cautious titration of antihypertensives, prioritizing ACE inhibitors/ARBs and avoiding over-diuresis or rapid BP drops that can cause hypotension or syncope [^1164R58L] [^112XjJ7i]. Target a **systolic BP of 130–139 mmHg** if tolerated, and coordinate care with a Heart Team to optimize timing for valve replacement [^114RMN2v] [^113vsYN7].

---

## Pathophysiological implications of hypertension in severe aortic stenosis

Hypertension **increases afterload**, which augments LV pressure overload, promotes hypertrophy, and elevates myocardial oxygen demand, worsening heart failure symptoms and accelerating disease progression [^114RMN2v]. It also **confounds echocardiographic assessment** by reducing transvalvular flow and gradients, leading to underestimation of stenosis severity and delayed intervention [^116TBffK]. Additionally, hypertension contributes to pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction, further worsening prognosis [^112Vrk9n].

---

## Clinical risks associated with uncontrolled hypertension in severe aortic stenosis

Uncontrolled hypertension in severe aortic stenosis is associated with:

- **Increased cardiovascular events**: Higher risk of heart failure, angina, syncope, and sudden cardiac death [^115K6bqE].

- **Accelerated disease progression**: Faster deterioration of LV function and earlier symptom onset [^114RMN2v].

- **Worsening prognosis**: Higher mortality and morbidity rates compared to normotensive patients [^117EBNZy].

---

## Challenges in managing hypertension in severe aortic stenosis

Managing hypertension in severe aortic stenosis is challenging because of the **risk of hypotension** — aggressive BP lowering can reduce coronary perfusion and precipitate syncope or ischemia — and the **limited evidence base**, with no large RCTs to define optimal BP targets or drug strategies [^1164R58L]. Hemodynamic variability also complicates therapy, as BP fluctuates with afterload, preload, and contractility changes [^112Vrk9n].

---

## Recommended blood pressure targets

Current guidelines recommend cautious BP lowering in severe aortic stenosis, with a **target systolic BP of 130–139 mmHg** if tolerated, balancing symptom control and organ perfusion [^114RMN2v]. Avoid **excessive BP reduction** — rapid or large drops can cause hypotension, syncope, or ischemia — and tailor targets to symptoms, comorbidities, and hemodynamic response [^1164R58L].

---

## Pharmacological management strategies

### First-line antihypertensive agents

- **ACE inhibitors/ARBs**: Preferred for their favorable effect on LV remodeling and survival; start low and titrate slowly [^113tBnbV] [^112MwoQ5].

- **Calcium channel blockers**: Dihydropyridines (e.g. amlodipine) are reasonable alternatives, especially if ACE inhibitors/ARBs are not tolerated [^notfound].

- **Beta-blockers**: Use cautiously; may be beneficial in patients with concomitant coronary artery disease or arrhythmias but can worsen bradycardia or heart block [^114RMN2v].

---

### Agents to use with caution or avoid

Avoid or use with caution **diuretics**, which can cause volume depletion and hypotension; reserve for patients with fluid overload. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g. verapamil, diltiazem) may cause bradycardia or negative inotropy and should be used cautiously. Direct vasodilators (e.g. hydralazine, minoxidil) can precipitate hypotension and are generally avoided.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Frequent monitoring is essential in patients with severe aortic stenosis and hypertension. Track **blood pressure** with regular home or clinic measurements during titration and after changes, and assess **symptoms** at each visit for dizziness, syncope, angina, or worsening heart failure. Reassess **echocardiography** periodically to evaluate disease progression and the need for valve intervention [^117Tk4TF].

---

## Role of multidisciplinary care

A **Heart Team approach** involving cardiology, cardiac surgery, and primary care ensures coordinated care, optimal timing for intervention, and comprehensive risk assessment [^113vsYN7]. Patient education on symptom recognition, medication adherence, and when to seek care is essential to safe management [^111QetAu].

Hypertension in severe aortic stenosis **worsens afterload**, accelerates disease progression, and confounds severity assessment. Management should be **cautious and individualized**, targeting 130–139 mmHg systolic when tolerated, with ACE inhibitors/ARBs as first-line therapy and close monitoring for hypotension or syncope. Coordinated Heart Team care and timely valve intervention are critical to optimizing outcomes [^114RMN2v] [^112XjJ7i] [^113vsYN7].

### Hypertension in aortic stenosis: a focused review and recommendations for clinical practice [^114RMN2v]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

In patients with aortic stenosis, the presence of hypertension negatively affects the hemodynamic severity of the stenosis, and worsens adverse left ventricular remodeling. It accelerates the progression of the stenosis and is associated with worse prognosis. Proper management of hypertension is thus crucial but there are concerns about the safety and efficacy of antihypertensive medications as well as uncertainty about optimal blood pressure (BP) targets and their impact on left ventricular mass regression and survival benefits. In the present review, we discuss these issues based on the evidence available in the current literature. Focus is first directed on the consequences of a persistently elevated BP before and after surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter valve implantation, and the clinical significance of an abnormal BP response during exercise in patients with significant aortic stenosis. Available data on use of antihypertensive drugs are then critically addressed, the conclusion being that calcium channel blockers may be associated with lower survival, and that diuretics may have disadvantages in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and smaller left ventricular cavity dimensions, β-blockers may be well tolerated and a better choice for patients with concomitant coronary artery disease and arrhythmias. Renin — angiotensin system blockers improve survival given either before or after valve intervention. Emphasis is placed on the fact that evidence is not derived from randomized trials but only from observational studies. Finally, we discuss the optimal SBP level to reach in patients with aortic stenosis. Again, randomized trials are not available but observational evidence suggests that values between 130 and 139mmHg systolic and 70–90mmHg diastolic might represent the best option, and lower BP targets should probably be avoided.

Valvular heart disease and hypertension — synopsis emphasizes limited directive evidence and observational associations: There are no recommendations based on sufficiently strong evidence for the management of adults with hypertension and valvular heart disease other than for aortic stenosis or chronic aortic regurgitation. Uncontrolled hypertension among individuals with moderate to severe aortic stenosis and/or aortic regurgitation is associated with worsening symptoms, HF, EF, and death. Data support the use of antihypertensive medications to control BP in adults with aortic stenosis and/or chronic aortic regurgitation and hypertension, and among adults with severe aortic stenosis who have undergone transcatheter aortic valve implantation, the use of ACEi or ARB to achieve BP control is associated with reduced mortality. However, there are no data from RCTs that examined optimal BP targets for adults with hypertension and chronic aortic regurgitation, chronic aortic regurgitation is often accompanied by a wide pulse pressure, and medications that lower heart rate may paradoxically increase SBP. The use of ACEi and ARB in adults with chronic moderate to severe aortic regurgitation and hypertension is associated with reductions in cardiovascular events and lower all-cause mortality.

### Management of patients with severe aortic stenosis in the TAVI-era: how recent recommendations are translated into clinical practice [^113e5ys9]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recent recommendations on the treatment of aortic stenosis (AS) distinguish between patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic severe AS. The 2012 European Society of Cardiology guidelines featured a class-I recommendation for aortic valve replacement (AVR; either surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)) in all patients presenting with symptoms. This was updated in 2017 to include all symptomatic patients with high-gradient AS or low-flow, low-gradient AS, a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and evidence of contractile reserve. A class IIa recommendation remains for those with low-flow, low-gradient AS, a reduced LVEF and no flow reserve, and those with a paradoxical low-flow low-gradient AS. In patients with asymptomatic AS, AVR should be performed in patients with a LVEF < 50% and a pathological exercise test. AVR is also recommended in asymptomatic patients with a peak transvalvular velocity (V max) of > 5.5 m/sand/or severe pulmonary hypertension. Generally, a careful risk–benefit analysis by the heart team is advocated prior to AVR in any asymptomatic individual due to recent evidence of a potential benefit of AVR versus medical therapy in asymptomatic patients. While guidelines recommend best clinical practice according to the available evidence, real-world deviations are known to occur. Furthermore, contemporary data on the real-world management of patients with AS are scarce. Historical data demonstrated that 33%–41% of patients did not undergo SAVR in the past — despite severe symptomatic AS. Recently, the widespread availability of TAVR has opened a less invasive treatment option for higher risk patients and the process of decision-making within the heart team approach has changed in many European centres. It is timely, therefore, to assess the contemporary practice of decision-making in patients with severe AS in centres across Europe in the era of interdisciplinary TAVI treatment. The present analysis aims to explore the characteristics of patients with severe AS with unusual treatment decisions, namely severe symptomatic patients did not undergo AVR and asymptomatic patients assigned to AVR, and to identify potential reasons for it.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Valvular heart disease and hypertension — synopsis indicates limited directive evidence and key associations. There are no recommendations based on sufficiently strong evidence for the management of adults with hypertension and valvular heart disease other than for aortic stenosis or chronic aortic regurgitation. Among adults with severe aortic stenosis who have undergone transcatheter aortic valve implantation, the use of ACEi or ARB to achieve BP control is associated with reduced mortality, and in chronic moderate to severe aortic regurgitation with hypertension, the use of ACEi and ARB is associated with reductions in cardiovascular events and lower all-cause mortality. Chronic aortic regurgitation is often accompanied by a wide pulse pressure, and medications that lower heart rate may paradoxically increase SBP.

Aortic stenosis diagnostic considerations — In adult patients, physical examination may not be accurate for diagnosis of and assessment of severity of AS, and echocardiographic imaging allows reliable evaluation of valve anatomy and motion and the degree of valve obstruction; transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is useful for measuring LV size and systolic function, identifying concurrent AR or MR, and estimating pulmonary systolic pressure. Measurements of AS severity made when the patient is hypertensive may underestimate or, less often, overestimate stenosis severity.

### Aortic stenosis: diagnosis and treatment [^111QetAu]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis affects 3% of persons older than 65 years. Although survival in asymptomatic patients is comparable to that in age- and sex-matched control patients, it decreases rapidly after symptoms appear. During the asymptomatic latent period, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial augmentation of preload compensate for the increase in afterload caused by aortic stenosis. As the disease worsens, these compensatory mechanisms become inadequate, leading to symptoms of heart failure, angina, or syncope. Aortic valve replacement is recommended for most symptomatic patients with evidence of significant aortic stenosis on echocardiography. Watchful waiting is recommended for most asymptomatic patients. However, select patients may also benefit from aortic valve replacement before the onset of symptoms. Surgical valve replacement is the standard of care for patients at low to moderate surgical risk. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement may be considered in patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk. Patients should be educated about the importance of promptly reporting symptoms to their physicians. In asymptomatic patients, serial Doppler echocardiography is recommended every six to 12 months for severe aortic stenosis, every one to two years for moderate disease, and every three to five years for mild disease. Cardiology referral is recommended for all patients with symptomatic moderate and severe aortic stenosis, those with severe aortic stenosis without apparent symptoms, and those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Medical management of concurrent hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease will lead to optimal outcomes.

### Valvular aortic stenosis: disease severity and timing of intervention [^115D2fKw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Standard echocardiographic evaluation of aortic stenosis (AS) severity includes measurement of aortic velocity, mean transaortic pressure gradient, and continuity equation valve area. Although these measures are adequate for decision making in most patients, there is no single value that defines severe stenosis. Aortic stenosis affects not just the valve, but the entire vascular system, including the left ventricle (LV) and systemic vasculature. More sophisticated measures of disease severity might explain the apparent overlap in hemodynamic severity between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients and might better predict the optimal timing of valve replacement. There have been several approaches to evaluation of stenosis severity based on valve hemodynamics, the ventricular response to increased afterload, ventricular-vascular coupling, or the systemic functional consequences of valve obstruction, such as exercise testing and serum brain natriuretic peptide levels. Aortic valve replacement is indicated when symptoms due to severe AS are present. In most asymptomatic patients, the risk of surgery is greater than the risk of watchful waiting so that management includes patient education, periodic echocardiography, and cardiac risk factor modification. Many adults with AS have comorbid conditions that affect both the diagnosis and management of the valve disease, including aortic regurgitation, aortic root dilation, hypertension, coronary artery disease, LV dysfunction, and atrial fibrillation. Comorbid conditions should be evaluated and treated based on established guidelines, although awareness of the potential effects of therapy in the presence of valve obstruction is needed.

Hypertension not only can modify the exploratory findings of aortic stenosis, but may also interfere with the assessment of severity, and even have an impact on patient outcome.

Pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (group 2) — prevalence across cardiac dysfunctions is summarized: Up to 60% of patients with severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and up to 70% of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction may present with PH, and PH can be found in virtually all patients with severe symptomatic mitral valve disease and in up to 65% of those with symptomatic aortic stenosis.

### Current management of calcific aortic stenosis [^112b5Npi]. Circulation Research (2013). Low credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis is a progressive disease with no effective medical therapy that ultimately requires aortic valve replacement (AVR) for severe valve obstruction. Echocardiography is the primary diagnostic approach to define valve anatomy, measure aortic stenosis severity, and evaluate the left ventricular response to chronic pressure overload. In asymptomatic patients, markers of disease progression include the degree of leaflet calcification, hemodynamic severity of stenosis, adverse left ventricular remodeling, reduced left ventricular longitudinal strain, myocardial fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension. The onset of symptoms portends a predictably high mortality rate unless AVR is performed. In symptomatic patients, AVR improves symptoms, improves survival, and, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, improves systolic function. Poor outcomes after AVR are associated with low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis, severe ventricular fibrosis, oxygen-dependent lung disease, frailty, advanced renal dysfunction, and a high comorbidity score. However, in most patients with severe symptoms, AVR is lifesaving. Bioprosthetic valves are recommended for patients aged > 65 years. Transcatheter AVR is now available for patients with severe comorbidities, is recommended in patients who are deemed inoperable, and is a reasonable alternative to surgical AVR in high-risk patients.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in low-flow aortic stenosis: treat the flow or treat the patient? [^113cHCFX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Severity of AS must be viewed as a continuum: from aortic sclerosis to hemodynamically severe valve obstruction. The 2017 focused update on the echocardiographic assessment of AS by the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography 3 provided new insights into the difficult subgroup with low‐gradient AS, and recommended a systematic stepwise approach for accurate AS evaluation.

AS grading can be straightforward when the maximum velocity, mean pressure gradient (MPG), and aortic valve area (AVA) are all concordant. When these parameters are discordant, it is important to integrate these criteria with additional imaging findings plus clinical data to determine the final diagnosis. This is especially important when the MPG suggests only moderate AS and the AVA by continuity equation falls in the severe range (Figure).

### Aortic stenosis: the old disease with new (and evolving) faces [^113im1FB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

"A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence" —

Recent guidelines on the management of valvular heart disease clarified the role of gradient states in stratifying severe aortic stenosis (AS; Figure 1). We are perhaps more familiar with the indications of aortic valve replacement (AVR) in high‐gradient (HG) severe AS. The guidance on low‐gradient (LG) severe AS have added complexity in the diagnosis and management algorithms; but this is necessary to keep pace with evolving knowledge. There are some relevant caveats worth highlighting:
Although not required to define HG severe AS, aortic valve area of ≤ 1.0 cm 2 (indexed aortic valve area 0.6 cm 2 /m 2) remains an important parameter to establish severity in patients with LG AS.
In LG severe AS, AVR is currently recommended in 2 specified groups of patients with symptoms: True severe AS in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; also termed classical low‐flow low‐gradient [LFLG] severe AS). True severe is to be distinguished from pseudosevere AS with further investigations such as dobutamine stress echocardiography or computed tomography calcium score of the aortic valve. Low‐flow state (indexed stroke volume ≤ 35 mL/m 2) in those with preserved LVEF (also termed as paradoxical LFLG severe AS).
Currently, there are no specific recommendations proposed in asymptomatic patients with LG severe AS; and those with normal‐flow low‐gradient (NFLG) severe AS.

Figure 1
Management of severe aortic stenosis stratified by gradient states.

The recommendations for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in high‐gradient severe aortic stenosis (AS) are guided by symptoms and/or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). In the absence of symptoms and preserved LVEF, AVR may be considered in patients with high‐gradient severe AS when there is evidence of other abnormal findings. In low‐gradient states, aortic valvular area remains an important parameter to establish severity. AVR is currently recommended in 2 groups of symptomatic patients with low‐gradient severe AS: true severe in those with reduced LVEF and those with paradoxical low‐flow low‐gradient severe AS. AVA indicates aortic valvular area; EU, European Union; HTN, hypertension; LOE, level of evidence; MPG, mean pressure gradient; NFLG, normal‐flow low‐gradient; PLFLG, paradoxical low‐flow low‐gradient; SVi, indexed stroke volume; and Vm, peak aortic jet velocity.

Background

Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common and most serious valve diseases. The prevalence of AS increases with age, affecting approximately 0.2%, 1.3%, 3.9% and 9.8% of patients aged 50–59 years, 60–69 years, 70–79 years and 80–89 years, respectively. In Europe, it is estimated that there are approximately 4.9 million patients over 75 years with AS and 1.0 million patients with severe AS.

AS is characterised by a narrowing of the aortic valve opening, restricting blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta and potentially affecting pressure in the left atrium and the pulmonary circulation. Eventually, with progression of stenosis severity, patients will develop symptoms of angina (35% of patients), syncope (15% of patients) or dyspnoea and/or heart failure (50% of patients), which without timely surgical intervention, result in an average survival of 2–3 years and are associated with an increased risk of sudden death. Treatment options for patients with severe AS include surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

In 2017, the European Society for Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) published guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease (VHD), which recommend intervention with SAVR or TAVR in patients with severe AS, with the exception of patients with severe comorbidities where intervention is unlikely to improve either their quality of life or their chances of survival. For asymptomatic patients with severe AS, intervention with SAVR is recommended if the patient has left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%, is physically active, or have the presence of risk factors (very severe AS, relevant progression, markedly increased levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or severe pulmonary hypertension attributed to AS) and a low individual surgical risk.

Several studies have reported non-adherence to guidelines in clinical practice and cite discrepancies between treatment decisions and the current scientific recommendations occurring in 23%–42% of patients with AS. Non-adherence to guidelines involved 'overuse' and 'underuse' of interventions for AS, as well as insufficient diagnostics to make an informed treatment decision.

Aortic stenosis — medical therapy recommendations are: In patients at risk of developing AS (Stage A) and in patients with asymptomatic AS (Stages B and C), hypertension should be treated according to standard GDMT, started at a low dose, and gradually titrated upward as needed, with appropriate clinical monitoring. In all patients with calcific AS, statin therapy is indicated for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis on the basis of standard risk scores. In patients who have undergone TAVI, renin-angiotensin system blocker therapy (ACE inhibitor or ARB) may be considered to reduce the long-term risk of all-cause mortality. In patients with calcific AS (Stages B and C), statin therapy is not indicated for prevention of hemodynamic progression of AS.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intraprocedural monitoring and supportive care include invasive access, defibrillation readiness, temperature management, volume status optimization, pulmonary hypertension rescue therapy, and infection prophylaxis. "At least 1 large-volume line is obtained peripherally or centrally". "Immediate access to a defibrillator device is necessary because ventricular fibrillation can occur with manipulation of catheters within the heart or with rapid ventricular pacing", and "Routine steps to prevent significant hypothermia are recommended". Regarding fluids, "Unless otherwise indicated, volume status needs to be supplemented, as patients in this age group are usually volume depleted", but "both volume overload and depletion can be problematic", and multimodal monitoring "can guide tailored therapy". For severe pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular failure, "Inhaled nitric oxide or inhaled epoprostenol should be readily available". "Routine surgical antibiotic prophylaxis administered prior to surgical incision or vascular access is warranted to decrease the risk of wound infection and endocarditis".

Aortic stenosis with pulmonary hypertension — prevalence, indications, and procedural considerations are summarized: PH is highly prevalent in severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) and is associated with increased mortality irrespective of surgery, functional status, or comorbidities, and studies led the ESC to give a class IIa indication for aortic valve replacement (AVR) for patients with asymptomatic AS and an estimated sPAP > 60 mm Hg. The sPAP often improves immediately after surgical AVR (SAVR) or transcatheter AVR (TAVR), but in many patients PH persists and is associated with higher 1-year mortality, and sPAP can also decrease with balloon aortic valvuloplasty though the improvement is not sustained over months. Population data from the German Federal Bureau of Statistics on 107,057 isolated TAVR or SAVR cases between 2007 and 2014 showed that the number of SAVR procedures declined by 50% in AS patients with PH; in PH, SAVR carried the highest operative risk with prolonged time to extubation and the death in-hospital mortality was twice as high compared to PH patients receiving TAVR, which points in favor of TAVR as the elective technique for treating AS patients with severe PH, especially the elderly.

Major cardiovascular comorbidity — coronary angiography is indicated in all patients because coronary artery disease is common in patients undergoing TAVR (40% to 75%); concurrent coronary revascularization may be needed, particularly if multivessel or left main coronary disease is present, although it is unclear if 30-day mortality is influenced by revascularization status; until more definitive randomized data are available, the Heart Valve Team should decide whether to revascularize before TAVR on a case-by-case basis; in a post hoc analysis of the PARTNER 2A trial, revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass graft in addition to TAVR did not increase the risk of death or disabling stroke at 2-year follow-up compared with TAVR or SAVR alone; other conditions that might increase procedural risk or limit benefit include LV systolic or diastolic dysfunction, severe mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis, and severe pulmonary hypertension, and low flow — defined as stroke volume index less than 35 mL/m2 — may also be associated with poor outcomes post-TAVR regardless of EF.

### Aortic stenosis: diagnosis and treatment [^111ni6kv]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Aortic stenosis is the most important cardiac valve disease in developed countries, affecting 3 percent of persons older than 65 years. Although the survival rate in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis is comparable to that in age- and sex-matched control patients, the average overall survival rate in symptomatic persons without aortic valve replacement is two to three years. During the asymptomatic latent period, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrial augmentation of preload compensate for the increase in afterload caused by aortic stenosis. As the disease worsens, these compensatory mechanisms become inadequate, leading to symptoms of heart failure, angina, or syncope. Aortic valve replacement should be recommended in most patients with any of these symptoms accompanied by evidence of significant aortic stenosis on echocardiography. Watchful waiting is recommended for most asymptomatic patients, including those with hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis. Patients should be educated about symptoms and the importance of promptly reporting them to their physicians. Serial Doppler echocardiography is recommended annually for severe aortic stenosis, every one or two years for moderate disease, and every three to five years for mild disease. Cardiology referral is recommended for all patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis, those with severe aortic stenosis without apparent symptoms, and those with left ventricular dysfunction. Many patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis have concurrent cardiac conditions, such as hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery disease, which should also be carefully managed.

### Systemic hypertension in low-gradient severe aortic stenosis with preserved ejection fraction [^112Vrk9n]. Circulation (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Low-gradient severe aortic stenosis with preserved ejection fraction is an increasingly recognized entity, and symptomatic patients may benefit from aortic valve replacement. However, systemic hypertension frequently coexists with low-gradient severe aortic stenosis, which itself may cause elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressures with resultant symptoms of dyspnea.

Methods and Results

Symptomatic patients with hypertension (aortic systolic pressure > 140 mm Hg) and low-gradient (mean gradient < 40 mm Hg) severe aortic stenosis (aortic valve area < 1 cm(2)) with preserved ejection fraction (ejection fraction > 50%) who underwent invasive hemodynamic catheterization of the left and right sides of the heart received infusion of intravenous sodium nitroprusside to reduce blood pressure and arterial afterload. At baseline, patients had severe hypertension (aortic systolic pressure, 176 ± 26 mm Hg), pulmonary hypertension (mean pressure, 39 ± 12 mm Hg), elevated LV end-diastolic pressure (19 ± 5 mm Hg), and reduced stroke volume (33 ± 8 mL/m(2)). All measures of afterload were reduced with nitroprusside (P < 0.001 for all). Nitroprusside reduced mean pulmonary artery pressure (25 ± 10 mm Hg) and LV end-diastolic pressure (11 ± 5 mm Hg; P < 0.001 for both compared with baseline). Aortic valve area (0.86 ± 0.11 to 1.02 ± 0.16 cm(2); P = 0.001) and mean gradient (27 ± 5 to 29 ± 6 mm Hg; P = 0.02) increased with nitroprusside.

Conclusions

Systemic hypertension in low-gradient severe aortic stenosis with preserved ejection fraction is associated with elevated LV filling pressures and pulmonary hypertension. Treatment of hypertension with vasodilator therapy results in a lowering of the total LV afterload, with a decrease in LV filling pressures and pulmonary artery pressures. These findings have important implications for the management of patients with low-gradient severe aortic stenosis with preserved ejection fraction and hypertension.

### Clinical profile and natural history of 453 nonsurgically managed patients with severe aortic stenosis [^114o4wSv]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is a surgically correctable condition. However, aortic valve replacement (AVR) is not offered to many patients with severe AS for various reasons. We investigated the profile and survival patterns of patients with severe AS who did not have AVR.

Methods

Our echocardiographic database was screened for patients with severe AS, defined as a Doppler estimated aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2 or less between 1993 and 2003. Seven hundred and forty patients with severe AS were identified, of whom 453 patients had no AVR through the follow-up period, forming the study cohort. These patients were comprehensively characterized by obtaining clinical, pharmacologic, and surgical data through a comprehensive chart review and extracting survival data from the National Death Index.

Results

Patient characteristics were as follows: age 75 ± 13 years, 48% male, left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction 52 ± 21%, coronary artery disease in 34%, hypertension in 35%, serum creatinine level greater than 2 mg/dL in 11%, and diabetes mellitus in 14%. The survival at 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years was 62%, 32%, and 18%, respectively. The univariate predictors of reduced survival were advanced age, low LV ejection fraction, heart failure, elevated serum creatinine level, severe mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension; and the independent predictors were advanced age, low LV ejection fraction, heart failure, elevated serum creatinine level, and systemic hypertension. Concomitant pharmacotherapy had no impact on survival.

Conclusions

Conservatively treated patients with severe AS have a grave prognosis, and it is worse in the presence of advanced age, LV dysfunction, heart failure, and renal failure.

Chronic aortic regurgitation — medical therapy: In asymptomatic patients with chronic AR (Stages B and C), treatment of hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 140 mm Hg) is recommended, and in patients with severe AR who have symptoms and/or LV systolic dysfunction (Stages C2 and D) but a prohibitive surgical risk, GDMT for reduced LVEF with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and/or sacubitril/valsartan is recommended. There is no evidence that vasodilating drugs reduce severity of AR or alter the disease course in patients with significant AR in the absence of systemic hypertension, and recommendations for GDMT for hypertension and HF apply to patients with chronic asymptomatic AR, as for the general population. In symptomatic patients who are candidates for surgery, medical therapy is not a substitute for AVR; however, medical therapy is helpful for alleviating symptoms in patients who are considered to be at very high surgical risk because of concomitant comorbid medical conditions.

Interestingly, the updated guidelines now also state that SAVR should be considered in asymptomatic patients with normal ejection fraction if the surgical risk is low and one of the following findings is present: (1) very severe aortic stenosis defined by a peak velocity > 5.5 m/s, (2) severe valve calcification and a rate of peak velocity progression ≥ 0.3 m/s/year, (3) markedly elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels (> 3-fold normal range) confirmed by repeated measurements and (4) severe pulmonary hypertension (systolic pulmonary artery pressure at rest > 60 mm Hg) without other explanation. In patients without these predictive factors, watchful waiting appears safe and early surgery is unlikely to be beneficial.

For the time being, there is no evidence available showing a role for TAVR in the treatment of asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis. However, studies are on their way to investigate the potential value of TAVR for this specific patient population.

### Severe pulmonary hypertension in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis: clinical profile and prognostic implications [^113nYwVZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

We analyzed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 47 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (PHT) and severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) from 1987 to 1999.

Background

The prognostic implications of severe pulmonary hypertension in patients with severe AS are poorly understood.

Methods

The mean age of patients was 78 years (range 47 to 91 years), and 37 patients (79%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) was performed in 37 patients (79%) and 10 patients (21%) were treated conservatively.

Results

In the group that had AVR, there were six perioperative deaths (16%) and nine late deaths, resulting in a total mortality of 32%. In the conservatively treated group, there were eight deaths (80%) on follow-up. Severe PHT was an independent predictor of perioperative mortality. However, perioperative mortality was independent of the severity of left ventricular systolic dysfunction or concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. Aortic valve replacement was associated with significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, the severity of PHT and NYHA functional class. The difference between long-term survival of the operative survivors and the expected survival from life tables was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

The prognosis for patients with AS and severe PHT treated conservatively without AVR is dismal. Although AVR is associated with higher than usual mortality, the potential benefits outweigh the risk of surgery.

### Comorbidities and symptom status in moderate and severe aortic stenosis: a multicenter clinical cohort study [^115SXPFZ]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most prevalent form of valvular heart disease, and is clinically silent in its earlier forms. By convention, symptoms are thought to only become apparent when the AS is severe enough to provoke ventricular decompensation. At this critical juncture, surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR), or in suitable patients, transcatheter AVR is recommended. However, recent evidence has shown that less severe forms of AS are also associated with high mortality. This creates a clinical conundrum as to the ideal management strategies for these individuals. Recent clinical trial data has supported consideration of AVR in critical asymptomatic AS, associated with a 2- to 3-fold lower cardiovascular mortality among patients who underwent early surgical intervention than those who received conservative care. The current evidence gap relating to valve intervention in various forms of moderate AS is currently the subject of ongoing clinical trials.

Despite conventional clinical wisdom, the true prevalence of symptoms in moderate AS is poorly understood. A recent publicationsuggested just under half of all patients with moderate AS were symptomatic. This included 17% of patients who were highly symptomatic (NYHA functional class III-IV). However, the results were not corrected for the presence of clinical comorbidities and their treatments. Symptoms observed in the setting of moderate and severe AS may be due to comorbidities typically found in those of similar age and with common risk factors. These include coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, or hypertension and may result in spurious associations with AS. Further, any symptoms due to AS are likely to be associated with the degree of cardiac damage and its independent association with mortality, indicating late stage disease and a strong determinant of outcome after AVR.

Because of the potential importance of symptoms as a risk marker in AS, we studied a clinical cohort being routinely investigated for heart disease, to assess whether the pattern or association of symptoms typically ascribed to AS remained associated after adjusting for their demographic and clinical characteristics.

### Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction phenotype is associated with early symptom onset in aortic stenosis and residual symptoms after transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^116KiYXK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated filling pressures have been associated with reduced exercise capacity and symptoms in patients with aortic stenosis, and may explain why patients with a high H 2 FPEF score developed symptoms at lower resting gradients of aortic stenosis in our study. This is further supported by a recent study including patients with moderate and severe aortic stenosis undergoing cardiopulmonary exercise testing, showing that exercise tolerance was significantly worse in patients with a high H 2 FPEF score across both moderate and severe aortic stenosis and thus irrespective of aortic stenosis severity.

Currently, early detection of symptoms forms a cornerstone of the management of aortic stenosis, and presence of symptoms largely determines whether aortic valve replacement is indicated for severe aortic stenosis. This approach finds its roots in the landmark study by Braunwald and Ross, who showed that onset of symptoms in severe aortic stenosis is associated with a dismal prognosis. At the time, rheumatic heart disease was the leading cause of aortic stenosis, and patients were relatively young with little comorbidity. Nowadays, however, most patients develop calcific aortic stenosis at an older age and often have concomitant cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, or atrial fibrillation, which all contribute to cardiac dysfunction and structural changes. This also makes it challenging to disentangle whether symptoms can be attributed primarily to aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or obesity. We hypothesize that elevated left atrial pressures, and therefore pulmonary pressures, are the main drivers of shortness of breath. Many patients with aortic stenosis eventually develop pulmonary hypertension when aortic stenosis becomes too severe, but we hypothesize that patients with concomitant features of HFpEF reach this point at lower aortic stenosis severity. Hence, it is likely that both aortic stenosis and HFpEF contribute to the onset of symptoms. Thus, our results imply that optimal treatment of concomitant HFpEF, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension may be critical to reduce the risk of symptoms.

Among 2704 (99.4%) patients with a completed clinical follow‐up (median, 5.0 years [interquartile range, 3.4–5.5]), 1156 (42.7%) had mild AS, 1121 (41.5%) moderate AS, and 427 (15.8%) severe AS at inclusion. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. This was an elderly population (mean age at inclusion, 76 ± 10.8 years; < 65 years, 370; 65–80 years, 1288; > 80 years, 1046) with 1257 (46.5%) women, mostly recruited by cardiologists in private practice (63.3%). There was a high prevalence of underlying risk factors and cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, 76.4%; diabetes, 30.3%; previous coronary event, 18.3%; atrial fibrillation, 22.3%) as well as a relatively high prescription of cardiovascular medications (angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist, 65.8%; statin, 55.2%; antiplatelet or anticoagulant, 64.4%).

### A call for an evidence-based approach to the heart team for patients with severe aortic stenosis [^112v7mcx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Application of a Heart Team approach is now a central concept in the care of patients with severe aortic stenosis. It has Class I recommendations from American and European professional societies and is required for reimbursement for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in the United States. The rationale for changing traditional practice models is to improve patient selection, procedural planning, and management of patients at high or prohibitive surgical risk, thus improving outcomes. Although the concept is intuitive, a clear definition of the Heart Team, and data supporting its effectiveness, are lacking. Other specialties, including oncology, provide a precedent for investigation of the use of a multidisciplinary team and its impact on patient care. We highlight the need for clear definitions and shared metrics to advance our understanding of an optimal Heart Team approach, focusing on patient, clinician, and health system outcomes.

### Imaging of low-gradient severe aortic stenosis [^116Hyr7F]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Although most patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) have high peak velocity and mean transvalvular gradient, there is a subset of patients with low-flow, low-gradient severe AS (LGSAS). Assessment and management of such patients can be difficult and dobutamine echocardiography has been recommended to distinguish those with pseudo-AS (low calculated AVA due to insufficient flow to fully open the valve) from those with contractile reserve and true LGSAS, who may have good outcomes with surgery. More recently, a group of patients with LGSAS and preserved LV function have been identified. These patients are often elderly with hypertension, small left ventricular cavities, and concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Because cardiac imaging plays a vital role in hemodynamic classification of patients with suspected LGSAS and determining appropriate management, this review was undertaken to summarize the current state of knowledge of this important but complex condition.

### Management of asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112JRHLx]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis is the valvular heart lesion with the highest clinical impact and mortality worldwide, accounting for half of valve-related deaths. For patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, European and American guidelines indicate that aortic valve replacement is advised as a class IB and class IA recommendation, respectively. However, more ambiguity exists in the management of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, where intervention is not recommended unless signs of adverse prognosis are present. These indicators include rapid progression of the valve stenosis, severe valve calcification, valve parameters reflecting the 'very severe' end of the spectrum of the disease, or signs of left ventricular impairment by echocardiographic data or blood biomarkers, although strong evidence for these is lacking.

However, many would argue that by the time the left ventricular myocardium shows direct or indirect signs of impairment, it is already too late, with irreversible damage establishedand the 'therapeutic window' for intervention missed. Additionally, studies have shown that most patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis exhibit symptoms in the first 2 years following the diagnosis. Many deaths however occur in the period of 'watchful waiting'. These observations have caused much controversy among clinicians and highlight the need for improved risk stratification models and better individualised management strategies according to each patient's risk.

The optimal timing of aortic valve intervention in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis is yet to be ascertained. Undoubtedly, after the results of the Aortic Valve ReplAcemenT versus Conservative Treatment in Asymptomatic SeveRe Aortic Stenosis (AVATAR) trial, many would argue whether the time for a change in clinical practice is fast-approaching. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and observational studies comparing early intervention versus conservative management of patients with asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis to synthesise and evaluate the current evidence.

### The spectrum of low-output low-gradient aortic stenosis with normal ejection fraction [^112GAbq5]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Low-flow, low-gradient (LF/LG) severe aortic stenosis (AS) with preserved ejection fraction refers to the condition of AS with aortic valve area ≤ 1cm(2), stroke volume index < 35mL/m(2), mean aortic valve gradient < 40mmHg and left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%. This mismatch of aortic valve area suggesting severe stenosis and 'low' gradient in some patients has led to confusion as to the severity of stenosis. Conditions previously labelled as LF/LG severe AS include a spectrum, with measurement error probably being the most common cause of marked inconsistency between gradient, valve area and patient presentation. The presence of LG severe AS may be overestimated in petite patients, who may have aortic valve area slightly less than 1cm(2)with only moderate AS. Concomitant cardiac conditions besides AS, including significant mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, intracardiac shunts and constrictive pericarditis, may contribute to reduced stroke volume, and evidence for these must be sought at the time of echocardiography. True LF/LG severe AS is associated with a unique and probably maladaptive remodelling pattern with smaller ventricles, increasing relative wall thickness, progressive worsening of diastolic function and higher afterload, as demonstrated by lower systemic arterial compliance, higher systemic vascular resistance and higher valvuloarterial impedance. Control of hypertension is essential to the appropriate management of patients with AS. Aortic valve replacement should be considered in patients with compelling evidence of severe AS who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment of hypertension.

Aortic stenosis — risk synopsis for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery (NCS). Severe AS, as defined by current valvular heart disease (VHD) and echocardiography guidelines, and including low-flow, low-gradient AS, is associated with increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing NCS; when feasible, perioperative management of patients with severe AS should be conducted in collaboration with a multidisciplinary heart valve team, and perioperative risk is higher in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients, in those with reduced left ventricular (LV) systolic function, in those with more severe AS, concomitant pulmonary hypertension (PH), and in the setting of urgent/emergency versus elective NCS.

### Comorbidities and symptom status in moderate and severe aortic stenosis: a multicenter clinical cohort study [^1171EgAq]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Symptoms associated with severe aortic stenosis (AS) are used to guide management.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to examine the pattern of symptoms, comorbidities, and cardiac damage in moderate and severe AS.

Methods

A total of 846,198 echocardiographic investigations from 330,940 individuals aged > 18 years were selected for the most recent echocardiogram, moderate or severe AS (mean gradient 20.0–39.9 mm Hg, aortic valve peak gradient 3.0–3.9 m/s and aortic valve area > 1.0 cm 2; or40.0 mm Hg, ≥ 4.0 m/s or ≤ 1.0 cm 2, respectively), and a cardiologist consultation. Natural Language Processing was applied to letters to extract comorbidities, dyspnea, chest pain, and syncope. Patients with prior aortic valve replacement were excluded.

Results

2,213 patients (0.7% overall, 32.8% females) had moderate and 3,416 (1.0%, 47.3% females) had severe AS. Comorbidities were common, including hypertension, (56.6% moderate AS, 53.1% severe AS, P = 0.01), coronary disease (46.0% and 46.8%, respectively, P = 0.58) and atrial fibrillation (29.6% and 34.8%, respectively, P < 0.001). Symptoms were also common in both moderate (n = 915, 41.3%) and severe (n = 1,630, 47.7%) AS (P < 0.001). Comorbidities were more likely in symptomatic vs asymptomatic patients (P < 0.001). Dyspnea was more likely in severe AS, whereas angina and syncope were similar in moderate vs severe AS. In multivariable analysis, only dyspnea was associated with severe (vs moderate) AS (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.41–2.13, P < 0.001). In both adjusted and unadjusted models, the degree of cardiac damage did not relate to presence of any symptoms but was associated with AS severity.

Conclusions

Dyspnea is common in both moderate and severe AS, is associated with comorbidities and is not related to the degree of cardiac damage. Symptom-guided management decisions in AS may need revision.

Limitations

The major limitation of the present analysis was the lack of adjustment for confounding factors, including other comorbidities that may have influenced AS presentation and treatment decisions. As such, unequivocal identification of independent associations between the comorbidities of interest and symptoms/management strategies is problematic. Nevertheless, the consistency of the observed trends with published data and clinical logic supports the value of our findings, which form a strong basis for further exploration.

### Effects of intensive blood pressure control on left ventricular hypertrophy in aortic valve disease [^112i8XYP]. American Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension adds to the pressure overload on the left ventricle (LV) in combination with aortic valve (AV) disease, but the optimal blood pressure (BP) targets for patients with AV disease remain unclear. We tried to investigate whether intensive BP control reduces LV hypertrophy in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis (AS) or aortic regurgitation (AR).

Methods

A total of 128 hypertensive patients with mild to moderate AS (n = 93) or AR (n = 35) were randomly assigned to intensive therapy, targeting a systolic BP < 130 mm Hg, or standard therapy, targeting a systolic BP < 140 mm Hg. The primary end point was the change in LV mass from baseline to the 24-month follow-up. Secondary end points included changes in severity of AV disease, LV volumes, ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain (GLS).

Results

The treatment groups were generally well balanced regarding the baseline characteristics. The mean (± SD) age of the patients was 68 ± 8 years and 48% were men. The mean BP was 145 ± 12/81 ± 10 mm Hg at baseline. Medication at baseline was similar between the 2 groups. The 2 treatment strategies resulted in a rapid and sustained difference in systolic BP (P < .05). At 24-month, the mean systolic BP was 129 ± 12 mm Hg in the intensive therapy group and 135 ± 14 mm Hg in the standard therapy group. No patient died or underwent AV surgery during follow-up in either of the groups. LV mass was changed from 189.5 ± 41.3 to 185.6 ± 41.5 g in the intensive therapy group (P = 0.19) and from 183.8 ± 38.3 to 194.0 ± 46.4 g in the standard therapy group (P < .01). The primary end point of change in LV mass was significantly different between the intensive therapy and the standard therapy group (-3.9 ± 20.2 g vs 10.3 ± 20.4 g; p = 0.0007). The increase in LV mass index was also significantly greater in the standard therapy group (P = 0.01). No significant differences in secondary end points (changes in severity of AV disease, LV volumes, ejection fraction and GLS) were observed between the treatment groups.

Conclusions

Among hypertensive patients with AV disease, intensive hypertensive therapy resulted in a significant reduction in LV hypertrophy, although progression of AV disease was similar between the treatment groups.

Management of the asymptomatic patient with VHD undergoing noncardiac surgery — In asymptomatic patients with moderate or greater degrees of aortic stenosis (AS) and normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function, it is reasonable to perform elective noncardiac surgery. In asymptomatic patients with moderate or greater degrees of rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) with less than severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure < 50 mm Hg), it is reasonable to perform elective noncardiac surgery. In asymptomatic patients with moderate or greater degrees of mitral regurgitation (MR) and normal LV systolic function with less than severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure < 50 mm Hg), it is reasonable to perform elective noncardiac surgery. In asymptomatic patients with moderate or greater degrees of aortic regurgitation (AR) and normal LV systolic function, it is reasonable to perform elective noncardiac surgery.

### Counting the cost of premature mortality with progressively worse aortic stenosis in Australia: a clinical cohort study [^115MoRmm]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

As individuals living in high-income countries increasingly benefit from preventive heart health measures to prolong their life, they become more likely to develop age-related heart conditions. Paradoxically, having avoided early and often fatal forms of heart disease, these individuals might still be at risk of dying prematurely. One such condition affecting the aortic valve is aortic stenosis, which is the most common form of valvular heart disease treated in clinical practice and is a major cause of death among those aged 75 years or older. In the context of a high prevalence of cardiac risk factors (including hypertension and metabolic disease), data suggest that around 1·5% of people aged 55 years or older (with a steep age-gradient in rising prevalence) in high-income countries are already living with severe aortic stenosis.

Traditionally, surgical aortic valve replacement is reserved for patients with severe symptoms. The development of less invasive, transcatheter techniques for aortic valve replacement has altered the benefit-to-risk ratio of aortic stenosis management and assessment of treatment safety and efficacy is ongoing in patients with less severe symptoms. Regardless of treatment modality, the increasingly prevalent condition of aortic stenosis poses an enormous challenge to already limited health-care resources. Crucially, there is increasing evidence showing that less severe forms of aortic stenosis are associated with premature mortality, whether by causation or correlation. However, there remains minimal evidence of the societal cost of progressive aortic valve disease.

Therefore, in this study, we firstly aimed to identify the sex-specific distribution of progressive aortic stenosis among older individuals being routinely investigated for heart disease. We then determined the association of progressive aortic stenosis with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost due to premature mortality, compared with individuals presenting with normal aortic valve function.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^1141SK6X]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

ESC Guidelines — syncope secondary to structural cardiac or cardiovascular disease — In patients with syncope secondary to structural cardiac disease, the goal of treatment is not only to prevent syncopal recurrence, but also to treat the underlying disease and to decrease the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and the mere presence of heart disease does not imply that syncope is related to the underlying cardiac disorder. In patients with syncope secondary to severe aortic stenosis or to atrial myxoma, surgical treatment of the underlying disease is indicated, whereas in patients with syncope secondary to acute cardiovascular disease, such as pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, or pericardial tamponade, treatment should be directed to the underlying process. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (with or without left ventricle outflow tract obstruction), specific treatment of the arrhythmia is usually warranted; in most of these patients, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) should be implanted to prevent SCD, and there are no data on the effect of reducing the outflow gradient on relief of syncope. In syncope associated with myocardial ischaemia, pharmacological therapy and/or revascularization is clearly the appropriate strategy in most cases, but when syncope is caused by primary pulmonary hypertension or restrictive cardiomyopathy, it is often impossible adequately to ameliorate the underlying problem; other less common causes include left ventricular inflow tract obstruction in patients with mitral stenosis, right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and right to left shunting secondary to pulmonary stenosis or pulmonary hypertension.

Coexistence of Severe CAD With Severe Aortic Stenosis: Treatment Options in the New Era

CAD is the most common comorbidity influencing outcomes after aortic valve replacement. 62, 63, 64, 65 In fact, in patients who are found to have severe aortic stenosis (AS), CAD is often found incidentally with underappreciated survival implications. Compared with patients who have AS alone, those who have concomitant CAD are more likely to be symptomatic, to be hypertensive, and to have a lower ejection fraction and greater atherosclerotic burden. In both groups, patients who were elderly and more symptomatic tended to have worse outcomes. These findings suggest that elderly patients with AS and risk factors for CAD should be investigated for atherosclerosis before evaluation for an aortic valve replacement. The current guidelines recommend bypassing significant stenoses at the time of surgical aortic valve replacement. 66 Those with advanced comorbidities and/or frailty may be better served with medical management alone. 67 The option that is now becoming more common for treating severe AS is TAVR. When evaluating elderly patients with CAD for TAVR, the following should come under consideration: hemodynamic changes during TAVR in the presence of unrevascularized significant CAD specifically during rapid ventricular pacing and balloon inflation during TAVR, degree of need for revascularization on the basis of the level of CAD and evidence of ischemia if available, the feasible option(s) for revascularization (PCI or surgical), the safety of performing PCI in patients with severe AS, the timing of PCI in regard to TAVR, and the type of stent and antiplatelet regimen. 66

### Moderate aortic stenosis: culprit or bystander? [^115mzAND]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Contemporary management

The 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with valvular heart disease and the 2017 ESC/EACTS guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease both recommend consideration for valvular replacement for moderate AS in patients who are already undergoing open heart surgery (class IIa, level of evidence C for both guidelines). The major rationale for this recommendation is the elevated perioperative risk and potential for damage to bypass grafts (if present) during repeat sternotomy should the moderate AS progress and require operative intervention in the future. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend screening patients with moderate AS with echocardiography every 1–2 years to assess for progression versus the ESC/EACTS guidelines which recommend yearly screening. Currently, guidelines do not recommend stratification of individuals at risk of rapid progression.

Cardiovascular disease contributes to approximately one third of all maternal mortality and remains a significant source of peri‑ and postpartum morbidity. As more women at risk for and with cardiovascular disease are desiring pregnancy, it is imperative that general cardiologists and obstetricians participate collaboratively in preconception counseling and are more facile with management of these lesions during peri‑ and postpartum periods. This review aims to address this growing need and highlights the management strategies for some of the major high risk cardiac conditions encountered during pregnancy including anticoagulation, cardiomyopathies as well as severe mitral and aortic stenosis; aortopathy, pulmonary hypertension, and severe congenital heart lesions will not be addressed.

### Early intervention vs conservative management in severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis: a critical review of randomized evidence [^114LGnNi]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a progressive disease that may remain asymptomatic despite underlying myocardial damage. Management of asymptomatic severe AS remains controversial, especially in the current era of safer surgical and transcatheter valve replacement. This critical review examines 4 randomized controlled trials-AVATAR (Aortic Valve Replacement Vs Conservative Treatment in Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis), RECOVERY (Randomized Comparison of Early Surgery vs Conventional Treatment in Very Severe Aortic Stenosis), EARLY TAVR (Evaluation of TAVR Compared to Surveillance for Patients with Asymptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis), and EVOLVED (Early Valve Replacement Guided by Biomarkers of Left Ventricular Decompensation in Asymptomatic Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis)-comparing early aortic valve replacement with conservative management. While early intervention reduces composite endpoints involving heart failure hospitalization, individual trials have not demonstrated consistent mortality or stroke benefits. Importantly, sudden cardiac death was rare across all trials, and close surveillance appeared to be a key determinant of outcomes in the conservative arms. Differences in surveillance intensity, trial populations, and valve types limit pooled interpretations. Current evidence supports a tailored approach: conservative management is reasonable when reliable follow-up can be ensured, while early aortic valve replacement may benefit selected patients. Ongoing trials will help clarify long-term outcomes, optimal timing, and risk stratification strategies in asymptomatic AS.

### Comorbidities and symptom status in moderate and severe aortic stenosis: a multicenter clinical cohort study [^113PKxPP]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The long-held notion since Ross and Braunwald's publication in 1968that symptom onset in AS is discrete, easily identifiable and inexorably linked to AS severity must now be questioned for 3 reasons: 1) while dyspnea is more common in severe AS than moderate AS, it is common in moderate AS and the hemodynamic severity of AS does not accurately predict dyspnea; 2) that chest pain and syncope were strongly associated with coronary disease and pacemaker requirement, respectively, but not related to AS severity; and 3) the degree of valve obstruction is not the only pathophysiological mechanism involved in most patients, considering that ventricular fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension are strong predictors of symptom development which in turn may be due to aortic stenosis and/or the interaction of multiple comorbidities. Although outcomes following AVR relate to the degree of cardiac damage at baseline, it remains unproven whether earlier AVR in symptomatic individuals with moderate AS would improve symptomatic status, heart failure progression or mortality. What is clear, however, is that traditional management decisions in AS based on a simple dichotomous threshold may be overly simplistic, and may lead to under-treatment of patients with a poor prognosis.

Study Limitations

Symptoms were extracted from cardiologist's clinical letters and based on clinical history taking rather than objective stress testing and observation of the degree of exercise impairment. However, reliability of cardiac symptoms extracted during a medical interview have been previously validatedand are recommended in current guidelines to guide treatment decisions. In addition, we did not use stress testing in symptomatic patients since current guidelines recommendations include stress testing only in the absence of reported symptoms.

The echocardiograms used in this study were undertaken for clinical indications for known or suspected cardiac disease and reported by cardiologists with expertise in echocardiography. No core laboratory was used, or retrospective image review undertaken. However, similar methodology has been utilized by our group and others with robust mortality outcomes. Individuals with AS that have not yet undergone echocardiography will not have been captured in this study, and therefore our results should not be taken to reflect the population prevalence of moderate and severe AS.

It is possible some patients may have had additional heart diseases not yet identified by the treating cardiologist. For example transthyretin amyloid (aTTR) may be found in 12% of patients with severe AS. This could have impacted the prevalence of dyspnea identified. It is important to note however, that every patient in this report has been reviewed by a board-certified cardiologist with expertise in clinical cardiology.

### Impact of pulmonary hypertension on outcomes after aortic valve replacement for aortic valve stenosis [^1179ggdC]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The presence of pulmonary hypertension historically has been considered a significant risk factor affecting early and late outcomes after valve replacement. Given the number of recent advances in the management of pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery, a better understanding of its impact on outcomes may assist in the clinical management of these patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether pulmonary hypertension remains a risk factor in the modern era for adverse outcomes after aortic valve replacement for aortic valve stenosis.

Methods

From January 1996 to June 2009, a total of 1080 patients underwent aortic valve replacement for primary aortic valve stenosis, of whom 574 (53%) had normal systolic pulmonary artery pressures (sPAP) and 506 (47%) had pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension was defined as mild (sPAP 35–44 mm Hg), moderate (45–59 mm Hg), or severe (≥ 60 mm Hg). In the group of patients with pulmonary hypertension, 204 had postoperative echocardiograms.

Results

Operative mortality was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary hypertension (47/506, 9%, vs 31/574, 5%, P = 0.02). The incidence of postoperative stroke was similar (P = 0.14), but patients with pulmonary hypertension had an increased median hospital length of stay (8 vs 7 days, P = 0.001) and an increased incidence of prolonged ventilation (26% vs 17%, P < .001). Preoperative pulmonary hypertension was an independent risk factor for decreased long-term survival (relative risk 1.7, P = 0.02). Those with persistent pulmonary hypertension postoperatively had decreased survival. Five-year survival (Kaplan-Meier) was 78% ± 6% with normal sPAP and 77% ± 7% with mild pulmonary hypertension postoperatively, compared with 64% ± 8% with moderate and 45% ± 12% with severe pulmonary hypertension (P < .001).

Conclusions

In patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, preoperative pulmonary hypertension increased operative mortality and decreased long-term survival. Patients with persistent moderate or severe pulmonary hypertension after aortic valve replacement had decreased long-term survival. These data suggest that pulmonary hypertension had a significant impact on outcomes in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement and should be considered in preoperative risk assessment.

### Prognostic markers and valve therapy: to pause or not to pause [^116FBbnv]. JACC: CardioOncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Due to ongoing improvements in oncology care, the number of adult patients with cancer survivorship continues to grow significantly. Importantly, in comparison to patients without cancer, those with an oncologic history are excessively vulnerable to age-related cardiovascular disease, owing to the pathophysiological effects of the malignancy (e.g. inflammation), its treatment (e.g. radiation, chemotherapy), and accompanying morbidity (e.g. hypertension). For patients with valvular heart disease, ∼20% have a current or prior cancer, which may be overt or discovered incidentally during clinical evaluation, such as cardiac computed tomography imaging for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Indeed, the common overlap of oncological issues and valvular heart disease poses a frequent vexing clinical challenge, especially when decision-making for therapeutic intervention is required.

For patients with aortic stenosis who may be TAVR candidates, prognostication is elementary to decision-making for therapy. Certainly, when there are not procedure impediments, the clinical benefit is greatest when longevity is seemingly unthreatened by morbidity, save for the presence of severe aortic stenosis. A history of cancer or any life-threatening illness (e.g. severe lung, kidney, or liver disease), is a common reason for pause in the therapeutic path. Excessive frailty, cognitive impairment, and limited mobility also are examples of cautionary conditions. Concerted efforts have been made to streamline the clinical algorithms for prognostication, with an increasing focus on simplified, bedside approaches that meaningfully impact the management of patients with aortic stenosis. One example of such an approach is the essential frailty toolkit (i.e. appropriate drawing of a clock, the number of chair rises that can be completed, hemoglobin, and albumin), whose prognostic capability has been validated in a cohort of 1,020 patients undergoing TAVR or surgery.

Shared decision-making and Heart Valve Team — the management of patients with severe AS considered for TAVR is 'best achieved by a multidisciplinary, collaborative Heart Valve Team' including cardiologists with expertise in valvular heart disease, structural interventional cardiologists, imaging specialists, cardiovascular surgeons, cardiovascular anesthesiologists, and cardiovascular nursing professionals. Patient management 'relies on a shared decision-making approach' integrating patient preferences and values; specific tasks are to review the patient's condition and valve severity, determine which interventions are indicated, technically feasible, and reasonable, and discuss benefits and risks with the patient and family. The Heart Valve Team 'should emphasize that the purpose of valvular intervention is to improve symptoms and/or prolong survival, while minimizing adverse outcomes associated with the intervention'. Initial assessment includes evaluation of AS symptoms, disease severity and comorbidities, and 'Echocardiographic measures of AS severity should be reviewed, disease severity confirmed, and additional imaging performed as indicated'.

Persistent symptoms after valve intervention — Persistent symptoms occur in many patients after valve intervention, and the first step in evaluation is to assess valve function to ensure symptoms are not caused by persistent or recurrent stenosis, regurgitation, or a valve complication. The next step is to evaluate and treat any concurrent cardiac disease and noncardiac conditions that may be the cause of symptoms, and symptoms also may be attributable to irreversible consequences of valve disease, including LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and RV dysfunction. Treatment of symptoms for these patients is based on GDMT for HF and/or pulmonary hypertension.

### Treating symptomatic aortic stenosis with transcatheter aortic valve replacement: is there time to wait? [^116ZZKdo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The authors also call for better ways to identify patients who may deteriorate and require unplanned hospitalization and urgent TAVR. Risk scores accounting for various patient characteristics are needed to identify patients at high risk of requiring an urgent TAVR. Implementation of such prediction models would help TAVR centers triage such patients and "fast track" their care while patients are still clinically stable and medically optimized. Comorbidities such as prior heart failure and advanced renal failure, for example, may be useful predictors. Other variables not measured in data from this study, such as symptom severity, severity of aortic stenosis, left ventricular ejection fraction, and New York Heart Association classification, may also prove to be useful predictors. Further investigation is needed to determine which characteristics may be most useful for risk prediction when initially evaluating TAVR candidates.

An additional factor to consider is the timing of initial TAVR referral. This is typically dependent on primary care providers or general cardiologists, who should be aware of current indications for valve replacement and refer to proceduralists at the appropriate time. It has long been recognized that patients with severe aortic stenosis should undergo valve replacement once symptoms develop. However, up to 50% of patients with severe aortic stenosis may be inaccurately perceived as being asymptomatic at time of diagnosis. Low‐intensity exercise stress testing may unmask symptoms in some sedentary patients. Development of symptoms, decreased exercise tolerance, or a fall in blood pressure while exercising are all indications to consider valve replacement. 17 Certain groups of asymptomatic patients warrant consideration for valve replacement because of high risk of disease progression and adverse outcomes. These include patients with severe aortic stenosis and left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 50%, extremely severe stenosis (peak transvalvular velocity ≥ 5.0 m/s or mean gradient ≥ 60 mm Hg), peak transvalvular velocity progression ≥ 0.3 m/s per year, markedly elevated natriuretic peptide on repeated testing, and excessive left ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of hypertension. 18

In summary, Wijeysundera and colleagues should be commended for tackling this intriguing clinical question in patients waiting for a TAVR procedure. Although the impact of wait time on postprocedure outcomes seems to be driven primarily by clinical status based on these data, big questions remain. As healthcare workers, it is clear that we need to continue researching and developing tools and systems that will optimize outcomes in the pre‐TAVR population.

### Management strategies and future challenges for aortic valve disease [^115qBjv9]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

The management of aortic valve disease has been improved by accurate diagnosis and assessment of severity by echocardiography and advanced imaging techniques, efforts to elicit symptoms or objective markers of disease severity and progression, and consideration of optimum timing of aortic valve replacement, even in elderly patients. Prevalence of calcific aortic stenosis is growing in ageing populations. Conventional surgery remains the most appropriate option for most patients who require aortic valve replacement, but the transcatheter approach is established for high-risk patients or poor candidates for surgery. The rapid growth of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been fuelled by improved technology, evidence-based clinical research, and setting up of multidisciplinary heart teams. Aortic regurgitation can be difficult to diagnose and quantify. Left ventricular dysfunction often precedes symptoms, needing active surveillance by echocardiography to determine the optimum time for aortic valve replacement. Development of transcatheter approaches for aortic regurgitation is challenging, owing to the absence of valvular calcification and distortion of aortic root anatomy in many patients.

### Patients with severe aortic stenosis and coexisting pulmonary hypertension treated by transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement-is there a need for increased attention? [^116VS9GL]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Aim of this study is to elucidate the impact of pulmonary hypertension on patients treated with a transapical aortic valve replacement.

Background

In patients with aortic stenosis (AS) the coexistence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with increased peri-operative risk for surgical aortic valve replacement. For transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), it is unknown whether transapical TAVR (TA-TAVR) is associated with increased peri-interventional risk in PH patients.

Methods

We performed a single center analysis in 189 patients with severe AS with (AS+PH) or without PH (AS-PH) undergoing TA-TAVR. PH was defined by mean pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 25mmHg assessed by right heart catheterization (exclusion of 64 patients due to missing results). As the primary endpoint a combination of 30-day mortality or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was analyzed.

Results

Seventy three patients (58.4%) had PH. Increased peri-interventional risk in AS+ PH patients was reflected by an increased rate of the primary endpoint in comparison to AS-PH patients (24.7 vs. 3.8%; p = .002). A higher proportion of acute kidney injury (34.2 vs. 15.7%; p = .025) was found in AS+PH patients while AS-PH patients showed a higher rate of bleeding in comparison AS+PH patients (18.5 vs. 6.8% p = .050).

Conclusion

Patients with AS+PH treated by TA-TAVR are at increased peri-interventional risk for severe complications in comparison to AS-PH patients. Therefore, the identification of preventive therapeutic strategies is needed.

### Aortic valve replacement improves survival in severe aortic stenosis associated with severe pulmonary hypertension [^1177GJ9R]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) carries a poor prognosis. There are limited data on the effect of aortic valve replacement (AVR) in these patients.

Methods

Our echocardiographic database between 1993 and 2003 was searched for patients with severe AS defined as a Doppler estimated aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2 or less and severe pulmonary hypertension defined as a pulmonary arterial systolic pressure 60 mm Hg or greater. Of the 740 patients with severe AS, 119 (16%) had severe pulmonary hypertension forming the study cohort. The AVR was performed in 36 (30%) of these patients. Survival of patients with and without AVR were compared and adjusted for comorbidities and group differences using the Cox regression model.

Results

Characteristics of patients with severe pulmonary hypertension; age 75 ± 13 years, 39% women, left ventricular ejection fraction 41 ± 20%. Patients who underwent AVR had a significantly higher five-year survival of 65% compared with 20% for those treated medically (p < 0.0001). The relative mortality risk associated with AVR was 0.28 (95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.36) and was independent of age, gender, ejection fraction, diabetes, coronary disease, serum creatinine level, and concomitant medical therapy such as beta blockers, angiotensin converting inhibitors, and statins. The benefit of AVR was further supported by sensitivity and propensity score analyses. Patients on conservative therapy had a 30-day mortality of 30% and a one-year mortality of 70%.

Conclusions

Aortic valve replacement in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension secondary to severe AS is associated with a huge survival benefit. Medical therapy alone carries a dismal prognosis and AVR should be considered urgently in severe AS patients with severe pulmonary hypertension.

### Antihypertensive treatment with β-blockade in patients with asymptomatic aortic stenosis and association with cardiovascular events [^1123N4b7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis (AS) represents a condition of left ventricular (LV) pressure overload resulting in neuroendocrine activation, including a heightened β‐adrenergic state, reduced myocyte protein synthesis, and extracellular matrix degradation comparable to heart failure. 1 This cardiovascular‐valvular coupling is important because there is little evidence of the ability of cardiotropic drugs to improve outcomes in patients with AS. 2 Moreover, hypertension is a frequent finding in patients with AS, and we have recently shown the importance of lowering blood pressure on reducing adverse cardiovascular outcome in patients with asymptomatic AS. 3 Nevertheless, the current guidelines do not specify whether antihypertensive treatment should differ from that used in patients without AS.

β‐Blockers (Bbls) are interesting in this regard, as they might reduce oxygen consumption and lower blood pressure to improve survival in AS patients. 4 However, Bbls may also pose a danger of reduced inotropy in AS, and evidence for the safety and efficacy of Bbl use in AS is scarce. This study was therefore undertaken to investigate the association of Bbls with risk of cardiovascular and all‐cause mortality as well as of sudden cardiac death during long‐term follow‐up in the SEAS (Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis) study, which is, to date, the largest cohort of patients with asymptomatic mild to moderate AS.

Results

Population

A total of 6746 patients were analyzed in this study, with 1707 (25%) managed by a PCP and 5039 (75%) managed by a cardiac specialist (Figure 1). About half (51%) of cardiologist‐managed patients also saw a PCP in the year before sAS detection by echocardiography. Key characteristics of the total study population included a median age of 78.0 (interquartile range 70–85) years, 3590 (53%) male, 6412 (95%) White, and 3566 (53%) of Midwest geography (Table 1). Of the total study population, 5165 (77%) were considered to have symptomatic sAS, with 1236 (24%) of this subpopulation managed by a PCP and 3929 (76%) managed by a cardiac specialist (Table 1). Differences were observed between PCP‐managed and cardiac‐specialist managed patients for several Elixhauser comorbidities (Table 2). Of 19 comorbidities for which a statistically significant difference was observed, 4 comorbidities (ie, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure [heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction], peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary circulation disorders [pulmonary vessel disease, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale]) were more prevalent among cardiac specialist‐managed patients (Table 2).

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic Disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112eXi7Q]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Acute aortic syndrome (AAS) — initial medical management is achieved with anti-impulse therapy using a combination of intravenous beta blockers and vasodilators to reduce both heart rate and blood pressure (BP) to decrease aortic wall stress, with small studies emphasizing reduction of heart rate to 60 to 80 bpm and systolic BP (SBP) to < 120 mm Hg. Intravenous beta blockers have been the mainstay of acute medical treatment, with reports emphasizing the importance of continuing this therapy at the time of hospital discharge to improve clinical outcomes; caution should be used in patients with contraindications to beta blockers (eg, acute AR, heart block, or bradycardia), and for intolerance to beta blockers, intravenous non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ie, verapamil or diltiazem) are typically used for initial treatment. Intravenous vasodilators are useful adjunctive therapy for intravenous beta blockers but should be avoided as initial treatment (before starting beta blockers or calcium channel blockers), given the potential for compensatory tachycardia. Pain related to AAS can trigger a rise in heart rate and BP, so treating pain can help control the patient's BP and heart rate; intravenous opiates are particularly efficacious, whereas intravenous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ketorolac may not be suitable because of the risk of inducing hypertension as well as adverse renal effects.

### The 'wait for symptoms' strategy in asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis [^112f4sun]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Calcific aortic stenosis is a prevalent and worrisome healthcare problem. The therapeutic approach in asymptomatic aortic stenosis is not well established. We argue that the natural history of this disease is based on old incomplete studies with many limitations. Likewise, studies suggesting that replacement, either surgical or percutaneous, improves prognosis in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis have important drawbacks and do not support this strategy as the treatment of choice. Despite the lack of evidence, some groups recommend early valve replacement in patients with severe asymptomatic aortic stenosis. There are five ongoing randomised trials which will shed light on this topic. Our conclusion is that unless a randomised study changes the evidence, valve replacement cannot be recommended in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis.

### Aortic stenosis [^115Epmo6]. Lancet (2009). Excellent credibility.

In developed countries, aortic stenosis is the most prevalent of all valvular heart diseases. A manifestation of ageing, the disorder is becoming more frequent as the average age of the population increases. Symptomatic severe disease is universally fatal if left untreated yet is consistent with a typical lifespan when mechanical relief of the stenosis is provided in a timely fashion. Management of mild disease, severe asymptomatic disease, and far advanced disease, and the effect of new percutaneous treatments, provide both controversy and exciting promise to care of patients with aortic stenosis. We discuss these issues in this Review.

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111EDqBx]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) — intervention for acute severe AR from infective endocarditis or aortic dissection may include temporary afterload reduction, but surgery should not be delayed, especially with hypotension, pulmonary edema, or low flow. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation is contraindicated in acute severe AR. Beta blockers, though often used for aortic dissection, should be used very cautiously, if at all, for other causes of acute AR because they can block compensatory tachycardia and precipitate a marked reduction in blood pressure.

### Impact of selected comorbidities on the presentation and management of aortic stenosis [^115171AM]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent native valve disease worldwide, affecting approximately 3.4% of elderly individuals in Europe and the United States. Patients with severe AS who do not undergo timely aortic valve replacement (AVR) face an extremely poor prognosis; this is particularly true following symptom onset, at which point average survival is just 2–3 years. Consequently, rapid, effective management is paramount.

Current European guidelines recommend that AVR be performed in patients with AS that are symptomatic, experience symptoms/hypotension during exercise testing, and/or that have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50%. However, despite the ever-growing availability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as a minimally invasive alternative to surgical AVR (SAVR), studies suggest that up to 40% of patients with severe AS still do not receive either of these life-saving interventions. The reason for this appears to be multifactorial, though a high comorbidity burden has been suggested as a key driver. Furthermore, certain comorbidities may have clinical presentations resembling those of AS. To the best of our knowledge, no formal investigations into such effects have been carried out to date.

The aim of this analysis therefore was to assess the impact of comorbidities on disease presentation and management decisions in patients with severe AS.

### Prevalence and outcomes of low-gradient severe aortic stenosis-from the national echo database of Australia [^113YNqbx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The other LFLG group, paradoxical LFLG, is composed of patients with severe AS with reduced flow states attributed to restrictive LV pathophysiology and/or small ventricular volumes; these are often compared with patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Paradoxical LFLG in our cohort was associated with similar medium‐term (0–3 years) but worse long‐term mortality than high‐gradient severe AS (59% versus 49% at 5 years). We note that a higher proportion of deaths in this group with paradoxical LFLG AS were non‐cardiovascular related compared with the other AS groups studied, consistent with a higher prevalence of significant comorbidities in this patient group.

The management of patients with NFLG severe AS can also be challenging. Although current guidelinesgenerally regard such patients as having only moderate AS, it has been argued that up to 50% have severe stenosis with evidence backing the case for early intervention. It is likely that systemic hypertension and/or reduced aortic compliance may account for this observed discordant valve area–gradient relationship in some patients. It is important to emphasize that the accepted AVA cutoff for severe stenosis of 1 cm 2 corresponds in many patients to a mean gradient of 30 to 35 mm Hgand that this AVA threshold has been independently associated with a survival benefit following AVR. Outcomes for patients with NFLG severe AS at 1 year were significantly better than those of patients with high‐gradient severe AS; however, at 2.5 years, both groups had similar mortality rates (~30%) with statistically similar adjusted 5‐year survival rates. These data support a clinical approach to patients with NFLG AS that is more akin to that for patients with high‐gradient AS and is consistent with our recent publication about the gradient "threshold" mortality effect for AS being lower than that previously considered.

### Clinical outcomes according to aortic stenosis management: insights from real-world practice [^115qybBU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most frequent valvular heart disease in Western countries, affecting ≈5% of individuals aged > 65 year old. Untreated, symptomatic severe AS is associated with poor short‐term prognosis, significant rates of health care resource usage including frequent hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), and impaired quality of life. To date, aortic valve replacement (AVR) is the only effective therapy that has been proven to improve survival. Therefore, current guidelines strongly recommend to refer symptomatic patients with severe AS for AVR, whether surgical (SAVR) or transcatheter (TAVR), depending on surgical risk and/or patient age.

Despite these recommendations, previous studies consistently reported an underuse of AVR in a significant proportion of symptomatic patients with severe AS. Additionally, the question of more timely interventions in severe but also moderate AS emerges to reduce its burden, particularly at a time of low AVR‐related death even for those who were previously deemed to be inoperable. Importantly, most of the studies exploring the current management of patients with AS and its association with outcomes are restricted to severe AS, tertiary centers, report only limited follow‐up or may be biased by the cost or the availability of the selected therapy. Finally, the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines suggest different age thresholds (65 and 80) for choosing between SAVR or TAVR and highlight for the first time the importance of shared decision making with the patient. In this context, there are few data on patients who did not have an AVR (because they refused or in whom AVR was considered futile) despite a strong indication.

Given the growing interest in intervention in AS patients, a deeper understanding of the population risk profile and clinical course of the disease through contemporary and unbiased management may serve as a benchmark for future clinical studies. Based on a population of outpatients across the overall spectrum of AS (mild, moderate and severe AS), this study aimed to explore the mode of intervention, in the overall cohort and according to the age of the patients proposed by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, as well as the association between the initial therapeutic decision and long‐term outcomes, including patients in whom AVR was considered futile or patients who refused AVR.

Aortic stenosis — Routine follow-up of asymptomatic disease and progression rates: When severe AS is present (aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s), the rate of progression to symptoms is high, with an event-free survival rate of only 30% to 50% at 2 years. With moderate AS (aortic velocity 3.0–3.9 m/s), the average annual rate of progression is an increase in velocity of 0.3 m/s, increase in mean pressure gradient of 7 mm Hg, and decrease in valve area of 0.1 cm2. In patients with aortic sclerosis, defined as focal areas of valve calcification and leaflet thickening with an aortic velocity < 2.0 m/s, progression to severe AS occurs in about 10% of patients within 5 years.

### Low systemic arterial compliance is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in aortic valve stenosis [^117EBNZy]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In asymptomatic aortic valve stenosis (AS) management is based on the assessment of prognostic risk markers. A number of clinical and echocardiographic factors have been demonstrated to influence prognosis in AS, including older age, the degree of aortic valve calcification, the AS severity, left ventricular (LV) ejection fractionand plasma levels of natriuretic peptides. Furthermore, in recent publications also concomitant hypertension, obesity, male sex, LV hypertrophy, presence of low flowor a small aortic roothave been associated with higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in AS, independent of the AS severity.

Ageing and hypertension both lead to reduced systemic arterial compliance (SAC). Lower SAC has previously been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertensionor diabetesas well as in general population. In AS, lower SAC has been associated with the presence of reduced LV systolic function, but the prognostic impact of reduced SAC has not been tested in a large, prospective study in AS. The present study tested the hypothesis that low SAC is associated with impaired outcome in asymptomatic patients with AS independently of stenosis severity, concomitant hypertension and older age.

Aortic stenosis (AS) — progression and symptom onset in severe asymptomatic disease are highlighted by prospective data showing frequent progression, with symptom onset within 2 to 5 years likely when aortic jet velocity is ≥ 4.0 m/s or mean pressure gradient is ≥ 40 mm Hg, and the additive risk of aortic valve replacement (AVR) at the time of other cardiac surgery being less than the risk of reoperation within 5 years.

### Management of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis in patient with very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114xPxHR]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a viable option for patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are deemed inoperable or high risk for surgery. We sought to determine outcomes of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and severe COPD referred for aortic valve replacement (AVR). One hundred thirty-one patients with severe AS and severe COPD (GOLD criteria) were evaluated at our center between 2008 and 2013 and were divided retrospectively into 4 groups: 1-medical management, 2-balloon aortic valvuloplasty, 3-surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), and 4-TAVR. Baseline, clinical, and echo data were recorded. Primary outcome was cardiovascular death. From the study cohort, 54 (41.2%), 29 (22.1%), 21 (16.0%), and 27 (20.6%) were included in groups 1–4, respectively; the age was 74.9 ± 8.8, 76.2 ± 8.8, 78.8 ± 7.4, and 82.8 ± 6.8 years, respectively (P < 0.01). There was no significant difference between the groups for hypertension, diabetes, aortic valve area or gradients, forced expiratory volume in first second, right ventricular systolic pressure, ejection fraction, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality score. At 3 ± 1.5 years, death occurred in 87%, 97%, 47.7%, and 51.8% of patients in groups 1–4, respectively. Heart failure readmissions occurred in 43%, 42%, 9.6%, and 14.8% of patients in groups 1–4, respectively. When SAVR and TAVR groups were compared, there was no significant difference in survival (P = 0.719) or heart failure readmissions (P = 0.19). In patients with severe or very severe COPD and severe AS, replacing the severely stenotic aortic valve by either SAVR or TAVR improves survival and reduces rehospitalization compared with medical therapy or balloon aortic valvuloplasty.

Examples of procedure-specific risk factors for interventions not incorporated into existing risk scores — covering surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), surgical mitral valve repair or replacement, and transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) — include technical or anatomic issues such as "Prior mediastinal radiation", "Aorto-iliac occlusive disease precluding transfemoral approach", and "Valve morphology (eg, thickening, perforations, clefts, calcification, and stenosis)", comorbidities including "Severe COPD or home oxygen therapy", "Pulmonary hypertension", and "Severe RV dysfunction", and futility markers such as "STS score > 15", "Life expectancy < 1 y", and "Poor candidate for rehabilitation".

### How should very severe aortic stenosis Be defined in asymptomatic individuals? [^116LhiD9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on the evidence presented above, patients with asymptomatic VSAS (Table), preserved LVEF, and low surgical risk should not be managed conservatively because this approach will result in an unacceptably high risk of death. Additional factors supporting prompt surgery in VSAS are the fact that the more severe the valvular lesion, the faster the progression and the continuously increasing operative risk in aging patients managed conservatively. Kicking the can down the road because patients have trouble expressing symptoms may be more comfortable to physicians because physicians are "risk‐averse" and do not want to impose an immediate risk to their patients. However, this comfortable attitude is the source of undertreatment of AS and of excess mortality while the patients remains under "observation" and secondarily when (and if) AVR is ultimately performed. This is why we believe it is time to consider a more proactive approach to AVR in patients with severe AS, and VSAS is a starting point for this call to action. In our opinion, patients with VSAS and low operative risk should be promptly referred for surgical AVR. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is not currently recommended for asymptomatic severe AS with low surgical risk. The results of ongoing randomized trials in low‐risk patients might extend the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement as a therapeutic solution for asymptomatic VSAS in elderly patients.

### Laparoscopic adrenalectomy of pheochromocytoma following management of severe aortic stenosis with transcatheter aortic valve replacement under monitored anesthesia care sedation: a case report [^1178SZdS]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a safer alternative to open surgical aortic stenosis (AS) treatment in patients otherwise too high risk for traditional surgery due to serious comorbidities. As often seen in patients with severe aortic stenosis, insidious onset of disease ultimately leads to eventual progression to symptomatic effects and often mortality. Pheochromocytomas, adrenal medullary tumors of chromaffin cells, produce robust amounts of catecholamines, and are classically associated with paroxysmal hypertension, tachycardia, and various other non-specific, insidious clinical manifestations. Alternatively, pheochromocytomas may be asymptomatic, alluding to their wide range of manifestations and difficulty in diagnosis (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Intraoperative data during TAVR procedure

This case report shows a unique approach to managing AS in a patient with significant comorbidities, including a symptomatic pheochromocytoma and severe dementia, which also led to a limited traditional management of pheochromocytoma by adrenergic blockers. By performing a TAVR under monitored anesthesia care prior to laparoscopic adrenalectomy, our patient was more hemodynamically stable and experienced no significant perioperative complications after both procedures.

### Evaluation and management of aortic stenosis in chronic kidney disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115QSu4J]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Aortic stenosis with concomitant chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a clinical challenge. Aortic stenosis is more prevalent and progresses more rapidly and unpredictably in CKD, and the presence of CKD is associated with worse short-term and long-term outcomes after aortic valve replacement. Because patients with advanced CKD and end-stage kidney disease have been excluded from randomized trials, clinicians need to make complex management decisions in this population that are based on retrospective and observational evidence. This statement summarizes the epidemiological and pathophysiological characteristics of aortic stenosis in the context of CKD, evaluates the nuances and prognostic information provided by noninvasive cardiovascular imaging with echocardiography and advanced imaging techniques, and outlines the special risks in this population. Furthermore, this statement provides a critical review of the existing literature pertaining to clinical outcomes of surgical versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement in this high-risk population to help guide clinical decision making in the choice of aortic valve replacement and specific prosthesis. Finally, this statement provides an approach to the perioperative management of these patients, with special attention to a multidisciplinary heart-kidney collaborative team-based approach.

### Severe aortic stenosis: more than an imaging diagnosis [^114Rknv8]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The definition of severe aortic stenosis has undergone significant change casting a wider net to avoid missing patients who could benefit from valve replacement. The presence or absence of symptoms remains the key decision-making element; however, individuals presently undergoing evaluation are older, more likely asymptomatic, and have lower gradients. Due to numerous potential measurement errors, attention to detail when performing diagnostic testing and understanding their limitations are necessary to render appropriate treatment. Exercise testing adds useful information for individuals with severe aortic stenosis felt to be asymptomatic. Dobutamine echocardiography, in low flow-low gradient aortic stenosis, distinguishes between a myopathic and valvular cause of left ventricular dysfunction. Evaluation of patients when normotensive minimizes measurement errors. The amount of aortic valve calcification adds useful information when the degree of aortic stenosis is uncertain. A good history and physical integrated with high-quality imaging data allows for appropriate clinical treatment decisions for patients with aortic stenosis. The goal is simultaneously to provide aortic valve replacement for patients in need while avoiding overdiagnosis and performance of unnecessary procedures.
