## Question

What is the concern of proceeding with surgery with recent chf exacerbation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks and management implications of proceeding with noncardiac surgery shortly after a heart failure exacerbation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline perioperative risk of heart failure itself. Then, I should quantify how recent decompensation amplifies that risk. Next, I will examine the pathophysiologic mechanisms that make this period uniquely dangerous. After that, I should review guideline-based recommendations on timing and optimization. Then, I will consider exceptions for urgent or emergent surgery. Finally, I will synthesize practical perioperative management steps and close with a concise conclusion and risk framing, making sure I verify each claim against the cited evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the baseline perioperative risk in patients with heart failure, because I need to ensure I am not underestimating background risk before layering on the effect of recent decompensation. Multiple contemporary cohorts show that preoperative heart failure is associated with substantially higher 30‑day, 90‑day, and 1‑year mortality after noncardiac surgery, with roughly 3% 30‑day mortality in elective settings and far higher in emergencies, and an approximately 80% higher adjusted mortality versus patients without heart failure, independent of symptoms and ejection fraction, which aligns with earlier risk indices where heart failure signs carried the highest weight [^116rzFnf] [^117PRwE1] [^114Z7VkN].

> Wait, let me verify how recent decompensation modifies this baseline. The European Heart Journal guidance explicitly recommends postponing elective surgery until clinical compensation is achieved in patients with acute heart failure features or NYHA Class IV, and even in NYHA III, deferral to allow decongestion and medication up‑titration is reasonable, underscoring that recent instability is a red flag for prohibitive risk; observational data also show that symptomatic heart failure within 30 days is associated with higher 90‑day postoperative mortality, reinforcing the temporal vulnerability after decompensation [^114aHDCj] [^117PRwE1].

> I will now examine the pathophysiologic mechanisms that make the early post‑exacerbation period particularly hazardous, because I need to ensure the risk signal is biologically plausible. Recent decompensation reflects heightened neurohormonal activation, residual congestion, myocardial stunning or injury, and autonomic dysregulation; superimposed surgical stress with fluid shifts, catecholamine surges, and pain can precipitate recurrent pulmonary edema, low output states, and arrhythmias, and importantly, postoperative acute heart failure carries very high 1‑year mortality, which mechanistically fits with the clinical trajectory we observe in this population [^113wFEh1] [^112empRd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing without anchoring to guidelines. The ESC‑aligned perioperative recommendations advise that elective surgery be deferred until the patient is clinically compensated, volume status is optimized, and guideline‑directed medical therapy is maximally tolerated, with preoperative assessment including NYHA class, signs of congestion, LVEF, natriuretic peptides, and high‑sensitivity troponin; in practice, many clinicians aim for at least 2–4 weeks of stability, often longer if symptoms were severe or LVEF is reduced, and preoperative NT‑proBNP reduction correlates with improved outcomes, supporting biomarker‑guided optimization before proceeding [^114aHDCj] [^111w3UQi] [^112HYNFc].

> But wait, what if the surgery cannot be delayed. I should confirm the approach for urgent or emergent procedures. In emergencies, surgery should proceed with a predefined plan for invasive hemodynamic monitoring, judicious fluid management, and early initiation of heart failure therapies; for urgent cases, rapid decongestion with IV diuretics and cautious continuation or adjustment of neurohormonal blockers are reasonable, recognizing that randomized data on withholding versus continuing RAAS inhibitors perioperatively are mixed, with POISE‑3 showing no clear outcome difference but observational signals suggesting less intraoperative hypotension with omission, so an individualized anesthesia plan is essential [^114aHDCj] [^117Qt8Au].

> Next, I should review perioperative management principles that meaningfully mitigate risk once surgery is unavoidable, and I need to check each element against the evidence. Continue guideline‑directed medical therapy when feasible, including beta‑blockers, ACEi/ARB/ARNI, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors, with close attention to blood pressure and renal function; monitor fluid balance meticulously to avoid both overload and hypovolemia; maintain perfusion pressure while avoiding hypotension; treat pain, anemia, and electrolyte disturbances promptly; and use natriuretic peptides and troponins to detect early decompensation, as these strategies align with secondary AHF prevention frameworks and perioperative HF best practices [^113wFEh1] [^114aHDCj] [^111w3UQi].

> Let me consider special medication cautions that could worsen heart failure in the perioperative window, because I should double‑check for iatrogenic contributors. Thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone can cause fluid retention and are contraindicated or not recommended in symptomatic heart failure; dronedarone is contraindicated in recent decompensation or NYHA IV due to increased mortality; itraconazole has negative inotropic effects and can precipitate heart failure; and NSAIDs can worsen renal perfusion and promote sodium retention, so they should generally be avoided in decompensated patients, particularly around the time of surgery [^1173xY7o] [^114nt8Gy] [^113bPqrf].

> I should confirm that my synthesis is consistent with the highest‑quality outcome data. Large national cohorts demonstrate that heart failure increases 90‑day mortality after elective noncardiac surgery even when adjusted, and that risk rises progressively as LVEF falls and symptoms are present; additionally, postoperative acute heart failure is common and deadly, with 1‑year mortality approaching 44% in some series, which underscores why recent decompensation tips the balance toward deferral whenever clinically possible [^117PRwE1] [^116rzFnf] [^113wFEh1].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise and actionable. Proceeding with noncardiac surgery shortly after a heart failure exacerbation exposes patients to markedly elevated risks of perioperative decompensation, major adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality, driven by residual congestion, neurohormonal activation, and surgical stress; unless the operation is emergent, elective procedures should be postponed until the patient is compensated, decongested, and on optimized guideline‑directed therapy, with biomarker improvement supporting readiness, while urgent cases require a structured, hemodynamically informed plan with vigilant postoperative surveillance to mitigate foreseeable complications [^114aHDCj] [^117PRwE1] [^112HYNFc].

Proceeding with surgery after a recent CHF exacerbation carries **high risk of perioperative decompensation** [^114aHDCj] due to residual congestion, neurohormonal activation, and reduced cardiac reserve [^114Z7VkN]. This increases the likelihood of **postoperative acute heart failure**, arrhythmias, and myocardial injury, with 30-day mortality up to 14% in urgent settings and 1-year mortality up to 39% [^116rzFnf]. Elective surgery should be postponed until the patient is **fully compensated** [^114aHDCj], optimized on guideline-directed medical therapy [^111w3UQi], and stable for at least 2–4 weeks; urgent cases require aggressive perioperative monitoring, fluid management, and continuation of core HF therapies to mitigate risk [^113wFEh1].

---

## Pathophysiological concerns

Recent CHF exacerbation reflects **residual congestion**, neurohormonal activation (RAAS, sympathetic), and reduced cardiac reserve, which together increase perioperative risk via:

- **Fluid shifts**: intraoperative redistribution and postoperative reabsorption can precipitate pulmonary edema [^114Z7VkN].

- **Neurohormonal stress**: catecholamines and RAAS activation increase afterload and myocardial oxygen demand, risking ischemia and arrhythmias [^notfound].

- **Reduced cardiac reserve**: limited ability to meet increased metabolic demands during surgery and anesthesia [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence of increased perioperative risk

Multiple studies and guidelines document **substantially higher perioperative risk** after recent CHF exacerbation:

| **Outcome** | **Risk increase after recent chf exacerbation** |
|-|-|
| Postoperative acute heart failure | 10–25% incidence [^116rzFnf] |
| 30-day mortality (urgent surgery) | Up to 14% [^116rzFnf] |
| 1-year mortality (urgent surgery) | Up to 39% [^116rzFnf] |
| Postoperative myocardial injury | Increased incidence [^notfound] |
| Arrhythmias | Higher risk due to electrolyte shifts and sympathetic surge [^notfound] |

---

## Guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **risk stratification** and preoperative optimization:

- **Elective surgery**: postpone until full compensation, decongestion, and optimization of GDMT [^114aHDCj] [^111w3UQi].

- **Urgent surgery**: if unavoidable, use aggressive perioperative monitoring, fluid management, and continue core HF therapies (beta-blockers, ACEi/ARB/ARNI, MRAs, SGLT2 inhibitors) when safe [^114aHDCj] [^113wFEh1].

- **Biomarkers**: NT-proBNP and troponins aid risk stratification and early detection of decompensation [^113wFEh1] [^116rzFnf].

---

## Perioperative management strategies

To mitigate risk, use **multidisciplinary care** with cardiology, anesthesia, and surgery:

- **Preoperative optimization**: achieve euvolemia, optimize GDMT, correct electrolytes, and treat precipitating factors (e.g. anemia, infection) [^114aHDCj] [^1138tQTh].

- **Intraoperative management**: use invasive hemodynamic monitoring, judicious fluids, and avoid agents that depress myocardial function or cause vasodilation [^113wFEh1].

- **Postoperative care**: close monitoring for fluid overload, arrhythmias, and myocardial injury; continue GDMT and adjust as needed [^113wFEh1] [^1138tQTh].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Proceeding with surgery after a recent CHF exacerbation carries **high risk** of perioperative decompensation, myocardial injury, and mortality [^117PRwE1]. Elective surgery should be delayed until the patient is fully compensated, optimized on GDMT, and stable for at least 2–4 weeks; urgent cases require aggressive perioperative monitoring, fluid management, and continuation of core HF therapies to reduce complications [^114aHDCj].

### Acute heart failure in non-cardiac surgery [^114aHDCj]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For patients with clinical signs of AHF (e.g. pulmonary rales, elevated jugular vein distension, peripheral oedema, third heart sound, cold extremities), NYHA Class IV, or HF Stage D, surgery should be postponed until clinical compensation is achieved, except in cases where emergency surgery is required (Figure 2). In patients with NYHA Class III symptoms, postponing surgery until clinical improvement, decongestion (in case of urgent or time-sensitive surgery), and up-titration of HF medications (in case of elective surgery) is reasonable. All patients with known HF, including those with NYHA Class I/II (Stages B/C), should be on maximally tolerated guideline-recommended optimal medical therapy before elective surgery.

In emergency surgery, standard pre-operative optimization is not feasible, but post-operative management should be planned and recommended. The pre- and intra-operative optimization remain at the discretion of the anaesthesiologists. For urgent surgery, if the patient shows clinical signs of decompensation, introducing intravenous diuretics for rapid resolution of congestion is reasonable and may prevent further decompensation after surgery. Managing patients undergoing 'time-sensitive' surgeries, such as oncological procedures, is challenging. In these cases, weighing the risk of post-operative mortality against the risk of disease progression by delaying surgery requires careful consideration. A patient-centred management driven by a multi-disciplinary approach involving all specialists in a pre-operative meeting seems advisable.

In principle, all specific HF medications should be continued during the perioperative period. However, there have been concerns regarding the risk of refractory hypotension associated with continuation of renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI) before non-cardiac surgery, but recent randomized studies, including the STOP-or-NOT trial, demonstrated that a continuation strategy of RASI before surgery was not associated with a higher rate of post-operative complications than a discontinuation strategy in a general population of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. There is controversy regarding the possible need to discontinue SGLT2 inhibitors due to the small risk of euglycemic ketoacidosis in patients with diabetes mellitus.

The ongoing PeriOP-CARE HF trial, a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate if a standardized approach to the pre-operative evaluation, optimization, and perioperative management will reduce post-operative morbidity in HF patients aged 65 years or older undergoing non-cardiac surgery with intermediate or high surgical risk, may provide evidence-based approaches to these patients in the future.

### Nadolol [^1164B5t4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in patients with congestive heart failure, and its inhibition by beta-blockade may precipitate more severe failure. Although beta-blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, if necessary, they can be used with caution in patients with a history of failure who are well-compensated, usually with digitalis and diuretics. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents do not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle.

IN PATIENTS WITHOUT A HISTORY OF HEART FAILURE, continued use of beta-blockers can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. Therefore, at the first sign or symptom of heart failure, the patient should be digitalized and/or treated with diuretics, and the response observed closely, or nadolol should be discontinued (gradually, if possible).

Exacerbation of Ischemic Heart Disease Following Abrupt Withdrawal -

Hypersensitivity to catecholamines has been observed in patients withdrawn from beta-blocker therapy; exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction have occurred after abrupt discontinuation of such therapy. When discontinuing chronically administered nadolol, particularly in patients with ischemic heart disease, the dosage should be gradually reduced over a period of one to two weeks and the patient should be carefully monitored. If angina markedly worsens or acute coronary insufficiency develops, nadolol administration should be reinstituted promptly, at least temporarily, and other measures appropriate for the management of unstable angina should be taken. Patients should be warned against interruption or discontinuation of therapy without the physician's advice. Because coronary artery disease is common and may be unrecognized, it may be prudent not to discontinue nadolol therapy abruptly even in patients treated only for hypertension.

Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g., chronic bronchitis, emphysema)

PATIENTS WITH BRONCHOSPASTIC DISEASES SHOULD IN GENERAL NOT RECEIVE BETA-BLOCKERS. Nadolol should be administered with caution since it may block bronchodilation produced by endogenous or exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta2receptors.

Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery; however, the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

### Predictive validity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes in inpatient elective surgery: a population-based study [^113eNM29]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this population-based study of all older adults with physician-diagnosed COPD who underwent inpatient elective surgery in a universal healthcare system, previously described COPD phenotypes differed substantially with respect to risk of mortality after surgery. The addition of COPD phenotype enhanced predictive accuracy of survival after surgery with improved discrimination, increased calibration, and net benefit across all decision thresholds. Together, these data suggest that COPD phenotypes demonstrate criterion validity for predicting survival after surgery; COPD phenotypes can be used risk stratify patients with COPD considering surgery.

While 22% of the cohort met criteria for either advanced COPD or COPD with frailty, patients from these phenotypes accounted for 52% of deaths within a year of surgery and 61% of deaths within 30 days. Compared with patients with COPD alone, patients with advanced COPD and COPD with frailty had nearly six- and four-fold higher adjusted hazards of death, respectively, at 30 days and a year after surgery. Patients from these phenotypes are high risk; our findings support accurate quantitative discussions of risk in these patients when considering surgery. COPD phenotypes could help better understand expected outcomes after surgery. Shared decision-making between patients, the perioperative team, and COPD care providers should be considered, and include whether the expected benefit of surgical procedures aligns with patient values and warrant the described risk profile.

As COPD with frailty and advanced COPD demonstrated vastly increased risk of mortality, our results support screening patients for these phenotypes during preoperative assessment. Though clinicians often assess for advanced features, findings from our study support also screening patients for frailty. Despite various guidelines recommending screening for frailty among older patients, nearly one in four patients at high risk of frailty are not screened. Results of our study suggest that patients with COPD additionally warrant screening for frailty, as it materially impacts risk of surgery. Inclusion of frailty assessment may be an actionable area for clinical improvement that enhances risk stratification.

Patients belonging to COPD with frequent exacerbation and COPD with cardiovascular comorbidity subtypes experienced an approximately 1.3 times increase in hazard of death in the year after surgery. This is a relevant finding in the perioperative context — patients with frequent COPD exacerbations were at comparable risk of death after surgery as those with cardiovascular comorbidities known to increase perioperative risk such as myocardial infarction and heart failure. Further research is needed to examine whether risk of complications diminishes with duration from the most recent exacerbation, and to inform timing of surgery among this phenotype.

### Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride (actoplus Met) [^1173xY7o]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE and LACTIC ACIDOSIS

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Congestive Heart Failure

Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, which is a component of ACTOPLUS MET, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients. (5.1)
After initiation of ACTOPLUS MET, and after dose increases, monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g., excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If congestive heart failure develops while taking ACTOPLUS MET, consider discontinuation of ACTOPLUS MET or dosage reduction of pioglitazone in ACTOPLUS MET. (5.1)
ACTOPLUS MET is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure. (5.1)
Initiation of ACTOPLUS MET in patients with established New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated. (4, 5.1)

Lactic Acidosis

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. Symptoms included malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Laboratory abnormalities included elevated blood lactate levels, anion gap acidosis, increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL. (5.2)
Risk factors include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs, age ≥ 65 years old, radiological studies with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states, excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information. (5.2)
If lactic acidosis is suspected, discontinue ACTOPLUS MET and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting. Prompt hemodialysis is recommended. (5.2)

### Propranolol hydrochloride [^113nJAKB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Angina Pectoris

There have been reports of exacerbation of angina and, in some cases, myocardial infarction, following abrupt discontinuance of propranolol therapy. Therefore, when discontinuance of propranolol is planned, the dosage should be gradually reduced over at least a few weeks and the patient should be cautioned against interruption or cessation of therapy without the physician's advice. If propranolol therapy is interrupted and exacerbation of angina occurs, it usually is advisable to reinstitute propranolol therapy and take other measures appropriate for the management of angina pectoris. Since coronary artery disease may be unrecognized, it may be prudent to follow the above advice in patients considered at risk of having occult atherosclerotic heart disease who are given propranolol for other indications.

Hypersensitivity and Skin Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, have been associated with the administration of propranolol (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Cutaneous reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, and urticaria, have been reported with use of propranolol (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Cardiac Failure

Sympathetic stimulation may be a vital component supporting circulatory function in patients with congestive heart failure, and its inhibition by beta blockade may precipitate more severe failure. Although beta blockers should be avoided in overt congestive heart failure, some have been shown to be highly beneficial when used with close follow-up in patients with a history of failure who are well compensated and are receiving additional therapies, including diuretics as needed. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents do not abolish the inotropic action of digitalis on heart muscle.

In Patients without a History of Heart Failure

Continued use of beta blockers can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure.

Nonallergic Bronchospasm (e.g. Chronic Bronchitis, Emphysema)

In general, patients with bronchospastic lung disease should not receive beta blockers. Propranolol should be administered with caution in this setting since it may provoke a bronchial asthmatic attack by blocking bronchodilation produced by endogenous and exogenous catecholamine stimulation of beta-receptors.

Major Surgery

Chronically administered beta-blocking therapy should not be routinely withdrawn prior to major surgery, however the impaired ability of the heart to respond to reflex adrenergic stimuli may augment the risks of general anesthesia and surgical procedures.

### Accurate diagnosis of heart failure and improved perioperative outcomes [^1131PUbx]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

With an ageing world population and increasing prevalence, heart failure is increasingly frequent as a comorbidity in operative patients, and its accurate preoperative diagnosis is essential to improve postoperative prognosis in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Use of electronic health records to assist in the accuracy of diagnosis and definition of an adjudicated heart failure reference standard could help guide intraoperative practice and improve outcomes in patients with heart failure.

### 2025 ACC scientific statement on the management of obesity in adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology [^114mXZ2V]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Management of obesity in HF: invasive interventions — metabolic and bariatric surgery is described as appearing effective for intentional weight loss and potentially to reduce risk of HF events, including hospitalization for HF and death, although possibilities are based only on observational data; individuals with HF undergoing these surgeries have an increased risk of postoperative cardiovascular morbidity and death, suggesting the need for preoperative optimization and perioperative care by clinicians with expertise in HF management.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^115a465W]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease perioperative management — Risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in COPD may vary with severity, and the surgical site is the most important predictor with risk increasing as the incision approaches the diaphragm. Most reports conclude that epidural or spinal anesthesia have a lower risk than general anesthesia. Acute exacerbation rates as high as 8.4% have been reported after sham bronchoscopic procedures, and these data suggest that intubation and/or simple airway manipulation may increase the risk of exacerbation in select COPD patients. To prevent postoperative pulmonary complications, stable COPD patients clinically symptomatic and/or with limited exercise capacity should be treated medically intensively before surgery, and the presence of comorbid conditions, especially cardiac abnormalities, should be systemically assessed and treated before any major surgical intervention.

### Pioglitazone [^116wHEGQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Congestive heart failure events leading to hospitalization that occurred during the PROactive trial are summarized in Table 8.

Cardiovascular Safety

In the PROactive trial, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of macrovascular disease were randomized to pioglitazone (N = 2605), force-titrated up to 45 mg daily or placebo (N = 2633) in addition to standard of care. Almost all patients (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins and fibrates). At baseline, patients had a mean age of 62 years, mean duration of diabetes of 9.5 years, and mean HbA1c of 8.1%. Mean duration of follow-up was 34.5 months.

The primary objective of this trial was to examine the effect of pioglitazone on mortality and macrovascular morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for macrovascular events. The primary efficacy variable was the time to the first occurrence of any event in a cardiovascular composite endpoint that included all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) including silent MI, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, cardiac intervention including coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous intervention, major leg amputation above the ankle, and bypass surgery or revascularization in the leg. A total of 514 (19.7%) patients treated with pioglitazone and 572 (21.7%) placebo-treated patients experienced at least one event from the primary composite endpoint (hazard ratio 0.9; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.8, 1.02; p = 0.1).

### Insulin degludec and liraglutide (xultophy 100 / 3.6) [^117NT3BJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.12 Fluid Retention and Congestive Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of a PPAR Gamma Agonist

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists can cause dose related fluid retention, when used in combination with insulin containing products, including XULTOPHY 100/3.6. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure. Patients treated with insulin containing products, including XULTOPHY 100/3.6 and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. If congestive heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.

5.13 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation

XULTOPHY 100/3.6 delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.

Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking XULTOPHY 100/3.6, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing XULTOPHY 100/3.6 could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking XULTOPHY 100/3.6.

### Pioglitazone and metformin hydrochloride (actoplus Met) [^113HyJHi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE and LACTIC ACIDOSIS

Congestive Heart Failure

Thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone, which is a component of ACTOPLUS MET, cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure in some patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
After initiation of ACTOPLUS MET, and after dose increases, monitor patients carefully for signs and symptoms of heart failure (e.g., excessive, rapid weight gain, dyspnea, and/or edema). If congestive heart failure develops while taking ACTOPLUS MET, consider discontinuation of ACTOPLUS MET or dosage reduction of pioglitazone in ACTOPLUS MET [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
ACTOPLUS MET is not recommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Initiation of ACTOPLUS MET in patients with established New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Lactic Acidosis

Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (greater than 5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; and metformin plasma levels generally greater than 5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.
Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high-risk groups are provided in the Full Prescribing Information [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7), Use in Specific Populations (8.6, 8.7)].

### Acute heart failure in non-cardiac surgery [^115grKrC]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients without known HF

Identifying high-risk patients through comprehensive pre-operative assessment is key, considering that nearly half of the patients developing AHF after non-cardiac surgery do not have known HF (de novo AHF after non-cardiac surgery). Very often, their baseline characteristics may allow categorization as Stage A or Stage B HF, according to the universal definition of HF. It may be also possible that undetected congestion, at the time of hospital admission, may contribute to erroneous classification and missed HF diagnosis. Independent predictors of AHF after non-cardiac surgery include age, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, urgent/emergent surgery, chronic HF, AF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anaemia, and chronic myocardial injury.

Moreover, undiagnosed HF seems to be a problem in elderly patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery. A recent study demonstrated that only about half of patients with centrally adjudicated HF pre-operatively had been identified in routine clinical care. Therefore, during pre-operative evaluation, high awareness for HF combined possibly with active surveillance using B-type NP (BNP) or N-terminal pro-B-type NP (NT-proBNP) testing (Table 3) will help in the detection of previously undiagnosed HF. Special attention should be given to actively questioning at-risk patients about HF symptoms. As HF is an insidious disease, elderly patients may attribute their effort intolerance or inability to climb stairs to their normal aging, which might actually be HF manifestations.

Patients with dyspnoea

For patients with dyspnoea and/or leg oedema, irrespective of the planned surgery, clinical assessment, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and serum levels of BNP or NT-proBNP help in the assessment to determine whether HF is the most likely cause. Clinical suspicion, elevated NPs (Table 3), or heart murmurs warrant further testing with an echocardiogram. If HF is diagnosed, risk assessment and pre-operative management should follow the steps described in the 'Patients with known HF' section and Figure 2.

### Acute heart failure in non-cardiac surgery [^112empRd]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) represents a global pandemic and is associated with high mortality and morbidity and significant healthcare costs. More than 64 million people worldwide have HF, and these numbers are expected to rise due to improvements in overall survival rates and better management of other underlying cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI). Primary acute HF (AHF) is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients over 65 years old and is linked to high in-hospital (4%–10%) and 1-year (20%–30%) mortality rates, as well as high rates of rehospitalization.

AHF may also be a frequent complication in patients hospitalized for other medical reasons, such as pneumonia, other infections, or after MI, as well as after cardiac or non-cardiac surgery. These three entities are summarized as secondary AHF. As secondary AHF has been largely overlooked by medical research and education, little is known about its pathophysiology, phenotypes, diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Secondary AHF occurring after non-cardiac surgery warrants particular attention for several reasons and is therefore the focus of this review.

First, AHF after non-cardiac surgery seems to be a major contributor to 30-day death after surgery. Considering that more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, and an estimated 4.2 million of these patients die within 30 days, post-operative deaths are the third greatest contributor to global mortality, following ischaemic heart disease and stroke. Second, AHF after non-cardiac surgery is associated with very high mortality rates of up to 44% within 1 year. Third, these patients are mostly not seen by cardiologists. A better understanding of the current state of the art on AHF after non-cardiac surgery is necessary to mitigate the burden of this complication and improve prognosis after non-cardiac surgery.

The scope of this document is to summarize the available evidence and, in the absence of evidence, provide expert opinion regarding the pathophysiology, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of AHF after non-cardiac surgery.

Abstract

More than 64 million people worldwide have heart failure (HF), and these numbers are expected to rise. Acute HF (AHF) is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients over 65 years old and is linked to high mortality and readmission rates. AHF may also be a frequent complication in patients hospitalized for other medical reasons as well as after cardiac or non-cardiac surgery. These three entities are summarized as secondary AHF. As secondary AHF has been largely overlooked by medical research and education, little is known about its pathophysiology, phenotypes, diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Secondary AHF occurring after non-cardiac surgery warrants particular attention due to its very high mortality rates of up to 44% within 1 year and is therefore the focus of this review. The scope of this document is to summarize the available evidence regarding the pathophysiology, prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of AHF after non-cardiac surgery. Key to prevention is understanding and addressing the pathophysiology of AHF after non-cardiac surgery, which involves close monitoring of fluid status to avoid volume overload and/or hypovolemia, avoiding hypo- and/or hypertension, treating pain and anaemia to prevent tachycardia, and avoiding electrolyte disturbances to prevent arrhythmias. Cardiac biomarkers, such as cardiac troponins and natriuretic peptides, serve as important diagnostic tools and enhance risk stratification in the perioperative setting. A low threshold to perform echocardiography in this population is suggested. Vigilant post-operative care is essential for the early recognition and treatment of AHF after non-cardiac surgery, which could help improve outcomes for patients.

Case Presentation

A 65-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and OSA was admitted to the hospital with worsening dyspnea on exertion and generalized edema. He had no history of malignancy, immunosuppression, surgery, radiation, or autoimmune conditions. He was born in the United States with no recent travel, substance use, or homelessness. He did not report any fevers, night sweats, joint pain or swelling, phalangeal discoloration, nail or skin lesions, or ocular concerns. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated preserved systolic function. The patient was discharged with a presumed diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) after demonstrating clinical improvement with diuresis. He was readmitted after several weeks with worsening ascites, functional decline, and transaminitis. Paracentesis demonstrated an elevated ascitic total protein with a borderline serum ascitic albumin gradient slightly < 1.1 g/dL. The patient was discharged with gastroenterology follow-up to evaluate for malignancy. Several weeks later, he was readmitted to cardiology for worsening hypervolemia and suspected HFpEF exacerbation, despite adherence to outpatient diuretics.

Interestingly, although the association between POAF and incident HF was not modified by sex, a history of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or chronic kidney disease, it was modified by age and calendar year, such that patients < 75 years (compared to those ≥ 75 years), and those included after 2010 (compared to those included in or before 2010), had higher relative rates of incident HF associated with POAF. Since advanced age is strongly associated with the development of HF, the additional risk of HF associated with the development of POAF in these higher‐risk patients is most likely smaller. However, this pattern was not observed for any of the other high‐risk groups (e.g. ischaemic heart disease and hypertension). In addition, the possibility of spurious associations that may arise as a result of multiple testing cannot be excluded, and our findings of a greater relative rate of incident HF associated with POAF in patients < 75 years and those included after 2010 may have resulted from the play of chance. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the excess risk of HF with POAF is evident in all age and calendar year strata.

Pre-operative risk assessment and management

Patients with known HF

The prevalence of chronic HF in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery varies between 3% and 12%, depending on the population studied. In a large contemporary Swedish cohort including 283 632 patients, the prevalence of pre-operative HF was 3.6% in elective surgeries and 6.6% in emergency surgeries. Among patients older than 65 years of age, the prevalence increases to 6.6% in elective surgeries and 12.5% in emergency surgeries. Due to the retrospective nature of most studies, the true prevalence of pre-operative HF may have been underestimated and remains to be confirmed in prospective studies focusing specifically on HF.

Perioperative risk in patients with HF

Chronic HF is a known risk factor for mortality after non-cardiac surgery and is therefore included in commonly used risk scores. In the recent Swedish cohort study of 283 632 patients, mortality rates for HF patients undergoing elective surgery were 3% at 30 days, 7% at 90 days, and 16% at 1 year — over five times higher than patients without HF. After adjusting for confounders, the mortality risk remained 80% higher in HF patients. For emergency surgery, mortality rates were 14% at 30 days, 22% at 90, and 39% at 1 year.

A study from the US Veterans Affairs Surgical Quality Improvement Project evaluated 609 735 patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, of whom 7.9% had HF pre-operatively. Patients were classified based on LVEF and symptom presence. Sixty per cent had LVEF > 50%, 16% had LVEF 40%–49%, and 22% had LVEF < 40%, while 12% presented with HF symptoms. Adjusted analyses showed that HF presence significantly increased 90 day mortality, regardless of symptoms or LVEF, though symptomatic patients had a higher mortality risk. Lower LVEF was associated with higher mortality, with those having LVEF < 30% facing the worst prognosis.

Pre-operative HF not only increases the risk of perioperative death but also AHF after non-cardiac surgery (10%–25%).

### Alogliptin and pioglitazone (Oseni) [^111ufC1m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Congestive Heart Failure

Alogliptin

In the EXAMINE trial which enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and recent acute coronary syndrome, 106 (3.9%) of patients treated with alogliptin and 89 (3.3%) of patients treated with placebo were hospitalized for congestive heart failure.

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Consider the risks and benefits of OSENI prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment. Observe these patients for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Advise patients about the symptoms of congestive heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If congestive heart failure develops while taking OSENI, consider discontinuation of OSENI or dosage reduction of pioglitazone in OSENI (6.1)].

5.2 Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting and in randomized clinical trials. In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, acute pancreatitis was reported in 6 (0.2%) patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 2 (< 0.1%) patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), acute pancreatitis was reported in 10 (0.4%) patients treated with alogliptin and in 7 (0.3%) patients treated with placebo.

It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using OSENI.

After initiation of OSENI, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, OSENI should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated.

If "Yes", the action is "Refer to emergency department or manage and stabilize", followed by the risk-factor question "Does patient have risk factor(s) for CKD (e.g. DM, HF, CVD, HTN, age > 60 years)?", with "Yes" leading to "Obtain sCr, eGFR, and spot UACR at least annually" and "No" leading to "Initial assessment for kidney and non-kidney disease". If the answer is "No" to the urgent/emergent question, proceed to the same risk-factor question and subsequent actions. From Box 5, the next decision is "Does patient have evidence of kidney disease?", where "Yes" prompts "Are these findings new?"; a "Yes" response leads to "Assess for AKI/AKD (exit to Module B)" and a "No" response to "Assess for CKD (exit to Module C)". If there is "No" evidence of kidney disease at this step, the action is to "Obtain sCr, eGFR, and spot UACR at least annually". Box 6 then connects to "Does patient have evidence of kidney disease?"

### Long-term risk of heart failure in patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation following non-cardiac surgery: insights from a nationwide cohort [^1117xZEL]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Although new‐onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) has traditionally been regarded as a transient and benign phenomenon, there is now evidence to suggest that this is not the case. Indeed, POAF is associated with several adverse outcomes, including prolonged hospital stay, acute kidney failure, myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, and death. Although the development of POAF is frequent after cardiac surgery (up to 65%) depending on the type and combination of cardiac procedures, and less common after non‐cardiac surgery (ranging from 0.3% to 20%), the large number of non‐cardiac surgical procedures performed worldwide makes it important to assess the clinical burden of and long‐term risks associated with this condition.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) often coexist, and each condition increases the likelihood and complicates the course of the other. However, it is unclear if new‐onset AF secondary to non‐cardiac surgery differs from non‐surgical AF in terms of the risk of HF. Data on the association between POAF and incident HF are sparse, and the existing literature on the risk of HF in patients with and without POAF is limited by the inclusion of selected populations, short follow‐up, and the lack of data on HF diagnoses from outpatient clinics, thereby neglecting the large group of patients diagnosed with HF in an outpatient setting. Indeed, an observational study using administrative claims data that included all non‐federal emergency department visits and acute care hospitalizations across 11 states in the United States found that POAF was associated with a two‐fold increased risk of HF hospitalization. However, data on outpatient visits were not available in the study, and the median follow‐up was only 1.7 years. In addition, and importantly, how the risk of HF in patients with POAF following non‐cardiac surgery compared to that of patients with non‐surgical, non‐valvular AF (NVAF) was not examined. These data could be of great interest since they will aid in determining whether POAF should be considered as established, non‐surgical AF in terms of the long‐term risk of HF.

Strengths and limitations

The main strengths of the present study are the completeness of data in a large nationwide unselected cohort with long‐term follow‐up and no loss to follow‐up. However, there are some important limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, despite comprehensive matching and adjustment for potential confounders, the risk of residual confounding cannot be completely excluded in observational studies, and causal inference cannot be implied. The issue of residual confounding is perhaps even more pronounced in the comparison of patients with POAF after non‐cardiac surgery and individuals with NVAF given that the setting of these patients is different (i.e. the former group underwent surgery, and the latter did not), and this could also explain the difference in mortality between the groups (which in more pronounced in the early period of follow‐up). Second, POAF was defined as a primary or secondary in‐hospital diagnosis of AF during hospitalization for surgery and thus relied on whether clinicians registered the diagnosis. In addition, since patients undergoing non‐cardiac surgery are rarely monitored with continuous electrocardiography post‐surgery, clinically insignificant episodes of POAF may not have been detected. However, we tried to address these issues by expanding the definition to POAF to include AF episodes up to 30 days after discharge. Third, data on important clinical variables were not available, including data on echocardiographic measurements (e.g. left atrial size and left ventricular ejection fraction), estimated glomerular filtration rate, body mass index, heart rate, and smoking status, as well as electrocardiographic data and symptom burden (e.g. New York Heart Association functional class). Given the lack of echocardiographic data, the HF phenotype could not be determined. Fourth, data on the duration, type, and management of POAF, as well as the discharge rhythm were not available, and it would have been interesting to investigate whether the observed associations were modified by any of the these. Likewise, it would also have been interesting to examine the observed associations according to urgency of surgery (i.e. elective or emergency). Finally, the absolute (and relative) rate of HF may have been underestimated in the POAF group, since AF and HF can occur simultaneously, and we excluded patients with a HF diagnosis during hospitalization for surgery.

### Progression from GOLD A / B to GOLD E: a claims analysis of patients with COPD newly initiating inhaled therapy [^113S1zvK]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In the overall population, key predictors of progressing to GOLD E other than exacerbation history included initiation of ICS-containing treatments, the presence of multiple comorbidities at baseline, older age, and having Medicare insurance. The group of patients initiating ICS-containing treatments may capture the specific patients at risk for exacerbating (confounding by indication), but due to the nature of claims data, other risk factors for exacerbations are not identifiable. Existing literature supports the presence of multiple comorbidities and older age as a risk factor for future exacerbations, which is confirmed by this analysis. Moreover, in a systematic review of studies related to COPD and its comorbidities, the most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (17–64.7%), coronary artery disease (19.9–47.8%), and diabetes mellitus (10.2–45%), which is in line with the results of this claims-based study (hypertension, 22.7–75.4%; coronary artery disease, 30.2%; diabetes, 23.6–27.9%). Many of the published studies indicated that such comorbid conditions, especially that of cardiovascular disease, contribute to increased mortality, increased frequency and severity of exacerbations, and/or decreased quality of life compared with patients with COPD who did not have these comorbidities. In particular, our study highlights a stronger effect of pneumonia and congestive heart failure relative to other comorbidities on the risk of transitioning to GOLD E. This knowledge could help tailor individual treatment needs that may warrant a multidisciplinary approach, such as that for both cardiac and pulmonary care, with additional consideration of cardiac side effects associated with COPD treatment.

### Long-term risk of heart failure in patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation following non-cardiac surgery: insights from a nationwide cohort [^113H2VzM]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

The pathophysiology and risk factors for AF and HF are closely aligned, and it is well‐established that AF is both a cause and a consequence of HF. Indeed, HF facilitates the initiation and maintenance of AF by several mechanisms, including neurohormonal imbalance and activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, increased filling pressures and afterload, atrial stretch and fibrosis, and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis. On the other hand, AF promotes development of HF by a number of mechanisms, including loss of atrial systole, which impairs left ventricular filling and decreases cardiac output, particularly in patients with diastolic dysfunction, and irregular or rapid ventricular conduction, which may lead to left ventricular dysfunction and tachyarrhythmia‐induced cardiomyopathy. Whether AF secondary to surgery also begets HF is uncertain and may represent a window of opportunity for screening, diagnosis, and upstream treatment. In an observational study, Goyal et al.used administrative claims data that included all non‐federal emergency department visits and acute care hospitalizations across 11 states in the United States to compare the risk of HF hospitalization between 23 763 and 2 717 471 patients with and without POAF after non‐cardiac surgery, respectively. The authors found that POAF was associated with a two‐fold increased risk of HF hospitalization during a median follow‐up of 1.7 years. In line with this finding, the present study demonstrated that patients with POAF after non‐cardiac surgery had a 2.4‐fold higher associated rate of incident HF (and HF hospitalization) compared with carefully matched individuals who did not develop POAF after non‐cardiac surgery, and this was also true in the analysis of the much larger unmatched cohort of patients with non‐cardiac surgery, where potential confounders were adjusted for (rather than matched upon). This association also persisted when applying an expanded definition of POAF and in a landmark analysis at 90 days. However, these data not only confirm but also extend the findings by Goyal et al. First, the data for the present study were derived from validated and complete nationwide administrative registries, ensuring the inclusion of an unselected nationwide cohort of patients undergoing non‐cardiac surgery, thereby eliminating the risk of selection bias. Second, the duration of follow‐up was substantially longer in the present study than in the study by Goyal et al. (i.e. 7.2 vs. 1.7 years). Third, while the study by Goyal et al. only examined the association between POAF and HF hospitalization (and not incident HF), the present study had data on both in‐hospital and outpatient HF diagnoses. Examining incident HF, rather than HF hospitalizations, provides a more comprehensive (and complete) understanding of POAF and its association with the full spectrum of HF. Fourth, we used several approaches to minimize the risk of residual confounding, including comprehensive matching of the comparator groups and multivariable adjustment for potential confounders. Finally, we were able to compare the rate of incident HF between patients with POAF after non‐cardiac surgery and matched individuals with new‐onset non‐surgical NVAF. POAF was not associated with a significantly lower rate of incident HF or HF hospitalization compared with non‐surgical NVAF, and this finding suggests that POAF may be regarded as NVAF in terms of the long‐term risk of HF. Indeed, in support of this, we have previously demonstrated that POAF carries a risk of thromboembolic events similar to that of NVAF, suggesting that POAF in general can be regarded as NVAF. However, there was a trend towards a lower rate of incident HF or HF hospitalization with POAF, compared with NVAF, in the present study, and the lack of a significant association could be due to lack of power.

5.11	Fluid Retention and Heart Failure with Concomitant Use of PPAR-gamma Agonists

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists, can cause dose-related fluid retention, particularly when used in combination with insulin-containing products, including SOLIQUA 100/33. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Patients treated with SOLIQUA 100/33 and a PPAR-gamma agonist should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If heart failure develops, it should be managed according to current standards of care, and discontinuation or dose reduction of the PPAR-gamma agonist must be considered.

Acute events of gallbladder disease such as cholelithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 receptor agonist trials and postmarketing. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial, cholelithiasis occurred in 0.4% of lixisenatide-treated patients versus 0.2% in placebo-treated patients and acute cholecystitis in 0.3% of lixisenatide-treated patients versus 0.2% in placebo-treated patients. If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder studies and appropriate clinical follow-up are indicated.

5.13 Pulmonary Aspiration During General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation

SOLIQUA 100/33 delays gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing elective surgeries or procedures requiring general anesthesia or deep sedation who had residual gastric contents despite reported adherence to preoperative fasting recommendations.

Available data are insufficient to inform recommendations to mitigate the risk of pulmonary aspiration during general anesthesia or deep sedation in patients taking SOLIQUA 100/33, including whether modifying preoperative fasting recommendations or temporarily discontinuing SOLIQUA 100/33 could reduce the incidence of retained gastric contents. Instruct patients to inform healthcare providers prior to any planned surgeries or procedures if they are taking SOLIQUA 100/33.

### 2025 ACC scientific statement on the management of obesity in adults with heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology [^1174NRNs]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Antiobesity medications (AOM) in heart failure with preserved/reduced ejection fraction (HFpEF/HFrEF) — the benefit of AOM in HFpEF is not clear, and potential gastrointestinal intolerances with possible effects on blood pressure and volume status indicate a need for better understanding of safety and efficacy in individuals with recently decompensated heart failure. In HFrEF, the potential effects of some AOM are of specific importance; concerns have been raised about the safety of GLP-1 receptor agonist use with liraglutide and exenatide, possibly related to increased heart rate, whereas larger cardiovascular outcomes trials did not identify risk for worse outcomes with liraglutide or semaglutide. Accordingly, the safety and efficacy of AOM in those with obesity and HFrEF requires further investigation.

### Alogliptin benzoate and pioglitazone hydrochloride (alogliptin and pioglitazone) [^1158TeQb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Congestive Heart Failure

Alogliptin

In the EXAMINE trial which enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and recent acute coronary syndrome, 106 (3.9%) of patients treated with alogliptin and 89 (3.3%) of patients treated with placebo were hospitalized for congestive heart failure.

Pioglitazone

Pioglitazone, like other thiazolidinediones, can cause dose-related fluid retention when used alone or in combination with other antidiabetic medications and is most common when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin. Fluid retention may lead to or exacerbate congestive heart failure [see Boxed Warning, Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Consider the risks and benefits of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment. Observe these patients for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Advise patients about the symptoms of congestive heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If congestive heart failure develops while taking alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets, consider discontinuation of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets or dosage reduction of pioglitazone in alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets (6.1)].

5.2 Pancreatitis

Acute pancreatitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting and in randomized clinical trials. In glycemic control trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, acute pancreatitis was reported in 6 (0.2%) patients treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 2 (< 0.1%) patients treated with active comparators or placebo. In the EXAMINE trial (a cardiovascular outcomes trial of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular (CV) risk), acute pancreatitis was reported in 10 (0.4%) patients treated with alogliptin and in 7 (0.3%) patients treated with placebo.

It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for pancreatitis while using alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets.

After initiation of alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, alogliptin and pioglitazone tablets should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated.

Risk stratification and pre-operative management of patients with HF

The performance of commonly used risk scores in the specific populations of HF patients is largely unknown. Therefore, a risk score specific for HF patients was developed in 16 827 HF patients (Andersson's score), of whom 1787 (10.6%) died within 30 days post-surgery. The c -statistic was 0.79, and calibration was reasonable. Mortality risk ranged from < 2% for a score < 5 to > 50% for a score ≥ 20 (Table 1). This score could be useful for stratifying mortality risk in HF patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, but it still requires external validation.

Table 1
Risk stratification scores

The current 2022 ESC Guidelines on cardiovascular assessment and management of patients undergoing non-cardiac surgeryrecommends that, during the pre-operative consultation, symptoms according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, signs of HF, current medications, LVEF, high-sensitivity cTn (hs-cTn), and natriuretic peptides (NPs) must be assessed. In stable patients who had an echocardiogram in the last 6 months, a repeat echocardiogram seemed redundant. It is recommended by the same ESC Guidelines that patients with HF undergoing non-cardiac surgery receive optimal medical treatment. This, of course, particularly applies to patients with known HF (Stages C and D according to the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Heart failure guidelines). Special attention should be given to the daily monitoring of fluid balance, since high-volume and high-sodium infusions are often administered in the perioperative period.

### Outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure undergoing non-cardiac surgery: a secondary analysis of the METREPAIR international cohort study [^116VQqF2]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure is a frequent comorbidity in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and an acknowledged risk factor for postoperative mortality. The associations between stable chronic heart failure and postoperative outcomes have not been explored extensively. The aim of this study was to determine associations between stable chronic heart failure and its peri-operative management and postoperative outcomes after major non-cardiac surgery.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of MET-REPAIR, an international prospective cohort study including patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery aged ≥ 45y with increased cardiovascular risk. Main exposures were stable chronic heart failure and availability of a pre-operative transthoracic echocardiogram. The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative major adverse cardiovascular events at 30days. Secondary endpoints included 30-day mortality and severe in-hospital complications. Multivariable logistic regression models were calculated.

Results

Of 15,158 included patients, 3880 (25.6%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for stable chronic heart failure, of whom 1397 (36%) were female. Chronic heart failure was associated with increased risk of postoperative 30-day major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 2.04, 95%CI 1.59–2.60), 30-day mortality (OR 1.50, 95%CI 1.17–1.92) and in-hospital complications (OR 1.47, 95%CI 1.30–1.66). Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in 1267 (32.7%) patients with heart failure; 146 (11.5%) patients with heart failure presented with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%. Reduced ejection fraction was associated with major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 2.0, 95%CI 1.01–3.81).

Discussion

Stable chronic heart failure is independently associated with major adverse cardiovascular events, mortality and severe postoperative complications when measured 30days after non-cardiac surgery.

### Levosimendan for postoperative subclinical heart failure after noncardiac surgery: a randomized, double-blinded, phase III trial [^111FLoBA]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular complications after noncardiac surgery are the most common cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality and still affect 1 of every 33 patients over 45 years. N-terminal brain pro natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a marker for increased myocardial wall strain, commonly increases up to 4- to 5-fold after noncardiac surgery and is independently associated with cardiac complications and mortality –. The underlying reason for this steep increase after noncardiac surgery is still unclear but was interpreted as postoperative subclinical heart failure affecting outcome.

Levosimendan is an intravenous inotropic drug, that binds at troponin C and increases the sensitivity of myofilaments to calcium. The more facilitated actin-myosin complexes increase contractility, without increasing myocardial oxygen demand. The active metabolite of levosimendan acts more than 7 days after a single infusion. Thus, levosimendan might be an optimal drug to improve perioperative myocardial function, possibly leading to a lower release of postoperative NT-proBNP.

Levosimendan significantly increased cardiac output and improved myocardial function. In the SURVIVE (Levosimendan vs. Dobutamine for Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) and the REVIVE I & II (Effect of Levosimendan on the Short-Term Clinical Course of Patients With Acutely Decompensated Heart Failure) trials, levosimendan led to a significant decrease in BNP concentrations up to 1 month after treatment in patients with decompensated heart failure. Based on the previously observed steep increase in postoperative NT-proBNP concentrations, we expected similar effects of levosimendan in patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery, in whom in fact studies are still lacking.

In this work, we tested the hypothesis that a single infusion of levosimendan will lead to a significantly lower release of postoperative NT-proBNP in cardiovascular high-risk patients undergoing moderate- to high-risk major noncardiac surgery as compared to placebo. As our secondary and exploratory aims we evaluated the effect of levosimendan on the incidence of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS), postoperative troponin T release, and postoperative cardiovascular complications.

Secondary and sensitivity analyses

A number of additional analyses were performed to test the robustness of the primary analyses:
To examine whether the risk of adverse outcomes in patients with POAF following non‐cardiac surgery would be similar to that of NVAF. The rate of outcomes in patients with POAF following non‐cardiac surgery was compared with individuals who were diagnosed with non‐surgical NVAF during hospitalization. Patients were included in the latter group if they (i) had not redeemed an antiarrhythmic drug prescription any time prior to hospitalization; (ii) had no history of HF; (iii) were not diagnosed with cancer within 1 year prior to or during hospitalization; (iv) had not redeemed an oral anticoagulation drug prescription in the 6 months prior to hospitalization; (v) had not undergone cardiac surgery any time prior to hospitalization; and (vi) were alive at discharge. Each patient with POAF was matched with three patients with NVAF by age (up to 2 years difference), sex, selected comorbidities (i.e. ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and year of the index date (defined as the discharge date for both groups). The rate of outcomes between groups was compared with Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by the matching (i.e. comparing cases with their matched controls), and adjusted for a history of stroke, peripheral artery disease, liver disease, and malignancy.
The rate of outcomes in patients with POAF following non‐cardiac surgery was compared with an unmatched cohort of patients who did not develop POAF after non‐cardiac surgery. The Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for the variables previously matched upon (i.e. age, sex, selected comorbidities, type of surgery, and year of the index date), in addition to the comorbidities adjusted for in the primary analysis.
To examine whether a possible difference in the risk of incident HF between patients with and without POAF following non‐cardiac surgery was driven by a high incidence of HF early after discharge, a landmark analysis at 90 days was performed. In this analysis, patients were followed from 91 days post‐discharge until incident HF, death, emigration, or end of the study. Only patients who did not have a HF diagnosis and who were alive until day 91 entered the analysis.
The definition of POAF was expanded from AF during hospitalization to AF during hospitalization and up to 30 days post‐discharge (primary or secondary in‐hospital or outpatient diagnosis of AF). Only patients who did not have a HF diagnosis and who were alive until day 31 entered the analysis.
To further ensure the exclusion of all patients with a history of HF, those who redeemed prescriptions for loop diuretics prior to hospitalization for surgery were excluded. The Cox proportional hazards regression models were stratified by the matching (i.e. comparing cases with their matched controls), and adjusted for the comorbidities as in the primary analysis.

Evaluation of the effect of changes in NT-proBNP concentration before surgery

NT-proBNP levels determined at diagnosis of the underlying heart disease or assignment to surgery (median time before surgery: 56.0 [27.9–94.6] days) were available for 4,739 patients. These data were obtained from the referring cardiology departments. The same assay (Roche Diagnostics) was used for these determinations in 99.2% of patients, but as patients were referred from different departments, other tests were used in some cases. A detailed list of the assays used is presented in Supplemental Table 2.

Perioperative hypertension — ACEi/ARB and RAAS inhibitor (RAASi) management: Observational data show patients who stopped their ACEi or ARB 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to have the composite of all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury and intraoperative hypotension versus those who continued, but POISE-3 randomized 7490 patients and did not find a significant difference between discontinuation and maintenance strategies during the operative and immediate perioperative periods. Omitted RAASi before surgery has been shown to reduce intraoperative hypotension, whereas randomized controlled trials have failed to prove continuation or implementation improves clinical outcomes.

Increasing noncardiac surgery volumes globally combined with the growing prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors continues to pose a challenge for anesthesiologists caring for patients in the perioperative period. Forty-five percent of all patients > 45 years old have multiple cardiovascular risk factors, with cardiovascular complications reported in three percent of surgical admissions. In 2024, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, in collaboration with several subspecialty societies, updated the 2014 guidelines on the management of cardiovascular diseases in the perioperative period for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Some of the topics covered include perioperative risk calculators, guidelines for diagnostic testing, perioperative considerations for cardiovascular comorbidities, management of medical therapies, and anesthetic/intraoperative management strategies. Since the guidelines are broad and detailed, this article highlights essential recommendations that are especially relevant to the busy perioperative physician.

Perioperative hypertension — Hypertension in the perioperative period increases the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and bleeding. As many as 25% of patients who undergo major noncardiac surgery and 80% of patients who have cardiac surgery experience perioperative hypertension. In general, the level of risk is related to the severity of the hypertension. Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with increased perioperative and postoperative complications. Certain medications (eg, BB, clonidine) may be associated with rebound hypertension if discontinued abruptly.

### Predictive validity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes in inpatient elective surgery: a population-based study [^1177UZ7f]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

As we recognised that some patients may align with more than one COPD phenotype, we used a priori clinical judgement (i.e. not based on the current study's outcome data) to create a phenotype hierarchy to allow assignment of each patient to the single COPD phenotype that our team postulated would be most prognostically severe. This classification was pre-specified with the following clinical rationale: compared with COPD alone (patients who did not meet criteria for any other phenotype), patients with both asthma and COPD were classified as higher severity as they experience greater symptom burden and worse quality of life. As cardiovascular complications are among the most common complications among surgical patients, and preexisting cardiovascular comorbidity is a risk factor for cardiac complications, COPD with cardiovascular comorbidity was classified as higher risk than both COPD alone and both asthma and COPD. COPD with frequent exacerbations was classified as still higher severity compared with COPD with cardiovascular comorbidity, both asthma and COPD, and COPD alone, as acute exacerbation events can lead to worrisome clinical outcomes including decline in lung function and higher rates of morbidity and mortality. COPD with frailty was classified as higher severity than the preceding phenotypes (COPD with frequent exacerbation, COPD with cardiovascular comorbidity, both asthma and COPD, and COPD alone) because frailty is a state of vulnerability to adverse health outcomes from multidimensional accumulation of age- and disease-related deficits; it more than doubles the risk of perioperative morbidity and disability after surgery. Finally, advanced COPD with home oxygen use was classified as highest severity because it is frequently associated with pulmonary hypertension and diminished survival even in the absence of surgery. Our definition of most severe phenotype for each person was defined as (in increasing severity): COPD alone, both asthma and COPD, COPD with cardiovascular comorbidity, COPD with frequent exacerbation, COPD with frailty, and advanced COPD.

Outcome

The primary outcome was time to death from any cause in the year after surgery. The secondary outcome was time to death within 30 days, to ascertain how the phenotypes predict early outcomes after surgery.

Covariates

We adjusted for variables that might influence the association between COPD phenotype and death. We identified patient characteristics (age, sex) from the RPDB. We extracted procedure type and site of the surgical procedure from the DAD, which has high accuracy. Procedure type was categorised based on type (example, open or minimally invasive) and site (example, upper abdominal). We assigned the Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (SORT), a validated preoperative risk stratification tool designed to predict 30-day mortality in adults after noncardiac surgery.

### Bosentan [^112f7Hz7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.2 Lack of Benefit in Congestive Heart Failure

Bosentan is not effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction. In a pair of studies, 1613 subjects with NYHA Class III-IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, on diuretics, ACE inhibitor, and other therapies, were randomized to placebo or bosentan (62.5 mg twice daily titrated as tolerated to 125 mg twice daily) and followed for up to 70 weeks. Use of bosentan was associated with no benefit on patient global assessment (the primary end point) or mortality. However, hospitalizations for heart failure were more common during the first 4 to 8 weeks after bosentan was initiated. In a placebo-controlled trial of patients with severe chronic heart failure, there was an increased incidence of hospitalization for CHF associated with weight gain and increased leg edema during the first 4 to 8 weeks of treatment with bosentan. Patients required intervention with a diuretic, fluid management, or hospitalization for decompensating heart failure.

### Comprehensive review of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery: prevention, intervention, and long-term management strategies [^116eFbkV]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevention

The prevention of MINS is critical for healthcare providers to decrease the occurrence of serious complications, reduce mortality rates, and improve patient outcomes while enhancing healthcare quality. To adequately impart preventative measures, medical institutions will need to implement the use of preoperative risk assessment tools, optimize cardiovascular risk factors, and utilize pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.

Preoperative risk assessment tools

Preoperative risk assessment tools play a crucial role in identifying high-risk patients, personalizing care plans based on patient histories and risk factors, and assisting with providing comprehensive, standardized evaluations. The most useful preoperative risk assessment tools for MINS include the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP), Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA), and VISION risk calculators.

The RCRI calculator is used to assess the risk of patients over forty-five years of age undergoing cardiac complications during noncardiac surgery. This tool evaluates six main parameters which include high-risk noncardiac surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, suprainguinal vascular surgeries), history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, prior transient ischemic attack or stroke, pre-operative treatment with insulin, and a preoperative creatinine over 2 mg/dL. The RCRI calculator further stratifies patients into four risk classes and estimates the risk of mortality within 30 days of noncardiac surgery. For patients with a score of one or greater for the RCRI calculator, providers can determine the appropriate postoperative cardiac monitoring (e.g. ECG, troponins). While this tool can be useful for determining the risk of MINS, there is limited predictive accuracy due to the assessment developing from retrospective data. Additionally, RCRI does not adequately address all risk factors that could impact patient outcomes. According to a large systematic study conducted by Ford and associates, it was determined that the RCRI assessment was useful for stratifying patients of low risk versus high risk, but it was not useful in predicting cardiac events or death during vascular noncardiac surgeries.

### Long-term risk of heart failure in patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation following non-cardiac surgery: insights from a nationwide cohort [^1142o7MZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Incident heart failure

The median follow‐up time from the index date until death, emigration, or the end of the study period was 7.2 years (25th–75th percentile, 3.3–12.4). The median follow‐up time from the index date until the diagnosis of incident HF was 3.7 (25th–75th percentile, 1.1–7.4) and 5.3 years (25th–75th percentile, 2.1–9.2) in patients with and without POAF following non‐cardiac surgery, respectively. The cumulative incidence of HF according to POAF status is displayed in Figure 2A. During follow‐up, 397 (17.5%) and 690 (10.1%) patients with and without POAF developed HF, respectively. The corresponding incidence rate of HF was 2.6 (95% CI 2.4–2.9) and 1.2 events (95% CI 1.1–1.3) per 100 person‐years, respectively. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, patients with POAF had a higher associated rate of HF compared with those without POAF following non‐cardiac surgery (adjusted HR 2.39, 95% CI 2.06–2.78) (Table 2). Further adjustment for treatment with beta‐blockers and renin–angiotensin system inhibitors yielded similar associations.

Table 2
Outcomes in patients with versus without postoperative atrial fibrillation

When restricting follow‐up to 1 year, similar associations were yielded (Table 2). In pre‐specified subgroup analyses, the association between POAF and incident HF was not modified by sex, a history of ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or chronic kidney disease. However, age did modify the association between POAF and incident HF. Although POAF was associated with a higher rate of incident HF in both patients above and below the median age (i.e. 75 years), the association was stronger in patients less than 75 years of age. The association between POAF and HF was also modified by calendar year. While an association was observed across all three periods examined (i.e. prior to 2001, between 2001 and 2010, and after 2010), the association was stronger after 2010 (online supplementary Table S5).

We then investigated the association between changes in NT-proBNP levels before surgery and postoperative outcomes. We compared NT-proBNP concentrations at the time of diagnosis of the underlying heart disease or at the time at which the decision to perform surgery was made with those obtained 1 day before the surgery. Preoperative improvements in NT-proBNP-based risk category were clearly associated with a lower risk of perioperative complications and lower mortality at 30 days and 5 years. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies demonstrating beneficial effects of decreasing BNP concentration on cardiovascular events in patients with heart failure.

Our findings suggest that at least patients with NT-proBNP concentrations > 3,000 ng/L should undergo a preoperative optimization of medical treatment by heart failure specialists to improve their perioperative outcomes. Further risk stratification within the intermediate NT-proBNP range could enhance clinical value, highlighting the need for future prospective studies to refine NT-proBNP-based risk thresholds in surgical populations. In addition, prospective studies are required to determine whether active efforts to decrease preoperative NT-proBNP levels actually lead to an improvement in perioperative and postoperative outcomes. It also remains to be determined which patients gain the most benefit from decreases in preoperative NT-proBNP concentration, since the absence of a detailed echocardiographic assessment of diastolic function limits the ability to fully differentiate between pathophysiological states such as diastolic dysfunction or volume overload. Nevertheless, our findings indicate that the effect of passing into a lower NT-proBNP risk category is not directly dependent on surgical procedure, being instead associated with preoperative patient characteristics. Clinical programs focusing on the preoperative optimization of patients undergoing cardiac surgery may therefore have benefits for both short- and long-term outcomes.

According to current guidelines, all patients, including those with heart failure, should be on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) before surgery. The EXCEL trial reported a clear improvement of clinical outcomes in patients on GDMT undergoing PCI or CABG. However, this trial also revealed that only 29% of the patients were on GDMT before the revascularization procedure. These figures probably reflect the clinical reality. Our data should therefore strongly encourage clinicians to enforce preoperative GDMT in all patients, including measuring preoperative NT-proBNP levels, with the aim of improving outcomes after cardiac surgery. Importantly, while our findings suggest an association between preoperative NT-proBNP reduction and improved outcomes, the mechanisms underlying this improvement remain unclear. Given the retrospective design of our study and lack of detailed data on preoperative medical interventions, causality cannot be inferred. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these observations and clarify whether targeted preoperative optimization can directly influence biomarker levels and clinical outcomes.

Guideline awareness

The primary findings regarding guideline awareness are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. Our survey indicated that HFCs are more familiar with the guidelines compared to GCs and OPs. Specifically, 84% of HFCs described themselves as 'knowledgeable or very knowledgeable', compared to 57% of GCs and 62% of OPs (p < 0.001), and 76% 'regularly or always' use ESC/HFA criteria to identify AdHF, compared to 44% of GCs and 48% of OPs (p < 0.001). Conversely, 43% of GCs and 38% of OPs rated their guideline knowledge as 'average' or lower, leading to the occasional or rarer use of the ESC/HFA definition for identifying AdHF patients in 56% and 52% for GCs and OPs, respectively.

Figure 1
Self‐assessment of knowledge (A) and utilization (B) of 2021 European Society of Cardiology/Heart Failure Association (/guidelines for advanced heart failure (HF).

Figure 2
Assessment of guideline awareness according to cardiology subspecialty. According to the 2021 European Society of Cardiology/Heart Failure Association (ESC/HFA) heart failure (HF) guidelines, heart transplantation is recommended for patients with advanced HF who are refractory to medical/device therapy and do not have absolute contraindications (Class I). Long‐term mechanical circulatory support (MCS) should be considered in patients with advanced HF with reduced ejection fraction despite optimal medical and device therapy, who are not eligible for heart transplantation or other surgical options, and without severe right ventricular dysfunction, to reduce the risk of death and improve symptoms (Class IIa). Long‐term MCS should also be considered in patients with advanced HF with reduced ejection fraction refractory to optimal medical and device therapy as a bridge to cardiac transplantation to improve symptoms, reduce the risk of HF hospitalization, and lower the risk of premature death (Class IIa).

The evaluation of the recommendation class associated with AdHF therapy in the latest guidelines showed a similar distribution. Adequate response rates concerning the recommendation class were 84%, 55%, and 60% for heart transplantation (p < 0.0001); 69%, 65%, and 55% for MCS as a bridge to transplantation (p = 0.018); and 65%, 52%, and 49% for MCS as destination therapy (p = 0.0003) among HFCs, GCs, and OPs, respectively (Figure 2).

STAT categories, the STS-ACHS score and Brompton PEACH score have all been utilized for ACHD surgical risk-prediction. We explored the utility of these risk-prediction tools in our 30 year experience, with an emphasis on the most recent 5 years, given the evolving nature of ACHD surgery.

Methods

1109 ACHD operations (1995–2024) at a single institution were analyzed for in-hospital mortality and time-related survival using logistic regression and multiphase parametric modeling, focusing on STAT, ACHS and PEACH scores, in addition to > 400 patient-specific variables. Final variable selection was guided by bootstrap bagging. Sub-analyses focused on the current era 2019–2024.

Results

Full cohort N = 1109: In-hospital mortality was 1.4% (16/1109). A late-phase hazard for death emerges at ∼15 years and 20-year survival was 81 ± 3%. Versus PEACH reference cohort, our experience included more revision, Fontan and heart failure surgery (including 82 operations related to advanced therapies). Nevertheless, PEACH showed good discrimination (AUC .78, P < .0001) versus STAT or ACHS, although significantly over-estimated mortality (O/E ∼0.5). PEACH was a strong independent determinant of time-related survival (P < .0001). Other independent predictors included endocarditis (IE), heart failure, > 4 prior sternotomies, social concerns, pre-op inotropes and cyanosis. Nature of surgical procedures did NOT feature strongly in risk. Current era N = 311 (2019–2024): had worse/more: AHA anatomy/physiology grade, single RV, IE, prior sternotomies, urgent surgery, heart failure and extensive surgical reconstructions (all P = .007-.0001), though in-hospital mortality was not different (1.9%, 6/311; p = 0.41). PEACH (AUC .79, P = .04) was superior to STAT or ACHS for predicting in-hospital mortality. However, the perioperative mortality estimate given by an ACHD surgeon (POME) to patients pre-operatively provided the best discrimination in the current era. PEACH and POME (P = .0004) predicted time-related survival; other independent predictors = lost to follow-up, infection, heart failure, > 4 prior sternotomies, social concerns, inotropes, Fontan physiology and cyanosis. Nature of surgical procedures did NOT predict risk well.

Conclusions

ACHD surgery in quaternary centers is increasingly major revision, endocarditis and heart failure surgery, hampering conventional risk-prediction models based on procedure. Non-procedural patient-specific circumstances strongly predict risk; as such, individual clinicians' risk-prediction can out-perform validated risk models.

### A two-centre study investigating the association between brain natriuretic peptides&outcomes in continuous flow left ventricular assist device recipients [^1122bDot]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Post-LVAD heart failure care

At both centers (TGH and RH), patients received standard heart failure care post-LVAD insertion. At TGH, patients were prescribed maximumtolerated guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) such as, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRA), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) and sildenafil. Of note, there is decreased use of angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) at the TGH due to patients having undergone a recent hospitalization and high risk surgery. Furthermore, patients that are bridged to HTx do not receive ARNI at TGH to reduce risk of vasoplegia at the time of HTx. At the RH, patients received maximally tolerated beta-blocker, MRA, and ACEi or ARB.

At both institutions, all patients underwent an echo-guided ramp study to adjust LVAD speeds to ensure adequate left ventricular unloading (e.g. reduce left ventricular size and mitral regurgitation) and permit aortic valve opening intermittently. The latter occurs prior to patient discharge (TGH), 3 months post-discharge (RH) and then annually (TGH and RH), thereafter.

Classification of outcomes

Outcomes observed after discharge from the index LVAD implant hospitalization were classified into the following groups:

Acute decompensated HF hospitalization– defined as any hospitalization that was documented in the patient chart as acute decompensated heart failure, new or worsening shortness of breath, or volume overload.
All-cause mortality.
Cardiac transplantation.
Composite end-point of first hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure and mortality.

Admissions for implantation of ICD, AICD pulse generator change, and heart transplantation were excluded. In patients undergoing heart transplant or LVAD explant, follow-up was censored at the time of intervention as the patient was alive.

### Metoprolol succinate [^114gmeHT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.3 Heart Failure

MERIT-HF was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets in which 3,991 patients with ejection fraction ≤ 0.40 and NYHA Class II-IV heart failure attributable to ischemia, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy were randomized 1:1 to metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets or placebo. The protocol excluded patients with contraindications to beta-blocker use, those expected to undergo heart surgery, and those within 28 days of myocardial infarction or unstable angina. The primary endpoints of the trial were (1) all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization (time to first event) and (2) all-cause mortality. Patients were stabilized on optimal concomitant therapy for heart failure, including diuretics, ACE inhibitors, cardiac glycosides, and nitrates. At randomization, 41% of patients were NYHA Class II; 55% NYHA Class III; 65% of patients had heart failure attributed to ischemic heart disease; 44% had a history of hypertension; 25% had diabetes mellitus; 48% had a history of myocardial infarction. Among patients in the trial, 90% were on diuretics, 89% were on ACE inhibitors, 64% were on digitalis, 27% were on a lipid-lowering agent, 37% were on an oral anticoagulant, and the mean ejection fraction was 0.28. The mean duration of follow-up was one year. At the end of the study, the mean daily dose of metoprolol succinate extended-release tablets was 159 mg.

The trial was terminated early for a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (34%, nominal p = 0.00009). The risk of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization was reduced by 19% (p = 0.00012). The trial also showed improvements in heart failure-related mortality and heart failure-related hospitalizations, and NYHA functional class.

The table below shows the principal results for the overall study population. The figure below illustrates principal results for a wide variety of subgroup comparisons, including US vs. non-US populations (the latter of which was not pre-specified). The combined endpoints of all-cause mortality plus all-cause hospitalization and of mortality plus heart failure hospitalization showed consistent effects in the overall study population and the subgroups. Nonetheless, subgroup analyses can be difficult to interpret and it is not known whether these represent true differences or chance effects.

### Association of age and frailty with the development of adverse events following carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic patients [^1172Bgaw]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

As carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is increasingly utilized for older adults, identification of risk factors in this cohort is critical. Frailty is increasingly recognized as a significant predictor of adverse surgical outcomes, yet contemporary associations with CEA outcomes in asymptomatic patients remains underexplored on a national scale.

Methods

All adults (≥ 18) with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis undergoing elective CEA were identified from the 2013–2022 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Files. Frailty was defined using the validated 5-factor modified frailty index (dependent functional status, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure), with patients scoring ≥ 2 classified as Frail (others: non-Frail). Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations of age and frailty status with major adverse events (MAE: death, stroke, or myocardial infarction) within 30 days, prolonged length of stay (≥ 2 postoperative days), non-home discharge, and unplanned readmission within 30 days.

Results

Of 18,887 CEA patients, 7,207 (38.2%) were Frail. Frail patients demonstrated increased MAE rates (3.5% vs. 1.9%, P < 0.001) and greater resource use. After adjustment, frailty was linked with increased odds of MAE (AOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.29–1.98), prolonged length of stay (AOR 1.31, CI 1.21–1.41), non-home discharge (AOR 1.83, CI 1.40–2.39), and unplanned readmission (AOR 1.64, CI 1.41–1.92). Following marginal analysis of age and frailty, frailty remained associated with a higher risk-adjusted probability of major adverse events.

Conclusion

Irrespective of age, frail patients exhibited concerning rates of major adverse events. If future studies confirm these findings, prophylactic CEA in this vulnerable population should be carefully reconsidered.

### Remote pulmonary artery pressure-guided management of patients with heart failure: a clinical consensus statement of the heart failure association (HFA) of the ESC [^116zYfsc]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Patients with cardiac transplantation and left ventricular assist device

Despite maximal GDMT and haemodynamic‐guided care, clinical disease progression occurs in HF patients, in many cases requiring LVADs or heart transplant. LVAD has been an increasingly utilized therapy for advanced HF and resulted in improvements in patient functional status and QoL, in addition to improved clinical outcomes relative to medical therapy. There is a potentially important clinical role for remote haemodynamic monitoring in clinical decision‐making and patient management before and after LVAD implantation.

A sub‐analysis of the CHAMPION trial suggested utility in using these devices to improve the timing of LVAD implantation, although further information is needed in this area. These patients who are not yet sick enough to warrant an LVAD but have an elevated PAP may require more frequent monitoring and medical adjustments in order to prevent decompensation and/or consider earlier LVAD implantation.

Using haemodynamic information leads to better optimization and better decongestion and unloading of the right ventricle, potentially reducing the risk of right ventricular failure after LVAD implantation. Also, changes in diastolic PAP after LVAD implantation might indicate potential post‐operative complications. The ability to remotely and non‐invasively monitor PAP is attractive in a population of HF patients who are not only on anticoagulation, but also supported by mechanical circulatory support with a propensity for bleeding. Moreover, early detection of changes in PAP and heart rate by CardioMEMS can alert clinicians to the pre‐clinical phase of complications like gastrointestinal bleeding, common in LVAD patients. Another advantage of remote monitoring is the ability to distinguish a subset of patients who may have reversible pulmonary hypertension from those who have a fixed component that does not respond to pharmacological or mechanical interventions. This may be especially valuable for patients receiving an LVAD as a bridge to transplant eligibility in the presence of pulmonary hypertension.

In the largest, prospective observational study of patients with continuous‐flow LVAD and implantable haemodynamic PAP monitoring devices, the CardioMEMS system was able to provide a longitudinal haemodynamic profile with a high degree of patient compliance. Relatively modest reductions in diastolic PAP (3–5 mmHg) were associated with significant improvements in functional capacity. Furthermore, among patients whose diastolic PAP was maintained less than 20 mmHg, fewer HF hospitalizations were observed. Additional studies have demonstrated that haemodynamic optimization using ramp protocols is associated with reduced hospitalizations and improved functional capacity in LVAD patients. However, ramp studies reflect conditions at a single time point. By contrast, the CardioMEMS system can provide a longitudinal haemodynamic profile of patients supported with LVADs.

### Predictive factors for pulmonary embolism in patients undergoing metabolic and bariatric surgery: insights from the latest MBSAQIP data [^112Jr1zs]. Obesity Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is a major risk factor for many diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, among others. While metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is an effective treatment, pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a concern due to factors like Virchow's triad exacerbated by excess adipose tissue. This study aims to identify perioperative risk factors for PE in patients undergoing MBS to help reduce its incidence.

Methods

This study retrospectively analyzed the MBSAQIP PUF database of the year 2023 to identify risk factors for PE within 30 days of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).

Results

A total of 200865 MBS patients (133,620 SG, 67,245 RYGB) were included in the study; the incidence of 30-day postoperative PE was 0.1% for SG and 0.12% for RYGB. For SG, significant PE risk factors included age, BMI, Black/African American race, history of PE, immunosuppressive therapy, and heart failure. For RYGB, risk factors were age, Black/African American race, history of PE/VTE, dialysis, need for surgical conversion, and mechanical-only VTE prophylaxis.

Conclusion

PE is a rare but potentially fatal post-bariatric surgery complication. The most important risk factor was previous history of thromboembolic events in both cohorts. Individualized risk assessment requires further prospective studies.

### Optimizing pre-to-post discharge transition of care in patients hospitalized for heart failure-part 3 of the international expert opinion series on acute heart failure management [^1138tQTh]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Hospitalization for heart failure (HF) represents a pivotal event in the disease course, often signaling decompensation and an elevated risk of readmission, mortality, and functional decline. Despite advances in inpatient management, the transition from hospital to home remains a vulnerable period characterized by residual congestion, incomplete implementation of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), unmanaged comorbidities, and fragmented care coordination. This expert consensus provides a comprehensive, evidence-based framework to optimize the pre-to-post discharge transition in patients hospitalized with HF. Key priorities include confirmation of decongestion using biomarkers, lung ultrasound, and validated risk scores; in-hospital initiation and up-titration of foundational GDMT; and identification of reversible etiologies such as ischemic heart disease. Early evaluation for device therapy, arrhythmia management, including anticoagulation and rhythm control in atrial fibrillation, and structured management of comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, COPD, iron deficiency, frailty, and depression are emphasized. Multidisciplinary collaboration across pharmacy, rehabilitation, mental health, and social services is essential to support safe discharge and continuity of care. Proactive strategies such as medication reconciliation, simplified dosing regimens, caregiver engagement, and attention to social determinants of health are critical to improving adherence and preventing avoidable readmissions. Early post-discharge follow-up (ideally within 7 days), remote monitoring, and ongoing GDMT optimization are central to management during the high-risk vulnerable phase. Cardiac rehabilitation, timely evaluation for advanced therapies, and integration of palliative care complete the continuum of care. This consensus proposes a structured, patient-centered approach that bridges inpatient stabilization with longitudinal outpatient management to reduce rehospitalizations, improve clinical outcomes, and enhance quality of life for patients living with HF.

### Itraconazole (Tolsura) [^113bPqrf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Congestive Heart Failure

TOLSURA can cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure (CHF) [see Boxed Warning and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. For patients with evidence of ventricular dysfunction such as CHF, history or risk factors for CHF, physicians should carefully review the risks and benefits of TOLSURA therapy. These risk factors include cardiac disease such as ischemic and valvular disease; significant pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and renal failure and other edematous disorders. Inform such patients of the signs and symptoms of CHF and monitor carefully for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment. If signs or symptoms of CHF appear or worsen during administration of TOLSURA, reassess the benefit-risk of continuing treatment.

When itraconazole was administered intravenously to anesthetized dogs, a dose-related negative inotropic effect was demonstrated. In a healthy volunteer study of itraconazole intravenous infusion, transient, asymptomatic decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction were observed using gated SPECT imaging; these resolved before the next infusion, 12 hours later.

Itraconazole has been associated with reports of CHF, peripheral edema, and pulmonary edema. In post-marketing experience, heart failure was more frequently reported in patients receiving higher total daily doses of itraconazole of 400 mg although there were also cases reported among those receiving lower total daily doses [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Calcium channel blockers can have negative inotropic effects which may be additive to those of itraconazole. In addition, itraconazole can inhibit the metabolism of calcium channel blockers. Therefore, when co-administering itraconazole and calcium channel blockers, monitor carefully for signs and symptoms of CHF during treatment due to an increased risk of CHF. Concomitant administration of TOLSURA and felodipine or nisoldipine is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1), Drug Interactions (7.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.2)]

5.2 Hepatotoxicity

Itraconazole has been associated with cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver failure and death. Some of these cases had neither pre-existing liver disease nor a serious underlying medical condition, and some of these cases developed within the first week of treatment. If clinical signs or symptoms develop that are consistent with liver disease, discontinue treatment and perform testing for liver disease. Continued TOLSURA use or reinstitution of treatment with TOLSURA is strongly discouraged unless there is a serious or life-threatening situation where the expected benefit exceeds the risk [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Dronedarone (Multaq) [^112HVMpi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Death in NYHA Class IV or Decompensated Heart Failure

MULTAQ is contraindicated in patients with NYHA Class IV heart failure or symptomatic heart failure with recent decompensation requiring hospitalization because it doubles the risk of death.

5.2 Cardiovascular Death and Heart Failure in Permanent AF

MULTAQ doubles the risk of cardiovascular death (largely arrhythmic) and heart failure events in patients with permanent AF. Patients treated with dronedarone should undergo monitoring of cardiac rhythm no less often than every 3 months. Cardiovert patients who are in atrial fibrillation (if clinically indicated) or discontinue MULTAQ. MULTAQ offers no benefit in subjects in permanent AF.

5.3	Increased Risk of Stroke in Permanent AF

In a placebo-controlled study in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, dronedarone was associated with an increased risk of stroke, particularly in the first two weeks of therapy [see Clinical Studies (14.4)]. MULTAQ should only be initiated in patients in sinus rhythm who are receiving appropriate antithrombotic therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

5.4 New Onset or Worsening Heart Failure

New onset or worsening of heart failure has been reported during treatment with MULTAQ in the postmarketing setting. In a placebo-controlled study in patients with permanent AF increased rates of heart failure were observed in patients with normal left ventricular function and no history of symptomatic heart failure, as well as those with a history of heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction.

Advise patients to consult a physician if they develop signs or symptoms of heart failure, such as weight gain, dependent edema, or increasing shortness of breath. If heart failure develops or worsens and requires hospitalization, discontinue MULTAQ.

### Predictive validity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes in inpatient elective surgery: a population-based study [^112z8zhK]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Study participants

All patients living in Ontario and diagnosed with COPD were included if they underwent any of the following intermediate-to-high-risk elective surgical procedures between April 2005 and March 2019 (Supplementary Fig. S1): carotid endarterectomy, open or endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, peripheral arterial bypass, total hip replacement, total knee replacement, shoulder replacement surgery, colectomy, partial liver resection, pancreaticoduodenectomy, gastrectomy, oesophagectomy, nephrectomy, cystectomy, prostatectomy, or hysterectomy. We restricted the cohort to patients aged 65 yr or older because older adults have a higher prevalence of COPD, and because our databases capture prescription drug dispensing only in patients aged 65 yr or older. Physician-diagnosed COPD was ascertained using a validated definition of one or more ambulatory visits or hospitalisations for COPD (sensitivity 85%, specificity 78%). We included the first surgery for patients who underwent multiple procedures.

Primary exposure: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes

Though numerous clinical COPD phenotypes have been described in the literature, certain phenotypes recur. Our candidate subtypes included previously defined phenotypes with validated definitions in our linked databases. Patients with both asthma and COPD were defined as individuals who met criteria for both asthma and COPD. COPD with cardiovascular comorbidity was defined as patients who also met definitions of heart failure, myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation based on validated algorithms, or International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision diagnostic codes in the DAD for coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral vascular disease. Advanced COPD was defined based on the requirement of home oxygen before index surgery. COPD with frequent exacerbations were those with two or more COPD exacerbations (including outpatient exacerbations, emergency department visits or hospitalisations) in the 2 yr before index surgery. COPD with frailty was defined as those with frailty based on a validated score of ≥ 0.21 on the preoperative frailty index. Individuals not meeting any other phenotype were assigned to COPD alone, the reference criteria.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^117REDHR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Preoperative management of cirrhosis-related decompensations — elective surgery planning should maintain routine cirrhosis care and continue key therapies. The guideline states: "Remaining current with routine cirrhosis-related management prior to elective surgery, including hepatocellular carcinoma screening, optimization of ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, variceal screening and/or bleeding prophylaxis, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis when indicated, may mitigate operative risk". It further specifies that "Patients with hepatic encephalopathy should have lactulose and/or rifaximin continued through the perioperative period, with close attention to serum sodium and minimization of medications that may exacerbate encephalopathy", and that "Patients taking nonselective beta blockers (NSBBs, e.g., carvedilol) for CSPH or secondary prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding should continue these medications in the peri-operative period, provided that the systolic blood pressure is over 90 mm Hg". For unclear variceal status, "upper endoscopy should be performed and NSBBs or band ligation should be pursued for large varices or medium varices with high-risk stigmata", and "Hepatocellular carcinoma screening should be up-to-date, especially as diagnosis of liver cancer may affect surgical decision-making and transplant consideration in selected patients".

### Cardiac rhythm devices in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction-role, timing, and optimal use in contemporary practice. European journal of heart failure expert consensus document [^113hSDw8]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Timing of referral for implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator implantation: the need for an individualized approach

Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator therapy is part of guideline‐directed and evidence‐based care and should not be delayed. The timing of ICD implantation may vary according to patient characteristics. After initiation of GDMT, patients may have improved LVEF and left ventricular volumes, with LVEF reassessment helping to determine device indications. The ESC HF guidelines recommend the consideration of ICD after 3 months of treatment with GDMTwhile US HF guidelines do not specify a certain time frame and underscore the individualization of ICD timing. The urgency of ICD implementation should be determined based on an individualized assessment of SCD risk.

Implantable cardioverter‐defibrillator implantation may be considered earlier than 3 months after GDMT initiation in patients with a high risk of VAs and SCD (e.g. patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy), with very low LVEF (i.e. LVEF < 20%), with irreversible aetiologies (e.g. recurrent myocardial infarction), with extensive myocardial scarring, or with a low likelihood of recovery of LVEF to > 35% (very low LVEF along with advanced and long‐standing HF with marked left ventricular remodelling).

Furthermore, certain patients – especially those with advanced HF and/or patients with hypoperfusion – may not tolerate initiation and up‐titration of medical therapies despite attempts. An indicated ICD should not be delayed in these patients as they are at very high risk for SCD.

### The impact of thyroid function on surgical prognosis in patients undergoing cardiac and major vascular surgeries [^112nikFR]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac and major vascular surgeries are among the most complex and high-risk procedures in modern medicine, often associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These surgeries require meticulous preoperative planning, intraoperative precision, and comprehensive postoperative care to improve outcomes. Although surgical techniques and perioperative management have advanced significantly, the incidence of adverse events remains a significant concern. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence postoperative outcomes is crucial for improving patient care and prognosis.

One such factor that has garnered increasing attention is thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid hormones play a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including metabolism, cardiovascular function, and overall systemic homeostasis. These hormones are integral to the proper functioning of multiple organ systems, ensuring that metabolic rates are optimized and cardiovascular operations are stable. Recent research has highlighted the significance of preoperative thyroid function assessment as a predictor of surgical risk. Studies have shown that both overt and subclinical thyroid dysfunction are linked to an increased incidence of adverse events, including arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and extended hospital stays post-surgery. For example, Park et al. reported that patients with hypothyroidism undergoing cardiac surgery were more likely to develop postoperative atrial fibrillation and heart failure compared to euthyroid patients. Similarly, hyperthyroidism is also associated with increased perioperative risks, such as tachyarrhythmias and hemodynamic instability. Patients with untreated or poorly controlled hyperthyroidism are at a higher risk of developing significant cardiovascular complications during surgery. In the perioperative period, the stress of surgery can exacerbate thyrotoxic symptoms, increasing the risk of a thyroid storm. Hemodynamic instability in hyperthyroid patients typically results from increased cardiac output, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and enhanced sensitivity to catecholamines, which complicates anesthesia and surgical management.

However, there is a paucity of comprehensive data examining this relationship in the context of cardiac and major vascular surgeries. This study aims to investigate the association between thyroid function (including preoperative, postoperative, and preoperative-to-postoperative changes) and surgical outcomes, offering valuable thyroid-related insights for improving the prognosis of patients undergoing these high-risk surgeries.

### Vecuronium bromide [^117Wdm5G]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Since allergic cross-reactivity has been reported in this class, request information from your patients about previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, inform your patients that severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including vecuronium bromide have been reported.

Renal Failure

Vecuronium is well tolerated without clinically significant prolongation of neuromuscular blocking effect in patients with renal failure who have been optimally prepared for surgery by dialysis. Under emergency conditions in anephric patients, some prolongation of neuromuscular blockade may occur; therefore, if anephric patients cannot be prepared for non-elective surgery, a lower initial dose of vecuronium should be considered.

Altered Circulation Time

Conditions associated with slower circulation time in cardiovascular disease, old age, edematous states resulting in increased volume of distribution may contribute to delay in onset time; therefore, dosage should not be increased.

Hepatic Disease

Experience in patients with cirrhosis or cholestasis has revealed prolonged recovery time in keeping with the role the liver plays in vecuronium metabolism and excretion (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY- Pharmacokinetics). Data currently available do not permit dosage recommendations in patients with impaired liver function.

### Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): advances and challenges [^111TQNGN]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Clinical profile of HFpEF subjects.

Figure 3
Comorbidities potentially involved in the development of HFpEF. Iron deficiency, diabetes mellitus, obesity, renal failure, hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension increase the risk of HFpEF through structural and functional cardiac change and systemic inflammation (Reproduced with permission from).

Current practice guidelines have included consideration of the natural history of each disease state. With the reclassification of HF into preserved EF (HFpEF), mid‐range EF (HFmrEF), and reduced EF (HFrEF), HF categories form a continuum. Thus, HFmrEF will share some features with HFpEF and HFrEF, and the behavior at the ends of each adjoining range may overlap with the next category. Current day classification of HF overall also defines stages in the HF lifecycle from A to D. These range from an at‐risk population (Stage A), to pre‐HF (Stage B), symptomatic HF (Stage C), and advanced HF (Stage D). Most of the discussion in this review will focus on Stages C and D, but increasing interest is emerging on the role of AF treatment strategy on HF Stages B and C.

The evolution of the modern classification of AF has emerged from a consensus document of international societies of arrhythmology. It was previously based on AF episode duration, ability to self‐terminate or requiring interventions for termination, or failure to successfully terminate and revert to stable sinus rhythm with interventions. Rather than a classification of AF events, a newer proposal defines four stages of the AF lifecycle and mirrors the HF terminology. Stage 1 of the life cycle includes those at risk for AF with or without modifiable comorbid conditions that confer risk. Stage 2, referred to as pre‐AF, includes individuals with structural or electrical abnormalities that predispose a patient to AF. Stage 3 includes three categories of manifest AF. Stage 3A, which was previously defined as paroxysmal AF, includes AF episodes that self‐terminate within 7 days. Stage 3B, which is commonly referred to as persistent AF, includes AF episodes not self‐terminating within 7 days and requiring intervention for termination. Stage 3C includes long‐standing persistent AF, defined as an episode duration of > 12 months. Stage 3D in the life cycle refers to successfully ablated (surgically or percutaneously) AF subjects. Stage 4 in the AF life cycle is defined as a condition of permanent AF when no further efforts at rhythm control are undertaken after agreement between the patient and clinician.

### Digoxin [^112eMdGz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Chronic Heart Failure

Two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies enrolled 178 (RADIANCE trial) and 88 (PROVED trial) adult patients with NYHA Class II or III heart failure previously treated with oral digoxin, a diuretic, and an ACE inhibitor (RADIANCE only) and randomized them to placebo or treatment with digoxin tablets. Both trials demonstrated better preservation of exercise capacity in patients randomized to digoxin. Continued treatment with digoxin reduced the risk of developing worsening heart failure, as evidenced by heart failure-related hospitalizations and emergency care and the need for concomitant heart failure therapy.

DIG Trial of Digoxin in Patients with Heart Failure

The Digitalis Investigation Group (DIG) main trial was a 37-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind mortality study comparing digoxin to placebo in 6800 adult patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 0.45. At randomization, 67% were NYHA class I or II, 71% had heart failure of ischemic etiology, 44% had been receiving digoxin, and most were receiving a concomitant ACE inhibitor (94%) and diuretics (82%). As in the smaller trials described above, patients who had been receiving open-label digoxin were withdrawn from this treatment before randomization. Randomization to digoxin was again associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of hospitalization, whether scored as number of hospitalizations for heart failure (relative risk 75%), risk of having at least one such hospitalization during the trial (RR 72%), or number of hospitalizations for any cause (RR 94%). On the other hand, randomization to digoxin had no apparent effect on mortality (RR 99%, with confidence limits of 91 to 107%).

### Bupivacaine and meloxicam (Zynrelef) [^116Cb6u9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular (CV) Thrombotic Events with NSAID Use

Clinical trials of several COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events, including myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, which can be fatal. Based on available data, it is unclear that the risk for CV thrombotic events is similar for all NSAIDs. The relative increase in serious CV thrombotic events over baseline conferred by NSAID use appears to be similar in those with and without known CV disease or risk factors for CV disease. However, patients with known CV disease or risk factors had a higher absolute incidence of excess serious CV thrombotic events, due to their increased baseline rate. Some observational studies found that this increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events began as early as the first weeks of treatment. The increase in CV thrombotic risk has been observed most consistently at higher doses. The risk of these events following single-dose local application of ZYNRELEF is uncertain.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse CV event in NSAID-treated patients, do not exceed the recommended dose. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of such events following treatment with ZYNRELEF, even in the absence of previous CV symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur.

There is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events associated with NSAID use. The concurrent use of aspirin and an NSAID, such as meloxicam, increases the risk of serious gastrointestinal (GI) events [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery

Two large, controlled clinical trials of a COX-2 selective NSAID for the treatment of pain in the first 10–14 days following CABG surgery found an increased incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke. ZYNRELEF is contraindicated in the setting of CABG [see Contraindications (4)].

### Spironolactone [^116SCsHm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Heart Failure

Spironolactone oral suspension is indicated for treatment of NYHA Class III-IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in adult patients to increase survival, manage edema, and to reduce the need for hospitalization for heart failure.

Spironolactone oral suspension is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies.

1.2 Hypertension

Spironolactone oral suspension is indicated as an add-on therapy for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure in adult patients who are not adequately controlled on other agents. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g. on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^115oTQJe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Liver transplant candidates — timing and setting for bariatric surgery: In potential liver transplantation candidates with indications for bariatric surgery, sleeve gastrectomy is the preferred approach because it preserves endoscopic access to the biliary tree, avoids malabsorption-related issues for immunosuppression medications, and poses less operative risk as compared with RYGB. Data to inform optimal timing are sparse, but bariatric surgery before liver transplant is generally safe in patients with MELD scores and compensated cirrhosis, and surgery should ideally be performed at an experienced, high-volume center; bariatric surgery at the time of liver transplant may be considered in selected patients at experienced centers, inclusive of those with high MELD scores that would otherwise preclude safe bariatric surgery before transplantation. After transplantation, retrospective single-center studies demonstrate significant postoperative weight loss and improvement in metabolic comorbidities, but this is balanced against longer operative times, higher risk of ICU stay, higher rates of early postoperative complications, and other disadvantages including higher reoperation rate and increased postoperative morbidity.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^112RNz4k]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

This guideline presents a comprehensive approach to perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis. Recognizing the unique surgical risks in this population, the guideline emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach to preoperative evaluation, perioperative care, and postoperative follow-up. Key considerations include the severity of liver disease, nonhepatic comorbidities, and surgery-specific factors, with an emphasis on the use of validated cirrhosis-specific risk calculators, such as the VOCAL-Penn Score, for individualized risk stratification. Recommendations highlight preoperative optimization strategies, including nutritional support, management of portal hypertension, correction of hemostatic abnormalities, and addressing frailty and sarcopenia. For patients with decompensated cirrhosis, interventions such as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt may reduce portal pressure and surgical risks when indicated. Elective surgeries, including cholecystectomy and hernia repair, are advised for select patients with compensated cirrhosis, whereas alternatives to surgery are explored for high-risk patients. The guideline underscores the importance of performing surgeries at high-volume centers with expertise in managing patients with cirrhosis and emphasizes shared decision-making informed by objective risk assessments. Furthermore, it addresses procedure-specific considerations, including the role of bariatric and cardiac surgeries in cirrhotic patients. Through evidence-based recommendations and expert insights, this guideline aims to enhance surgical outcomes and inform clinical decision-making in a growing population of patients with cirrhosis undergoing surgery.

### Hetastarch (hextend) [^113N9jpT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In a retrospective observational study, 606 adult patients underwent open heart surgery in association with cardiopulmonary bypass. Until July 2013 they received an HES product (N = 247) both as pump prime (1500 mL) and intraoperative fluid replacement (1000 mL), but only crystalloid (N = 359) from August 2013 onward. The frequency (percent) of postoperative AKI was higher in patients receiving HES (N = 53; 21.5%) than those receiving crystalloid (N = 34; 9.5%). Surgical revision for rebleeding also was higher for HES (N = 11; 4.6%) than for crystalloid (N = 5; 1.4%).18

In a meta-analysis of RCTs (n = 15) in adult subjects (N = 4409) undergoing surgery who received an HES product, significantly more HES subjects (83/2157; 3.8%) than controls (56/2252; 2.5%) underwent RRT (relative risk, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04, 2.01).19

In a retrospective observational study of adult blunt and penetrating trauma patients, use of an HES product was a significant independent predictor of AKI after blunt trauma, but not penetrating trauma, in multiple logistic regression analysis. In separate logistic regression models, HES also was a significant predictor of mortality after blunt trauma but not penetrating trauma.20

In a retrospective observational study of severely injured adult blunt (89%) and penetrating (11%) trauma patients (N = 413) admitted to the ICU, 103 patients developed AKI within the first week of ICU admission. AKI was associated with increased 30-day (17.5% versus 5.8%, AKI versus non-AKI cohorts, respectively) and 1-year mortality (26.2% versus 7.1%). Univariate and multivariable regression analyses of prespecified risk factors for AKI found that volume loading using an HES product was independently associated with postinjury AKI within the first 24 hours.21

Postmarketing Experience

Because adverse reactions are reported voluntarily post-approval from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causal relationship to product exposure.

### Flecainide acetate [^115k8Sv5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The relatively high frequency of proarrhythmic events in patients with sustained VT and serious underlying heart disease, and the need for careful titration and monitoring, requires that therapy of patients with sustained VT be started in the hospital. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

HEART FAILURE

Flecainide acetate has a negative inotropic effect and may cause or worsen CHF, particularly in patients with cardiomyopathy, preexisting severe heart failure (NYHA functional class III or IV) or low ejection fractions (less than 30%). In patients with supraventricular arrhythmias new or worsened CHF developed in 0.4% (1/225) of patients. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia during a mean duration of 7.9 months of flecainide acetate therapy, 6.3% (20/317) developed new CHF. In patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia and a history of CHF, during a mean duration of 5.4 months of flecainide acetate therapy, 25.7% (78/304) developed worsened CHF. Exacerbation of preexisting CHF occurred more commonly in studies which included patients with class III or IV failure than in studies which excluded such patients. Flecainide acetate should be used cautiously in patients who are known to have a history of CHF or myocardial dysfunction. The initial dosage in such patients should be no more than 100 mg bid (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and patients should be monitored carefully. Close attention must be given to maintenance of cardiac function, including optimization of digitalis, diuretic, or other therapy. In cases where CHF has developed or worsened during treatment with flecainide acetate, the time of onset has ranged from a few hours to several months after starting therapy. Some patients who develop evidence of reduced myocardial function while on flecainide acetate can continue on flecainide acetate with adjustment of digitalis or diuretics, others may require dosage reduction or discontinuation of flecainide acetate. When feasible, it is recommended that plasma flecainide levels be monitored. Attempts should be made to keep trough plasma levels below 0.7 to 1.0 mcg/mL.

### Fentanyl citrate [^112Mk2oC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression

Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended. Respiratory depression, if not immediately recognized and treated, may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Adequate facilities should be available for postoperative monitoring and ventilation of patients administered anesthetic doses of Fentanyl Citrate Injection. It is essential that these facilities be fully equipped to handle all degrees of respiratory depression. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention from opioid-induced respiratory depression can exacerbate the sedating effects of opioids.

To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Fentanyl Citrate Injection are essential. As with other potent opioids, the respiratory depressant effect of Fentanyl Citrate Injection may persist longer than the measured analgesic effect. The total dose of all opioid agonists administered should be considered by the practitioner before ordering opioid analgesics during recovery from anesthesia.

Certain forms of conduction anesthesia, such as spinal anesthesia and some peridural anesthetics can alter respiration by blocking intercostal nerves. Through other mechanisms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] Fentanyl Citrate Injection can also alter respiration. Therefore, when Fentanyl Citrate Injection is used to supplement these forms of anesthesia, the anesthetist should be familiar with the physiological alterations involved and be prepared to manage them in the patients selected for these forms of anesthesia.

Patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of Fentanyl Citrate Injection. Elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients resulting in greater risk for respiratory depression.

Monitor such patients closely including vital signs, particularly when initiating and titrating Fentanyl Citrate Injection and when Fentanyl Citrate Injection is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of Fentanyl Citrate Injection are essential [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the opioid dosage using best practices for opioid taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Hetastarch (hetastarch in sodium chloride) [^115mroRZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Coagulopathy

6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is not recommended for use as a cardiac bypass pump prime, while the patient is on cardiopulmonary bypass, or in the immediate period after the pump has been discontinued because of the risk of increasing coagulation abnormalities and bleeding in patients whose coagulation status is already impaired. Monitor the coagulation status of surgery patients, as excess bleeding has been reported with HES solutions in this population. Discontinue use of 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection at first sign of coagulopathy1–2

6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection has not been adequately evaluated to establish its safety in uses over extended periods other than leukapheresis. 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection has been associated with coagulation abnormalities in conjunction with an acquired, reversible von Willebrand's-like syndrome and/or Factor VIII deficiency when used over a period of days. Replacement therapy should be considered if a severe Factor VIII deficiency is identified. If a coagulopathy develops, it may take several days to resolve. Certain conditions may affect the safe use of 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection on a chronic basis. For example, in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage where 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is used repeatedly over a period of days for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm, significant clinical bleeding may occur. Intracranial bleeding resulting in death has been reported.3

Slight declines in platelet counts and hemoglobin levels have been observed in donors undergoing repeated leukapheresis procedures using 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection due to the volume expanding effects of hetastarch and to the collection of platelets and erythrocytes. Hemoglobin levels usually return to normal within 24 hours. Hemodilution by 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection may also result in 24 hour declines of total protein, albumin, calcium, and fibrinogen levels. Regular and frequent clinical evaluation and complete blood counts (CBC) are necessary for proper monitoring of 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection use during leukapheresis. If the frequency of leukapheresis is to exceed the guidelines for whole blood donation, you may wish to consider the following additional tests: total leukocyte and platelet counts, leukocyte differential count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT).

### Ivabradine [^115qy3BJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Most patients (89%) were taking beta-blockers, with 26% on guideline-defined target daily doses. The main reasons for not receiving the target beta-blocker doses at baseline were hypotension (45% of patients not at target), fatigue (32%), dyspnea (14%), dizziness (12%), history of cardiac decompensation (9%), and bradycardia (6%). For the 11% of patients not receiving any beta-blocker at baseline, the main reasons were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypotension, and asthma. Most patients were also taking ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II antagonists (91%), diuretics (83%), and anti-aldosterone agents (60%). Few patients had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (3.2%) or a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device (1.1%). Median follow-up was 22.9 months. At 1 month, 63%, 26%, and 8% of ivabradinetreated patients were taking 7.5, 5, and 2.5 mg BID, whereas 3% had withdrawn from the drug, primarily for bradycardia.

SHIFT demonstrated that ivabradine reduced the risk of the combined endpoint of hospitalization for worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death based on a time-to-event analysis (hazard ratio: 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.75, 0.90, p < 0.0001) (Table 3). The treatment effect reflected only a reduction in the risk of hospitalization for worsening heart failure; there was no favorable effect on the mortality component of the primary endpoint. In the overall treatment population, ivabradine had no statistically significant benefit on cardiovascular death.

### Empagliflozin (Jardiance) [^114kmycz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

At baseline, 88% of patients were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), or angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), 95% with beta-blockers, 71% with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), and 95% with diuretics.

The primary endpoint was the time to first event of either cardiovascular (CV) death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). First and recurrent HHF was assessed as a key secondary endpoint.

JARDIANCE was superior in reducing the risk of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure compared with placebo, mostly through a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. JARDIANCE reduced the risk of first and recurrent HHF (see Table 16 and Figures 7 and 8).

Figure 7	Time to First Occurrence of the Primary Composite Endpoint of CV Death or Hospitalization for Heart Failure

Figure 8	Time to Event of Hospitalization for Heart Failure (First and Recurrent)

The results of the primary composite were generally consistent across the pre-specified subgroups (see Figure 9).

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^114WiezT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Key concepts: overall perioperative risk stratification in cirrhosis — Comprehensive evaluation of surgical risk in patients with cirrhosis requires consideration of liver-related factors, non–liver-related comorbidities, and surgery-specific factors, and individualized estimation is best accomplished by combining validated cirrhosis-specific surgical risk calculators with clinical judgement and individual patient circumstances. In conjunction with clinical judgment, cirrhosis-specific risk scores including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), Childs-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo, and VOCAL-Penn Score are useful to estimate operative risk, and nonhepatic comorbid conditions require independent assessment. In patients with known liver disease but unknown fibrosis stage, FIB-4 and/or elastography may be used to identify advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, and patients with very low MELD (6–9) and CTP (5–6) scores and no evidence of clinically significant portal hypertension or hepatic decompensation have limited excess risk of adverse surgical events; preoperative assessment of frailty may help to inform surgical risk.

### Acute precipitants of congestive heart failure exacerbations… [^115Pse8s]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background Few studies have prospectively and systematically explored the factors that acutely precipitate exacerbation of congestive heart failure in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Knowledge of such factors is important in designing measures to prevent deterioration of clinical status. The objective of this study was to prospectively describe the precipitants associated with exacerbation of CHF status in patients enrolled in the Randomized Evaluation of Strategies for Left Ventricular Dysfunction Pilot Study. Results A total of 323 episodes of worsening of CHF occurred in 180 patients during 43 weeks of follow-up; 143 patients required hospitalization, and 5 died.

Factors implicated in worsening of CHF status included noncompliance with salt restriction; other noncardiac causes, notably pulmonary infectious processes; study medications; use of antiarrhythmic agents in the past 48 hours; arrhythmias; calcium channel blockers; and inappropriate reductions in CHF therapy. Conclusions A variety of factors, many of which are avoidable, are associated with exacerbation of CHF. Attention to these factors and patient education are important in the prevention of CHF deterioration. DESPITE MANY advances in congestive heart failure therapy, worsening of clinical status, often to the point of requiring hospitalization, remains a common occurrence. 1 It is estimated that there are 700 000 hospitalizations for CHF per year in the United States.

In the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction registry of 6273 consecutive patients with CHF, 2 19% were hospitalized 1 or more times for CHF and 27% died or were hospitalized for CHF within 1 year. Clinical and lifestyle factors associated with deterioration of patients with CHF have not been systematically addressed. Most studies that have explored the prognostic importance of CHF have relied on historical, clinical, or investigational data obtained at "entry" into the study. The impact of these prognostic indicators on later deterioration of clinical status, whether transient or permanent, were then assessed at a remote time point. 6–8 However, given the magnitude of the problem, knowledge of the immediate precipitants of CHF exacerbation, particularly if avoidable, provides useful insight for clinicians in preventing the deterioration. Of the 323 CHF events, 143 events required that the patient be hospitalized, and 180 cases were managed on an ambulatory basis.

Five patients died in the hospital. Patients gained an average weight of 1. 16 kg compared with baseline. Physical examination revealed lung crackles in 66% of cases, peripheral edema in 52%, elevation of jugular venous pressure in 55%, and a third heart sound in 36%. Hospitalized cases had more crackles and were more likely to have a chest radiograph performed compared with those not hospitalized. Treatments administered for the exacerbation of CHF included oral diuretics in 56% of cases, intravenous diuretics in 48%, and addition of a new diuretic in 19%. Factors that the investigators believed to be associated with exacerbation of CHF are shown in the "Total" column of Table 5.

### Preoperative evaluation for major noncardiac surgery… [^114Z7VkN]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

The noncardiac surgical volume is increasing beyond previous predictions by Mangano1 in 1990. Despite advances in care, the changing complexity of patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery may make prediction of cardiovascular risk more difficult in the future. CHF indicates congestive heart failure; MI, myocardial infarction. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Over the last 25 years, there has been steady improvement in the care of patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery. In the past, attention was focused on coronary artery disease and the detection of ischemia. For the future, changes in the epidemiologic characteristics of patients undergoing surgery may require improved strategies and care, especially for those with heart failure. This review will summarize preoperative risk evaluation and perioperative care focusing on HF.

In the original Cardiac Risk Index by Goldman and colleagues, 13 clinical signs of HF including an S3 gallop or jugular venous distention were the most significant predictors of postoperative life-threatening or fatal cardiac complications. In the final analysis, signs of HF carried the highest weight in the original Cardiac Risk Index. In addition, 36 of the 39 patients manifesting 1 or more life-threatening cardiac complications had pulmonary edema. In the Revised Cardiac Risk Index study population, HF was both an important predictor and a key complication. The outcome required a formal reading of pulmonary edema on the chest radiograph by a radiologist with a plausible clinical setting. In the validation set, it provided the highest odds ratio for major cardiac complications. In addition, it was an important outcome similar to MIs.

16 Other models have shown HF as an important predictor of perioperative events and the degree of HF appears to correlate with complications.
17. With today's current approach to preoperative care, it is unclear what the risk factors for postoperative HF are. In a 1990 study by Mangano and colleagues, 30 a history of dysrhythmia, diabetes, duration of anesthesia, vascular surgery, and narcotic anesthesia were all associated with postoperative HF while postoperative ischemia was not. They speculated that vascular surgery placed patients at higher risk because of the length of the procedure and volume of intravenous fluids. In another study, Charlson and colleagues31 found that the risk for postoperative HF was limited to patients with preoperative symptomatic cardiac disease, especially in patients with diabetes. Another possible factor in postoperative HF may be the inability to administer some HF medications because of the inability to use an oral route postoperatively.

Finally, it appears that surgery leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin system and postoperative elevations in cortisol as well as epinephrine levels.
32. Manifestations of perioperative HF usually develop during the day of surgery or the second to third postoperative day, although this is not well studied. 31 Theoretically, there are 2 potential periods when HF may worsen: immediately after surgery because of the length of surgery, myocardial ischemia, and rapid fluid shifts and a few days later, when HF may occur because of reabsorption of third-spaced fluid. 33 In the study by Mangano and colleaugues, 30 48% of HF occurred after the third postoperative day. The exact approach to patients with HF in the perioperative period is uncertain, but understanding the degree and cause may be helpful. The ACC/AHA guidelines state, "Every effort must be made to detect unsuspected HF by a careful history and physical examination. "34.

### ACC / AHA release guidelines on perioperative cardiovascular… [^114PSKz2]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

To provide an outline for considering cardiac risk in a variety of patients and surgical procedures, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association created guidelines on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and care for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Preoperative evaluation is done to assess a patient's current medical status; to provide recommendations about the evaluation, treatment, and risk of cardiac problems over the perioperative period; and to provide a risk profile that may affect cardiac outcomes and that can be used when choosing treatment. This practice guideline focuses on preoperative evaluation rather than on perioperative treatment. See the full guidelines for more information on perioperative treatment.

Cardiac Risk Stratification Identifying the cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery is important in patients who have clinical risk factors. The type of surgery may identify a patient who has a higher probability of underlying heart disease and higher perioperative morbidity and mortality. The surgery may also be associated with coronary or myocardial stressors; intensity of these stressors helps to determine the probability of perioperative cardiac events. Perioperative morbidity related to noncardiac surgical procedures ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Figure 1 shows the stepwise approach to perioperative cardiac assessment.

Assessment of LV Function PREOPERATIVE NONINVASIVE EVALUATION Nine studies have shown a positive correlation between decreased preoperative ejection fraction and postoperative morbidity or mortality. In a study of 339 men with ischemic heart disease or risk factors for CHD, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40 percent was associated with all adverse perioperative outcomes, including cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, and ventricular tachycardia. It determined that an LVEF of less than 35 percent had a sensitivity of 50 percent and specificity of 91 percent for predicting perioperative nonfatal MI or cardiac death. The highest risk of complications was found in patients with a resting LVEF of less than 35 percent.

Recommendations Preoperative evaluation of LV function is reasonable in patients with dyspnea from an unknown cause. Preoperative evaluation of LV function is reasonable in patients with heart failure or a history of heart failure who have worsening dyspnea or other changes in clinical status. Reassessment of LV function in clinically stable persons with previous cardio-myopathy is not well established. Routine perioperative evaluation of LV function is not recommended. The study determined that pathologic Q waves on ECG before the surgery, which were found in 17 percent of the patients, were associated with an increased risk of cardiac complications, including MI, pulmonary edema, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and heart block. However, in another study of 513 patients at least 70 years of age who were undergoing noncardiac surgery, 75 percent had a baseline ECG abnormality and 3. 7 percent died.

### Perioperative cardiovascular considerations prior to elective noncardiac surgery in patients with a history of COVID-19… [^116DW5Ey]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Patients with cardiovascular risk factors and established cardiovascular disease have excess morbidity and mortality with COVID-19. 1 Acute cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 can include myocardial injury, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, arrhythmias, dysautonomia, and thromboembolism. 1 It remains unknown whether these cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 persist beyond the acute phase of illness. Prior studies indicate that hospitalization with non–COVID-19 pneumonia may be associated with an increased risk of CVD up to 10 years after the initial infection.
2. Many COVID-19 survivors are resuming routine clinical care and being referred for elective surgery. It is unclear if a history of recent COVID-19 warrants additional preoperative cardiac assessment.

We outline key considerations for cardiac risk assessment in patients with recent COVID-19 undergoing evaluation for elective noncardiac surgery. In a large international prospective observational study from the GlobalSurg-COVIDSurg collaborative of 140 231 patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, 2. 2% had a preoperative COVID-19 diagnosis. 3 A majority of the patients with a preoperative COVID-19 diagnosis were younger than 70 years, were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class of 1 or 2, had revised cardiac risk index of 0 or 1, and reported either asymptomatic COVID-19 or experienced symptom resolution prior to the surgery. Among surgeries performed within 2 weeks of a COVID-19 diagnosis, 70. 3% were emergent. The 30-day adjusted postoperative mortality was 3. 6% to
4. 1% in patients undergoing surgery within 7 weeks of a COVID-19 diagnosis, but only 1.

5% in patients undergoing surgery 7 weeks or more after a COVID-19 diagnosis, similar to patients without a COVID-19 diagnosis. This association between postoperative mortality and the timing of COVID-19 diagnosis was observed irrespective of age, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class, major or minor surgery, emergent or elective surgery, or COVID-19 symptom status. Among patients undergoing surgery 7 weeks or more after a COVID-19 diagnosis, those with ongoing COVID-19 symptoms had substantially higher 30-day postoperative mortality when compared with asymptomatic patients or those with symptom resolution. Unfortunately, perioperative cardiovascular complications and causes of death were not reported in these analyses.

However, the postoperative incidence of pulmonary complications was also greater in patients undergoing surgery within 7 weeks of a COVID-19 diagnosis, compared with patients in whom surgery was delayed 7 weeks or more after a COVID-19 diagnosis or those without a COVID-19 diagnosis. Although we cannot exclude confounding by surgical indication in these observational analyses, based on these data, delaying elective surgery for a minimum of 7 weeks after COVID-19 diagnosis is advised, and longer delays may be reasonable in patients with persistent symptoms.

### Association of LVEF and heart failure symptoms with mortality after elective noncardiac surgery… [^117PRwE1]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Heart failure with or without symptoms was associated with increased risk of 90-day postoperative mortality. Importance Heart failure is an established risk factor for postoperative mortality, but how left ventricular ejection fraction and heart failure symptoms affect surgical outcomes is not fully described. Objectives To determine the risk of postoperative mortality among patients with heart failure at various levels of echocardiographic and clinical severity compared with those without heart failure and to evaluate how risk varies across levels of surgical complexity. Exposures Heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction, and presence of signs or symptoms of heart failure within 30 days of surgery. Main Outcome and Measure The primary outcome was postoperative mortality at 90 days. Results.

Compared with patients without heart failure, those with heart failure had a higher risk of 90-day postoperative mortality. Both left ventricular ejection fraction and the presence of heart failure symptoms are associated with long-term mortality rates in patients with heart failure, but the degree to which these factors influence postoperative risk is not fully described. 8–10 Previous studies evaluating the association between LVEF or symptoms and postoperative mortality were. Patients with heart failure were further subdivided by LVEF and presence of heart failure signs and symptoms.

The following established cutoffs were used for LVEF: preserved, 50% or more; mildly reduced, 40% through 49%; moderately reduced, 30% through 39%; and severely reduced, less than 30%. 23 Patients were classified as having symptomatic heart failure by the American College of Surgeons–NSQIP definition: newly diagnosed or chronic heart failure with signs or symptoms in the 30 days prior to surgery.
24. The risk of postoperative mortality progressively increased with decreasing systolic function, with all ejection fraction groups having a higher risk of postoperative mortality than patients without heart failure. All patients with a history of heart failure, regardless of systolic function or presence of heart failure symptoms, had a higher risk of postoperative mortality compared with patients without heart failure.

Patients with a history of heart failure, without symptoms and with preserved LVEF had a crude 90-day post-operative mortality risk of 4. 42%. Both crude mortality risks and the heart failure-mortality association differed significantly between levels of surgical complexity. The crude 90-day postoperative mortality for patients with heart failure increased from 4. 62% for standard complexity operations to
10. 34% for complex procedures. For patients without heart failure, crude 90-day postoperative mortality increased from 0. 66% to
6. 19%. The adjusted absolute RD between patients with and without heart failure was 1. 29% (95% CI,
1. 22%-1.
