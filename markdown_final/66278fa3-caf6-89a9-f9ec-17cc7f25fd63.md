## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the chief complaint — what it is, why it matters, how it is used in practice, and what the evidence says about its clinical implications and limitations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the chief complaint and its role in clinical encounters. Then, I should verify its operational use in triage, documentation, and quality measurement. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence linking chief complaint to outcomes like mortality and readmission. After that, I need to check limitations, including misclassification and discordance with discharge diagnoses. Finally, I will consider special populations, system-level applications, and practical takeaways for clinicians and researchers.

> Let me first confirm the definition and core function. The chief complaint is the patient's self-reported primary reason for seeking care, typically recorded at presentation and used to anchor triage, initial diagnostic thinking, and workflow; it is the first piece of information collected and is intended to be captured reliably across settings, including resource-limited environments where definitive diagnoses may not be immediately available [^9ce2a2ee].

> Wait, let me verify how it is used operationally. In emergency care, chief complaint drives triage acuity, resource allocation, and early testing; it is a mandatory element in many triage systems and is often coded to support analytics, surveillance, and performance measurement, with structured schemas like CCC-EDS enabling automated classification of free-text complaints and supporting case-mix description and quality metrics [^e76f2bf9] [^30ef735e] [^4856fe15].

> I will now examine the evidence that chief complaint predicts outcomes. Large cohort data show that specific chief complaints carry substantially different risks of 30-day mortality and readmission; altered level of consciousness and dyspnea consistently associate with the highest 30-day mortality, while fever/infection and dyspnea associate with the highest readmission risk, and these relationships persist after adjustment, suggesting chief complaint contains prognostic information beyond simple triage color or disposition [^4c258d42] [^594b6ab1] [^dad26239].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the magnitude and consistency. Multiple analyses from the same Danish registry report 30-day mortality around 8% for ALOC and dyspnea with adjusted odds ratios near 2.0, and 30-day readmission around 11–12% for fever/infection and dyspnea, with abdominal symptoms also showing elevated readmission risk; these findings align with 1-year mortality signals for ALOC and dyspnea, reinforcing their clinical salience for early escalation and follow-up planning [^4c258d42] [^594b6ab1] [^36e18f33].

> Next, I should review limitations and potential biases. Chief complaint is a syndromic label that may not map cleanly to final diagnoses; discordance between chief complaint and discharge diagnosis is well documented, with sepsis, neurologic syndromes, and unspecified infections showing poor agreement, and many patients are discharged with nonspecific R-diagnoses, indicating incomplete diagnostic closure and potential misclassification of risk when relying on complaint alone [^f753c7a5] [^be7551dd] [^36e18f33].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought chest pain would carry the highest mortality among complaints; let me reconsider. The cohort data actually show chest pain is common but has relatively lower 30-day mortality compared with ALOC and dyspnea, which repeatedly demonstrate the highest short- and long-term mortality; this correction aligns with the epidemiology that ALOC and dyspnea often reflect systemic illness, respiratory failure, or neurologic catastrophe, whereas many chest pain presentations are low-risk or noncardiac [^4c258d42] [^594b6ab1] [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and contexts. In older adults, nonspecific complaints such as generalized weakness, confusion, or "unwell" are common and associate with higher admission, longer ED length of stay, and higher 30-day mortality, underscoring the need for heightened vigilance and geriatric protocols; in pediatrics, triage chief complaints that are nonspecific for appendicitis increase the odds of missed diagnosis, illustrating anchoring risk; in COVID-19, chief complaint patterns differ by age, with older patients more often presenting with weakness and altered mental status, which should inform triage and testing strategies [^e00ebedd] [^4bcbd363] [^e042345f] [^33d60131].

> Let me consider system-level applications. Chief complaint data are foundational for syndromic surveillance, ED operations, and quality measurement, yet their utility depends on standardization and analytic rigor; efforts to define minimum effective chief complaint sets for LMICs and to develop complaint-based performance measures reflect growing recognition that symptom-level data can guide resource planning and quality improvement when diagnosis-level data are sparse or delayed [^4856fe15] [^9ce2a2ee].

> But wait, what if the complaint is vague or multifactorial. I should confirm that clinicians often face patients with multiple concurrent complaints and that current systems force selection of a single chief complaint, which can obscure risk; future work should explore combinations of complaints, temporal evolution, and integration with vitals and context to improve risk stratification and reduce misclassification bias [^2e28e08a] [^7abd5e61].

> Next, I should review practical clinical takeaways. Given the strong association of ALOC and dyspnea with poor outcomes, these complaints warrant early senior involvement, aggressive diagnostics, and careful disposition planning; conversely, patients with nonspecific complaints in older adults merit expanded differentials, delirium screening, and social risk assessment; across cases, documenting a precise, patient-centered reason for visit and revisiting the complaint as new data emerge helps mitigate anchoring and diagnostic error [^4c258d42] [^35f19ee5] [^092a512e].

> Finally, I should double-check the research implications. There is a need for multicenter, standardized chief complaint taxonomies, linkage to outcomes and diagnoses, and analytic methods that capture multimorbidity and evolving presentations; until then, clinicians should treat chief complaint as a high-yield but imperfect signal that must be integrated with vitals, history, and trajectory to optimize care and reduce preventable harm [^720489ec] [^4856fe15] [^4c258d42].

The chief complaint is the **patient's primary reason for seeking care** [^720489ec], typically recorded in their own words at presentation [^30ef735e]. It guides initial evaluation, triage, and diagnostic prioritization, and is essential for communication, documentation, and quality metrics [^4856fe15]. Chief complaints are often nonspecific (e.g. "pain", "weakness") [^e00ebedd] and may not match final diagnoses, so clinicians should use them to frame but not limit the differential [^2a8725bc]. Standardized coding systems improve data quality and enable analytics, but free-text entries still require careful interpretation [^30ef735e] [^aca54327].

## Common examples of chief complaints

Common chief complaints include:

| **Chief complaint** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Pain | - Chest pain <br/> - Abdominal pain <br/> - Headache <br/> - Back pain |
| Respiratory symptoms | - Shortness of breath <br/> - Cough <br/> - Wheezing |

---

## Clinical implications and challenges

- **Diagnostic guidance**: Chief complaints guide initial diagnostic thinking but may be nonspecific or misleading, requiring careful verification and correlation with clinical findings [^2a8725bc].
- **Misclassification**: Patients may present with multiple symptoms, and selecting a single chief complaint can lead to misclassification and potential diagnostic errors [^2e28e08a].
- **Communication barrier**: Language, cultural differences, and patient anxiety can affect the accuracy of the chief complaint, necessitating clear communication and clarification [^6d210e0f].

---

## Documentation and standardization

- **Documentation**: Chief complaints are typically recorded in the patient's own words, followed by a more detailed history of present illness (HPI) [^notfound].
- **Standardization**: Efforts have been made to standardize chief complaint coding using structured taxonomies (e.g. CCC-EDS) to improve data quality and comparability [^30ef735e] [^aca54327].
- **Electronic health records (EHRs)**: EHRs facilitate structured documentation and retrieval of chief complaint data for clinical decision-making and research [^notfound].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Subjectivity**: Chief complaints are inherently subjective and may not accurately reflect the underlying medical condition [^2a8725bc].
- **Variability**: There is significant variability in how patients articulate their symptoms, influenced by factors such as education, culture, and health literacy [^6d210e0f].
- **Clinical judgment**: Clinicians must interpret chief complaints within the broader clinical context, integrating physical examination, diagnostic tests, and patient history [^6189da1c].

---

## Conclusion

The chief complaint is a foundational element of clinical practice, guiding initial evaluation and diagnostic prioritization. While it is a valuable starting point, clinicians must recognize its limitations and interpret it within the broader clinical context to ensure accurate diagnosis and effective patient care.

### Making recording and analysis of chief complaint a priority for global emergency care research in low-income countries [^720489ec]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The chief complaint is a patient's self-reported primary reason for presenting for medical care. The clinical utility and analytical importance of recording chief complaints have been widely accepted in highly developed emergency care systems, but this practice is far from universal in global emergency care, especially in limited-resource areas. It is precisely in these settings, however, that the use of chief complaints may have particular benefit. Chief complaints may be used to quantify, analyze, and plan for emergency care and provide valuable information on acute care needs where there are crucial data gaps. Globally, much work has been done to establish local practices around chief complaint collection and use, but no standards have been established and little work has been done to identify minimum effective sets of chief complaints that may be used in limited-resource settings. As part of the Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference, "Global Health and Emergency Care: A Research Agenda", the breakout group on data management identified the lack of research on emergency chief complaints globally-especially in low-income countries where the highest proportion of the world's population resides-as a major gap in global emergency care research. This article reviews global research on emergency chief complaints in high-income countries with developed emergency care systems and sets forth an agenda for future research on chief complaints in limited-resource settings.

### Chief complaint-based performance measures: a new focus for acute care quality measurement [^4856fe15]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Performance measures are increasingly important to guide meaningful quality improvement efforts and value-based reimbursement. Populations included in most current hospital performance measures are defined by recorded diagnoses using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes in administrative claims data. Although the diagnosis-centric approach allows the assessment of disease-specific quality, it fails to measure one of the primary functions of emergency department (ED) care, which involves diagnosing, risk stratifying, and treating patients' potentially life-threatening conditions according to symptoms (ie, chief complaints). In this article, we propose chief complaint-based quality measures as a means to enhance the evaluation of quality and value in emergency care. We discuss the potential benefits of chief complaint-based measures, describe opportunities to mitigate challenges, propose an example measure set, and present several recommendations to advance this paradigm in ED-based performance measurement.

### Defining high-risk emergency chief complaints: data-driven triage for low-and middle-income countries [^9ce2a2ee]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Emergency medicine continues to be underdeveloped and heterogeneous in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs). 1 With recent estimates suggesting that high‐quality emergency care could address more than 50% of annual deaths in LMICs, the World Health Organization, World Bank, and African Federation for Emergency Medicine have called for a renewed focus on research and investment into emergency care. 2, 3, 4 However, local needs remain poorly characterized due to insufficient data in several areas including prehospital care, emergency unit triage, and patient outcomes. 5, 6

The Working Group on Emergency Care Data Management at the 2013 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference generated a list of research priorities for global emergency medicine and emphasized the capture and analysis of chief complaint (CC) data. 7 The CC, or reason for visit, is the first piece of information collected from a patient and can be reliably captured in nearly all emergency unit environments. 8 Since definitive diagnoses are often unavailable to LMIC emergency care providers, the CC also serves as a syndromic label to guide triage, diagnostic, and therapeutic decisions. 7, 9 Although few LMICs have the means to map CC data, a comprehensive understanding of CCs is postulated to enhance provider training and help optimize the allocation of scant financial, diagnostic, and human resources. 7

### When the chief complaint is (or should be) dyspnea in adults [^15801097]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Dyspnea, "a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity", is an important and challenging complaint associated with a wide variety of adverse clinical outcomes, including hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac mortality. Although up to 85% of cases are caused by asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, congestive heart failure, or psychogenic disorders, a systematic approach can help to identity uncommon, but important, causes of dyspnea. In this review that includes clinical examples as well as a didactic review of currently available information, we suggest a step-wise approach to the evaluation of the adult patient with dyspnea. It is also important to avoid 3 possible pitfalls: accepting a cause for dyspnea in which the element identified is only part of a syndrome which includes that element; accepting a single cause for dyspnea when the cause is multifactorial; and failing to recognize a diagnosis and cause of dyspnea is incorrect and has been assumed without rigorous confirmation, when a patient with a specific diagnosis is referred for "failing to respond to treatment".

### Predicting mortality and readmission based on chief complaint in emergency department patients: a cohort study [^37f58f72]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The number of visits to emergency departments (ED) is increasing. Therefore, the ED workflow, that is, initial treatment and diagnostic workup, needs to be constantly optimized and improved to fit the increased patient flow without placing the patient at risk. Thus, it is crucial to risk-stratify patient groups according to outcome, for example, mortality and readmission. These factors are to a certain degree known for different diagnoses. However, patients attending the ED present with a variety of chief complaints, not diagnoses. Triage systems classify and prioritize patients according to chief complaint, and hence the initial diagnostic workup and treatment are based hereupon. It is therefore relevant to characterize the population in the ED based on the patient's chief complaint — a symptom-based approach.

In recent years, there has been increased focus on symptom-based research. Studies have shown that the ED patient's chief complaint can be used as a predictor of mortality, both long term and short term. Likewise, revisits to the ED are associated with higher mortality. However, readmissions have not yet been investigated based on chief complaint. Also, previous symptom-based ED research has mainly focused on a limited number of chief complaints at presentation and primarily in medical (non-surgical) patients and rarely in a mixed ED population.

Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to investigate 30-day mortality and 30-day readmission among all acute surgical and non-surgical ED patients using chief complaint as an exposure. Second we present data on in-hospital and 1-year mortality and 7-day readmission, and report discharge diagnoses of the 10 chief complaints with the highest 30-day mortality.

### Predicting mortality and readmission based on chief complaint in emergency department patients: a cohort study [^7abd5e61]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

This study may be used as an impetus to more ED symptom-based research in general. As discussed, identification of risk factors among the chief complaints as well as the link between discharge diagnoses and chief complaint, and even combinations/interactions of chief complaints, is an essential area to focus future research on. This knowledge may contribute to the development or improvement of standardized ED algorithms and risk stratification tools, potentially improving patient outcomes.

### Characterizing COVID-19: a chief complaint based approach [^e042345f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic has inundated emergency departments with patients exhibiting a wide array of symptomatology and clinical manifestations. We aim to evaluate the chief complaints of patients presenting to our ED with either suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to better understand the clinical presentation of this pandemic.

Methods

This study was a retrospective computational analysis that investigated the chief complaints of all confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases presenting to our adult ED (patients aged 22 and older) using a variety of data mining methods. Our study employed descriptive statistics to analyze the set of complaints that are most common, hierarchical clustering analysis to provide a nuanced way of identifying complaints that co-occur, and hypothesis testing identify complaint differences among age differences.

Results

A quantitative analysis of 5015 ED visits of COVID-suspected patients (1483 confirmed COVID-positive patients) identified 209 unique chief complaints. Of the 209 chief complaints, fever and shortness of breath were the most prevalent initial presenting symptoms. In the subset of COVID-19 confirmed positive cases, we discovered seven distinct clusters of presenting complaints. Patients over 65 years of age were more likely to present with weakness and altered mental status.

Conclusions

Our research highlights an important aspect of the evaluation and management of COVID-19 patients in the emergency department. Our study identified most common chief complaints, chief complaints differences across age groups, and 7 distinct groups of COVID-19 symptoms. This large-scale effort to classify the most commonly reported symptoms in ED patients provides public health officials and providers with data for identifying COVID-19 cases.

### Whom should we screen for Cushing syndrome? The endocrine society practice guideline recommendations 2008 revisited [^774c08e9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Chief Complaint for Consultation and Screening in Patients With Cushing Syndrome and Ruled-out CS

We identified 18 different chief complaints for which patients were transferred to the tertiary center (Table 2). The 3 most common reasons were obesity/weight gain (n = 89, 24% of patients), adrenal or pituitary incidentaloma (n = 40, 11%), and hypertension (n = 40, 11%). The frequencies of the chief complaints are listed in Table 2. Half the patients screened for CS belonged to groups that are not counted as the priority groups recommended by the 2008 guidelines (see Tables 2 and 3). CS was diagnosed in 12% of those patients, compared to 39% among those who fall into the screening groups A to C as recommended by the 2008 guidelines.

Table 2.
Reasons for consultation/screenings in the study cohorts

Table 3.
Summary of screening recommendations

Group A consisted of patients who had unusual features for their age. These were, for example, osteoporosis and osteopenia, which were chief complaints in 12 patients, of whom 7 (58%) received a final diagnosis of CS. Hypertension, mostly of new onset, was found in the consultation recommendation notes of 40 patients, and CS was confirmed in 5 (13%). Group B patients had multiple and progressive features, particularly those that are more predictive of CS. Eighteen patients presented with multiple symptoms (defined as > 3 typical symptoms for CS), and CS was diagnosed in 15 (83%). Details regarding these symptoms are presented in Table 4. Myopathy was the chief complaint in 14 patients, and CS was confirmed in 9 (64%). Metabolic syndrome was also common (22 patients), with 10 (45%) having CS. Twenty-eight women presented with hyperandrogenic symptoms, and 21% had confirmed CS. Finally, group C patients had adrenal or pituitary incidentaloma compatible with adenoma. There were 40 patients in this group, of whom 16 (40%) received a final diagnosis of CS.

Symptoms in patients with chief complaint "multiple symptoms"

Group D consisted of 203 patients who did not fall in one of the aforementioned categories. Of those, 25 (27%) received a final diagnosis of CS. Details are depicted in Table 2.

### The national capitol region's emergency department syndromic surveillance system: do chief complaint and discharge diagnosis yield different results? [^f753c7a5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Public health officials implementing ED syndromic surveillance systems must decide what data types to use when assigning visits to syndrome categories. Overall we found good agreement between ED chief complaint and discharge diagnosis, but substantial variability existed by syndrome. Sepsis, neurologic, and unspecified infection syndromes were found to have lower agreement than death, rash, respiratory, and gastrointestinal syndromes. These results suggest that several important differences exist between chief complaint and discharge diagnosis.

We found poor agreement between chief complaint and discharge diagnosis for sepsis syndrome. Our matrix terms for sepsis syndrome are sepsis, septic shock, shock, and urosepsis. Sepsis and shock are clinical terms rarely seen as a patient's chief complaint, even when the ED staff translate patients' complaints into medical terminology, making this life-threatening clinical entity difficult to track by using chief complaint only.

For neurologic syndrome, which was designed to capture botulism and meningitis cases, we also observed poor agreement between the two data types. Which data source best serves the aims of syndromic surveillance remains unclear, as no botulism or meningitis cases were diagnosed during the study period. Many key components of a meningitis diagnosis are available after a relatively brief ED evaluation, such as classic physical exam findings and spinal fluid analysis results, suggesting that discharge diagnosis may provide a better positive predictive value than chief complaint. Coding initial ED visits of patients with culture-confirmed cases retrospectively, by using chief complaint and discharge diagnosis, would test this hypothesis.

Unspecified infection syndrome is intended to identify nonspecific infectious conditions not captured elsewhere. As expected, we found a low agreement here, since patients with fever alone or other nonspecific chief complaints are often given a specific diagnosis after clinical evaluation. In some situations, organ-specific discharge diagnoses reasonably rule out the possibility of illness caused by category A or B agents. In other situations, these diagnoses may be less informative if they place febrile patients into diagnoses infrequently associated with fever, such as upper respiratory infections, without ruling out serious rare disease.

### High-risk chief complaints I: chest pain – the big three [^e4cd8dd7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Chest pain is one of the most frequently seen chief complaints in patients presenting to emergency departments, and is considered to be a "high-risk" chief complaint. The differential diagnosis for chest pain is broad, and potential causes range from the benign to the immediately life-threatening. Although many (if not most) emergency department patients with chest pain do not have an immediately life-threatening condition, correct diagnoses can be difficult to make, incorrect diagnoses may lead to catastrophic therapies, and failure to make a timely diagnosis may contribute to significant morbidity and mortality. Several atraumatic "high-risk" causes of chest pain are discussed in this article, including myocardial infarction and ischemia, thoracic aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Also included are brief discussions of tension pneumothorax, esophageal perforation, and cardiac tamponade.

### Predicting mortality and readmission based on chief complaint in emergency department patients: a cohort study [^594b6ab1]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This study shows that chief complaint is associated with 30-day mortality and readmission in a mixed ED population. Patients with dyspnea stood out as very frequent with high mortality and readmission. The unspecific complaints ALOC and unwell also had high mortality. GI bleeding was the surgical complaint with the highest mortality. Patients with fever/infection, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and abdominal symptoms were more often readmitted within 30 days. Second, we found that ALOC and dyspnea stood out in terms of a high 1-year mortality at 24% and 23%, respectively. Overall, chief complaint at presentation carries important information that may assist in improving initial diagnostic workup and treatment and patient flow in the ED.

### A comprehensive set of coded chief complaints for the emergency department [^aca54327]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop a generally applicable set of coded chief complaints for the computerized patient records of emergency departments (EDs).

Methods

At an urban teaching ED the chief complaints of more than 50,000 patients were analyzed retrospectively during a 29-month period (June 1995-October 1997). Applying continuous quality improvement methods, a multidisciplinary team examined the current process documenting the patient's chief complaint. During two prospective periods (November 1997-December 1998; January 1999-June 1999), more than 34,000 chief complaints were analyzed. To reduce free-text charting practices, a variety of interventions on individual and team level were applied. Quantitative analysis was performed with statistical process control charts, and a qualitative evaluation was performed with a questionnaire.

Results

The charting of chief complaint in free-text format decreased from 23% to 1%. The range among individual ED staff members narrowed from 45% to 9%. During the refinement of the set of coded chief complaints, six infrequently charted items were removed. Five new chief complaints identified by analysis of free-text entries during the second study period were added. The current set of chief complaints consists of 54 codable and the three original free-text items. The ED staff members perceived all the interventions beneficial. A poster displaying all available terms as a visual aid, however, had the largest impact on charting the patient's chief complaint in coded format.

Conclusions

Applying continuous quality improvement methods, the authors created a clinically developed and applicable set of codable chief complaints that can be easily integrated into a computerized patient record of an ED.

### High-risk chief complaints I: chest pain-the big three (an update) [^367f8a1a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic chest pain is a frequent concern of emergency department patients, with causes that range from benign to immediately life threatening. Identifying those patients who require immediate/urgent intervention remains challenging and is a high-risk area for emergency medicine physicians where incorrect or delayed diagnosis may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This article focuses on the 3 most prevalent diagnoses associated with adverse outcomes in patients presenting with nontraumatic chest pain, acute coronary syndrome, thoracic aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Important aspects of clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, treatment, and disposition and other less common causes of lethal chest pain are also discussed.

### High-risk chief complaints III: abdomen and extremities [^ba24b425]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal and extremity complaints are common in the emergency department (ED) and, because of their frequency, clinical vigilance is vital in order not to miss the timely diagnosis of occult or delayed emergencies. Such emergencies, if not timely managed, are sources of significant patient morbidity and mortality and may expose ED physicians to possible litigation. Each patient complaint yields to a nuanced approach in diagnostics and therapeutics that can lead physicians toward the ruling in or out of the correct high-risk diagnosis. This article discusses the approach and risk management of this high-risk subset of abdominal and extremity diagnoses.

### Predicting mortality and readmission based on chief complaint in emergency department patients: a cohort study [^4c258d42]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency department (ED) patients present with complaints and not diagnoses. Characterization and risk stratification based on chief complaint can therefore help clinicians improve ED workflow and clinical outcome. In this study we investigated the 30-day mortality and readmission among ED patients based on chief complaint.

Methods

In this cohort study we retrieved routinely collected data from electronic medical records and the Danish Civil Registration System of all ED contacts from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017. All patients triaged with one chief complaint using the Danish Emergency Process Triage system were included. Patients with minor injuries were excluded. The chief complaint assigned by the triaging nurse was used as exposure, and 30-day mortality and 30-day readmission were the primary outcomes. Logistic regression was used to determine crude and adjusted ORs with reference to the remaining study population.

Results

A total of 41 470 patients were eligible. After exclusion of minor injuries and patients not triaged, 19 325 patients were included. The 30-day mortality and 30-day readmission differed significantly among the chief complaints. The highest 30-day mortality was observed among patients presenting with altered level of conscousness (ALOC) (8.4%, OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.1) and dyspnea (8.0%, OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.6). 30-day readmission was highest among patients presenting with fever/infection (11.7%, OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.4) and dyspnea (11.2%, OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.0).

Discussion

Chief complaint is associated with 30-day mortality and readmission in a mixed ED population. ALOC and dyspnea had the highest mortality; fever/infection and dyspnea had the highest readmission rate. This knowledge may assist in improving and optimizing symptom-based initial diagnostic workup and treatment, and ultimately improve workflow and clinical outcome.

### High-risk chief complaints II: disorders of the head and neck [^efbd3958]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Of the many different complaints of patients presenting to the emergency department, some of the most difficult to diagnose and manage involve pathology of the head and neck. Often diagnoses of conditions affecting this part of the body are elusive, and occasionally, even once the diagnosis has been made, the management of these disorders remains challenging. This article addresses some of the high-risk chief complaints of the head and neck regarding diagnosis and management. These complaints include headache, seizure, acute focal neurologic deficits, throat and neck pain, ocular emergencies, and the difficult airway.

### Age differences in the chief complaint associated with a first acute myocardial infarction and patient's care-seeking behavior [^f23e8cf4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This study set out to describe age differences in patient's chief complaint related to a first myocardial infarction and how the "typicality" of patient's acute symptoms relates to extent of prehospital delay.

Methods

The medical records of 2586 residents of central Massachusetts hospitalized at 11 greater Worcester medical centers with a first myocardial infarction on a biennial basis between 2001 and 2011 were reviewed.

Results

The average age of the study population was 66.4 years, 39.6% were women, 40.2% were diagnosed with a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and 72.0% presented with typical symptoms of myocardial infarction, namely acute chest pain or pressure. Patients were categorized into 5 age strata: > 55 years (23%), 55–64 years (20%), 65–74 years (19%), 75–84 years (22%), and ≥ 85 years (16%). The lowest proportion (11%) of atypical symptoms of myocardial infarction was observed in patients < 55 years, increasing to 17%, 28%, 40%, and 51% across the respective age groups. The most prevalent chief complaint reported at the time of hospitalization was chest pain, but the proportion of patients reporting this symptom decreased from the youngest (83%) to the oldest patient groups (45%). There was a slightly increased risk of prehospital delay across the different age groups (higher in the oldest old) in those who presented with atypical, rather than typical, symptoms of myocardial infarction.

Conclusions

The present results provide insights to the presenting chief complaint of patients hospitalized with a first myocardial infarction according to age and the relation of symptom presentation to patient's care-seeking behavior.

### Predicting mortality and readmission based on chief complaint in emergency department patients: a cohort study [^36e18f33]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

The fact that chief complaint is associated with multiple final diagnoses also emphasizes the importance of not thinking too narrow in terms of differential diagnoses, which underlines the challenging essence of emergency medicine: to initiate acute treatment and diagnostic workup to "convert" a patient's symptoms to a correct diagnosis, to assure the best treatment.

Furthermore, we found that unspecific diagnoses (majorly R-diagnoses and less frequent Z-diagnoses) were often used, which means that many ED patients leave the hospital without a specific diagnosis. This may be explained by the patients being stable and discharged to further diagnostic workup electively or at the general practitioner. Another contributing factor could be the patients getting well spontaneously and therefore discharged without specific diagnosis. However, the large proportion of patients without organ-specific or cause-specific diagnosis is inappropriate and underlines the need to improve the diagnostic process. More research is needed to understand the link between discharge diagnoses and chief complaints.

The 1-year follow-up revealed that ALOC and dyspnea stood out with a mortality of 24% and 23.4% (both with adjusted OR of 2.1). These are alarming numbers, but are not new. A Danish study of emergency medical services patients also found impaired consciousness and dyspnea to have the highest mortality, with a 1-year mortality of 54.7% in "unconscious and cardiac arrest" patients and a 1-year mortality of 27.7% in patients with dyspnea. This suggests that these two chief complaints should be considered extremely high risk, both short and long term, and there is a potential for outcome improvement in these patients.

A major strength of this study is the large study population with complete follow-up due to the Danish Civil Registration System. All adult patients visiting the ED during the inclusion period were eligible, thus minimizing selection bias. Moreover, we included patients during a whole year and thereby avoided bias from seasonal variance.

### Comparison of presenting complaint vs discharge diagnosis for identifying " nonemergency" emergency department visits [^2a8725bc]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Reduction in emergency department (ED) use is frequently viewed as a potential source for cost savings. One consideration has been to deny payment if the patient's diagnosis upon ED discharge appears to reflect a "nonemergency" condition. This approach does not incorporate other clinical factors such as chief complaint that may inform necessity for ED care.

Objective

To determine whether ED presenting complaint and ED discharge diagnosis correspond sufficiently to support use of discharge diagnosis as the basis for policies discouraging ED use.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The New York University emergency department algorithm has been commonly used to identify nonemergency ED visits. We applied the algorithm to publicly available ED visit data from the 2009 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) for the purpose of identifying all "primary care-treatable" visits. The 2009 NHAMCS data set contains 34,942 records, each representing a unique ED visit. For each visit with a discharge diagnosis classified as primary care treatable, we identified the chief complaint. To determine whether these chief complaints correspond to nonemergency ED visits, we then examined all ED visits with this same group of chief complaints to ascertain the ED course, final disposition, and discharge diagnoses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and disposition associated with chief complaints related to nonemergency ED visits.

Results

Although only 6.3% (95% CI, 5.8%-6.7%) of visits were determined to have primary care-treatable diagnoses based on discharge diagnosis and our modification of the algorithm, the chief complaints reported for these ED visits with primary care-treatable ED discharge diagnoses were the same chief complaints reported for 88.7% (95% CI, 88.1%-89.4%) of all ED visits. Of these visits, 11.1% (95% CI, 9.3%-13.0%) were identified at ED triage as needing immediate or emergency care; 12.5% (95% CI, 11.8%-14.3%) required hospital admission; and 3.4% (95% CI, 2.5%-4.3%) of admitted patients went directly from the ED to the operating room.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among ED visits with the same presenting complaint as those ultimately given a primary care-treatable diagnosis based on ED discharge diagnosis, a substantial proportion required immediate emergency care or hospital admission. The limited concordance between presenting complaints and ED discharge diagnoses suggests that these discharge diagnoses are unable to accurately identify nonemergency ED visits.

### Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination [^fb92fc61]. AOA (2023). High credibility.

Comprehensive adult eye and vision examination — patient history and examination procedures state that a comprehensive examination includes an in-depth patient history; tests to thoroughly evaluate the patient's visual function, ocular health, and related systemic health status; an assessment of examination findings; and the development of a plan for treatment/management and future care, and that "Clinicians should remain alert for new and emerging technologies, instruments, and procedures, and incorporate them into the clinical examination, as appropriate". The patient history is an initial and ongoing component of the examination, with the objective to obtain specific information about the patient's perception of their eye and vision status and important background information on related medical issues; it helps to identify and assess problems, provides an opportunity to establish a relationship of confidence and trust, and the collection of demographic data generally precedes the taking of the patient history; major components include the nature and history of the presenting problem (including chief complaint), visual and ocular history, general health history (including a social history and review of systems), and family ocular and health histories; a clinical note adds that some patients may fail to disclose medically-relevant information to clinicians, which can undermine patient care or even lead to patient harm, and nondisclosure may occur because of embarrassment or a desire to avoid potential judgement or lecturing.

### Association between COVID-19 diagnosis and presenting chief complaint from New York city triage data [^33d60131]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

New York City (NYC) is an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Proper triage of patients with possible COVID-19 via chief complaint is critical but not fully optimized. This study aimed to investigate the association between presentation by chief complaints and COVID-19 status.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed adult emergency department (ED) patient visits from five different NYC hospital campuses from March 1, 2020 to May 13, 2020 of patients who underwent nasopharyngeal COVID-19 RT-PCR testing. The positive and negative COVID-19 cohorts were then assessed for different chief complaints obtained from structured triage data. Sub-analysis was performed for patients older than 65 and within chief complaints with high mortality.

Results

Of 11,992 ED patient visits who received COVID-19 testing, 6524/11992 (54.4%) were COVID-19 positive. 73.5% of fever, 67.7% of shortness of breath, and 65% of cough had COVID-19, but others included 57.5% of weakness/fall/altered mental status, 55.5% of glycemic control, and 51.4% of gastrointestinal symptoms. In patients over 65, 76.7% of diarrhea, 73.7% of fatigue, and 69.3% of weakness had COVID-19. 45.5% of dehydration, 40.5% of altered mental status, 27% of fall, and 24.6% of hyperglycemia patients experienced mortality.

Conclusion

A novel high risk COVID-19 patient population was identified from chief complaint data, which is different from current suggested CDC guidelines, and may help triage systems to better isolate COVID-19 patients. Older patients with COVID-19 infection presented with more atypical complaints warranting special consideration. COVID-19 was associated with higher mortality in a unique group of complaints also warranting special consideration.

### Coded chief complaints – automated analysis of free-text complaints [^30ef735e]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe a new chief-complaint categorization schema, the development of a computer text-parsing algorithm to automatically classify free-text chief complaints into this schema, and use of these coded chief complaints to describe the case mix of a community emergency department (ED).

Methods

Coded Chief Complaints for Emergency Department Systems (CCC-EDS) is a new and untested schema of 228 chief complaints, grouped within dimensions of type and system. A computerized text-parsing algorithm for automatically reading and classifying free-text chief complaints into 1 of these 228 coded chief complaints was developed by using a consecutive derivation sample of 46,602 patients who presented to a community teaching-hospital ED in 2004. Descriptive statistics included frequency of patients presenting with the 228 coded chief complaints; percentage of free-text complaints not categorizable by the CCC-EDS; and admission rate, age, and gender differences by chief complaint.

Results

In the derivation sample, the text-parsing algorithm classified 87.5% of 45,329 ED visits with non-null free-text chief complaints into 1 of 194 coded chief complaints. The text-parsing algorithm successfully classified 87.3% of the free-text chief complaints in a validation sample. The five most common coded chief complaints were Abdominal Pain (3,734 visits), Fever (2,234), Chest Pain (2,183), Breathing Difficulty (2,030), and Cuts-Lacerations (2,028).

Conclusions

The CCC-EDS is a new comprehensive, granular, and useful classification schema for categorizing chief complaints in an ED. A CCC-EDS text-parsing algorithm successfully classified the majority of free-text chief complaints from an ED computer log. These coded chief complaints were used to describe the case mix of a community teaching-hospital ED.

### Predicting mortality and readmission based on chief complaint in emergency department patients: a cohort study [^c32491b4]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Study population

All patients 18 years or older attending the ED at Aarhus University Hospital during July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017 were eligible.

The following were the exclusion criteria:

Patients with a planned/elective visit to the ED.
Patients assessed to have a minor injury.
Patients with no triage registered.
Patients registered with more than one specific chief complaint at the same time.

The most acute patients, such as major trauma and surgical and medical emergencies, are received by the coded rapid response teams and are not registered with chief complaint or triage color and are therefore excluded. Included patients were followed up 1 year from the beginning of their first contact to the ED (index contact) using the civil registration number given to all Danish citizens. Repeated ED visits in the follow-up period were regarded as separate contacts.

Exposure

This study uses chief complaint as an exposure. The chief complaint is defined by the specific contact card assigned by the triaging nurse on arrival (figure 1). Included patients who were triaged but not assigned with a specific contact card were allocated to a "no contact reason" group.

Figure 1
Flow chart showing the included contacts. 1 Majority of this group were patients with minor injuries who never got triage-registered. A small fraction is constituted by the most acute patients, such as major trauma and medical and surgical emergencies, who are received by the coded rapid response team and thus not triaged. Exact numbers not known. 2 Index contact was defined by a patient's first contact during the inclusion period. ED, emergency department.

Primary outcomes

The primary outcomes are 30-day mortality and 30-day readmission. Thirty-day mortality was defined as death within 30 days after the index contact start. Thirty-day readmission was defined as a patient being acutely/unplanned admitted to the hospital (hospitalized) between 12 hours and 30 days after discharge from the index contact.

Secondary outcomes

The secondary outcomes are in-hospital mortality, 1-year mortality and 7-day readmission. In-hospital mortality was defined as death during the index contact. 1-year mortality and 7-day readmission, was defined consistent with the above-mentioned conditions. Discharge diagnosis was the International Classification of Disease, tenth revision (ICD-10) diagnosis registered at discharge from the hospital. Patients not being admitted were also given a discharge diagnosis.

### National trends in U.S. emergency department visits for chief complaint of hypertension (2006–15) [^f3811f89]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Hypertension is one of the most common chronic illnesses among adults in the United States. While poor hypertension control is a risk factor for many emergent conditions, asymptomatic hypertension is rarely an emergency. Despite this, patients may present to the emergency department (ED) with a chief complaint of hypertension, and there may be significant variability in the management of these patients. Our objective was to characterize national trends in ED visits for chief complaint of hypertension between 2006 and 2015.

Methods

We used the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from 2006 to 2015 to examine ED visits for chief complaint of hypertension. We examined trends in demographics, diagnostic resource utilization, and clinical management of these patients.

Results

Between 2006 and 2015, visits with hypertension as the primary chief complaint represented 0.6% of all ED visits, or 6,215,787 national-level ED visits. Of these, 63.9% received a primary diagnosis of hypertension. While there was no significant growth in these visits over the study period, 79.3% of visits received any form of diagnostic testing, with 35.5% of patients receiving an antihypertensive medication. Increasing blood pressure and non-white race were associated with increased odds of receiving antihypertensive medications.

Conclusions

Despite clinical policies and guidelines recommending against routine diagnostic testing for asymptomatic hypertension, roughly 4 out of 5 ED visits received diagnostic testing, and more than 1 out of 3 received medications. These visits may represent an opportunity for improvement to reduce overutilization, as well as for innovative approaches as EDs expand their role in care coordination across settings.

### The national capitol region's emergency department syndromic surveillance system: do chief complaint and discharge diagnosis yield different results? [^be7551dd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Table 2 shows counts of concordant and discordant visits. Sepsis had only one concordant visit, which was the only visit coded as sepsis by chief complaint. Another 17 visits were coded as sepsis by discharge diagnosis only. Seven (41%) were coded as "other" by chief complaint, and the remaining 10 chief complaints (59%) were distributed throughout the syndromes.

Table 2

a Resp, respiratory; GI, gastrointestinal; UI, unspecified infection; Neur, neurologic. b Areas in bold indicate counts of visits with concordant results for both data types.

Neurologic syndrome had 2 concordant visits and 41 discordant visits. Among the 30 discordant visits coded neurologic for chief complaint but not for discharge diagnosis, the most common chief complaint was altered or decreased mental status and level of consciousness (21/30; 70%). Discharge diagnoses for these 30 visits included syncope, sepsis, and other infections; cerebral vascular events or asymmetric weakness in a person > 50 years of age; hypoglycemia; and cancer. Eleven discordant visits were coded neurologic for discharge diagnosis only. Nine of these had chief complaints coded "other", including three patients with Bell's palsy with chief complaints of facial numbness and three patients with psychiatric chief complaints but discharge diagnoses of change in mental status.

Results

Study population and patient characteristics

During the study period 41 470 contacts were registered at the ED. A total of 19 325 (47%) were included in the study (figure 1). Hereof there were 15 369 index contacts, defined by a patient's first contact during the inclusion period. Thus, 22 145 (53%) contacts were excluded: 2377 (6%) elective contacts, 10 346 (25%) with minor injuries, 7960 (19%) not registered with triage color and 1462 (2.5%) assigned with two different chief complaints. Among the patients who received two chief complaints, the most frequent chief complaints were head and face symptoms (318), extremity injury (261) and dyspnea (211).

Patient characteristics and the distribution of chief complaints are shown in table 1.

### High-risk chief complaints III: neurologic emergencies [^6189da1c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

A careful history and thorough physical examination are necessary in patients presenting with acute neurologic dysfunction. Patients presenting with headache should be screened for red-flag criteria that suggest a dangerous secondary cause warranting imaging and further diagnostic workup. Dizziness is a vague complaint; focusing on timing, triggers, and examination findings can help reduce diagnostic error. Most patients presenting with back pain do not require emergent imaging, but those with new neurologic deficits or signs/symptoms concerning for acute infection or cord compression warrant MRI. Delay to diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke is a frequent reason for medical malpractice claims.

### Predicting mortality and readmission based on chief complaint in emergency department patients: a cohort study [^dad26239]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study presents data on mortality and readmission among different chief complaints presented to the ED. We found that ALOC, dyspnea and GI bleeding had the highest 30-day mortality, and fever/infection, dyspnea, and nausea, vomiting and diarrhea had the highest 30-day readmission. Dyspnea was very frequent and associated with both high mortality and readmission compared with other chief complaints. Chest pain was found to be relatively frequent and had the lowest mortality. Second, we looked at discharge diagnoses among the 10 chief complaints with the highest 30-day mortality and found that each chief complaint had various discharge diagnoses across the ICD-10 chapters, with the unspecific R-diagnoses frequently represented.

In the present study, the overall 30-day mortality was 3% and differed significantly among the chief complaints, which is in line with Nielsen et al in a similar study including medical ED patients. Moreover, we found an overall 30-day readmission of 6.5%, which also differed significantly among the chief complaints. Previous studies have mainly focused on readmission based on discharge diagnosis; however, few studies have described short-term readmission/revisit in the ED, but the definitions of "readmission" and "revisit" differ and are often used interchangeably, making comparison difficult. Furthermore, organization of the health system also plays a major role in terms of readmission.

ALOC had the highest 30-day mortality (8.4%, OR = 2.0). This chief complaint is not included in previous studies comparing ED chief complaints; however, this finding is supported by Völk et al, who found an in-hospital mortality of 10% among patients presenting to the ED with ALOC. The higher mortality found by Völk et al may be explained by only including unknown reasons for ALOC. In the present study, ALOC was not one of the most common chief complaints and only represented 2.6% of the study population. In addition, it was not associated with a significantly higher readmission. ALOC is acknowledged as an unspecific but critical condition associated with various causes, for example, intoxication, trauma and vascular emergencies. Correspondingly we found a diverse distribution of discharge diagnoses among patients with ALOC; however, the unspecific R-diagnoses were most used (21.5%).

### Positive predictive value of an elevated cardiac troponin for type I myocardial infarction in ED patients based on the chief complaint [^4c0fe46b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiac troponin testing is used to aid the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) in the emergency department (ED) for patients who present with a range of symptoms. From a clinical perspective, the distinction between MI due to acute coronary artery thrombosis (type I MI) and other forms of direct and secondary myocardial injury (type II MI) is very important. However, the positive predictive value (PPV) of an elevated troponin for diagnosing type I MI, based on clinical history, has not been described. The objective of this study was to determine the PPV of an elevated troponin for type I MI based on the ED chief complaint.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1772 consecutive patients who had a troponin ordered in the ED at a tertiary care center over the period of March 1, 2013, to April 30, 2013. The chief complaint was based on official ED coding. For patients with a positive troponin, 2 authors independently reviewed the electronic medical record pertaining to the index encounter and subsequent hospitalization to adjudicate the cause.

Results

There was a significant association between the PPV of an elevated troponin for type I MI and the chief complaint. Patients with a chief complaint of chest pain were significantly more likely to have a type I MI compared to those without (PPV 84% vs 20%; Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR), 14.31; P < .0001). There was also a significant association between the rate of type I MI and the chief complaint in all patients who had a troponin drawn. Patients with a chief complaint of chest pain were significantly more likely to have a type I MI compared to those without (PPV 9.8% vs 1.3%; AOR, 7.34; P < .0001).

Conclusion

Applying information on the PPV of troponin for type I MI based on the clinical history could improve troponin utilization and clinical decision making.

### Cherry picking patients: examining the interval between patient rooming and resident self-assignment [^8f8299e2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed to evaluate the association between patient chief complaint and the time interval between patient rooming and resident physician self-assignment ("pickup time"). We hypothesized that significant variation in pickup time would exist based on chief complaint, thereby uncovering resident preferences in patient presentations.

Methods

A retrospective medical record review was performed on consecutive patients at a single, academic, university-based emergency department with over 50,000 visits per year. All patients who presented from August 1, 2012, to July 31, 2013, and were initially seen by a resident were included in the analysis. Patients were excluded if not seen primarily by a resident or if registered with a chief complaint associated with trauma team activation. Data were abstracted from the electronic health record (EHR). The outcome measured was "pickup time", defined as the time interval between room assignment and resident self-assignment. We examined all complaints with > 100 visits, with the remaining complaints included in the model in an "other" category. A proportional hazards model was created to control for the following prespecified demographic and clinical factors: age, race, sex, arrival mode, admission vital signs, Emergency Severity Index code, waiting room time before rooming, and waiting room census at time of rooming.

Results

Of the 30,382 patients eligible for the study, the median time to pickup was 6 minutes (interquartile range = 2–15 minutes). After controlling for the above factors, we found systematic and significant variation in the pickup time by chief complaint, with the longest times for patients with complaints of abdominal problems, numbness/tingling, and vaginal bleeding and shortest times for patients with ankle injury, allergic reaction, and wrist injury.

Conclusions

A consistent variation in resident pickup time exists for common chief complaints. We suspect that this reflects residents preferentially choosing patients with simpler workups and less perceived diagnostic ambiguity. This work introduces pickup time as a metric that may be useful in the future to uncover and address potential physician bias. Further work is necessary to establish whether practice patterns in this study are carried beyond residency and persist among attendings in the community and how these patterns are shaped by the information presented via the EHR.

### Natural language generation for electronic health records [^a37281b1]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Epidemiological validity

In addition to achieving reasonably high scores on the translation metrics above, the synthetic chief complaints are also able to preserve some but not all of the epidemiological information encoded in the original record-sentence pairs. For example, the abbreviation "preg" appears in the authentic chief complaints for 134 females but for 0 males, and it appears in the synthetic chief complaints for 44 females but also for 0 males. Similarly, "overdose" has the exact same distribution by 2 age groups in both the authentic and the synthetic chief complaints, appearing 10 times for patients aged 20–24 but 0 times for those between 5 and 9. We take these patterns as rough indications that the model can learn to avoid generating highly improbable word-variable pairs.

Extending this line of analysis to crude odds ratios (ORs) shows similar, though not identical, effects. To illustrate this point, we examine falls, which are a leading cause of injury among older adults, and which we expect to differ in distribution by age. The authentic data bear this expectation out: in the authentic chief complaints, the word "fall" is nearly 8 times more likely to appear for patients who are over 80 years of age (207 of 2234 patients reporting) than for those between 20 and 24 years of age (48 of 4009 patients reporting). We see a similar pattern in the synthetic chief complaints, although the association is much stronger, with the older patients being about 15 times more likely to report a fall than the younger patients (229 vs. 27 patients reporting, respectively). We speculate on reasons for this increase in the discussion — it is not unique to falls and appears to be a direct result of the model's particular optimization goal — but we note here that odds of older patients receiving an actual diagnosis of a fall (CCS code 2603) relative to the younger patients falls between these 2 extremes (OR = 12.71).

### Predicting mortality and readmission based on chief complaint in emergency department patients: a cohort study [^2e28e08a]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

The study has some limitations. First, we excluded 7960 contacts not registered with a triage color. However, a review of the discharge diagnoses of these contacts revealed that the vast majority belonged to the minor injury group and thus correctly excluded. A minority of the contacts encompassed patients dying at the hospital (n = 237), with the most frequent diagnoses being intracranial injury and cardiac arrest. These contacts represent the most acute patients attending the ED and are prehospitally reported as "major trauma", "surgical or medical emergency" and received by coded rapid response teams and thus not triaged at arrival. The exclusion of the most acute patients causes selection bias and will most likely underestimate the mortality rates, especially in the chest pain group, the ALOC group and the focal neurological symptoms group.

Second, the classification of chief complaint might be imprecise and thereby add random error. Many patients present with several complaintsand it may be difficult to determine the most appropriate chief complaint in an acute situation. Furthermore, in case of several symptoms, there are, to date, no guidelines on how to prioritize symptoms, thus placing the decision on the triaging nurse, which implies a risk to the patient of being assigned a misleading chief complaint — a potential source of misclassification. Also, chief complaint combinations/interactions may be an important factor in identifying high-risk ED patients. This is not touched on in this study due to the exclusion of patients assigned with two specific chief complaints. This is an area of interest in future research.

Third, we included a group with no chief complaint registered. The discharge diagnoses of this group indicated that it was a heterogenous group of medical and surgical patients and with different triage colors. The reason why these patients were not given a chief complaint is unknown. One possible explanation could be that the patients' presenting symptoms were unspecific and none of the chief complaints predefined by DEPT fitted. However, lack of registration of chief complaint is another possible explanation and it is therefore another potential source of misclassification.

This is a single-center study and the result cannot therefore by definition be directly generalized to other EDs. However, the study population was comparable with other ED studies in terms of age, gender, admission rate and mortality, indicating that the results can be generalizable. This said, it is important to notice that the generalizability is limited due to the Danish set-up where patients suspected of cardiac arrest due to thrombosis, STEMI or stroke are not seen in the ED, but directly sent to a specialized department.

### Predicting mortality and readmission based on chief complaint in emergency department patients: a cohort study [^ba0a8031]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Readmission

For readmission analysis another 213 index contacts were excluded due to in-hospital death and a total of 14 839 index contacts were analyzed (table 3).

Table 3
Readmission and revisit analysis showing chief complaints with more than 150 index contacts, ranked by 30-day readmission (primary outcome)

Overall, 6.5% (CI 6.1 to 6.9) were readmitted and 6.4% had an ED revisit without admission within 30 days. As for mortality, the 30-day readmission differed significantly among the chief complaints. Five chief complaints had a 30-day readmission of more than 10%, with fever/infection having the highest at 11.7% (95% CI 9.4 to 14.4), followed by dyspnea (11.2%, 95% CI 9.4 to 13.2), nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (10.8%, 95% CI 6.6 to 16.3), and abdominal symptoms (10.2%, 95% CI 8.7 to 11.8).

After adjustment, the highest odds of being readmitted within 30 days were seen in abdominal symptoms (2.0, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.4), fever/infection (1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.4), skin and mucosal symptoms (1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.9) and dyspnea (1.7, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.0).

Diagnoses

Table 4 illustrates that the 10 chief complaints with the highest 30-day mortality had various discharge diagnoses. Moreover, it shows that all chief complaints except GI bleeding had discharge diagnoses within each of the 10 most common ICD-10 chapters.

Table 4

Furthermore, it stands out in the table that R-diagnoses (symptoms, signs, abnormal results of clinical or other investigative procedures, and ill-defined conditions regarding which no diagnosis classifiable elsewhere is recorded, eg, dyspnea and chest pain) were given to more than 15% of the patients at discharge within all of the shown chief complaints, except fever/infection and extremity symptoms without injury.

### The relationship between a chief complaint of "altered mental status" and delirium in older emergency department patients [^35f19ee5]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Altered mental status is a common chief complaint among older emergency department (ED) patients. Patients with this chief complaint are likely delirious, but to the authors' knowledge, this relationship has not been well characterized. Additionally, health care providers frequently ascribe "altered mental status" to other causes, such as dementia, psychosis, or depression.

Objectives

The objective was to determine the relationship between altered mental status as a chief complaint and delirium.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study designed to validate three brief delirium assessments, conducted from July 2009 to March 2012. English-speaking patients who were 65 years or older and in the ED for < 12 hours were included. Patients who were comatose or nonverbal or unable to follow simple commands prior to the acute illness were excluded. Chief complaints were obtained from the ED nurse triage assessment. The reference standard for delirium was a comprehensive psychiatrist assessment using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision criteria. Sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR), and negative LR with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the psychiatrist's assessment as the reference standard.

Results

A total of 406 patients were enrolled. The median age was 73.5 years old (interquartile range [IQR] = 69 to 80 years), 202 (49.8%) were female, 57 (14.0%) were nonwhite race, and 50 (12.3%) had delirium. Twenty-three (5.7%) of the cohort had chief complaints of altered mental status. The presence of this chief complaint was 38.0% sensitive (95% CI = 25.9% to 51.9%) and 98.9% specific (95% CI = 97.2% to 99.6%). The negative LR was 0.63 (95% CI = 0.50 to 0.78), and the positive LR was 33.82 (95% CI = 11.99 to 95.38).

Conclusions

The absence of a chief complaint of altered mental status should not reassure the clinician that delirium is absent. This syndrome will be missed unless it is actively looked for using a validated delirium assessment. However, patients with this chief complaint are highly likely to be delirious, and no additional delirium assessment is necessary.

### A foundational triage system for improving accuracy in moderate acuity level emergency classifications [^e76f2bf9]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Data introduction

Our data consists of tabular data and chief complaints. All triage data was collected as patients arrive in the emergency department. The tabular data consists of demographics (age and gender), vital signs, and method of admission. Vital signs consist of seven parameters, namely body temperature, heart rate, respiration, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, SPO2 and consciousness. These measurements are taken and recorded by emergency department nurses during the triage process when a patient presents in the emergency department, all of which are mandatory according to the triage system. Method of admission refers to the way patients come to the emergency department of a hospital, which is also mandatory according to the triage system. As for the chief complaints, they are also mandatory according to the triage system, and consist of a series of symptoms chosen by nurses from a predefined presenting symptoms list. We set the maximum length of the chief complaint to 80. If a patient's chief complaint had more than 80 words, we only took the first 80 words; Otherwise, zero padding was used to satisfy the length requirement. Some patient records had missing vital signs or chief complaints, and these samples were transferred to the missing sample dataset. When conducting overall performance comparison, we only use complete samples as input, while incomplete samples are considered only in the study on handling missing data.

### Pediatric appendicitis: association of chief complaint with missed appendicitis [^4bcbd363]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

We evaluated the association between the emergency department (ED) triage chief complaint and rate of missed appendicitis in children.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who presented to a pediatric ED and were diagnosed with appendicitis over 5 years (July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2014). We reviewed the medical record for any additional ED visits in the 7 days preceding the diagnosis of appendicitis. Triage chief complaints were classified as "suggestive of appendicitis" (abdominal pain, right lower quadrant pain, or rule out appendicitis) or "nonspecific" (fever, vomiting, dehydration, etc). We evaluated the association between triage chief complaint and missed diagnosis of appendicitis.

Results

We reviewed 1680 patients with appendicitis. In 67 (4%) cases, patients had at least 1 additional ED visit during the week preceding the diagnosis of appendicitis. When comparing those diagnosed with appendicitis at their initial ED visit to those diagnosed after multiple visits, we found no difference in age (9.9 vs 10.1 years, P = 0.665), sex (55.7% vs 49.3% male, P = 0.291), white blood cell count (14.4 vs 12.3 × 10³/L, P = 0.115), or presence of fever (19.9% vs 19.4%, P = 0.920). Of patients with a triage chief complaint that was suggestive of appendicitis, 3.8% were missed on their initial ED visit versus 8.8% of those with a nonspecific triage chief complaint (odds ratio, 2.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–5.6).

Conclusions

A triage chief complaint less suggestive of appendicitis was associated with a higher rate of missed appendicitis in a pediatric ED. Our findings further confirm the potential impact of anchoring bias by a triage chief complaint when attempting to diagnose appendicitis.

### Use of patient complaints to identify diagnosis-related safety concerns: a mixed-method evaluation [^5403905a]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

Background

Patient complaints are associated with adverse events and malpractice claims but underused in patient safety improvement.

Objective

To systematically evaluate the use of patient complaint data to identify safety concerns related to diagnosis as an initial step to using this information to facilitate learning and improvement.

Methods

We reviewed patient complaints submitted to Geisinger, a large healthcare organisation in the USA, from August to December 2017 (cohort 1) and January to June 2018 (cohort 2). We selected complaints more likely to be associated with diagnostic concerns in Geisinger's existing complaint taxonomy. Investigators reviewed all complaint summaries and identified cases as 'concerning' for diagnostic error using the National Academy of Medicine's definition of diagnostic error. For all 'concerning' cases, a clinician-reviewer evaluated the associated investigation report and the patient's medical record to identify any missed opportunities in making a correct or timely diagnosis. In cohort 2, we selected a 10% sample of 'concerning' cases to test this smaller pragmatic sample as a proof of concept for future organisational monitoring.

Results

In cohort 1, we reviewed 1865 complaint summaries and identified 177 (9.5%) concerning reports. Review and analysis identified 39 diagnostic errors. Most were categorised as 'Clinical Care issues' (27, 69.2%), defined as concerns/questions related to the care that is provided by clinicians in any setting. In cohort 2, we reviewed 2423 patient complaint summaries and identified 310 (12.8%) concerning reports. The 10% sample (n = 31 cases) contained five diagnostic errors. Qualitative analysis of cohort 1 cases identified concerns about return visits for persistent and/or worsening symptoms, interpersonal issues and diagnostic testing.

Conclusions

Analysis of patient complaint data and corresponding medical record review identifies patterns of failures in the diagnostic process reported by patients and families. Health systems could systematically analyse available data on patient complaints to monitor diagnostic safety concerns and identify opportunities for learning and improvement.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^5c75f3fa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — transfer of care documentation specifies that if provision of the completed medical record is not possible at the time of transfer of care, a verbal report and an abbreviated written run report should be provided to the next caregiver, and the information provided during the transfer of care should include, but is not limited to, Patient's full name, Age, Chief complaint, History of present illness/Mechanism of injury, Past medical history, Medications, Allergies, Vital signs with documented times, and Patient assessment and interventions along with the timing of any medication or intervention and the patient's response to such interventions; the verbal or abbreviated written run report provided at the time of transfer of care does not take the place of or negate the requirement for the provision of a complete electronic or written medical record of the care provided by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy [^3b72940d]. The Spine Journal (2014). Medium credibility.

Lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy — introduction and scope state that the guideline provides evidence-based recommendations to address key clinical questions surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy and was developed as an educational tool to assist practitioners who treat these patients. The patient population encompasses adults (18 years or older) with a chief complaint of leg pain, numbness or weakness in a dermatomal or myotomal distribution as a result of a primary lumbar disc herniation. The document clarifies that it does not represent a "standard of care", is not a fixed treatment protocol, should not be seen as prescribing the type, frequency or duration of intervention, and should not be used as the sole reason for denial of treatment and services.

### The provision of diagnosis at emergency department discharge: a pilot study [^95f7d015]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Understanding the cause of patients' symptoms usually involves identification of a pathological diagnosis. Anecdotal reports suggest that emergency department (ED) providers do not prioritise giving pathological diagnoses, and often reiterate the patient's symptom as the discharge 'diagnosis'. Our pilot study sought to identify the proportion of patients at a large teaching hospital who receive a symptomatic versus pathological diagnosis at ED discharge.

Methods

We performed a chart review of all adult patients who were discharged from an urban ED in the USA, with an 88,000 annual visit volume. All charts of patients presenting with the three most common ED chief complaints (chest pain, abdominal pain and headache) were reviewed by two reviewers. Charts were coded as either symptomatic or pathological diagnosis based on the discharge diagnosis provided by the attending physician. Those with discrepant coding by the two reviewers were subject to review by a third adjudicator.

Results

797 charts met the inclusion criteria. Five charts (0.6%) were coded differently by the two reviewers; a discussion with the third reviewer resulted in consensus in all cases. For patients presenting with chest pain, abdominal pain and headache, the proportion that received a pathological ED discharge diagnosis were 17%, 43% and 41%, respectively.

Conclusions

According to our pilot study, most patients are discharged from the ED without a pathological diagnosis that explains the likely cause of their symptoms. Future studies will investigate whether this finding is consistent across institutions, and whether provision of a pathological diagnosis affects clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction.

### Elderly patients with non-specific complaints at the emergency department have a high risk for admission and 30-days mortality [^e00ebedd]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Older adults have complex medical needs that causes increased use of resources at the emergency department (ED). The prevalence of non-specific complaint (NSC) as a chief-complaint in the ED is common among older adults and is not prioritized even though possibly having worse clinical outcome. The objective was to study hospital admission and mortality for older adults visiting the ED with NSC compared to specific complaints such as dyspnea, chest pain and abdominal pain.

Methods

A retrospective observational study of older adults visiting the ED with NSC and specific complaints; dyspnea, chest pain and abdominal pain was performed. Chief-complaint were collected from electronic medical records. Fatigue, confusion, non-specific complaints, generalized weakness and risk of falling were defined as non-specific complaint (NSC) when registered as chief-complaint at the ED. Admission rate and 30-days mortality were the primary outcomes.

Results

A total of 4927 patients were included in the study based on chief-complaint; patients with chest pain 1599 (32%), dyspnea 1343 (27%), abdominal pain 1460 (30%) and NSC 525 (11%). Patients with dyspnea and NSC had the highest hospital admission rate 79% vs 70% compared to patients with chest pain (63%) and abdominal pain (61%) (p = < 0.001). Patients with NSC had a mean LOS 4.7 h at the ED which was significantly higher compared to chest pain, dyspnea and abdominal pain. Mean bed-days for the whole population was 4.2 days compared to patients with NSC who had a mean LOS of 5.6 days. NSC and dyspnea were both associated with the highest 30-day mortality.

Conclusion

Older patients who present with NSC at the ED are associated with a high risk for admission and 30-days mortality. In addition, patients with NSC have a longer LOS at the ED, a high admission rate and the highest number of bed-days once admitted. This study indicates that ED staff should be more vigilant when an elderly patient presents with NSC at the ED. Further studies and guidelines are needed to improve the management of these individuals.

### Elderly patients with non-specific complaints at the emergency department have a high risk for admission and 30-days mortality [^8ad93d32]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

In the study, it is not possible to evaluate the degree of acuity or morbidity in terms other than the number of comorbidities. Nor can frailty be assessed, which is likely to be of decisive importance in this patient group. Trauma is a common diagnosis in the ED and was not included as a chief complaint in this study. The intention was to identify NSC and compare them with chief complaints that are judged to be relatively serious in the ED and where there are guidelines on how these patients should be managed at ED. Trauma has a wide variety of conditions and was not assessed being not appropriate in this regard.

The terminologies fatigue, altered mental status, falling, generalized weakness and non-specific complaints to define NSC could have been somewhat restrictive and leading to lower acceptance rate. However, these chief-complaint used compiled to a high rate compared to others and the purpose was not to overlap to specific complaint associated with specific diseases such as vertigo and neurology.

It should be emphasized that the results in this study are only associations, and it is not possible to draw any conclusions regarding causality.

### Visual analog scale questionnaire to assess quality of life specific to each symptom of the international prostate symptom score [^38653a8b]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We assessed patient quality of life specific to each of the 7 items on the International Prostate Symptom Score, as evaluated with a novel visual analog scale questionnaire.

Materials and Methods

A total of 246 male patients with a chief complaint of lower urinary tract symptom were asked to complete the International Prostate Symptom Score and visual analog scale questionnaires to assess bother or satisfaction regarding patient quality of life specific to each of the 7 items on the International Prostate Symptom Score.

Results

An item with the maximum visual analog scale measure matched the chief complaint in 169 patients (69%). In contrast, the chief complaint failed to match to an item with the most severe International Prostate Symptom Score in 104 patients (42%) (p = 0.012). Multiple regression analysis to define the best predictor of International Prostate Symptom Score quality of life score of the 14 items, including International Prostate Symptom Score and visual analog scale, revealed that the best predictor was the visual analog scale measure for nocturia (p = 0.0003), followed by visual analog scale measures for frequency (p = 0.0004) and incomplete emptying (p = 0.01). After alpha-blocker treatment improvement in the visual analog scale measure for the chief complaint correlated better with improvement in the International Prostate Symptom Score quality of life score than the change in International Prostate Symptom Score. The overall test-retest correlation for the visual analog scale questionnaire in 55 healthy elderly men and 44 patients with lower urinary tract symptoms was 0.772 and 0.742, respectively (p < 0.00001).

Conclusions

The novel visual analog scale measure of quality of life specific to each of the 7 items on the International Prostate Symptom Score has a significant impact on identifying the patient chief complaint as well as on patient specific quality of life. Our study supports the concomitant use of the International Prostate Symptom Score and visual analog scale questionnaires.

### Presenting complaint: use of language that disempowers patients [^092a512e]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Language that belittles patients

Some language used in clinical practice implicitly casts doubt on patients' experiences or infers a degree of petulance. One such term — presenting complaint — is so central to the patient-doctor encounter that many will have stopped hearing the words for what they are. Complain has negative connotations, and use of "problem" or "concern" instead has been suggested as more sympathetic. But not all patients have symptoms that are causing concern. A patient may, for example, be seeking to understand the cause of an untroublesome lump. It would be more neutral to refer to a patient's reason for engaging with healthcare (which could include diagnosing or treating a symptom, managing a condition, proactively planning for life changes, or preventing future complications).

In medical documentation, doctors sometimes use language that questions the authenticity of a patient's symptoms. For example, they often translate the reported absence of symptoms or experiences as the patient "denying" symptoms — for example, "patient denies fever, chills, or night sweats". To deny is to refuse to admit the truth or existence of something, and the term can hint at untrustworthiness. In a study examining reactions to outpatient notes, patients responded negatively to language that questioned the validity of their experiences. One patient stated: "I did not deny these things. I said I didn't feel them. Completely different. Language matters". Similarly, writing, "patient claims pain is 10/10" instead of "patient experiencing 10/10 pain" implies a degree of disbelief. Other phrases that cast doubt on the validity of the patient's experience have also been criticised.

It is, of course, sometimes appropriate for a clinician to exercise some scepticism about a patient's account (for example, when a patient asserts that they have not taken any illicit substances but a urine toxicology screen gives positive results). But the terms denies and claims are widely used in situations where there is no reasonable basis for such doubt, probably out of (bad) habit rather than any disbelief. By contrast, physician observations are usually described as "note", "observe", or "find". Clinicians record their (somewhat subjective) perception of the presence or absence of signs on examination yet it is rarely documented as, "Dr claimed to hear diastolic murmur".

### An unusual case of a central nervous system tumor presenting as a chief complaint of depression [^6155d412]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Patients presenting to the emergency department with a psychiatric chief complaint often undergo a medical clearance examination. There is much debate in the literature as to the value of routine laboratory and other diagnostic studies in the initial evaluation of these patients. We report on a patient presenting to the pediatric emergency department with a chief complaint of depression who ultimately was found to have diabetes insipidus and a primary intracranial germ cell tumor. Although a rare outcome to a relatively common scenario in the emergency department, this case underscores the value of a detailed history, careful physical examination, and consideration of laboratory and other diagnostic studies in patients presenting to the emergency department for psychiatric evaluation.

The document emphasizes that "THIS GUIDELINE DOES NOT REPRESENT A 'STANDARD OF CARE', nor is it intended as a fixed treatment protocol" and that "Treatment should be based on the individual patient's need and doctor's professional judgment". The target population "encompasses adults (18 years or older) with a chief complaint of low back pain and/or lower extremity symptoms related to spinal stenosis and degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis", and the guideline "outlines conservative treatment options for adult patients with this diagnosis".

Table 3 — Potential red flags for labor or sex trafficking/exploitation (T/E) detail concerning features spanning presentation, complaints, history, and exam. Initial presentation may include being accompanied by a domineering adult who does not allow the child to answer questions, an unrelated adult, or peers and only 1 other adult; inconsistent information from the patient or companion; delay in seeking care; or the patient being a poor historian from sleep deprivation or drug intoxication. Chief complaints that raise concern include acute assault (sexual or physical), work-related trauma or toxic exposure, mental and emotional health issues, genitourinary symptoms or signs, and substance use or ingestion. Historical factors include multiple sexually transmitted infections, previous pregnancy or termination, frequent visits for emergency contraception, frequent substance use, prior sexual abuse, assault, or other maltreatment, and recent immigration with lack of local language proficiency or undocumented status. Physical findings include withdrawn, fearful, hostile, or suspicious demeanor; evidence of malnutrition; untreated chronic disease or injury; evidence suggestive of inflicted injury; signs of substance use or abuse (eg, nonmedical use); dental trauma or evidence of neglect; possession of expensive items inconsistent with the rest of the presentation; and constantly checking the phone, appearing anxious or afraid.

### A test of syndromic surveillance using a severe acute respiratory syndrome model [^2cfbffea]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

We describe a field simulation that was conducted using volunteers to assess the ability of 3 hospitals in a network to manage a large influx of patients with a potentially communicable disease. This drill provided the opportunity to evaluate the ability of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's (NYC-DOHMH) emergency department chief complaint syndromic surveillance system to detect a cluster of patients with febrile respiratory illness.

Methods

The evaluation was a prospective simulation. The clinical picture was modeled on severe acute respiratory syndrome symptoms. Forty-four volunteers participated in the drill as mock patients.

Results

Records from 42 patients (95%) were successfully transmitted to the NYC-DOHMH. The electronic chief complaint for 24 (57%) of these patients indicated febrile or respiratory illness. The drill did not generate a statistical signal in the NYC-DOHMH SaTScan analysis. The 42 drill patients were classified in 8 hierarchical categories based on chief complaints: sepsis (2), cold (3), diarrhea (2), respiratory (20), fever/flu (4), vomit (3), and other (8). The number of respiratory visits, while elevated on the day of the drill, did not appear particularly unusual when compared with the 14-day baseline period used for spatial analyses.

Conclusions

This drill with a cluster of patients with febrile respiratory illness failed to trigger a signal from the NYC-DOHMH emergency department chief complaint syndromic surveillance system. This highlighted several limitations and challenges to syndromic surveillance monitoring.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^a6885baa]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Emergency department (ED) elevated blood pressure without prior diagnosis — prospective cohort follow-up found that 407 patients with elevated blood pressure measurement in the ED and no previous diagnosis of hypertension were classified according to JNC criteria (stage I, II, or III) and prospectively followed; the proportion of patients with at least 1 abnormal measurement in follow-up increased with increasing stage of initial blood pressure and pain as a chief complaint was unrelated to likelihood of having an elevated blood pressure in follow-up; only 65% of patients had repeat blood pressure measurements at follow-up and the authors concluded that patients with a single elevated blood pressure measurement in the ED are at risk for diagnosis of primary hypertension and should be referred for follow-up evaluations.

### Characteristics of youth agreeing to electronic sexually transmitted infection risk assessment in the emergency department [^02287867]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Adolescents and young adults are at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We previously reported an increase in STI testing of adolescents in our ED by obtaining a sexual history using an Audio-enhanced Computer-Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI). We now examine associations among demographics, sexual behaviour, chief complaint and willingness to be tested.

Methods

This was a prospective study conducted in a paediatric ED between April and December 2011. After triage, eligible patients between 15 and 21 years presenting with non-life-threatening conditions were asked to participate in the study. Consenting participants used an ACASI to provide their demographic data and answer questions about their sexual history and willingness to be tested. Our primary outcome was the association of demographics, chief complaint and ACASI recommendation with the participant's willingness to be tested.

Results

We approached 1337 patients, of whom 800 (59%) enrolled and completed the ACASI. Eleven who did not answer questions related to their sexual history were excluded from analysis. Of 789 participants, 461 (58.4%) were female and median age was 16.9 years (IQR 16.0–17.8); 509 (64.5%) endorsed a history of anal, oral and/or vaginal intercourse. Disclosing a sexual history and willingness to be tested did not differ significantly by gender. 131 (16.6%) had a chief complaint potentially referable to an STI; among the 658 participants with non-STI-related complaints, 412 (62.6%) were sexually active, many of whom disclosed risky behaviours, including multiple partners (46.4%) and inconsistent condom use (43.7%). The ACASI identified 419 patients as needing immediate STI testing; the majority (81%) did not have a chief complaint potentially related to STIs. 697 (88.3%) participants were willing to receive STI testing. Most (94.6%) of the patients with STI-related complaints were willing to be tested, and 92.1% of patients with a recommendation for immediate testing by the ACASI indicated a willingness to be tested.

Conclusions

Adolescents were willing to disclose sexual activity via electronic questionnaires and were willing to receive STI testing, even when their chief complaint was not STI related. The ACASI facilitated identification of adolescent ED patients needing STI testing regardless of chief complaint.

### Use of patient complaints to identify diagnosis-related safety concerns: a mixed-method evaluation [^94d50e43]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

Qualitative analysis

Thirty-nine MOD patient complaints from cohort 1 were included in the final qualitative content analysis. On review of the summary statement and the investigation report text, three commonalities emerged across cases despite heterogeneity among diagnoses. These included: (1) reports of return visits for same or worsening symptoms (the most salient; n = 24); (2) interpersonal issues; and (3) diagnostic testing issues. Return visits involved patient-reported situations such as initial treat-and-release ED visits for a symptom (eg, abdominal pain), followed by an ED return visit where a more certain diagnosis (eg, appendicitis) was made. From the patient/caregiver perspective, several reasons for such return visits emerged within this theme: first visit was not helpful, concerns that patient was not heard, limited or no testing performed and concerns with notification of test results. Of this subset, five complaints involved more than one return visit to resolve the patient's concerns.

Eighteen of the cases included comments related to interpersonal problems (eg, ignoring patient/caregiver suggestions). Testing issues were also found across 12 of the cases and included patient/caregiver concerns regarding perceptions of overtesting and undertesting, not communicating or acting on abnormal test results and imaging misreads. Other concerns were related to perceptions of being discharged too soon (n = 4) and challenges in obtaining urgent referral for symptoms (n = 1).

### Learning from complaints in healthcare: a realist review of academic literature, policy evidence and front-line insights [^dbf39710]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2020). High credibility.

Methods

Stage 1. Identifying the aim of the review: literature screening and lay partner codesign

The aim of this review was shaped by initial literature screening and patient lay partner involvement. Academic and policy evidence was screened to capture procedures and policy involved in healthcare complaints management and to understand patient priorities for how their complaint is handled by healthcare settings. The limited volume of complaints literature allowed for literature searching based on broad search terms (eg, 'healthcare complaints' or 'patient complaints'). Searches were conducted between February 2018 and July 2019, and included academic (ie, PubMed, Google Scholar, Medline) and England-based policy searches (ie, government archives (UK), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Social Care Institute for Excellence, General Medical Council (UK), Care Quality Commission, Parliamentary Health and Social Care Ombudsman). Further sources were included based on reference list screening. Articles were excluded if older than 15 years, if not written in English or if they discussed informal complaints that do not require a formal response (such as online or verbal complaints). Policy sources were excluded if they were older than 5 years, did not include primary data or if they included a small sample size (eg, less than 15 interviewees or 30 complaints). A total of 216 sources were identified and screened, of which 164 sources initially met the inclusion criteria (for further review in stage 3).

To shape the review's focus, we first conducted a rapid review of academic studies that directly explored remedies sought by complainants when they submit a complaint to healthcare settings or regulators (n = 9; table 1).

Table 1
Summary of evidence on complainants' main remedies sought in healthcare (stage 1)

Literature screening was then discussed with patient lay partners (three participants in an initial workshop; two in each of two follow-up sessions) to determine the aim of the review and articulate key programme theories to be explored. Lay partners highlighted the accessibility of complaint procedures as an important part of complaint handling which was therefore included in the review.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (update) [^7a2fe0a3]. The Spine Journal (2013). Medium credibility.

Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (NASS guideline) defines the target population and intended use: The patient population "encompasses adults (18 years or older) with a chief complaint of neurogenic claudication without associated spondylolisthesis", and the guideline "outlines a reasonable evaluation of patients suspected to have degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis and outlines treatment options for adult patients with a diagnosis of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis". Its objective is "to provide evidence-based recommendations to address key clinical questions surrounding the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis", and it was "developed by the North American Spine Society Evidence-based Guideline Development Committee as an educational tool to assist practitioners who treat patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis". Use is explicitly limited: "THIS GUIDELINE DOES NOT REPRESENT A "STANDARD OF CARE", nor is it intended as a fixed treatment protocol", and "Treatment should be based on the individual patient's needs and doctor's professional judgment and experience"; it "should not be used as the sole reason for denial of treatment and services".

### The clinical frailty scale predicts 1-year mortality in emergency department patients aged 65 years and older [^c29e0f55]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patient characteristics

After screening of 7859 patients for inclusion, 550 patients aged 18 years and older denied verbal consent, resulting in a total number of 7309 included patients. Among these, 4850 patients were aged 64 years or younger, leaving 2459 consecutive patients aged 65 years and older for further analysis of whom 268 were re‐presentations. Thirty‐eight (1.7%) patients had missing data on CFS level, and 15 (0.7%) patients were lost to 1‐year follow up. The final study population included 2191 patients (Figure 1). Mean age (SD) was 78.9 years (8.4), 1124 (51.3%) were female, and 1281 (58.5%) received a medical diagnosis. 1040 (47.5%) patients were assigned a medium urgency triage level of ESI 3 (Table 1). The five presenting chief complaints dyspnea, abdominal pain, chest pain, dizziness, and back pain, based on a list of 36 predefined presenting chief complaints, were the most commonly reported. Regarding patient characteristics (age, sex, triage level, and presenting condition), there does not appear to be a difference between the population of patients lost to follow‐up or between the population of patients with missing data on CFS level compared with patients analyzed (Of note, Table 1 depicts the overall population of 2191 patients aged 65 and older, for baseline demographics of the final study population, see Supporting Information Table S1).

### Auditory and vestibular symptom improvement with surgery for superior canal dehiscence syndrome [^661970ed]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

(1) To measure the change in auditory and vestibular symptoms following superior canal dehiscence (SCD) surgery, and (2) to determine differences in clinical features and surgical outcomes between superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) patients with primarily auditory or vestibular complaints.

Study Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Single surgeon series at the tertiary academic medical center from 2002 to 2021.

Methods

Retrospective review of SCDS patients who underwent surgical repair. (1) Patients were administered a standardized symptom questionnaire at preoperative and follow-up visits, and results were compared with paired statistical testing. (2) Patients were divided into 2 cohorts based on either auditory or vestibular chief complaint and differences in demographic, clinical, and outcome variables were examined.

Results

Our study included 113 patients with 118 operated ears. Twenty-seven patients (24%) had radiographic bilateral dehiscence. 10/11 auditory symptoms (91%) and 5/8 vestibular symptoms (63%) solicited on the questionnaire improved significantly with surgery, except for nonpulsatile tinnitus, sense of imbalance, positional dizziness, and oscillopsia. Analyses stratified by chief complaint (auditory vs vestibular) revealed overall similar characteristics and surgical outcomes. Patients with chief vestibular complaints underwent surgery at an earlier age (45.5 vs 53.9 years, p < 0.05).

Conclusion

SCD surgery alleviates a wide range of auditory and vestibular symptoms. Overall, we did not find significant differences between patients with chief auditory versus vestibular complaints, and both groups benefited from surgery. Symptoms are not directly linked to third-window physiology and certain vestibular symptoms may be more likely to persist. Bilateral dehiscence may play an important role in persistent symptoms as well.

### Neuroimaging and natural language processing-based classification of suicidal thoughts in major depressive disorder [^65f4a579]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Topic modeling

We used the psychiatrist's initial notes at the time of depression diagnosis for the topic modeling. In the initial record, the main symptoms were written in the chief complaint section, and these symptoms included only those that are in the DSM-5, and all of them were written in English. We did a regular expression to extract chief complaints for NLP. Subsequently, NLP algorithms were used to extract topics as predictive variables from each patient's chief complaints. Specifically, we converted the patient's chief complaints into a bag-of-words model of the corpus after stemming, normalization, and stop-word removal. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as an unsupervised learning method was used to cluster the topics from each patient. With an LDA-based topic model, the topic probabilities were calculated for each chief complaint. For instance, if five topics were created by the LDA from chief complaints, the probability of being assigned to five topics for each chief complaint was generated. Prior to the use of LDA, we also calculated the perplexity scores in order to determine the optimal number of topics in the LDA. The perplexity score can be an estimate of the relative quality of statistical models. Specifically, Griffiths2004 and Deveaud2014 represent maximization approaches which means that a higher numerical fit score implies a better fit. CaoJuan2009 and Arun 2010 represent minimization approaches which means that a lower numerical fit score implies a better fit. We selected five as the number of topics based on the perplexity scores (Supplementary Fig. 1).

Decision criteria and additional considerations — screening and referral processes for anxiety/depression emphasize that while the decision to screen a particular patient is at the discretion of the clinical provider, initiation of broad-based screening in this population of interest is likely best operationalized, resourced, and backstopped at the level of the hospital or healthcare system; handling of results should be operationalized in such a manner that there is consistency and ease of access, with plans for a patient that screens positive for severe anxiety or depression, and all of these recommendations will require system-level support and are affected by the local resources available.

### Prevalence of vestibular and balance disorders in children [^b0a34a30]. Otology & Neurotology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Determine the prevalence of vestibular and balance disorders in children, rate of complaints of imbalance, and odds ratio of related diagnoses.

Patients and Methods

Retrospective review of pediatric health system during a 4-year period for International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, codes related to balance disorders. Identified records were searched for chief complaints related to balance and for codes of related otologic and neuro-otologic diagnoses.

Results

A total of 561,151 distinct patient encounters were found. Unspecified dizziness was diagnosed in 2,283 patients (0.4%). Also, 22% presented with balance complaints. Peripheral disorders were diagnosed in 159, and central disturbances were diagnosed in 109 (prevalence < 0.0002%). Cumulative prevalence of diagnoses related to balance was 0.45% (2,546/561,151). Of all patients, 5,793 (1.03%) had chief complaint related to balance, and 2,076 (35.84%) were also diagnosed with vestibular disorder. Moreover, 38% with peripheral disturbances and 21% with central disturbances had balance complaints. Odds ratio of syncope was 21× higher than the general pediatric population in patients with unspecified dizziness, and sensorineural hearing loss was 43 times higher in those with peripheral vestibular disorders. In patients with central disorders headache was 16× higher (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

The prevalence of balance disorders in children is low. Children diagnosed with these disorders typically do not present with chief complaint related to balance. Significant associations exist between sensorineural hearing loss, syncope, and headache in children diagnosed with balance disorders.

Translation of classes of evidence to recommendation levels — Level A recommendations are generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of scientific certainty, Level B recommendations identify strategies that reflect moderate scientific certainty, and Level C recommendations are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of adequate published literature, on expert consensus, with "consensus" placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation when used. Recommendations from a body of evidence may be downgraded for factors such as consistency of results, uncertainty of effect magnitude, and publication bias, and when possible clinically oriented statistics such as likelihood ratios [LRs] and number needed to treat are presented to help apply results to the individual patient.
