## Question

Bladder frequency testing and management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bladder frequency testing and management, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define bladder frequency and frame the diagnostic approach. Then, I should verify the initial evaluation steps, including history, exam, urinalysis, and bladder diaries. Next, I will review when to measure post-void residual and how to interpret it. After that, I need to check the role and timing of urodynamics and cystoscopy. Then, I will consider special populations and comorbidities. Finally, I will outline management principles, follow-up, and outcome measurement, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. Bladder frequency is best understood within the overactive bladder (OAB) symptom complex, defined by urinary urgency, usually with frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology, and it is a symptom-based diagnosis rather than a urodynamic entity, so I should not overcall detrusor overactivity unless proven on testing and even then it is not required for diagnosis [^1133Hoy2] [^115kFmKv].

> Wait, let me verify the initial evaluation elements before jumping to tests. A careful history should characterize urgency, daytime and nighttime frequency, and urgency urinary incontinence, and it should screen for red flags such as hematuria, recurrent UTIs, pelvic or bladder pain, neurologic symptoms, and bowel dysfunction, while the physical examination should include abdominal, focused neurologic, pelvic, and rectal components as indicated, and urinalysis should be obtained to exclude infection, hematuria, or glucosuria, with culture when infection is suspected [^114Pa1ti] [^1146cr2H].

> I need to ensure objective symptom quantification. A bladder diary for at least 3 days is recommended to document void times and volumes, fluid intake, incontinence episodes, and nocturnal voids, because it helps distinguish OAB from other causes of frequency and establishes a baseline for treatment response; I should double-check that both AUA/SUFU and EAU endorse diaries early in evaluation, which they do [^114en4r7] [^1123SNBR] [^113vK7Sg].

> Hold on, I should verify how to interpret diary data. Normal daytime frequency is often up to about seven voids, and nocturia is commonly defined as one or more nocturnal voids, but I must correlate with voided volumes to differentiate OAB from high fluid intake or nocturnal polyuria; if voids are normal or large volume, especially at night, that points away from OAB and toward fluid management or nocturnal polyuria, which I should confirm on the diary before labeling OAB [^111stT9z] [^113hA7hB].

> Next, I should review post-void residual (PVR). I initially thought PVR is not necessary for first-line behavioral therapy, and that is correct; however, I need to correct myself because PVR should be considered when there are voiding or emptying symptoms, suspicion of retention, neurologic disease, or prior pelvic surgery, and in men with suspected outlet obstruction, so I should measure PVR in those contexts rather than routinely for everyone [^116zSfzr] [^115MCmgL] [^114Pa1ti].

> Let me consider urodynamics carefully. Routine urodynamics are not recommended in uncomplicated OAB; I should reserve urodynamics for diagnostic uncertainty, failure of conservative therapy, or when invasive treatments are being considered, acknowledging that while urodynamics can change management decisions, randomized data have not consistently shown improved clinical outcomes, so I should avoid overusing it [^115MCmgL] [^112s9xuc] [^114S5UYd].

> I should confirm the role of cystoscopy and imaging. Cystoscopy and upper tract imaging are not part of the initial workup for idiopathic OAB; they are reserved for hematuria, suspected bladder pathology, or when findings would change management, so I need to ensure I am not over-ordering these tests in straightforward cases [^115MCmgL].

> But wait, what if the patient is a man with mixed LUTS or an older adult with retention risk. In men, I should consider outlet obstruction and measure PVR, and in older adults or those with neurologic risk, I should be more liberal in checking PVR and reassessing retention risk before starting anticholinergics; I need to ensure I tailor testing to pretest probability and potential treatment consequences [^114Pa1ti] [^112PAAgq].

> Let me think about comorbid contributors that can amplify frequency. Constipation, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and medications such as diuretics can worsen OAB symptoms, so I should screen for and address these modifiable factors as part of comprehensive management rather than attributing everything to bladder dysfunction alone [^111X77xJ] [^112CABrM] [^114UDoDM].

> Next, I should review management principles and avoid a rigid stepwise mindset. Shared decision-making is emphasized, and options are grouped by invasiveness; behavioral therapies, fluid and caffeine management, pelvic floor strategies, and bladder training are foundational, pharmacotherapy with antimuscarinics or beta-3 agonists can be added, and minimally invasive options such as onabotulinumtoxinA, tibial neuromodulation, or sacral neuromodulation are reasonable when symptoms persist or side effects limit oral therapy, all aligned with patient preferences and goals [^116CMJkG] [^112xwVrk] [^112qdqSw] [^112SRCj6].

> I should double-check treatment sequencing and trial duration. For medications, a 4 to 8 week trial is reasonable before declaring failure, and for behavioral therapy, 8 to 12 weeks allows adequate time for response; if monotherapy is insufficient, combination strategies can be layered methodically, and I should avoid prematurely abandoning effective options or stacking too many changes at once [^1153ghD8] [^115hVaXT] [^113RMZBc].

> Let me verify follow-up and outcome measurement. Follow-up should assess adherence, efficacy, side effects, and patient-reported bother, ideally using the same instruments as baseline such as voiding diaries and validated scales like OAB-q or OABSS to quantify change; I should also remember that objective improvements do not always translate to perceived benefit, so patient-reported outcomes are essential to judge success [^1127YGf6] [^116Ue1jV] [^116BjmQb].

> Hold on, I should verify special scenarios that require deviation from routine care. In patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, urodynamics may be indicated earlier to characterize storage and emptying and to guide management, and safety protocols for autonomic dysreflexia during testing must be in place; in children with complex or refractory symptoms, urodynamics may be appropriate to define dysfunction and protect renal function, so I need to adapt the pathway to the underlying condition [^115LrXGC] [^116vvxAC] [^111pnGPw].

> I will now examine the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. Bladder frequency is a symptom that requires a symptom-based diagnosis of OAB after excluding infection and obvious pathology, with initial evaluation anchored in history, exam, urinalysis, and a 3-day bladder diary; PVR is selective, urodynamics and cystoscopy are reserved for complex or refractory cases, and management should be individualized through shared decision-making across behavioral, pharmacologic, and minimally invasive options, with follow-up focused on patient-centered outcomes and iterative adjustment over adequate trial periods [^1133Hoy2] [^114en4r7] [^115MCmgL] [^116CMJkG].

---

Bladder frequency testing centers on a **symptom-based diagnosis** of overactive bladder (OAB) [^1133Hoy2], defined by urgency, frequency, and nocturia without infection or other obvious pathology [^115kFmKv]. The core evaluation includes a **focused history, physical exam, urinalysis, and a 3-day bladder diary** [^1123SNBR] to quantify symptoms and exclude mimics [^114en4r7]; post-void residual is measured when retention is suspected [^115MCmgL]. urodynamics, cystoscopy, and imaging are not routine [^115MCmgL] and are reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, refractory symptoms, or before invasive therapy [^115MCmgL]. Management is **stepwise**: start with behavioral therapy and fluids [^116GNeze], add antimuscarinics or β3-agonists if needed [^112qdqSw], and consider botulinum toxin or neuromodulation for refractory cases [^112SRCj6]. Shared decision-making and patient education are essential [^116CMJkG], and telemedicine can support follow-up [^115MCmgL].

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Initial assessment

- **History and physical examination**: Document OAB symptoms (urgency, frequency, nocturia, UUI) [^115kFmKv], exclude other disorders, and assess severity, duration, and impact on quality of life [^114Pa1ti].

- **Urinalysis**: Essential to exclude UTI, hematuria, glucosuria, and proteinuria [^notfound].

- **Bladder diary**: A 3-day diary [^1123SNBR] quantifies voiding patterns, fluid intake, and incontinence episodes, helping distinguish OAB from polyuria or nocturnal polyuria [^113hA7hB].

- **Post-void residual (PVR)**: Measure when retention is suspected or before invasive therapy [^115MCmgL].

---

### Advanced diagnostic testing

Reserve **urodynamics** for diagnostic uncertainty, refractory symptoms, or before invasive therapy; it is not routine in uncomplicated OAB [^112s9xuc] [^115MCmgL]. Use **cystoscopy and imaging** only when indicated (e.g. hematuria, suspected pathology, or before invasive procedures) [^112PAAgq].

---

## Management strategies

### First-line therapy

- **Behavioral interventions**: Bladder training, pelvic floor muscle therapy, fluid management, and lifestyle modifications (weight loss, caffeine reduction) [^116GNeze] [^112Kk3Xe].

- **Patient education**: Explain OAB, set expectations, and emphasize shared decision-making [^116CMJkG] [^114bwPRU].

---

### Second-line therapy

Offer **pharmacologic therapy** with antimuscarinics or β3-agonists (mirabegron, vibegron) to reduce urgency, frequency, and UUI [^112qdqSw]; tailor to side effects and comorbidities.

---

### Third-line therapy

Use **minimally invasive options** — such as onabotulinumtoxinA, sacral neuromodulation, or percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation — for refractory symptoms or when medications are contraindicated [^112SRCj6] [^114EfekL].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up should assess **symptom control, side effects, and adherence** [^1127YGf6]; adjust therapy based on response and patient preference [^1153ghD8] [^116CMJkG]. Telemedicine can support follow-up and shared decision-making [^115MCmgL].

---

## Special considerations

Identify and manage **comorbidities** (e.g. obesity, constipation, sleep apnea) that may exacerbate OAB symptoms [^114UDoDM] [^112CABrM]. In older adults, individualize therapy to balance efficacy with side effects and fall risk [^115rkpBC].

---

Bladder frequency testing and management rely on a **symptom-based approach**, with initial evaluation by history, exam, urinalysis, and bladder diary, and advanced testing reserved for specific indications. Management is stepwise, from behavioral to pharmacologic to minimally invasive therapies, with shared decision-making and regular follow-up to optimize outcomes.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — initial evaluation and testing: Clinicians may offer telemedicine to initially evaluate patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB, with the understanding that a physical exam will not be performed and urinalysis should be obtained at a local laboratory (or recent lab results reviewed, if available). Clinicians may obtain a post-void residual in patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB to exclude incomplete emptying or urinary retention, especially in patients with concomitant voiding or emptying symptoms. Clinicians may obtain a symptom questionnaire and/or a voiding diary in patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB to assist in the diagnosis of OAB, exclude other disorders, ascertain the degree of bother, and/or evaluate treatment response. Clinicians should not routinely perform urodynamics, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB. Clinicians may perform advanced testing, such as urodynamics, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB when diagnostic uncertainty exists. Clinicians should assess for comorbid conditions in patients with OAB that may contribute to urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urgency urinary incontinence and should educate patients on the role that managing these conditions can have on bladder symptoms. Clinicians may use telemedicine for follow-up visits with patients with OAB.

### Future studies of overactive bladder: the need for standardization [^1116Z2UB]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians and researchers agree that pharmacologic studies of the overactive bladder (OAB) require precise planning, strict adherence to study design, and meticulous attention to study conduct and statistical methods. In addition, there should be straightforward and highly directed formulation of the conclusions derived expressly from data that have been collected. The exact methods to achieve these ends, however, are often debated among statisticians and experts in study design and by physicians who interpret the clinical implications of the findings. For these reasons, the conclusions of clinical research in OAB are commonly criticized on the basis of study objectives, study design, statistical methods, or conclusions. However, a subtler, but possibly more critical problem exists: the method of defining the population and the methods for collecting the data for the efficacy outcome parameters, including frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence.

### Urodynamic testing in children: indications, technique, interpretation and significance [^116vvxAC]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Urodynamic studies in children have been performed with increasing frequency as the techniques, reproducibility and reliability of the testing have been refined in the last quarter century. Children of all ages and with a variety of comorbidities are now often referred for urodynamic testing to evaluate and understand the causes of incontinence and/or persistence of lower urinary tract symptoms, as well as to appropriately define and evaluate treatment regimens.

Materials and Methods

We performed a MEDLINE® search for relevant articles on urinary tract dysfunction, neurogenic bladder and urodynamic studies in the pediatric population. We also included 3 major textbooks that addressed the subject matter.

Results

We review the current indications for urodynamic studies in children with nonneurogenic and neurogenic bladder dysfunction. We summarize the components and techniques of the current practice of urodynamic studies in the pediatric population, and explain how to identify abnormal results.

Conclusions

The use of urodynamic studies in pediatrics has become almost mandatory for the effective management of severe or therapy resistant urinary tract abnormalities. This review may be used as a guideline for the appropriate application of urodynamics in this patient population.

### Role of cystometry in evaluating patients with overactive bladder [^111hujQD]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) can be caused by a variety of conditions. We believe that cystometrography (CMG) is an essential part of the diagnostic evaluation, both in defining underlying pathophysiology and directing treatment. Essential to the diagnosis of OAB syndrome is some combination of urinary frequency, urgency, urge incontinence, and pain. CMG can be thought of simply as a provocative test to determine whether bladder filling, involuntary detrusor contractions, or low bladder compliance in fact reproduces any of these symptoms, and whether the symptoms abate when the bladder is empty or when the pressure decreases. At another level, the CMG has been likened to "the reflex hammer" of the lower urinary tract and, as such, provides important neurologic information. Finally, the voiding phase of the CMG is an essential component of the detrusor pressure/uroflow study, which is the only accurate method of diagnosing urethral obstruction and impaired detrusor contractility. Both of these conditions can coexist with detrusor overactivity. The treatment of OAB depends on the underlying cause. We believe that only by understanding the particular cystometric characteristics of patients with OAB can we determine the appropriate treatment. Urodynamic testing should serve as an essential part of therapy and guide future research in diagnosis and management.

### Does cystoscopy method affect the investigation of bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis? [^115yzndr]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bladder pain is defined as suprapubic or retropubic pain, pressure, or discomfort, related to the bladder. It often increases with bladder filling and may persist or be relieved after voiding. When bladder pain presents with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency or nocturia, in the absence of identifiable pathology or causes, the diagnosis of bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is given. This is a chronic condition with much to unravel about its aetiology and prognosis. Many international societies have developed guidelines to aid clinicians in the management of this complex condition; however, international consensus for all aspects has not yet been reached. Symptoms of BPS must be present for a minimum of 6 weeks (American Urological Association) to 6 months (European Society for the Study of Bladder Pain Syndrome (ESSIC)) before a clinical diagnosis is made.

### Updates to microhematuria: AUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116imRnK]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Microhematuria (MH) guideline updates emphasize that UBTM/cytology is limited to use in appropriate populations per current Guideline recommendations as a tool to reduce the use of cystoscopy during MH evaluation, and similarly, optimizing follow-up in patients with negative marker testing will be valuable; the necessity of such repeated evaluation should be evaluated as well as the optimal timing and should be a key endpoint for designing prospective marker-based trials. The revised Guideline includes recent data demonstrating the low risk of diagnosis of a subsequent malignancy among patients with MH who have a negative evaluation, even among those with persistent (stable) MH, and while these patients may be discharged from urologic follow-up, dissemination and implementation beyond urologists may be needed to prevent repeated referrals. Many patients with MH will have persistent findings of microscopic blood, likely due to benign causes that may or may not be recognized, and additional prospective research is needed to determine when and how patients with persistent or recurrent MH should be re-evaluated and when it is potentially safe to stop repeat evaluations. Further studies are also needed to guide management and follow up of patients who have a presumed false-positive UBTM test, particularly if done inappropriately in low/negligible- or high-risk groups, and additional non-invasive means of evaluating for the presence of bladder cancer. Overall, the revision represents an effort to improve the detection of clinically significant disease while reducing the indiscriminate allocation of healthcare resources and subjecting patients to tests with risk and attendant discomfort/anxiety, and the impact of this Guideline on frequency, intensity, yield of evaluation will need to be studied to determine the impact of the updated recommendations on public health and to inform the next Guideline update.

### Artificial intelligence-based prediction of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder management [^115UbSTQ]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a symptom complex defined by the International Continence Society as urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. It is important to emphasize that OAB is primarily a symptom-based clinical diagnosis that does not require urodynamic confirmation of detrusor overactivity. While detrusor overactivity (an urodynamic observation characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions during the filling phase) may be present in many OAB patients, the correlation is imperfect, and the two conditions are not synonymous. Approximately 54% of patients with OAB symptoms demonstrate detrusor overactivity on urodynamic testing, while conversely, not all patients with urodynamically confirmed detrusor overactivity report OAB symptoms.

This clinical distinction is crucial because OAB is diagnosed based on patient-reported symptoms rather than urodynamic findings. Urodynamic studies may provide additional information about bladder function but are not necessary for diagnosis and are typically reserved for complex cases or when invasive treatments are being considered. The diagnosis and initial management of OAB should focus on the symptom complex that significantly impacts patients' quality of life, rather than on the presence or absence of detrusor overactivity.

This symptom complex significantly impacts patient quality of life and presents substantial challenges in clinical management. Despite advancements in treatment protocols, the rates of failure and non-adherence to pharmacological therapies, particularly antimuscarinics and beta-3 agonists, remain concerningly high, with estimates suggesting that up to 40% of patients experience suboptimal outcomes within the first three months after treatment initiation. The ability to predict treatment failure and medication non-adherence early in the treatment course would enable clinicians to implement targeted interventions and proactively modify treatment strategies.

Current challenges in overactive bladder management

Overactive bladder management presents multiple challenges, including variable treatment responses, complex pathophysiology, and difficulties in patient adherence. Traditional approaches to predicting treatment outcomes have largely relied on urodynamic studies which, while valuable, have limitations in terms of predictive capacity and interpretation variability. Additionally, assessment of bladder compliance and function requires careful evaluation of multiple parameters, making outcome prediction particularly challenging.

### Urodynamic studies for management of urinary incontinence in children and adults [^114S5UYd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Urodynamic tests are used to investigate people who have urinary incontinence or other urinary symptoms in order to make a definitive, objective diagnosis. The aim is to help select the treatment most likely to be successful. The investigations are invasive and time consuming.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to determine if treatment according to a urodynamic-based diagnosis, compared to treatment based on history and examination, led to more effective clinical care of people with urinary incontinence and better clinical outcomes. The intention was to test the following hypotheses in predefined subgroups of people with incontinence:(i) urodynamic investigations improve the clinical outcomes;(ii) urodynamic investigations alter clinical decision making;(iii) one type of urodynamic test is better than another in improving the outcomes of management of incontinence or influencing clinical decisions, or both.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process, handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 19 February 2013), and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing clinical outcomes in groups of people who were and were not investigated using urodynamics, or comparing one type of urodynamic test against another were included. Trials were excluded if they did not report clinical outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Eight trials involving around 1100 people were included but data were only available for 1036 women in seven trials, of whom 526 received urodynamics. There was some evidence of risk of bias. The four deaths and 12 dropouts in the control arm of one trial were unexplained. There was significant evidence that the tests did change clinical decision making. Women in the urodynamic arms of three trials were more likely to have their management changed (proportion with change in management compared with the control arm 17% versus 3%, risk ratio (RR) 5.07, 95% CI 1.87 to 13.74), although there was statistical heterogeneity. There was evidence from two trials that women treated after urodynamic investigations were more likely to receive drugs (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.31). On the other hand, in five trials women undergoing treatment following urodynamic investigation were not more likely to undergo surgery (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.12). There was no statistically significant difference however in the number of women with urinary incontinence if they received treatment guided by urodynamics (37%) compared with those whose treatment was based on history and clinical findings alone (36%) (for example, RR for the number with incontinence after the first year 1.02, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.21). It was calculated that the number of women needed to treat was 100 women (95% CI 86 to 114 women) undergoing urodynamics to prevent one extra individual being incontinent at one year. One trial reported adverse effects and no significant difference was found (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.50).

Authors' Conclusions

While urodynamic tests did change clinical decision making, there was some evidence that this did not result in better outcomes in terms of a difference in urinary incontinence rates after treatment. There was no evidence about their use in men, children, or people with neurological diseases. Larger definitive trials are needed in which people are randomly allocated to management according to urodynamic findings or to management based on history and clinical examination to determine if performance of urodynamics results in higher continence rates after treatment.

### Screening for bladder cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^115S44iD]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

USPSTF bladder cancer screening — clinical considerations specify that this recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults, including adults with mild lower urinary tract symptoms (such as urinary frequency, hesitancy, urgency, dysuria, or nocturia) in the population under consideration for screening, while adults with gross hematuria or acute changes in lower urinary tract symptoms are not included. Screening may yield false-positive results that can lead to anxiety, labeling, pain, and complications from diagnostic cystoscopy and biopsy or imaging. The USPSTF found inadequate evidence on the harms of screening and also inadequate evidence on harms associated with early treatment. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bladder cancer in asymptomatic adults.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^114bwPRU]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) — patient education (Guideline Statement 5): Clinicians should provide education to patients regarding normal lower urinary tract function, what is known about OAB, the benefits vs. risks/ burdens of the available treatment alternatives and the fact that acceptable symptom control may require trials of multiple therapeutic options before it is achieved (Clinical Principle). Prior to initiating treatment, the clinician should provide patient education regarding normal and abnormal bladder function, including voiding frequency and toileting behavior; explaining what is normal can help the patient understand how their condition diverges from normal and gives them a comparator (or goal) for judging their own progress in treatment. Education also empowers the patient to engage and participate in their treatment, which is essential when using interventions that rely on behavior change, and patients must understand that voiding is a behavior that can be managed and that successful OAB treatment requires a willing participant who is informed and engaged in the treatment process; patients should be informed that OAB is a symptom complex with a variable and chronic course.

### Overactive bladder: an update [^111K24Uk]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Overactive bladder is an important lower urinary tract syndrome that negatively affects the quality of life of millions of people worldwide. Both sexes and all age groups may be affected; therefore many specialists, including urologists, gynaecologists, geriatricians, paediatricians, physiotherapists and continence advisors, are involved in the management of patients with overactive bladder.

Recent Findings

There is ongoing research, both basic science and clinical trials, to establish the cause of overactive bladder and to determine the best method of managing patients who suffer from this syndrome. New theories and modified definitions of overactive bladder have been proposed, structured evidence-based management guidelines have been established, more prevalence studies have been conducted and new treatment strategies have emerged.

Summary

Overactive bladder is now recognized as a chronic debilitating condition that costs millions of dollars. With an ageing population these costs will increase, and it is necessary that health systems around the world recognize this. Further research into the basic science of the condition is required to identify the true cause of overactive bladder, allowing new targeted treatments to be established.

### Patient-reported outcomes in overactive bladder: importance for determining clinical effectiveness of treatment [^113KbtFS]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition defined by its symptoms — urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence and often with frequency and nocturia. As such, determining the efficacy of OAB treatments using objective measures, such as urodynamic testing, can be difficult. A better means of gauging treatment efficacy for symptom-based conditions is through the use of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). With PROs, clinicians can gain insight into how a treatment affects a patient's symptoms and whether improvement in symptoms has a positive effect from the patient's perspective. PROs are increasingly being included as end points in clinical trials, including those of antimuscarinic drugs for OAB. Consequently, clinicians should become familiar with the most commonly used instruments. We provide an overview of instruments used to assess symptoms, health-related quality of life, and treatment satisfaction in patients with OAB and discuss how PROs can be incorporated into clinical trial protocols.

### International consultation on incontinence 2016; executive summary: urodynamic testing [^1113YDwy]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

The International Consultation on Incontinence has published an update of the recommendations for the diagnosis and management of urine incontinence (ICI2016). This manuscript summarizes the consultations committee-recommendations with regard to urodynamic assessment.

Methods

Expert consensus on the basis of structured evidence assessment has been the basis of the consultations publication and has been summarized by the committee for this manuscript.

Results

Patients that are not satisfied with their initial management on the basis of their reported signs and symptoms of urinary incontinence, as well as all patients with neurological abnormalities that are potentially relevant for the function of the lower urinary tract, may very likely profit from objective diagnosis and staging and grading of their dysfunction, with urodynamic testing, regardless their age, vulnerability and/or comorbidities. The principles and technical innovations as well as the principal recommendations for the utilization of (invasive) urodynamic assessment for women, men, children, and vulnerable elderly, with or without neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction with urinary incontinence are provided in this abbreviated ICI recommendations-document.

Conclusions

The ICI2016 committee on urodynamics presents an executive summary of the most important reasons and recommendations for the use of urodynamic investigations for patients with urinary incontinence.

Using the PubMed database (search until January 2017) and relevant guidelines, we reviewed evidence for the self‐management of LUTS and identified suitable components for the intervention. Next, we built an algorithm that provided individualized advice based on patient characteristics and symptoms for use on an online platform. Men with LUTS tested the usability of the intervention and provided feedback. Finally, we surveyed urologists and general practitioners to identify potential areas for improvement of the intervention.

Results

We identified nine self‐help interventions from 48 eligible publications. These were as follows: information and education about LUTS, pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, urethral milking, double voiding, caffeine management, alcohol management, fluid management, and exercise advice. The level of evidence for each item was low due to the paucity of research available. Six men with LUTS reported difficulties understanding and completing the frequency‐volume chart online. The 158 surveyed physicians agreed (≥ 50% positive ratings) on the inclusion of seven advice items, but not for double voiding and fluid management. Respondents noted that some advice should be provided to all men with LUTS, while other advice should only be presented to certain groups. Some recommendations for additions were offered.

Conclusions

Despite a lack of evidence for the self‐management advice, physicians agreed with most of the included advice. The online platform needs further development. Therefore, adjustments will be made and we will assess its impact in future studies.

Regarding medical management for overactive bladder, more specifically with respect to general principles, AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend to engage in shared decision-making with patients with overactive bladder, taking into account their expressed values, preferences, and treatment goals, to facilitate informed decisions regarding different treatment modalities or to explore the option of no treatment.

### Current status of genetic urinary biomarkers for surveillance of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: a systematic review [^114Vrg6f]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bladder cancer (BC) is the fifth most common neoplasm worldwide, with more than 54,000 new cases estimated per year in the United States alone. BC is a heterogeneous tumour that is associated with very high economic costs and a substantial impact on patients' quality of life owing to its characteristically high risk of recurrence and the complexity of follow up. Guidelines from the European Association of Urology (EAU) and the American Urological Association (AUA) suggest a combination of cystoscopy, cytology and imaging for the surveillance of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Cystoscopy is an invasive procedure that carries the risks of painful micturition, urinary frequency and macroscopic haematuria of 50, 37 and 19%, respectively, while cytology has a very low sensitivity, especially for low-grade tumours.

For this reason there has been an increase in research over the past years into urinary biomarkers for the three scenarios of haematuria, diagnosis and surveillance. The role of these new tests is to increase the sensitivity and the specificity of the available gold-standard techniques, while sparing the patient the discomfort of an invasive test and its potential complications. Although many types of urinary biomarkers have been investigated, biomarkers that use genetic materials such as DNA and RNA seem to be the most promising due to their potential to identify a genetic signature. Such a signature would not only prove useful in disease detection and follow-up but also in the facilitation of more precise treatment by avoiding unhelpful therapies that may delay the best oncological pathway.

The field of urinary biomarker research in BC is focused on balancing a non-invasive, safe method with a cost-effective strategy that can be used to improve the sensitivity of bladder tumour detection in the initial phase of the disease and during patient follow-up, compared with the current gold standard.

Selecting a biomarker must be based on the given scenario and follow the principles of the international guidelines. The current literature clearly differentiates between different biomarker tests and characteristics depending on whether the BC is low or high risk. For low-risk tumours, marker-guided testing of lesions is suggested to detect possible progression to high-risk tumours. For high-risk tumours, however, where early detection is the main objective, selection of high-sensitivity biomarkers is recommended.

The aim of this study is to analyse the current literature for the use of genetic urinary biomarkers in the surveillance of NMIBC.

### Bladder and upper tract urothelial cancer [^116whLhv]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

While there are data available indicating the incidence and prevalence of bladder and upper tract urothelial cancer, population level data on resource use, costs and patterns of care for these cancers are limited. We quantified the economic impact of caring for patients with bladder and upper tract urothelial cancer, and determined the primary drivers for such costs in the population in the United States.

Materials and Methods

The analytical methods used to generate these results have been described previously.

Results

An increasing proportion of patients with bladder and upper tract urothelial cancer were being treated in the outpatient setting. Most care was provided by urologists and visit frequency was directly related to disease stage. Only a small proportion of patients potentially eligible for chemotherapy, ie those with advanced disease, sought specialized care from oncologists. Office based diagnostic tests such as cytology were not commonly done, although a substantial number of patients with bladder cancer underwent cystoscopy. The use of excretory urography in these patients was decreasing, while the use of computerized tomography was increasing. Ileal conduits were the most frequently performed type of urinary diversion following cystectomy. The cystectomy rate remained unchanged for a decade. Intravesical therapy was done infrequently in patients with bladder cancer. Annual costs for treating bladder and upper urinary tract cancers were $1 billion and $64 million, respectively, in 2000. These costs represented a $164 million increase over 1994 levels, which outpaced inflation.

Conclusions

The costs of treating bladder cancer increased steadily during a 6-year period despite a decrease in inpatient care. Coupled with a lack of substantial change in transurethral resection and cystectomy rates, this suggests that the primary cost drivers are increased outpatient testing, eg computerized tomography and cystoscopy, and an increase in the number of diagnosed cases. Greater focus on selective use of testing modalities, preventive care such as smoking cessation and earlier identification of patients at risk may help curtail further expenditure with regard to managing bladder and upper urinary tract cancers.

### A urinary assay for mutation and methylation biomarkers in the diagnosis and recurrence prediction of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients [^116dBE3j]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Potential implementation of OncoUrine in clinic practice for NMIBC management

Based on our results above, we proposed a model to possibly incorporate OncoUrine into clinic practice for diagnosis and recurrence monitoring in NMIBC (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
A proposed model to incorporate OncoUrine in clinical practice. A The potential application of OncoUrine in bladder cancer diagnosis. B The potential application of OncoUrine in recurrence diagnosis and monitoring. In both clinical settings, patients with negative test results have low risk of developing bladder cancer or recurrence and cystoscopy could be avoided. While patients with positive test results should undergo confirmatory cystoscopy

In the setting of bladder cancer diagnosis, patients present with hematuria would receive OncoUrine test. For patients with positive test result, confirmatory cystoscopy should be performed following clinical guidelines. However, based on the high NPV, those with negative test results are thought to have a low likelihood diagnosed as malignant bladder cancer and thus cystoscopies are not recommended.

In the setting of recurrence surveillance, NMIBC patients under regular surveillance are included to undergo OncoUrine test. For patients with positive test results, confirmed cystoscopy under normal follow-up frequency should be performed. While a negative test result could confidently indicate a non-recurrence at present and a low risk to recurrence in the near future. For these low-risk recurrence patients, cystoscopies can be postponed, and surveillance frequency can be reduced.

### Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer [^11698kpg]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Bladder cancer is the commonest malignancy of the urinary tract. In this review, we look at the latest developments in the diagnosis and management of this condition. Cystoscopy and urine cytology are the most important tools in the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder cancer. Various alternatives have been investigated, either to reduce the frequency of cystoscopy, or improve its sensitivity for detection of tumors. These include urine-based markers and point-of-care tests. Narrow-band imaging and photodynamic diagnosis/blue-light cystoscopy have shown promise in improving detection and reducing recurrence of bladder tumors, by improving the completion of bladder resection when compared with standard resection in white light. The majority of patients with a new diagnosis of bladder cancer have non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, which requires adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Recent developments in post-resection intravesical regimens are discussed. For patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, both laparoscopic radical cystectomy and robot-assisted radical cystectomy have been shown to reduce peri-operative morbidity, while being oncologically equivalent to open radical cystectomy in the medium term. Bladder-preserving strategies entail resection and chemoradiation, and in selected patients give equivalent results to surgery. The development, advantages, and disadvantages of these newer approaches are also discussed.

### A urinary assay for mutation and methylation biomarkers in the diagnosis and recurrence prediction of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients [^111D1ecm]. BMC Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Bladder cancer is the 10th most common cancer and the most common malignancy of the urinary tract, with approximately 75% initially diagnosed as non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). During follow-up, more than half of patients with NMIBC recur within 5 years and about 20% will progress to muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Therefore, an accurate diagnosis and a strict surveillance is crucial for the decision-making of NMIBC management.

Currently, the gold standard method of diagnosis and surveillance of NMIBC is dependent on cystoscopy and confirmed with pathology. Cystoscopy has an overall high sensitivity but a limited specificity, especially in low-grade (LG) and carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) tumors. Cytology, frequently used as adjunct to cystoscopy, is highly specific but its sensitivity is only 15–75%. In clinical practice, patients with suspected symptoms typically undergo a comprehensive assessment that includes imaging, cytology, and cystoscopy for thorough evaluation to identify any suspicious areas of tumors. Pathological assessment will be performed for further confirmation if any suspicious tissues are detected during cystoscopy.

The high recurrence rate of NMIBC lead to extensive follow-up schemes with regular surveillance cystoscopies. Follow-up with invasive cystoscopies maintained for years would impose great negative impacts on patients' quality of life. Therefore, the current challenge in bladder cancer management is to develop a reliable non-invasive method to improve the accuracy of selecting any suspicious patients and detecting any risk of recurrence. For this purpose, several urinary biomarkers have been developed to reduce the frequency of unnecessary cystoscopy. However, none of them has been incorporated in the current clinical guidelines because of insufficient sensitivity or negative predictive value (NPV). For instance, NMP22, BTA, and FISH are FDA-approved urinary tests for initial diagnosis and surveillance of bladder cancer despite an overall sensitivity of 57–82% and NPV of 21–48%. One of the well-studied DNA methylation biomarkers EpiCheck presented a sensitivity of 68.2% in NMIBC follow-up and a sensitivity of 83% in upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC) diagnosis and 51% in bladder cancer diagnosis, respectively.

### Urodynamic studies for management of urinary incontinence in children and adults [^112dmWur]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Urodynamic tests are used to investigate people who have urinary incontinence or other urinary symptoms in order to make a definitive objective diagnosis. The aim is to help to select the treatment most likely to be successful. The investigations are invasive and time consuming.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to discover if treatment according to a urodynamic-based diagnosis, compared to treatment based on history and examination, led to more effective clinical care of urinary incontinence and better clinical outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and CINAHL, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 24 May 2011), and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing clinical outcomes in groups of people who were and were not investigated using urodynamics, or comparing one type of urodynamics against another. Trials were excluded if they did not report clinical outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Seven small trials involving around 400 people were included but data were only available for 385 women in five trials, of whom 197 received urodynamics. There was some evidence of risk of bias. The four deaths and 12 dropouts in the control arm of one trial were unexplained. There was some evidence that the tests did change clinical decision making. There was evidence from two trials that women treated after urodynamic investigations were more likely to receive drugs (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.31) but not, in three trials, surgery (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.39 to 7.75). Women in the urodynamic arms of two trials were more likely to have their management changed but this did not quite reach statistical significance (proportion with no change in management 76% versus 99%, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.10). However, there was not enough evidence to demonstrate whether or not this resulted in a clinical benefit. For example there was no statistically significant difference in the number of women with urinary incontinence if they received treatment guided by urodynamics (70%) versus those whose treatment was based on history and clinical findings alone (62%) (e.g. RR for number with incontinence after first year 1.23, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.55). No trials reported whether or not there were any adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

While urodynamic tests may change clinical decision making, there was not enough evidence to suggest whether this would result in better clinical outcomes. There was no evidence abut their use in men, children or people with neurological diseases. Larger definitive trials are needed, in which people are randomly allocated to management according to urodynamic findings or to standard management based on history and clinical examination.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^116GNeze]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — adjunctive and lifestyle measures — notes that adjuvant measures such as voiding diaries, frequency/volume charts, and mobile electronic apps are often used as an assessment tool in OAB; however their utility in improving the results of bladder training as an OAB treatment is unclear. Review of fluid intake is recommended, and management of these habits may improve OAB symptoms in some individuals. There is some evidence supporting dietary modification, increasing physical activity, and caffeine reduction in the treatment of OAB, with or without UUI, and similar to bladder training these interventions are considered very low risk, inexpensive and have few if any adverse effects and therefore can be considered in selected individuals.

### Intermittent catheter techniques, strategies and designs for managing long-term bladder conditions [^1137kCg2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Intermittent catheterisation (IC) is a commonly recommended procedure for people with incomplete bladder emptying. Frequent complications are urinary tract infection (UTI), urethral trauma and discomfort during catheter use. Despite the many designs of intermittent catheter, including different lengths, materials and coatings, it is unclear which catheter techniques, strategies or designs affect the incidence of UTI and other complications, measures of satisfaction/quality of life and cost-effectiveness. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different catheterisation techniques, strategies and catheter designs, and their impact, on UTI and other complications, and measures of satisfaction/quality of life among adults and children whose long-term bladder condition is managed by intermittent catheterisation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 12 April 2021), the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings, and we attempted to contact other investigators for unpublished data or for clarification.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or randomised cross-over trials comparing at least two different catheterisation techniques, strategies or catheter designs.

Data Collection and Analysis

As per standard Cochrane methodological procedures, two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Outcomes included the number of people with symptomatic urinary tract infections, complications such as urethral trauma/bleeding, comfort and ease of use of catheters, participant satisfaction and preference, quality of life measures and economic outcomes.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (1339 randomised participants), including twelve RCTs and eleven cross-over trials. Most were small (fewer than 60 participants completed), although three trials had more than 100 participants. Length of follow-up ranged from one month to 12 months and there was considerable variation in definitions of UTI. Most of the data from cross-over trials were not presented in a useable form for this review. Risk of bias was unclear in many domains due to insufficient information in the trial reports and several trials were judged to have a high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding and a high risk of attrition bias. The certainty of evidence was downgraded for risk of bias, and imprecision due to low numbers of participants. Aseptic versus clean technique We are uncertain if there is any difference between aseptic and clean techniques in the risk of symptomatic UTI because the evidence is low-certainty and the 95% confidence interval (CI) is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm (RR 1.20 95% CI 0.54 to 2.66; one study; 36 participants). We identified no data relating to the risk of adverse events comparing aseptic and clean techniques or participant satisfaction or preference. Single-use (sterile) catheter versus multiple-use (clean) We are uncertain if there is any difference between single-use and multiple-use catheters in terms of the risk of symptomatic UTI because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CI is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.55, 1.74; two studies; 97 participants). One study comparing single-use catheters to multiple-use catheters reported zero adverse events in either group; no other adverse event data were reported for this comparison. We identified no data for participant satisfaction or preference. Hydrophilic-coated catheters versus uncoated catheters We are uncertain if there is any difference between hydrophilic and uncoated catheters in terms of the number of people with symptomatic UTI because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CI is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.14; two studies; 98 participants). Uncoated catheters probably slightly reduce the risk of urethral trauma and bleeding compared to hydrophilic-coated catheters (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.87; moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain if hydrophilic-coated catheters compared with uncoated catheters has any effect on participant satisfaction measured on a 0–10 scale (MD 0.7 higher, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.21; very low-certainty evidence; one study; 114 participants). Due to the paucity of data, we could not assess the certainty of evidence relating to participant preference (one cross-over trial of 29 participants reported greater preference for a hydrophilic-coated catheter (19/29) compared to an uncoated catheter (10/29)). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite a total of 23 trials, the paucity of useable data and uncertainty of the evidence means that it remains unclear whether the incidence of UTI or other complications is affected by use of aseptic or clean technique, single (sterile) or multiple-use (clean) catheters, coated or uncoated catheters or different catheter lengths. The current research evidence is uncertain and design and reporting issues are significant. More well-designed trials are needed. Such trials should include analysis of cost-effectiveness because there are likely to be substantial differences associated with the use of different catheterisation techniques and strategies, and catheter designs.

### Overactive bladder in men: special considerations for evaluation and management [^111ZPWQr]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men may arise from a variety of underlying causes, including benign prostatic hyperplasia. LUTS may have a significant component of storage symptoms (urgency, frequency, urge incontinence) at presentation; however, the absence of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms does not necessarily imply pure outlet obstruction nor does their presence indicate the lack thereof. Symptomatic correlates to urodynamic findings are high when considering isolated OAB symptoms. However, mixed presentations or more overtly obstructive scenarios have less correlation with baseline symptom appraisal instruments. The ideal approach for diagnosis and management is predicated on a graded approach, with more invasive evaluation withheld for those men in whom presumptive therapy fails or who present with associated complex symptoms and in whom a higher level of intervention is being considered. The increasing incidence of LUTS with age implies a partial detrusor contribution, which must be considered in the overall management schema.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^116CXTFA]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — shared decision‑making approach emphasizes that diagnosis and management are complex because research has not identified a unifying pathophysiology and diagnostic testing has not led to reliable patterns that can guide treatment; nascent research has focused on phenotyping OAB and identifying predictors of treatment outcomes, and incorporating these into shared decision‑making can help clinicians and patients select the best treatment modality and improve outcomes. The text states that we should strive for upfront and clear communication with patients regarding OAB as a poorly understood and chronic syndrome, with interventions designed to mitigate symptoms rather than to treat or resolve an underlying condition, and that shared decision‑making should include a plan of care with emphasis on multiple modalities acceptable to the patient to optimize response.

### Research methodology in acupuncture for managing interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: a scoping review [^112BfYZr]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

3.2 Main Outcome Measures and Measurement Tools

Different instruments were applied in these studies to measure the efficacy of acupuncture and moxibustion. Of the 22 articles analyzed, only 15 reported outcome variables. The most commonly measured variables were pain, quality‐of‐life impact (symptom burden), urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, and bladder capacity. Based on these 15 articles, we observed the following.

Pain was the most frequently assessed outcome (73.33%), using tools like the VAS (40%), PUF questionnaire (13.33%), and bladder pain threshold tests (13.33%), including the Von Frey test (6.67%); other methods included the BPI‐SF, Q‐tip test, and myofascial exams. Symptom burden and quality of life were next (46.67%), primarily assessed with the ICSI/ICPI (33.33%) and OSS (26.67%), along with PCS, SF‐36, and PHQ‐9 (each 6.67%). Bladder capacity was evaluated in 40% of studies, mainly using maximum void volume (MVV) (26.67%), with some also measuring average void volume (AVV) (6.67%) or unspecified tools (13.33%). Urinary frequency was assessed in 33.33% of studies, urgency and nocturia in 20% each, using the PUF test (13.33%) and voiding diaries (26.67%).

3.3 Adverse Events

AEs were reported in only five articles, all of which concluded that these effects were not significant and that acupuncture could be considered a safe and relatively noninvasive technique. The review by Verghese et al. was the only one to perform a comprehensive analysis of this parameter, reporting data from 2.2 million treatment sessions. It found a risk of 1 AE/76 000 patients, with the most common side effects being minor, such as bleeding or bruising.

3.4 Participant Attitudes, Beliefs, and Experiences

These variables could not be adequately analyzed as they are only addressed in two articles, both of which are observational (surveys), thus limiting the validity of their outcomes. In general, the results are positive regarding patients' attitudes and beliefs, as well as greater effectiveness when acupuncture is administered in the early stages of the disease.

Results

This review included 38 RCTs, with a total of 18,316 patients. Twenty-five of the 38 trials (65.8%) included over 100 patients, nine of the 38 studies included over 500 participants (23.7%) and one study, over 2000 participants (2.6%). Overall, 69 outcomes were tested using 62 different outcome measures (Supplementary Table 1 and 2 respectively – S.2 and S.3). All but five of the studies (86.8%) assessed improvement in symptoms of OAB: the symptoms assessed were stated clearly in 29 of the 33 (87.9%) whilst the remaining 4 studies (12.1%) assessed efficacy as 'change in micturition daily variables', 'improvement in symptoms', 'pre and post-treatment bladder daily variables' and 'change in OAB symptoms from baseline'. Some of the OAB symptoms assessed were as follows: change from baseline to week 12 in the number of micturitions per 24 h, the number of nocturia episodes per 24 h and the number of urgency episodes per 24 h. Other symptom related variables included change in volume of the first nocturnal void, level of urgency and the number of patients achieving continence.

### EAU guidelines on the assessment of non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms including benign prostatic obstruction [^112PAAgq]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) represent one of the most common clinical complaints in adult men and have multifactorial aetiology.

Objective

To develop European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on the assessment of men with non-neurogenic LUTS.

Evidence Acquisition

A structured literature search on the assessment of non-neurogenic male LUTS was conducted. Articles with the highest available level of evidence were selected. The Delphi technique consensus approach was used to develop the recommendations.

Evidence Synthesis

As a routine part of the initial assessment of male LUTS, a medical history must be taken, a validated symptom score questionnaire with quality-of-life question(s) should be completed, a physical examination including digital rectal examination should be performed, urinalysis must be ordered, post-void residual urine (PVR) should be measured, and uroflowmetry may be performed. Micturition frequency-volume charts or bladder diaries should be used to assess male LUTS with a prominent storage component or nocturia. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) should be measured only if a diagnosis of prostate cancer will change the management or if PSA can assist in decision-making for patients at risk of symptom progression and complications. Renal function must be assessed if renal impairment is suspected from the history and clinical examination, if the patient has hydronephrosis, or when considering surgical treatment for male LUTS. Uroflowmetry should be performed before any treatment. Imaging of the upper urinary tract in men with LUTS should be performed in patients with large PVR, haematuria, or a history of urolithiasis. Imaging of the prostate should be performed if this assists in choosing the appropriate drug and when considering surgical treatment. Urethrocystoscopy should only be performed in men with LUTS to exclude suspected bladder or urethral pathology and/or before minimally invasive/surgical therapies if the findings may change treatment. Pressure-flow studies should be performed only in individual patients for specific indications before surgery or when evaluation of the pathophysiology underlying LUTS is warranted.

Conclusions

These guidelines provide evidence-based practical guidance for assessment of non-neurogenic male LUTS. An extended version is available online (www.uroweb.org/guidelines).

Patient Summary

This article presents a short version of European Association of Urology guidelines for non-neurogenic male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The recommended tests should be able to distinguish between uncomplicated male LUTS and possible differential diagnoses and to evaluate baseline parameters for treatment. The guidelines also define the clinical profile of patients to provide the best evidence-based care. An algorithm was developed to guide physicians in using appropriate diagnostic tests.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: diagnosis and management [^111wdhYE]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is a spectrum of urological symptoms characterised by bladder pain with typical cystoscopic features. Diagnosis and management of this syndrome may be difficult. There is no evidence-based management approach for the diagnosis or treatment of BPS. The objective of this study was to critically review and summarise the evidence relating to the diagnosis and treatment of the bladder pain syndrome.

Methods

A review of published data on the diagnosis and treatment of the BPS was performed. Our search was limited to English-language articles, on the "diagnosis", and "management" or "treatment" of "interstitial cystitis" and the "bladder pain syndrome" in "humans".

Results

Frequency, urgency and pain on bladder filling are the most common symptoms of BPS. All urodynamic volumes are reduced in patients with BPS. Associated conditions include psychological distress, depression, history of sexual assault, irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. Cystoscopy remains the test for definitive diagnosis, with visualisation of haemorrhage on cystoreduction. A multidisciplinary treatment approach is essential in the management of this condition. Orally administered amitriptyline is an efficacious medical treatment for BPS. Intravesical hyaluronic acid and local anaesthetic, with/without hydrodistension are among new treatment strategies. Sacral or pudendal neuromodulation is effective, minimally invasive and safe. Surgery is reserved for refractory cases.

Conclusions

There remains a paucity of evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of BPS. We encountered significant heterogeneity in the assessment of symptoms, duration of treatment and follow up of patients in our literature review.

AUA/SUFU guideline — differentiation from other conditions explains that nocturnal polyuria is "the production of greater than 20% to 33% of total 24-hour urine output during the period of sleep" and "is largely age-dependent: > 20% for younger individuals and > 33% for elderly individuals". It notes that nocturnal polyuria voids are "frequently normal or large volume as opposed to the small volume voids" of OAB-associated nocturia. The guideline adds that OAB can be distinguished from "excess fluid intake (more than eight glasses of water per day)" using a "frequency-volume chart (i.e., a voiding diary)", and that if frequency is due to high intake with normal or large volume voids, "then the patient most likely does not have OAB", which "can be managed with education and fluid intake management".

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a highly prevalent symptom syndrome that negatively affects health-related quality of life (HRQL). In clinical practice, the diagnosis and treatment of OAB are largely driven by a patient's reporting of symptoms, often in combination with objective assessment. Thus, OAB provides the opportunity to examine the relations between objective (eg, urodynamic studies, bladder diary variables) and subjective (eg, symptom bother, HRQL) outcomes. We compared objective and subjective results from 27 trials recently evaluated in a systematic review and meta-analysis of antimuscarinic agents used to treat OAB. Many studies demonstrated concurrent improvements in both types of outcomes. However, several reports showed that although pharmacotherapy may reduce micturition frequency or increase bladder capacity, treated patients may not perceive a significant benefit to HRQL. We conclude that objective assessments can help determine the underlying causes of OAB symptoms and assess the effects of treatment, but that these results are not always predictive of subjective outcomes, which are influenced by a patient's priorities and lifestyle, and thus highly individualized. A patient's perception of treatment success should be regarded as an important measure of efficacy because a patient considers the trade-offs between symptom improvement, adverse events, and effects on daily life when assessing overall treatment benefit. We recommend that subjective measures become standard considerations in the initial evaluation and treatment of patients with OAB.

### Giggle incontinence: a scoping review [^1179FGqE]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Giggle incontinence (GI) is poorly described, defined, and understood. It is considered a bladder storage disorder in which laughter causes an uncontrollable episode of urinary incontinence that cannot be stopped until the bladder is completely emptied. It has been confused with stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder. A thorough analysis of 26 articles on the subject of "giggle incontinence" and associated terms was performed, including all articles since the phrase first appeared. To date, 351 GI cases have been reported. It occurs mainly in women (69.5%) at 5 years of age, with a prevalence ranging from 8.4 to 16.2 years (average age of 12.4 years), and some cases have a family history of the disease (13–16.7%). This review discusses the historical background, current understanding, and challenges related to GI. It primarily affects females after the age of 5 years, causing complete bladder emptying during uncontrollable laughter. The exact cause is unknown, but hypotheses suggest involvement of the central nervous system. Diagnosis relies on clinical history, physical tests, and urine frequency evaluation. Management involves urotherapy techniques, biofeedback, and methylphenidate. Understanding GI will aid in developing more effective management techniques. IMPACT: Highlights limited awareness among healthcare professionals about giggle incontinence as a distinct condition, emphasizing the need for standardized diagnostic criteria and assessment tools. Addresses insufficient understanding of the underlying mechanisms and contributing factors, providing valuable insights for better diagnosis and treatment. Emphasizes the importance of patient education and support, calling for improved resources and counseling. Urges further research and evidence-based guidelines to enhance treatment strategies.

### Overactive bladder: a better understanding of pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^115ECyJw]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed current information regarding the updated definitions, prevalence, etiologies, disease burden, and management of OAB from a number of perspectives, including professional impact and patient quality of life.

Materials and Methods

Published literature and current treatment concepts were reviewed regarding the understanding and management of OAB.

Results

OAB is a symptom syndrome including urinary urgency with or without urinary incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. Approximately 17% of the adult population experience OAB. There are evolving theories regarding its pathophysiology and the mechanism of action of the most commonly prescribed pharmacological therapy (antimuscarinic agents). Treatment primarily revolves around improving quality of life.

Conclusions

Behavioral therapy combined with pharmacological therapy often will bring about acceptable outcomes for patients with OAB. Modalities such as botulinum toxin injections, neuromodulation, and various surgical interventions also are showing encouraging results in more refractory patients.

### Invasive urodynamic studies for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men with voiding dysfunction [^11157rpf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Invasive urodynamic tests are used to investigate men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and voiding dysfunction to determine a definitive objective diagnosis. The aim is to help clinicians select the treatment that is most likely to be successful. These investigations are invasive and time-consuming.

Objectives

To determine whether performing invasive urodynamic investigation, as opposed to other methods of diagnosis such as non-invasive urodynamics or clinical history and examination alone, reduces the number of men with continuing symptoms of voiding dysfunction. This goal will be achieved by critically appraising and summarising current evidence from randomised controlled trials related to clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness. This review is not intended to consider whether urodynamic tests are reliable for making clinical diagnoses, nor whether one type of urodynamic test is better than another for this purpose. The following comparisons were made.• Urodynamics versus clinical management.• One type of urodynamics versus another.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2014, issue 10), MEDLINE (1 January 1946 to Week 4 October 2014), MEDLINE In-Process and other non-indexed citations (covering 27 November 2014; all searched on 28 November 2014), EMBASE Classic and EMBASE (1 January 2010 to Week 47 2014, searched on 28 November 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) (searched on 1 December 2014 and 3 December 2014, respectively), as well as the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing clinical outcomes in men who were and were not investigated with the use of invasive urodynamics, or comparing one type of urodynamics against another, were included. Trials were excluded if they did not report clinical outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

We included two trials, but data were available for only 339 men in one trial, of whom 188 underwent invasive urodynamic studies. We found evidence of risk of bias, such as lack of outcome information for 24 men in one arm of the trial. Statistically significant evidence suggests that the tests did change clinical decision making. Men in the invasive urodynamics arm were more likely to have their management changed than men in the control arm (proportion with change in management 24/188 (13%) vs 0/151 (0%), risk ratio (RR) 39.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.42 to 642.74). However, the quality of the evidence was low. Low-quality evidence indicates that men in the invasive urodynamics group were less likely to undergo surgery as treatment for voiding LUTS (164/188 (87%) vs 151/151 (100%), RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.92). Investigators observed no difference in urine flow rates before and after surgery for LUTS (mean percentage increase in urine flow rate, 140% in invasive urodynamic group vs 149% in immediate surgery group, P value = 0.13). Similarly, they found no differences between groups with regards to International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) (mean percentage decrease in IPSS score, 58% in invasive urodynamics group vs 59% in immediate surgery group, P value = 0.22). No evidence was available to demonstrate whether differences in management equated to improved health outcomes, such as relief of symptoms of voiding dysfunction or improved quality of life. No evidence from randomised trials revealed the adverse effects associated with invasive urodynamic studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Although invasive urodynamic testing did change clinical decision making, we found no evidence to demonstrate whether this led to reduced symptoms of voiding dysfunction after treatment. Larger definitive trials of better quality are needed, in which men are randomly allocated to management based on invasive urodynamic findings or to management based on findings obtained by other diagnostic means. This research will show whether performance of invasive urodynamics results in reduced symptoms of voiding dysfunction after treatment.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^1127YGf6]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) follow-up — Guideline Statement 23 states, "The clinician should offer follow up with the patient to assess compliance, efficacy, side effects and possible alternative treatments" (Expert Opinion). The discussion notes, "The purpose of follow-up is to assess compliance with treatment protocols, query patients regarding symptom improvements and any adverse events and present information about possible alternative treatments to patients who have insufficient symptom improvement and/or intolerable adverse events". It adds that measurement options include "voiding diaries with or without frequency-volume charts and patient-rated global response scales for urgency, urgency incontinence, incontinence, frequency and nocturia", and that "validated OAB-specific instruments may be used to assess the impact of OAB symptoms on quality of life". It further advises, "Ideally, clinicians should obtain baseline measures using the same instruments in order to quantify progress" and "Patients should be encouraged to persist with a particular treatment for four to eight weeks; this time period will identify the majority of responders".

### Evaluation of a new model of care for bladder management in a statewide spinal cord service [^113HMnP6]. Spinal Cord (2025). Medium credibility.

There are many methods for managing a neurogenic bladder. Two common options are the use of an indwelling catheter (IDC) and intermittent self-catherisation (ISC). An IDC is inserted into the bladder and can remain in situ for weeks at a time. ISC involves emptying the bladder at a specified, intermittent frequency by person inserting a catheter, completely draining the bladder and then removing the catheter. Whilst the evidence is low, some studies have found that ISC can reduce chronic urogenital complications such as UTI, and the European Association of Urology (EAU) and American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend the use of ISC over IDC for bladder management. Intermittent self-catheterisation is therefore recommended as the gold standard of care for bladder management. The use of IDCs previously had been standard bladder care at the Victorian Spinal Cord Service (VSCS). A retrospective review of bladder management practice at the VSCS found that ISC was associated with a lower rate of UTI in people with SCI. As such, in August 2017 the VSCS introduced a new method of bladder management, ISC. Therefore, the change in practice is important to reduce the risk and rate of UTI and improve QoL for people living with SCI. The aim of this project was to evaluate the impact of a new bladder management strategy following a change from using IDC as standard care to ISC.

### Management, surveillance patterns, and costs associated with low-grade papillary stage Ta non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer among older adults, 2004–2013 [^114N452Z]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Patient characteristics independently associated with more frequent cystoscopic evaluation (> 2 cystoscopies per year) included female sex (odds ratio [OR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64–0.76), being married or having a partner (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.61–0.77), and having a more recent NMIBC diagnosis (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86–1.00) (Table 3). Female sex (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74–0.88), being married or having a partner (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.93), and having a more recent diagnosis (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61–0.71) were significantly associated with frequent cytologic testing (> 1 test per year). Female sex (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77–0.91) was also independently associated with more frequent upper tract imaging (> 1 test per year). Regional differences were also noted, with residence in the South and West being uniformly associated with more frequent surveillance testing (eg, receipt of ≤ 2 cystoscopies: OR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.62–0.80] in the South and 0.80 [95% CI, 0.73–0.89] in the West). There were also patient-related factors associated with less frequent surveillance testing. Advanced age (81–90 years) was associated with less frequent cystoscopies (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.36–1.69) and urine cytologic testing (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03–1.28), whereas Black race was associated with less frequent cystoscopies (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.14–1.74) and upper tract imaging (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11–1.67). Patient characteristics associated with the receipt of intravesical BCG included Black race (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.59–0.96) and being married or having a partner (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70–0.95). Black race (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54–0.84), residence in the South (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70–0.94), and more recent diagnosis (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78–0.93) were significantly associated with the receipt of intravesical induction and/or maintenance chemotherapy.

### Visceral and cutaneous sensory testing in patients with painful bladder syndrome [^116o9nQ4]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Our aims were to determine whether subjects with painful bladder syndrome (PBS) demonstrate characteristics of visceral pain syndromes: visceral hyperalgesia, expanded loci of referral of bladder sensation, increased bladder pain with repetitive filling, lower thresholds to cutaneous stimulation in relevant dermatomes, abnormal response to repetitive cutaneous stimulation in relevant dermatomes, and also to develop easily applied measures for PBS pain evaluation and management.

Methods

We recruited PBS subjects and control subjects with no bladder pain and with either stress urinary incontinence (SUI) or no incontinence. Subjects underwent three bladder fills up to maximum 300 mL and mapped bladder fullness/discomfort, rating any pain present. Cutaneous current perception thresholds (CPTs) were tested at 2000 Hz, 250 Hz, 5 Hz at C5, T6, T10, T12, S3 dermatomes. Repetitive supra-threshold stimulation in trains of 15 stimuli 2 sec apart were then administered to T12, S3 dermatomes.

Results

PBS subjects demonstrated hyperalgesia to bladder filling and tended to sense bladder discomfort at both suprapubic and vulvar/urethral sites. There was no difference in CPTs at any dermatome at any stimulating frequency. PBS and SI subjects tended not to habituate to repetitive stimuli, while asymptomatic controls tended to habituate to repetitive stimulation.

Conclusions

PBS subjects demonstrate bladder hyperalgesia and may sense bladder discomfort at sites other than suprapubic. Rating of bladder discomfort and sensory mapping during cystometry usefully distinguishes between PBS subjects and controls.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^111stT9z]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline — symptom definitions and measurement in OAB: Urgency is defined by the ICS as the "complaint of a sudden, compelling desire to pass urine which is difficult to defer", and although it is "considered the hallmark symptom of OAB", many studies measure response using other metrics such as "number of voids" and "number of incontinence episodes". Urinary frequency "can be reliably measured with a voiding diary", and "up to seven micturitions episodes during waking hours has been considered normal", with substantial variability. Nocturia is "the complaint of interruption of sleep one or more times because of the need to void", and "In one study, three or more episodes of nocturia constitutes moderate or major bother". Urgency urinary incontinence is "the involuntary leakage of urine, associated with a sudden compelling desire to void", and incontinence episodes "can be measured reliably with a diary", with quantity measurable "with pad tests".

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: a systematic review [^116Ue1jV]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and study assessment

We abstracted information on baseline population characteristics, interventions, subject enrollment and discontinuation, and results for effectiveness and harms outcomes. Efficacy outcomes examined included change from baseline number of incontinence and urgency (grade 3 or 4) episodes, micturition frequency, proportion of patients reporting no incontinence over 3 days at end of study, and patient-reported symptom assessment using the Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) Symptom Bother score, or the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). The PPBC contains six items assessing change scores from −2 to 2 with negative scores indicating improvement. Clinically meaningful difference has not yet been established for the PPBC. The OAB-q Symptom Bother score contains eight items on a 100-point scale with a suggested minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of ten points. The OABSS contains four questions, one each assessing daytime frequency, nighttime frequency, urgency, and UUI with a maximum score of 2, 3, 5, and 5, respectively (higher score indicates worse symptom), yielding a total possible score of 15. An MCID of 3 points has been suggested. Harm outcomes examined included withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs) as defined by individual studies, blurred vision, constipation, dizziness, dry mouth, QT prolongation, arrhythmia, and other cardiac outcomes. Data abstraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. We assessed the internal validity (quality) of trials based on the predefined DERP criteria, including method used for randomization, allocation concealment, similarity of compared groups at baseline, loss to follow-up, and the use of intent-to-treat analysis. Studies with a high risk of bias were rated poor quality, trials that met all criteria were rated good quality, and the remainder were rated as fair. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of each study and differences were resolved by consensus.

### Overactive bladder: clinical updates in women's health care primary and preventive care review [^116cma3r]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is a condition that involves urinary urgency, usually accompanied by increased daytime frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. This condition is multifactorial, and several theories exist that explain the pathophysiologic process underlying the condition. Because the prevalence of the condition is high among women across all age groups, obstetrician-gynecologists will encounter women with OAB syndrome and should be able to evaluate and treat this condition. The appropriate management often is based on the degree of bother and severity of symptoms in an individual patient. This monograph will delineate the general characteristics of OAB syndrome from its epidemiology to potential causes and provide a detailed discussion of the evaluation of the patient with various diagnostic modalities and the range of available treatment options.

### Associations between subjective overactive bladder symptoms and objective parameters on bladder diary and filling cystometry [^112fxG3b]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Daytime and nocturnal frequency symptoms are best associated with objective frequency and volume parameters from a bladder diary and filling cystometry. In contrast, the urgency symptom, which is essential in the current definition of OAB, is poorly associated with these objective parameters. Therefore, the current practice of using frequency and incontinence episodes in the outcome research of OAB trials is justified.

### Good urodynamic practice: keys to performing a quality UDS study [^117H5BFh]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Urodynamics (UDS) is the dynamic study of the storage and voiding function of the urinary tract. The goal of the UDS study is to identify the cause of a patient's voiding symptoms, assess prognosis or the results of prior therapy, or direct management by collecting quantitative measurements while reproducing the patient's voiding symptoms where appropriate and possible. Several parts of the UDS study are customized for each individual to maximize the utility of the test. This article summarizes the key points to performing a quality UDS study that can evaluate and diagnose disorders of the lower urinary tract.

### Multidisciplinary management of a spondyloarthritis presenting with bladder involvement as the initial clinical symptom: a rare case report [^115LZL38]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

This case underscores the critical importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in managing complex medical presentations. The initial misdiagnosis and ineffective treatments highlight the challenges faced when symptoms cross traditional specialty boundaries. The successful diagnosis and management were achieved through collaboration between urology and rheumatology, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach to patient, especially in cases of chronic, treatment-resistant symptoms.

The differential diagnosis for patients with refractory LUTS and chronic pelvic pain requires a systematic, stepwise approach to balance diagnostic feasibility and accuracy, particularly when advanced testing (e.g. HLA-B27, biopsies) is unavailable. Our proposed framework includes: (1) Initial Evaluation: ① Clinical History: Duration, triggers, and progression of LUTS (e.g. urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia). Pain characteristics (location, timing, relation to bladder filling/voiding). Allergy history, autoimmune disorders, or prior infections. ② Basic Investigations: Urinalysis, urine culture, and cytology to exclude infection/malignancy. Blood tests: CBC (eosinophil count), CRP, ESR, and renal function. (2) Imaging and Non-Invasive Testing: ① Pelvic MRI/CT: To assess structural abnormalities (e.g. bladder wall thickening, masses) and rule out pelvic floor dysfunction or musculoskeletal causes. ② Ultrasound: Evaluate for hydronephrosis, bladder residuals, or urothelial lesions. (3) Key Differentiators for Overlapping Conditions: 3.1 Interstitial Cystitis (IC): ① Diagnostic Clues: Symptom correlation with bladder filling (worsening pain relieved by voiding). Cystoscopy Findings: Glomerulations (petechial hemorrhages) after hydrodistension or Hunner's ulcers (patches of inflamed mucosa). Exclusion of mimics (e.g. infection, malignancy). ② Limitations: Requires cystoscopy under anesthesia, which may not be universally accessible. 3.2 Eosinophilic Cystitis (EC): ① Diagnostic Clues: History of allergic diseases (e.g. asthma, eczema) or parasitic infections. Laboratory Findings: Peripheral eosinophilia on CBC. ② Cystoscopy: Polypoid or ulcerative lesions, typically localized to the bladder dome or trigone. ③ Histopathology: Dense eosinophilic infiltration in bladder mucosa/submucosa (definitive diagnosis). 3.3 Spondyloarthropathy (SpA)-Associated Cystitis: ① Diagnostic Clues: Concurrent axial/peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, or extra-articular manifestations (e.g. uveitis). ② Sacroiliac joint imaging (MRI/CT) for axial involvement. ③ HLA-B27 testing if accessible (supports but does not confirm diagnosis). (4) Pragmatic Diagnostic Algorithm: ① Exclude infection, stones, and malignancy via urinalysis, imaging, and cytology. ② For allergy-prone patients or eosinophilia, prioritize EC evaluation (CBC, cystoscopy if indicated). ③ In patients with pain linked to bladder filling/emptying, pursue cystoscopy for IC (if feasible). ④ For those with systemic inflammatory features (e.g. arthritis, elevated CRP), investigate SpA (imaging, HLA-B27). (5) Therapeutic Trials as Diagnostic Tools: ① IC: Response to intravesical therapies (e.g. heparin, hyaluronic acid). ② EC: Trial of corticosteroids/antihistamines with monitoring of eosinophil counts. ③ SpA: Improvement with NSAIDs or biologics (e.g. TNF inhibitors). While HLA-B27 and biopsies provide definitive insights, resource constraints necessitate reliance on clinical phenotyping, targeted imaging, and therapeutic response. Multidisciplinary collaboration (urology, rheumatology) is critical to optimize diagnostic accuracy and avoid prolonged diagnostic odysseys. This approach aligns with our case management strategy, emphasizing adaptability to local diagnostic capabilities.

### Development of a core set of outcome measures for OAB treatment [^114irvGu]. International Urogynecology Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a symptom-based condition defined as urinary urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia in the absence of urinary tract infections or other obvious pathology. It is a common condition that affects many individuals worldwide, with a prevalence estimated between 11.8 and 17%, with incidence increasing with increasing age. OAB negatively impacts quality of life (QoL) and often results in significant healthcare expenditures. Treatments range from conservative approaches, such as lifestyle intervention, to pharmacological and surgical options. For many patients, the process of seeking care involves frequent clinic appointments and multiple treatment approaches. A study of five European countries and Canada found that the annual expenditure per patient for OAB ranged from 262 to 619 euros (US$293–693). When indirect costs such as work absenteeism were included, the total cost for the estimated 25 million people with OAB in the countries studied was 9.7 billion euros. Despite the significant cost of OAB management, it is difficult to determine the most effective and efficient treatment approaches because there are no standard outcome metrics that allow comparison of outcomes and costs across providers.

The discipline of value-based health care (VBHC) contains the tools to support such a strategy. VBHC defines "value" in healthcare as the ratio between the outcomes of care delivered and the cost of achieving those outcomes. The VBHC agenda focuses on the standardization of metrics to promote comparison of outcomes and costs across providers for identifying best practices for delivering high-value care. Standardized measures enable comparison of outcomes across providers and treatments to improve care quality and efficacy. Measures for evaluating care outcomes for OAB that are most important to patients would be of great utility to improve our understanding of which treatment options or combinations offer greatest treatment value.

The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) is a not-for-profit organization that convenes international working groups of clinicians, researchers, and patients to define minimum sets of standardized outcomes by medical condition with a focus on outcomes that matter most to patients. Following such development, ICHOM works to support implementation and benchmarking of these standard sets to facilitate the adoption of VBHC worldwide. The objective of this project was to define a minimum standard set of outcomes for evaluating OAB treatment. This set of outcome measures and case-mix factors is designed to be appropriate for and easily implemented by any clinician treating patients with OAB, regardless of medical specialty, treatment given, or country of practice.

### Management of overactive bladder [^117Vj8ji]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

Many people are affected by urinary urgency, which can be highly bothersome. Urgency is the cornerstone symptom of overactive bladder (OAB), commonly occurring in conjunction with urinary frequency and nocturia. Once other medical causes of similar symptoms have been excluded, first-line OAB management comprises fluid intake advice and bladder training, supplemented by antimuscarinic drugs if necessary. Urodynamic confirmation of the diagnosis is required for OAB patients whose symptoms are refractory to first-line interventions. If patients are severely bothered by OAB despite optimization of medical treatment, they may proceed to invasive treatments, including neuromodulation, enterocystoplasty, detrusor myectomy, or urinary diversion. Our burgeoning understanding of the complex cellular, neural and integrative physiology of the bladder offers new insights into the causative mechanisms of OAB, and reasons why patients sometimes fail to respond to treatment. Study of sensory information pathways in the lower urinary tract has led to identification of the urothelium, afferent nerves and interstitial cells as key cellular elements in OAB. In-depth knowledge of the hierarchy of central nervous system control is lacking, but functional imaging is beginning to elucidate the challenges that lie ahead. New treatments under investigation include botulinum neurotoxin-A injection, oral β(3)-adrenergic agonists, and novel modalities for nerve stimulation. The subjective nature of urinary urgency, the lack of animal models and the multifactorial pathophysiology of OAB present significant challenges to effective clinical management.

### Patient-reported outcomes and different approaches to urinary parameters in overactive bladder: what should we measure? [^112TwS2S]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is highly prevalent and associated with considerable impact on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Assessment of HRQoL can reveal the burden of disease and post-intervention improvement. This review aims to highlight the importance of HRQoL assessment and outline the tools available for use in clinical trials and real-world clinical practice. A number of validated measures of HRQoL specific to OAB have been developed, offering greater sensitivity and responsiveness over generic instruments. These condition-specific, multi-dimensional and single-item global questionnaires are particularly useful for the multiple and varied symptoms of OAB, as they reflect the patient's needs, concerns and values. Measurements for lower urinary tract symptoms, e.g. bladder diaries, are being compared with HRQoL instruments to provide greater understanding of the disease and treatment from the patient's perspective. Therapeutic interventions to improve OAB symptoms should also be evaluated for their effect on the patient's HRQoL.

The objective of this ICCS standardization document is to report the initial diagnostic evaluation and subsequent work-up of children with neuropathic bladder dysfunction.

Materials and Methods

Due to a paucity of level I or level II, "levels of evidence" publications, these recommendations are actually a compilation of best practices because they seem to be effective and reliable, although not with any control.

Results

Throughout the document, the emphasis is on promoting early, comprehensive evaluation of lower urinary tract function that is thorough but with a minimum of unnecessary testing. This includes what tests to order, when to order them and what to do with the results. Some of the recommendations may not be practical in various worldwide locations but the suggested testing should be considered the ideal approach to completely diagnosing and then promulgating treatments based on the full knowledge of the condition and its effect on urinary tract function. Once the findings are delineated, those lower urinary tract patterns of dysfunction that put the kidneys at risk for deterioration, that are barriers to attaining eventual continence, and that have long-term consequence to the lower urinary track can be obviated by specific management recommendations. The indications and timing of investigations to achieve these objectives are clearly defined in each diagnostic category and during follow-up.

Recommendations

This document should be used as a basis for appropriate evaluation and timely surveillance of the various neuro-urologic conditions that affect children.

### Bladder management in persons with spinal cord lesion [^115f3wJh]. Spinal Cord (2004). Low credibility.

Study Design

Cross-sectional clinical descriptive prevalence study.

Objective

To evaluate the methods of self-reported bladder management, the frequency of urinary tract infection (UTI) and subjective disturbance of bladder problems of all those individuals with traumatic spinal cord lesion (SCL) living in Helsinki area.

Setting

Helsinki, Finland.

Methods

A total of 152 persons with SCL were found in the Helsinki area (546 000 inhabitants). A structured questionnaire was sent to all subjects and they were invited to a clinical visit.

Results

The final study-group consisted of 129 (85%) subjects. They were defined into seven specific subgroups of bladder management: 14 (11%) subjects in the normal voiding group, 15 (12%) in the controlled voiding group, 16 (12%) in the clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) group, 30 (23%) in the mixed group, 31 (24%) in the suprapubic tapping group, 16 (12%) in the compression or straining group and seven (5%) in the catheter or conduit group. The frequency of UTI was highest in the mixed group. The bladder management was a biggest bother to the subjects in the compression or straining group.

Conclusions

This prevalence study assesses the self-reported bladder management methods in all the persons with traumatic SCL in the Helsinki area. The subjects who used CIC and other methods for bladder management had more problems than others. These subjects might manage better by using either CIC or suprapubic tapping as the only method for bladder emptying.

### 75NC007 device for noninvasive stress urinary incontinence management in women: a randomized controlled trial [^112DP4h1]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Management of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) with intravaginal devices is an alternative to surgical management, but data of a high level of evidence remain scarce. Our goal was to assess efficacy, tolerance, and acceptability of the 75NC007 intravaginal device for SUI management.

Methods

A phase III, multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted. After an initial washout period with no treatment, allowing baseline evaluation, women with SUI were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group (no treatment). The primary endpoint was the reduction of incontinence episode frequency (IEF), according to bladder diaries, as compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints were variation of the Urinary Symptom Profile (USP) score, of 24-h pad test, and of CONTILIFE questionnaire scores as compared to baseline. Intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted.

Results

Fifty-five patients were enrolled and analyzed (26 controls and 29 treated). The mean relative variations of IEF, SUI USP subscore, and overactive bladder (OAB) USP subscore were more significant in the treatment group than in the control group (-31.7 ± 65.1% vs -7.6 ± 24.5%, p = 0.002, -2.4 ± 2.6 vs 0.2 ± 2.2, p = 0.004, and -1.5 ± 2.8 vs 0.2 ± 1.8, p = 0.016, respectively). The dysuria USP subscore was slightly decreased in the treatment group. CONTILIFE scores were slightly improved in the treatment group. Pad test variations were not different between groups. No serious adverse event was noted throughout the entire study.

Conclusions

The 75NC007 intravaginal device is a safe and effective noninvasive treatment of SUI in women.

Definitions of dysfunctional voiding symptoms

Voiding diary

A detailed voiding diary and associated symptoms can provide valuable diagnostic and management insights into DV. The diary should span three days and record the time and volume of each void, fluid intake, incontinence episodes, defecation, and fecal soiling episodes.

Uroflowmetry can provide key insights into the dynamics of bladder emptying. It is beneficial for children who are capable of voiding on command, particularly in cases involving a weak urinary stream, difficulty voiding without straining, frequent UTIs due to incomplete bladder emptying, or incontinence that does not respond to treatment. Uroflowmetry measures urine flow rate and offers a comprehensive view of bladder function when combined with post-void residual volume assessed via ultrasound. Repeated abnormal flow patterns may indicate bladder contraction abnormalities or the presence of a functional or structural issue at the bladder outlet or along the urethra.

Physical examination

The physical examination should be thorough, identifying any urologic, neurologic, or anatomical abnormalities. Table 2 outlines the key components of a comprehensive physical exam for DV.

Table 2
Physical Examination Components

Laboratory assessment

The urinalysis and urine culture are the first laboratory assessments that should be conducted. These tests are essential to rule out underlying infections, hematuria, or proteinuria, which may indicate additional urinary system abnormalities.

Imaging evaluation

Ultrasound [US], as a non-invasive and commonly used method, is employed to investigate the kidneys and bladder of children with DV. It should be performed in every child suspected of neurological or anatomical lesions, UTI, or symptoms indicating obstructive uropathy, such as a weak or interrupted urinary stream. The US is beneficial because of its safety, ease of use, and ability to detect structural anomalies early. It can provide information regarding anomalies, such as hydronephrosis, a duplicated collecting system with or without an ectopic ureter, and scarring of the kidneys. Additionally, it assesses post-void residual volume, which indicates impaired bladder emptying when a volume exceeds 20 mL after repeated measurements [or more than 15–20% of their bladder capacity]. Increased residual volumes suggest ineffective bladder emptying, which may require further urodynamic evaluation. The US also evaluates bladder wall thickness, which, if thickened, suggests an overactive bladder due to an anatomical or functional abnormality of its outlet.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis in adolescents [^116uSNzy]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis (IC), or painful bladder syndrome, is characterized by irritative voiding symptoms and can be a challenging problem that affects children and adolescents. Diagnosis and management in children and adolescents is challenging because of strict diagnostic criteria and the paucity of investigations focusing on this age group, which often can lead to delayed or missed diagnosis. Clinical features suggestive of IC include bladder pain, urgency, frequency, nocturia, and pressure. Symptoms may wax and wane and often are exacerbated by menstruation, intercourse, dietary triggers, and stress. Diagnosis can be made by history, physical exam findings such as suprapubic tenderness, voiding diaries, and exclusion of other etiologies. Some diagnostic tests such as the potassium sensitivity test and cystoscopy are invasive and often impractical in younger patients. Treatment of IC consists of a multimodal approach that should be tailored to the individual needs of the patient. Therapies for younger patients include oral medication, intravesical therapy, cystoscopy with hydrodistention, and conservative measures such as dietary modification. This review of the literature focuses on diagnosing IC in younger patients and on what treatment modalities are appropriate and effective for this age group.

### Research methodology in acupuncture for managing interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: a scoping review [^116fbgxc]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Guidelines from the Canadian Urological Association (CUA, 2016), the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (ESSIC, 2021), the European Association of Urology (EAU, 2023), the Asian 2020 Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the American Urological Association guideline (AUA, 2022) all define interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) as a condition characterized by chronic pelvic pain (usually suprapubic) and bladder‐related pressure or discomfort, accompanied by other urinary symptoms such as urgency and increased frequency. Additional signs described in the literature include nocturia, sleep disorders, sexual dysfunction, emotional or behavioral issues, and a higher prevalence in women.

Despite this general consensus, definitions vary across regions: North America favors "IC" with a bladder‐centric focus, Europe prefers "BPS" emphasizing pain and broader symptom‐based criteria, and some Asian countries use both terms but apply stricter diagnostic thresholds. These discrepancies pose challenges for global research collaboration, clinical trials, and patient management. Furthermore, some authors consider IC/BPS as synonymous, while others define it as a syndrome, disorder, chronic pelvic pain syndrome, or a symptom.

The unclear pathophysiology of IC/BPS complicates diagnosis and treatment, especially since IC and BPS often overlap but differ: IC involves chronic inflammation, while BPS typically does not. Diagnostic practices vary globally, with North America emphasizing cystoscopy and biopsy for IC, while other regions favor symptom‐based diagnosis and highlight the need for biomarkers to improve early management.

Still, a comprehensive therapeutic solution is needed, so the current approach focuses primarily on symptom relief, starting with conservative treatments, followed by medication and more invasive treatments such as hydrodistension and surgery. Please see Supporting Material for more detailed treatment strategies (S1).

IC/BPS is a challenging condition to treat, with limited effective options, prompting many patients to explore complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Complementary medicine is used alongside conventional treatments to enhance their effects, while alternative medicine replaces conventional treatments. Acupuncture and moxibustion, both practiced for over 3000 years, are among the most well‐known CAM treatments. The method is commonly practiced as a routine treatment in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, but since the late 1970s, these therapies have gained popularity in the United States and other Western countries.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^115kFmKv]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Background — definitions and measurement in overactive bladder (OAB) state that this guideline is focused on the evaluation and treatment of idiopathic OAB, and the IUGA/ICS joint terminology defines OAB as "urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without UUI, in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology"; urgency is the "complaint of a sudden, compelling desire to pass urine which is difficult to defer" and is considered the hallmark symptom of OAB; increased daytime urinary frequency is the "complaint that micturition occurs more frequently during waking hours than deemed normal", daytime void number can be measured with a voiding diary or self-report and, traditionally, "up to seven micturition episodes during waking hours has been considered normal"; nocturia is interruption of sleep to micturate with each void preceded and followed by sleep, and UUI is involuntary leakage associated with urgency with incontinence episodes measured by diary or self-report and leakage quantity estimated with pad counts.

### Artificial intelligence-based prediction of treatment failure and medication non-adherence in overactive bladder management [^114pesUo]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

While urodynamic studies were performed in a subset of patients (n = 178, 62.5%) to further characterize bladder function, detrusor overactivity on urodynamic testing was not required for OAB diagnosis, consistent with international guidelines. Patients were categorized according to the likely underlying etiology of their OAB symptoms: idiopathic OAB (without identifiable cause), neurogenic OAB (associated with specific neurological conditions including diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury), or OAB secondary to bladder outlet obstruction.

Exclusion criteria included: (1) incomplete medical records, (2) loss to follow-up before three months, (3) active urinary tract infection or stone disease, (4) significant pelvic organ prolapse (≥ stage 2), (5) patients with predominant stress urinary incontinence without OAB symptoms, and (6) urological surgical intervention within six months prior to treatment initiation.

The data collection process encompassed demographic characteristics, underlying neurological conditions, baseline ultrasonographic bladder parameters, medication regimens, and early treatment response indicators.

Treatment failure was defined as meeting any of the following criteria within three months of treatment initiation: persistent symptoms with Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) symptom bother score > 40 (representing continued moderate-to-severe symptom burden despite treatment); deterioration in ultrasonographic bladder wall thickness (> 20% increase from baseline when measured under standardized conditions with bladder volume of 200–300 ml); lack of improvement in key voiding diary parameters (specifically, < 20% reduction in frequency or < 25% reduction in urgency episodes); deterioration in uroflowmetry parameters (> 20% decrease in maximum flow rate or > 30% increase in post-void residual volume); or need for treatment regimen modification due to inadequate symptom control.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^113eQ6LD]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Fluid intake, diaries, normal frequency, medications, and bother assessment — Bladder function is related to amount and type of fluid intake and excessive fluid intake can produce voiding patterns that mimic OAB symptoms, so an inquiry into fluid intake habits should be performed including how much fluid and of what type is consumed, daily and nocturnal voiding frequency, and patients who cannot provide accurate intake/voiding information should fill out a fluid diary; urinary frequency varies across individuals and in community-dwelling healthy adults normal frequency consists of voiding every three to four hours with a median of approximately six voids a day, current medication use also should be reviewed to ensure voiding symptoms are not due to prescribed medications (particularly diuretics), and the degree of bother from bladder symptoms also should be assessed because if a patient is not significantly bothered there would be less compelling reason to treat the symptoms.

### Management, surveillance patterns, and costs associated with low-grade papillary stage Ta non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer among older adults, 2004–2013 [^114eW7FH]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cohort study involving 13 054 patients with low-grade Ta NMIBC, frequent surveillance testing was common, and the intensity of surveillance increased over time. Moreover, treatments persisted, and cancer outcomes remained unchanged, with higher costs associated with management of recurrent disease. Among patients with low-grade Ta NMIBC, progression is rare, occurring in approximately 4% to 11% of patients. Notably, death rates are also negligible in this low-risk population. Given these favorable cancer outcomes, deescalation in surveillance among those with low-risk NMIBC compared with high-risk NMIBC is recommended by current international guidelines. However, consistent with the findings of the present study, practitioner-reported adherence to guidelines among low-risk patients remains low.

Our study had several notable findings. First, to our knowledge, this study performed one of the largest population-based analyses of surveillance patterns among patients with low-grade Ta NMIBC. The data revealed that, despite the nonaggressive nature of low-risk low-grade Ta NMIBC, surveillance testing was performed frequently. We observed numerous patients receiving invasive procedures and urine-based tests, which are associated with morbidity and additional costs to the health care system, who experienced no change in cancer outcomes. Patients underwent a median of 3.0 cystoscopies per year after receiving their low-grade Ta diagnosis. Many patients also received a median of 2.0 CTs or magnetic resonance imaging scans and 2.0 to 3.0 urine-based tests, despite guidelines recommending against the use of these tests in the low-risk setting. Although these data predated current guidelines, risk stratification and early efforts to deescalate testing had been introduced during the study period; however, despite these changes, rates of testing increased over time. These findings are consistent with those of van Rhijn et al, which revealed low adherence to AUA/SUO treatment guidelines, particularly in North America, where adherence ranged from 0.5% to 29.0%. However, in contrast to other studies that primarily focused on the underuse of indicated treatments, such as intravesical BCG in the high-risk setting, the present study centered on overuse of testing in the low-risk patient population.

### Can multicentre urodynamic studies provide high quality evidence for the clinical effectiveness of urodynamics? ICI-RS 2019 [^111HeB9g]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical registries could present an opportunity to improve the scientific evidence base currently lacking in UDS by the collection and sharing of UDS data both nationally and internationally. Currently, no such registry exists for UDS. Although some centers have their own local clinical registries, the data collected and software utilized vary from center to center, making it difficult to share data. A global registry would allow the collection of standardized datasets from multiple centers, thus providing health professionals and researchers with relevant and good quality data on a larger scale.

Clinical registries already play an important role in medical and scientific research in other areas of healthcare. Data collected within registries are often utilized to monitor disease, assess treatment outcomes and improve diagnostic techniques and healthcare delivery. 8 Increasingly, clinical registries in healthcare are being utilized to develop cost saving strategies, improve quality management processes and ensure clinical guidelines and standards are being met. 8 Registries have been shown to be valuable because the information they contain can be analyzed and used to make data‐driven (ie, evidence‐based) decisions and improvements to patient care. Consequently, clinical registries bring together clinical practice interventional, outcomes and potential areas of improvement to inform best practice. In other areas automated interpretation of examinations based on large datasets has been the standard for many years. For example, in ECG machines, which have facilitated diagnostic conclusions and enhanced accuracy. 9 Today, as a result of big data, the failure rates of the proposed diagnoses of ECG machines are lower than those of a physician.

By collecting a significant amount of urodynamic data into one large database, information on the evolution of the disease or regarding treatment response could be effectively and reliably measured. Comparing the data of thousands of patients would enable new trends on the pathophysiology of, for example, overactive or underactive bladder to be explored. This could in turn lead to new strategies in disease management. Moreover, urodynamic responses to treatment (eg, medication, botulinum toxin, neuromodulation) could be more thoroughly evaluated, which would better identify predictive factors for success or failure. The database could further reveal potential weaknesses of urodynamic investigations guiding the society to improve teaching courses and advising the industry for further improvement of their products.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^1153ghD8]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (AUA/SUFU) — treatment trial duration and sequencing (Expert Opinion) emphasizes that the Panel encourages practitioners and patients to persist with new treatments (4 to 8 weeks for medications and 8 to 12 weeks for behavioral therapies) before abandoning therapy or adding a second therapy; if a particular therapy is not efficacious after a reasonable trial, then an alternative therapy should be tried, combination therapeutic approaches should be assembled methodically one at a time toward adequate symptom control, and if control is not achieved then referral to a specialist should be considered.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^112xwVrk]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — treatment framework and differential diagnosis: The evidence base used to support this guideline did not favor stepwise "first"→"second"→"third line therapy", and to eliminate the concept of "step therapy", options are grouped by invasiveness with an emphasis on shared decision-making to select therapies based on the patient's needs, desires, and side effect tolerance; there are eight treatment categories: incontinence management strategies, behavioral therapies, optimization of co-morbidities, non-invasive therapies, pharmacologic therapies, minimally invasive therapies, invasive therapies, and indwelling catheters, and patients may select from multiple categories simultaneously. Differential diagnosis and contributors include that interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome shares urinary frequency and urgency with or without UUI, but bladder and/or pelvic pain, including dyspareunia, is crucial; genitourinary syndrome of menopause can contribute to urgency and incontinence symptoms and there is some evidence for improvement with vaginal (but not systemic) estrogen; urinary tract infection can mimic OAB but is generally acute, shorter in duration, accompanied by cues such as dysuria or suprapubic discomfort, and resolves with antibiotics; and lower urinary tract symptoms related to neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are considered neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and not idiopathic OAB. Patients with prostates experience OAB nearly as often as those without and may be underdiagnosed and undertreated; some have both benign prostatic hyperplasia and OAB, while others have OAB alone and would benefit from diagnosis specific treatment. Because the term "refractory OAB" lacks a clear definition and consensus, the guideline has refrained from using it.

### Oxybutynin in detrusor overactivity [^114fAnxH]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Oxybutynin has been used for the management of detrusor overactivity for over 30 years and has withstood medical scrutiny and the test of time throughout the world. Although several agents in the class of bladder relaxants have only recently been studied, oxybutynin's effectiveness in reducing urinary frequency and urge urinary incontinence is unquestioned in the medical literature. Oxybutynin is extremely safe and effective in almost every population including children, the elderly, and those who have neurogenic bladder. With more preparations available and more dosing flexibility than any other anticholinergic medication on the market, oxybutynin remains the "gold standard" for first-line therapy for patients who have detrusor overactivity.

### The fundamentals of uroflowmetry practice, based on international continence society good urodynamic practices recommendations [^111fBC4P]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

To review the recommendations on uroflowmetry in the International Continence Society (ICS) Standardization documents in order to identify a systematic approach to the delivery and interpretation of free flow rate testing in clinical practice.

Methods

Expectations of service and good practice in uroflowmetry described in the ICS standards on Urodynamic Practice, Urodynamic Equipment, and Terminology for Lower Urinary Tract Function were identified and summarized.

Results

Urodynamic centers should provide a suitable uroflowmetry testing environment. Equipment should be calibrated and maintained according to manufacturer requirements. Patients should be well-informed in advance of the test. They should be advised to avoid: knocking the machine; allowing the stream to move; squeezing the urethra; and body movements. It is generally appropriate to get more than one flow trace for each patient. Voided volume should be representative for the patient, for example by comparing with values recorded on a Bladder Diary. Post void residual (PVR) should be measured soon after testing. After the test, the urodynamicist should review the trace and ensure maximum flow rate and end of micturition are correctly identified in case the equipment has inappropriately taken the values from a trace artefact.

Conclusions

The summary provides a systematic approach to ensure a representative, high quality, non-invasive flow test is carried out for individual patients.

### The overactive bladder: epidemiology and morbidity [^1122z6fj]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The International Continence Society recognizes the overactive bladder (OAB) as a "symptom syndrome suggestive of lower urinary tract dysfunction" that is defined as "urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia". Patients who have OAB are often sleep deprived and their sexual life is hindered. These patients have a restricted social life and an increased risk for depression. Accurate prevalence figures are difficult to obtain because most patients consider OAB an inevitable part of aging and some patients are too embarrassed to seek diagnosis. Primary care physicians need to be educated about the importance of identifying this clinical problem and managing it in a way that will minimize morbidity and maximize quality-of-life improvement. This article describes the various aspects of OAB, with special emphasis on epidemiology and morbidity.

### Detrusor overactivity and urodynamics [^114ChDGE]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

While overactive bladder (OAB) is a clinical diagnosis, detrusor overactivity is identified through urodynamic testing. UDS is usually considered when primary treatment for OAB fails, because UDS is expensive, time consuming, invasive, and sometimes inaccurate, and it is not considered to influence treatment strategy substantially. On the other hand, UDS helps for diagnosis and treatment among women with OAB symptoms, and plays a key role in diagnosing DO to properly assess bladder function for complex LUTS situations such as nocturnal enuresis, bladder outlet obstruction, detrusor underactivity or after surgical correction of stress urinary incontinence. This article emphasizes the vital role of urodynamics in diagnosing and managing DO, highlighting its significance in treatment planning and the need for further research to refine diagnostic criteria and therapeutic strategies.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^112SRCj6]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) minimally invasive therapies — clinical principle and evidence — are positioned for patients not candidates for first-line approaches. Recommendation 23 states: Clinicians may offer minimally invasive procedures to patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo behavioral, non-invasive, or pharmacologic therapies. The guideline notes an empiric strategy where all patients are initially started on the least invasive, least expensive intervention ("first line therapy") and then, if ineffective, are progressed to more invasive and expensive options, adding that in this paradigm, individuals with OAB are not initially offered more invasive options and that long-term compliance with behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy is poor resulting in high rates of failure. Minimally invasive options including PTNS, implantable tibial nerve stimulation, BTX, and SNM have been associated with high success rates, durable efficacy, and excellent patient satisfaction in populations largely not responding to behavioral measures and medication management. For acupuncture, the evidence supporting acupuncture is uncertain as compared to no treatment or sham in OAB, though low-certainty evidence suggests similar improvements to pharmacotherapy in treatment naïve patients for reduction in UUI episodes, nocturia, and urinary frequency. Both laser and radiofrequency thermal therapies have not been well studied in OAB, and what evidence exists is of poor quality; thus these measures cannot be recommended at this time.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^114Pa1ti]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Medical history and bladder symptom assessment — clinician assessment of patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB should characterize symptoms, assess severity and duration, exclude alternative diagnoses, and identify complicated signs or symptoms that may necessitate referral or additional evaluation. Bladder symptom assessment should include questions about typical OAB symptoms (urinary urgency, daytime and nighttime frequency, urgency urinary incontinence [UUI]), other urinary storage impairments (stress incontinence, incontinence without sensation), and the ability to empty the bladder (straining to void, poor force of stream, urinary hesitancy, history of urinary retention, sensation of incomplete emptying). Predominant emptying symptoms can indicate an elevated post-void residual (PVR) and/or bladder outflow obstruction (BOO), especially in patients with prostates. Certain signs or symptoms may suggest a more complicated process that may require further evaluation include abdominal pain, pelvic pain, hematuria, recurrent UTI, sudden onset of severe OAB symptoms, concomitant neurologic symptoms (blurred vision, limb weakness or numbness), and bowel dysfunction (fecal incontinence, severe constipation). The presence of incomplete emptying or other complicated symptoms warrants specialist evaluation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a stressful and disruptive disorder that causes millions of individuals to suffer from a decrease in their quality of life.OAB is defined as the presence of urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urge urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. Urgency is the complaint of a sudden, irresistible desire to pass urine. Frequency is the number of voids per day (> 7 voids per day). Nocturia is greater than 1 void per night. Urge incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine associated with sudden compelling desire to void. To be diagnosed a combination of these symptoms must be present without a pathologic or metabolic component causing them. The national prevalence of OAB is 16.5%. The real number of individuals with OAB is most likely much larger. Many people living with OAB delay or do not seek medical attention, others are embarrassed and do not know how to talk to their health care providers about their symptoms, and others are often unaware that there are treatments available for OAB.

Patients are offered treatment following guidelines from the American Urological Association. First‐line treatments are physical therapy and behavioral therapies. These can be effective, but many patients are noncompliant. Second‐line treatment are medications. Anticholinergic and β‐3 agonist drugs show improvement rates of 70% to 80% but produce significant side effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, and cognitive decline) and can be cost‐prohibitive. Third‐line therapies include intradetrusor onabotullinumtoxin (Botox) injections, and neuromodulation. Botox produces a temporary improvement in up to 70% of cases; however, may cause urinary retention. Neuromodulation using percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is up to 70% effective and has few side effects but requires frequent visits to the clinic. Also, because it lacks an objective method of nerve location and activation, PTNS' efficacy can be highly dependent on the clinician performing the procedure.

### Overactive bladder symptoms: do we need urodynamics? [^112jUunP]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of our study was to determine whether the urodynamic diagnosis is useful in the management of women with symptoms of an overactive bladder (OAB).

Methods

Women with lower urinary tract symptoms, attending a tertiary referral urogynaecology clinic were studied. All women were fully evaluated, with history, urinary symptoms questionnaire, frequency-volume chart, vaginal examination, and videocystourethrography. Women with symptoms consistent with an overactive bladder (urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge incontinence) were selected. Women with neurological disorders were excluded. Finally, urinary symptoms and urodynamic diagnosis were correlated. All terms and definitions are in accordance with the International Continence Society [Abrams et al., 1988, Scand J Urol Nephrol 114(Suppl):5–19.].

Results

A total of 4,500 women 22–73 years of age were studied. Only 843 women (18.7%) could be classified as having an OAB. Of these, 457 women (54.2%) had urodynamically proven detrusor instability, whereas 386 women (45.8%) had a stable urodynamic trace. Sixty-eight (8.1%) of the women studied had postvoid residual greater than 100 mL. Of the 4,500 women studied, 1,641 (36.5%) had detrusor instability on laboratory urodynamics. Only 27.5% of these women (457 of 1,641) had OAB symptoms.

Conclusions

Symptomatic diagnosis of OAB does not correlate with a urodynamic diagnosis of detrusor instability. The diagnosis of overactive bladder based on urinary symptoms underdiagnoses the condition of detrusor instability in a population of women suffering from lower urinary tract symptoms. Therefore, symptomatic diagnosis of OAB alone is not recommended. Our study suggested that urodynamic evaluation is mandatory in the management of the women with symptoms of an overactive bladder.

### Diagnosis and management of overactive bladder… [^115yd419]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder has a multifactorial etiology in most persons. The author states that a targeted diagnostic evaluation of patients with symptoms of overactive bladder is required. All older men should be questioned about symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy. Patient diaries may provide helpful details regarding frequency of urination, voiding volumes, pattern of voiding, and lifestyle factors that may contribute to symptoms. All patients should have focused genitourinary, pelvic, and rectal examinations, and a clean-catch urine specimen should be checked for hematuria and infection. Sterile in-and-out catheterization can be used to check for the presence of post-void residual urine, and this procedure should be considered in patients at risk for urinary retention. Alternatively, ultrasonography provides a noninvasive way to measure post-void bladder volumes.

Cystoscopy should be targeted to patients with unexplained hematuria, recurrent urinary tract infections, or risk factors for bladder cancer. Urodynamic testing is relatively more complex and invasive, and the author notes that its role in the diagnostic work-up of overactive bladder is controversial. He suggests targeting this procedure to patients who have failed initial therapy or those with nonspecific symptoms and an unclear etiology of overactive bladder. The multifactorial causes of bladder dysfunction typically necessitate a multimodal approach to treatment that includes behavioral and pharmacologic interventions. All patients should be educated to limit caffeine intake, avoid constipation, and plan fluid intake to minimize social disruptions and sleep disturbance. Pelvic-muscle floor exercises and "bladder training" are more likely to be effective in cognitively intact, motivated patients whose primary problem is incontinence.

Older men with prostatic hypertrophy may benefit from alpha-blocker medications and should be watched for urinary retention if anticholinergic drugs are employed. Nocturia related to volume overload may be improved by one dose of a diuretic taken in the late afternoon or by nighttime use of desmopressin in children. The review discusses a number of investigational medications, which may have promise for treatment of overactive bladder.

### AUA releases guideline on diagnosis and treatment of overactive… [^112dN5nN]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Diagnosis Physicians should document signs and symptoms of overactive bladder and exclude other disorders. A patient history should be taken and physical examination and urinalysis should be performed. Additional procedures may be necessary in some patients to confirm the diagnosis, exclude other disorders, and formulate a treatment plan. A urine culture or postvoid residual urine assessment may also be performed, and information can be obtained from bladder diaries or symptom questionnaires. Urodynamics, cystoscopy, and diagnostic renal and bladder ultrasonography typically should not be used in the initial workup. Treatment Overactive bladder is a complex of symptoms that generally do not affect survival, but may compromise quality of life. For this reason, physicians should carefully weigh the potential benefit of a particular treatment against the risk, severity, and reversibility of adverse effects.

The physician and patient may decide to defer treatment if the assessment excludes conditions that would require treatment and counseling. Information should be provided to patients about overactive bladder and normal lower urinary tract function, and about the benefits and risks of available treatments. Patients should also be informed that several treatments may need to be tried before symptoms are successfully controlled. FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS Behavioral therapies should be offered as first-line therapy to all patients with overactive bladder. Antimuscarinic agents may be used in combination with behavioral strategies. Limited evidence suggests that initiating behavioral and pharmacologic therapy simultaneously may improve outcomes, including frequency, voided volume, incontinence, and symptom distress.

Intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxin A may be offered as third-line treatment in select patients who have symptoms that are refractory to first- and second-line treatments. The patient must be willing to return for frequent postvoid residual urine assessments, and must be able and willing to perform self-catheterization if necessary. OTHER TREATMENTS Indwelling catheters are not recommended as a management strategy for overactive bladder except as a last resort in select patients. In rare cases, augmentation cystoplasty or urinary diversion may be considered in patients with severe, refractory, complicated overactive bladder.

### Bladder and other urothelial cancers screening (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^113JFvcN]. NCI (2025). Medium credibility.

Bladder and Other Urothelial Cancers Screening –Health Professional Version. Screening Methods Cystoscopy and Cytology The use of cystoscopies and bladder wash/urinary cytologic examinations has proven quite successful in the surveillance and management of patients with previously treated bladder cancers. These means are not practical in individuals without a history of bladder cancer because of expense and morbidity. 4] Because of the retrospective nature of each study, neither was designed to specifically look for bladder cancer detection or to focus on the population at highest risk. Both studies concluded that single hematuria testing was not effective in diagnosing bladder cancer. A longer follow-up of the HMO study indicated that individuals with microhematuria were at a higher risk of subsequent development of muscle-invading bladder cancer, with a latency of 3. 5 to
14. 5 years. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that single hematuria testing is effective in screening for bladder cancer, and there is no evidence that single hematuria testing results in reduced mortality from the disease. Repetitive Hematuria Testing Two studies using Ames Hemastix, a chemical reagent strip for hemoglobin that correlates with microscopic urinalysis in detecting hematuria, were conducted in geographically defined populations of middle-aged and older men using repetitive home reagent strip testing. In each program, patients were solicited from patient care registries. 6] In the Wisconsin hematuria screening studies, all patients who were hematuria positive with negative workups or who were found to have no serious disease were followed for at least 24 months, with no findings of developing bladder cancer.

Similarly, at least 18 months after their last testing, no screening participant had died of bladder cancer. The same proportion of participants without hematuria during screening were diagnosed with bladder cancer, none within 1 year after their last testing date. It is possible that longer follow-up is necessary to prove that these participants did not have bladder cancer; however, such studies are not available. The relatively low positive predictive value of repetitive hematuria testing raises questions about the practicality of this mode of screening.
