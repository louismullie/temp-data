## Question

What is the significance of this finding?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the significance of a radiographic finding and how that should inform management decisions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the intrinsic radiographic characteristics and what they actually represent. Next, I will assess the evidence base linking that finding to patient-important outcomes. After that, I need to consider the magnitude and direction of effect, including statistical versus clinical significance. Then, I should weigh potential benefits and harms of acting on the finding. Finally, I will integrate these into a clear recommendation and communication plan, while double-checking for common pitfalls like overdiagnosis and incidental findings.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability, because the same radiographic abnormality can be pivotal in one patient and noise in another. I need to check the indication for imaging, the patient's symptoms, risk factors, and prior imaging, since pretest probability drives the post-test likelihood and downstream decisions. For example, in suspected pneumonia, chest radiography rarely changes management in low-risk adults with acute cough, whereas in high-risk presentations it can be decisive, so I should align imaging use with risk-stratified algorithms rather than reflex ordering [^111B1b12]. Hold on, I should verify that this principle also applies to incidental findings; indeed, lung cancer screening programs show substantial variability in how radiologists and clinicians judge what is "clinically significant", underscoring the need to anchor interpretation to the patient's baseline risk and goals [^116NZr15].

> Next, I should review the intrinsic radiographic characteristics and what they actually represent. I need to ensure I am not overcalling artifacts or normal variants, and I should classify the finding by type, size, location, chronicity, and pattern. For instance, an abnormal opacity overlying the vertebral column on lateral chest radiography modestly increases the probability of lower lobe pathology, but I should confirm with CT when suspicion persists, rather than assuming disease from a single projection [^117RASHx]. Wait, let me verify the role of modality-specific limitations; plain radiographs can miss early or subtle disease, so I should escalate to CT or MRI when the stakes are high or the radiograph is non-diagnostic, as in suspected occult hip fracture where MRI outperforms CT in stable patients with non-diagnostic radiographs [^111R8aeq].

> I will now examine the evidence base linking the radiographic finding to patient-important outcomes. I should confirm whether the finding predicts mortality, hospitalization, function, or quality of life, not just radiographic surrogates. In rheumatoid arthritis, radiographic progression correlates with historic disease activity and long-term functional decline, so suppressing progression early has meaningful implications even if the immediate clinical impact is modest, which supports using radiographic endpoints in trials and longitudinal care decisions [^1175bb2E] [^114wzVZQ]. But wait, what if the evidence is weak or heterogeneous; for example, MRI findings in early RA have variable prognostic performance across studies, so I should be cautious about overinterpreting a single MRI signal as destiny for progression without corroborating clinical data [^111HsBD2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about statistical significance equaling clinical importance. I need to check effect sizes, confidence intervals, and whether the magnitude of association is large enough to change decisions. A statistically significant association between dorsal tilt after distal radius fracture and disability emerges beyond about 5 degrees, but the relationship is nonlinear and not clinically important at very small degrees of malalignment, reminding me to interpret thresholds rather than binary "significant vs not significant" labels [^113qwwm9]. I should double-check that I am not overweighing very small effects in large studies; studies with excessive power can detect trivial differences that are not clinically meaningful, so I must scrutinize effect size and context alongside P values [^115wMLxe].

> Now I need to weigh potential benefits and harms of acting on the radiographic finding. I should confirm whether acting reduces morbidity or mortality, and whether inaction risks harm, while also considering false positives, overtreatment, radiation, cost, and patient anxiety. Routine postoperative radiographs after spine fusion rarely change management in asymptomatic patients, so the balance favors selective imaging tied to symptoms rather than blanket schedules, to minimize radiation and resource use without sacrificing safety [^114afmZr]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that more imaging is always better after surgery; but the data show most abnormalities on routine postoperative films are incidental and do not alter care, so I should correct that assumption and individualize imaging to clinical triggers [^114FuWYm].

> Next, I should integrate these elements into a clear, clinically actionable recommendation. I need to ensure the recommendation specifies whether the finding mandates immediate action, surveillance, or no further workup, and I should tie it to guideline-concordant thresholds where available. For example, in suspected blunt aortic injury, no combination of chest radiographic signs is sufficiently sensitive or specific, so abnormal or suspicious findings should prompt definitive cross-sectional imaging rather than reliance on radiographs alone, which prevents both missed injuries and unnecessary delays [^113kFomb]. Let me reconsider whether I am overgeneralizing; yes, some radiographic signs shift probability, but in high-stakes scenarios like possible aortic injury, the negative and positive predictive values of radiography are inadequate for decision-making, reinforcing the need for advanced imaging when suspicion exists [^113kFomb].

> I should also communicate uncertainty transparently and align with patient preferences. I need to check that my report distinguishes definitive diagnoses from probabilistic statements and incidental findings, and I should provide clear next steps. Reports that include clinical context, explicit significance statements, and recommendations improve downstream decisions and reduce unnecessary testing, which is especially important as patients increasingly access their own reports. Hold on, I should verify that I am not propagating ambiguity; standardized lexicons like Lung-RADS reduce variability in managing incidental pulmonary nodules, but even then, clinician judgment and patient values still modulate what is deemed "significant", so shared decision-making remains essential [^116NZr15].

> But wait, what if the finding is an incidental discovery unrelated to the clinical question. I need to ensure I contextualize incidental findings by prevalence, potential harms, and evidence for benefit from follow-up. Extraspinal incidental findings on lumbar MRI are common, yet only about 5% are clinically significant and require action, so reflexive workups can do more harm than good without a structured approach. Similarly, extracardiac incidental findings on CT attenuation correction are frequent and drive resource use, but their prognostic value is uncertain, so I should avoid cascade testing unless there is a credible pathway to improved outcomes [^114QFvNX].

> Finally, I should double-check for common pitfalls that distort interpretation. Overdiagnosis of low back pain on imaging is common because many "abnormalities" occur in asymptomatic people, so I must correlate with the clinical picture to avoid misattribution and iatrogenic harm [^116Jihtn]. Interobserver variability in chest radiograph interpretation is substantial, and even experienced radiologists miss actionable findings, which means second reads, decision support, or AI triage can reduce misses but must be integrated thoughtfully into workflow rather than used as a blanket substitute for expert review [^112JVcXD]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not dismissing radiographic progression in inflammatory arthritis; while subtle changes may not immediately alter symptoms, they can forecast long-term disability, so I should treat radiographic progression as a meaningful surrogate in the right clinical context rather than ignore it [^114wzVZQ].

> In summary, I need to ensure that declaring a radiographic finding "significant" means it changes diagnosis, prognosis, or management in a way that matters to the patient, supported by evidence and aligned with guidelines. That requires anchoring on pretest probability, verifying what the image truly shows, appraising outcome-linked evidence, quantifying effect size, balancing benefits and harms, and communicating clearly with the care team and patient, while staying vigilant for overdiagnosis and incidental findings that can mislead practice [^1153k2er].

The clinical significance of a radiographic finding depends on its **correlation with symptoms, risk of progression, and impact on management**. Findings are clinically significant when they explain symptoms, indicate disease severity, or guide treatment decisions; they are less significant when incidental, stable, or unrelated to the clinical question [^115vCAEh]. Radiographic progression in inflammatory arthritis reflects disease activity and predicts disability, supporting early intervention [^1175bb2E] [^114wzVZQ]. In contrast, many postoperative or screening radiographs show abnormalities that rarely change management, so routine imaging without clinical indication is often low yield [^114afmZr] [^111B1b12]. Always interpret findings in **clinical context** to avoid overdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions [^116u8iK7].

## Factors determining clinical significance

Several factors determine the **clinical significance of radiographic findings**:

- **Correlation with clinical symptoms**: Findings that align with patient-reported symptoms or physical examination findings are more likely to be clinically significant [^117BdY6E].

- **Disease severity and progression**: Radiographic evidence of disease progression, such as joint erosion in rheumatoid arthritis, indicates clinically significant disease activity and predicts future disability [^1175bb2E] [^114wzVZQ].

- **Impact on management**: Findings that necessitate changes in treatment plans, surgical interventions, or further diagnostic testing are considered clinically significant [^115FURTF].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and overall health status influence the clinical significance of radiographic findings [^notfound].

## Examples of clinically significant radiographic findings

| **Clinical scenario** | **Radiographic finding** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Rheumatoid arthritis | Joint erosion | Indicates disease progression and predicts disability [^1175bb2E] [^112Zg9vi] |
| Osteoarthritis | Joint space narrowing | Reflects disease severity and guides management [^notfound] |
| Pneumonia | Consolidation | Confirms diagnosis and guides antibiotic therapy [^notfound] |
| Fracture | Visible fracture line | Confirms diagnosis and guides immobilization or surgical intervention [^notfound] |
| Lung cancer screening | Pulmonary nodule | May indicate malignancy and necessitate further evaluation [^116wWZM6] |

## Examples of radiographic findings with limited clinical significance

Some radiographic findings have **limited clinical significance**, including:

- **Incidental findings**: Small, stable lesions or anatomical variants that do not correlate with symptoms or affect management [^111vnDqD].

- **Postoperative changes**: Expected postoperative radiographic changes that do not indicate complications or require intervention [^114FuWYm].

- **Degenerative changes**: Mild degenerative changes in older adults that are common and often asymptomatic [^116Jihtn].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Clinical guidelines emphasize **context-specific interpretation** of radiographic findings. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, radiographic progression is a key outcome measure reflecting disease activity and guiding therapy [^1175bb2E]. Conversely, routine postoperative radiographs are often discouraged unless clinically indicated, as they rarely alter management [^114afmZr] [^112hLwxA].

---

## Conclusion

The clinical significance of radiographic findings **varies with their correlation to symptoms, disease severity, and impact on management** [^115YCUPq]. Clinically significant findings guide treatment and prognostication, whereas incidental or stable findings may have limited impact. Accurate interpretation requires integration of clinical context, patient factors, and evidence-based guidelines to optimize patient care and avoid unnecessary interventions [^116u8iK7].

Radiographically identified extranodal extension (rENE) was predictive of decreased progression-free survival (d, P = 0.001).

Owing to the potentially confounding influence of the cT category, the relationship of the number of radiologic positive nodes to outcomes was reassessed after exclusion of cT3 and cT4 patients. More than 2 radiographically positive lymph nodes still demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in PFS (P = 0.02). These findings were consistent with the results of the Cox hazards analysis, which also showed decreased PFS with > 2 radiographically involved lymph nodes (HR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.32–6.48). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, > 2 radiographically positive lymph nodes was identified as a significant threshold for PFS (P = 0.006) as well as OS (P = 0.03) (Fig. 3). Furthermore, > 2 radiographically positive lymph nodes was also predictive of both decreased and loco-regional tumor control (P = 0.02) and distant metastasis-free survival (P = 0.01). A univariate Cox hazards analysis for clinical and pathologic categorizations is presented in Table 2.

These findings suggest that the number of radiographic nodes (and not rENE or maximum nodal size) could be used to further categorize cN1 patients. This proposed reclassification of cN1 patients using the number of radiographically positive lymph nodes (1–2 = cN1a, 3–4 = cN1b, and > 4 = cN1c) is portrayed in Figure 4.

Prostate cancer — plain radiography role and limitations: Plain radiography can be used to evaluate symptomatic regions in the skeleton; however, plain films will not detect a bone lesion until nearly 50% of the mineral content of the bone is lost or gained, and CT or MRI may be more useful to assess fracture risk because cortical involvement assessment may be obscured on plain films when osteoblastic lesions are present.

### Relationship of multi-biomarker disease activity score and other risk factors with radiographic progression in an observational study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^111ovXsQ]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Multivariate analysis extended our findings by demonstrating that the MBDA score remained significantly associated with subsequent joint damage after adjusting for several established risk factors for joint damage. The interaction between the MBDA score and other risk factors was further explored by cross-classification analyses. For conventional measures of disease activity (SJC28, CRP or DAS28–CRP), the most striking finding was that a high MBDA score was significantly associated with more frequent progression, even when the clinical measures or the acute phase reactant, CRP, indicated low disease activity. This finding suggests that such patients may have subclinical synovitis. Conversely, for patients with high DAS28–CRP, risk of progression was low when the MBDA score was low or moderate, suggesting that their signs or symptoms may have a non-inflammatory component. These findings elucidate the clinical implications of discordances between MBDA scores and conventional measures. Discordances with the MBDA score have been previously reported in patients with early RA. Further study of patients with such discordances is needed.

The multivariate analyses also indicated that the MBDA score was associated with joint damage progression independently of two non–disease activity risk factors — serologic status and the amount of pre-existing joint damage. Cross-classification analysis demonstrated that the MBDA score significantly discriminated risk for progression among seropositive patients, with a similar trend observed for seronegative patients; this was also observed in patients with intermediate levels of prior joint damage (SHS > 18–53), with similar trends observed for patients with lower or higher levels of prior joint damage. The results of our cross-classification analyses are consistent with studies that evaluated matrixed combinations of conventional risk factors for patients with new onset RA and established RA, and with an analysis of MBDA scores in patients with early RA.

Our findings imply that the MBDA score may be a useful addition to conventional clinical, serologic and radiographic measures to identify patients who are or are not at risk of radiographic progression during non-biologic DMARD therapy. Second, they support the prior, clinically based validation of the MBDA score by providing radiographic data indicating that the MBDA score is reflective of pathological inflammation in RA.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis — ancillary diagnostic considerations notes that response to treatment and antigen avoidance may narrow the differential diagnosis and support a provisional diagnosis, mainly in patients with nonfibrotic HP, and that BAL fluid lymphocytosis may increase diagnostic confidence if the clinical context, exposure history, and HRCT findings are suggestive, but is not definitive; the recommendations are preliminary as they are based on very-low quality evidence and may change as new evidence becomes available.

Disease outcome

Classical definitions of disease prognosis

Disease outcome has been assessed in different ways, using different definitions reflecting disease activity, structural damage, function, quality of life, pain, occurrence of extra-articular manifestations, etc. In addition, it has been evaluated either at a single point of time, such as the achievement of remission, or by considering changes in parameters over a period of time, as is the case for structural damage. This heterogeneity in the definition of prognosis has led to the identification of a large number of factors likely to influence disease outcome, a large proportion of which (genetic, bone, inflammatory biomarkers, etc) cannot be used in routine clinical practice.

So what is the best definition of prognosis? In pivotal and observational studies, poor prognosis is defined as the absence of remission or radiographic progression. Is the latter really the most appropriate? This parameter has the advantage of incorporating all events occurring during the course of the disease. But it has many limitations. What value can be placed on the radiographic progression of existing lesions or on the progression of lesions in joints with little functional impact? This is certainly of interest in the early stages of the disease, especially if we use the definition of rapid radiographic progression (RRP), characterised by a variation in total Sharp score of ≥ 5 points over 1 year after initiation of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

### Diagnostic accuracy in axial spondyloarthritis: a systematic evaluation of the role of clinical information in the interpretation of sacroiliac joint imaging [^112EJcdm]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this study show that the structured CI provided to radiologists evaluating SIJ images has an overall positive influence on the related interpretation of images. When comparing the radiologists' findings without and with CI we found clinically relevant differences in their interpretation of images — especially for radiographs.

The precision of the evaluation of SIJ radiographs in relation to the clinical diagnosis of axSpA was 70.3% without and 78.2% with CI — a statistically and clinically significant difference. For the radiographs+MRI combination, the precision was 80.8% without CI and 81.8% with CI — only a minor, non-significant difference. This is most likely related to the higher level of uncertainty of interpretation of SIJ radiographs as compared with MRI (or a combination of radiographs+MRI). The evaluation of radiographs and MRI combined provided more accurate results as compared with radiographs alone even without CI. This is explained, at least in part, by the fact that only about 64% of axSpA patients were classified as radiographic axSpA (patients with definite radiographic SIJ changes based on mNY criteria) and could, therefore, be captured by radiographs. On the other hand, radiologists may just be more certain with their findings when evaluating MRI (+radiographs) of the SIJ allowing for a more sensitive evaluation of structural lesions in parallel to the visualisation of active inflammatory changes, which are simultaneously present in the majority of axSpA patients.

### Proximity of a lower third molar to the inferior alveolar canal as a predictor of delayed recovery [^112zxKUP]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that removal of lower third molars below the occlusal plane and in close proximity to the inferior alveolar canal (IAC) delays recovery after surgery as compared with lower third molars below the occlusal plane yet not close to the IAC.

Patients and Methods

Recovery data were available for 579 patients enrolled in an institutional review board-approved clinical trial. After surgery a questionnaire designed to assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) recovery was given to the patient to be completed each day for 14 days. At each postsurgery visit, clinical data were collected detailing healing and treatment. Based on radiographic findings, patients with at least 1 mandibular third molar below the occlusal plane were identified. Outcomes for patients with at least 1 radiographic sign indicating proximity of a lower third molar to the IAC were compared with those with none. Clinical and HRQOL outcomes were compared with Cochran-Mantel-Haensel statistics (P < .05).

Results

No significant differences were found between groups for delayed clinical recovery. If radiographic signs for a patient at presurgery evaluation indicated close proximity of a lower third molar to the IAC, odds were significantly increased for delayed HRQOL recovery for worst pain, lifestyle, and oral function.

Conclusion

Our findings support the hypothesis that a presurgery finding of a lower third molar below the occlusal plane and in close proximity to the IAC is associated with patients' prolonged HRQOL recovery, but not a significant delay in clinical recovery.

### Adult outpatients with acute cough due to suspected pneumonia or influenza: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^111B1b12]. Chest (2019). High credibility.

Chest radiography for acute cough in adults — A Cochrane review of chest radiographs for acute lower respiratory tract infections included two RCTs with a combined 2,024 patients (1,502 adults, 522 children), and the conclusion was that chest radiography did not improve clinical outcomes (duration of illness); for adults with acute cough illness, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routinely obtaining a chest radiograph in addition to clinical judgment to make management decisions, and because the overall proportion with significant radiographic findings is very small, the benefit, if any, is likely very small. Clinical algorithms to identify the subset of patients with a higher risk of underlying pneumonia are needed to help guide the decision to order chest radiographs in this population.

### A clinicoradiologic study of the shoulder in apert syndrome [^1112Sywm]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

To provide a comprehensive radiographic, clinical, and functional description of the shoulder in Apert syndrome.

Methods

A cohort of 9 Apert syndrome patients (ages, 9–27 years) followed at a tertiary care facility was included in this prospective study. Patients were clinically assessed with physical examination and completion of 2 validated functional assessment tools, the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (AAOS PODCI). Radiographs were obtained of both shoulders, and standardized-protocol magnetic resonance imaging was performed on the dominant shoulder of all participants.

Results

All patients had some degree of functional impairment attributable to their shoulder pathologic abnormality. Physical examination consistently revealed reduced forward flexion and abduction. Radiographic findings were similar to previous reports, with pervasive osseous dysplasia of the shoulder joint. Medial humeral head hypoplasia was seen in 8 of 9 patients and greater tuberosity overgrowth in 7 of 9 patients. Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder, not previously performed in a cohort of Apert patients, allowed better delineation of abnormalities seen radiographically such as a central glenoid cleft seen in 8 of 9 patients. It also revealed a new finding of inferior glenoid inclination (7/9 patients) that has not been described in the literature. Very few soft tissue or degenerative abnormalities were demonstrated.

Conclusions

The findings of this study confirm that patients with Apert syndrome are functionally impaired by their shoulder pathologic abnormality, which may have a similar clinical impact as the more well-described hand and foot anomalies. The global functioning of patients with Apert syndrome is equivalent to patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The shoulder range of motion in Apert patients is decreased, most significantly in flexion and abduction. Radiographs confirmed previous imaging findings of glenohumeral dysplasia. The novel magnetic resonance imaging component demonstrated consistent inferior glenoid inclination, which may be a significant factor in their shoulder impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed no significant soft tissue or degenerative abnormalities to account for their clinical disability. These findings have potential relevance in the surgical and clinical management of these patients.

### Imaging aspects of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis [^113bPSGS]. European Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disorder of unknown aetiology with a wide spectrum of radiological appearances and almost invariably pulmonary involvement. Lung involvement accounts for most of the morbidity and much of the mortality associated with sarcoidosis. Imaging contributes significantly to the diagnosis and management of patients with sarcoidosis. In typical cases, chest radiography may be sufficient to establish the diagnosis with little margin of error and CT is not necessary. However, CT can play a critical role in several clinical settings: atypical clinical and/or radiographic findings; normal or near-normal chest radiograph but clinical suspicion of sarcoidosis; and detection of complications. Moreover, in many patients, CT findings are atypical and unfamiliar to most radiologists (e.g. sarcoidosis mimicking other lung diseases and vice versa), and in these cases histological confirmation of the diagnosis is recommended. CT is also useful in assessing disease extent and may help to discriminate between reversible and irreversible lung disease, thus providing critical prognostic information. This review concentrates on the more difficult imaging aspects of sarcoidosis, in particular differential diagnosis and disease complications.

Key Points

- Sarcoidosis is characterized by a wide spectrum of radiological appearances.
- In typical cases, imaging substantially contributes to the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
- CT plays a critical role in atypical and complicated cases.
- CT may discriminate between reversible and irreversible lung disease.

### Interpreting radiographic data in rheumatoid arthritis [^114RQv92]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Plain film radiography is the preferred method for evaluating disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis and for establishing the efficacy of new disease modifying antirheumatic agents. However, the relative efficacy of these agents cannot be determined by comparing radiographic data from different studies, and a standardised system is needed.

### The role of computer-assisted radiographer reporting in lung cancer screening programmes [^116wWZM6]. European Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Ritchie et al report excellent accuracy (sensitivity and specificity both > 90%) in a specifically trained technician's ability to identify non-calcified nodules measuring > 1 mm in diameter using CADe support but did not evaluate their ability to distinguish the clinical significance of such nodules, avoiding some of the uncertainty faced by our radiographers and lessening the impact of inter-observer measurement variation on radiographer accuracy. The radiographer sensitivities reported by Nair et al are closer to those observed in this study at 61.4–79.4%, though this was without the use of CADe. However, whilst our findings preclude CADe-assisted radiographers as a single reader of LDCT, the relatively high detection rate for suspicious cancers (83.3–100%) and low false-positive rates reported here suggest that CADe-assisted, radiographer-led triage of LDCT for radiologist review would be a feasible strategy. Future research could examine whether such a strategy would save time compared to CADe-assisted radiologist reading, but in this study both radiographers achieved significantly faster read times than radiologists reading without CADe (Supplementary materials figure e1). Alternatively, radiographers may have a role in reporting follow-up studies, which in clinically indicated nodule surveillance scans has improved clinical service delivery with significant cost- and time-saving benefits. However, this would require further research to evaluate radiographer accuracy in the comparison of current and prior imaging and interpretation of longitudinal nodule measurements, and particularly in the detection of new nodules, given the increased risk of lung cancer in such findings. Radiographers had acceptable agreement for evaluation of emphysema and CAC; however, reporting of these findings is a contentious issue in LCS. Although higher CAC on LDCT is associated with cardiovascular or all-cause mortality, the impact of acting on these findings on patient outcomes has not been conclusively demonstrated. Refining the management of such findings with appropriate training could improve radiographer performance with this regard as well as improve the efficiency of screening and downstream impact on other health care resources.

### Generative artificial intelligence for chest radiograph interpretation in the emergency department [^112JVcXD]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

In the present study, interrater reliability was moderate between pairs of ratings for all 3 report types, suggesting that there is genuine clinical uncertainty in many radiographic findings. Studies have shown relatively low interreader reliability on chest radiography interpretation across many different pathologies, although double reading of chest radiographs increases sensitivity for pathology. For context, abnormal radiographs are frequently misdiagnosed by trainees, with accuracy as low as 9% for conditions such as pneumothorax. Among radiologists, studies have demonstrated a discrepancy rate of 4% in representative samples of chest radiographs, rising to as high as 30% when abnormal radiographs are exclusively considered. The low rates of clinically significant discrepancy in AI reports in studies containing actionable findings — nearly one-third of the test data set — compares favorably to these benchmarks, highlighting the relevance of AI reports to ED physicians.

Notably, there were several cases in which the AI report improved on the radiologist report. For instance, in 1 case, both raters commented that the radiologist report missed a new infiltrate that was correctly described in the AI report. In another, the radiologist report described opacities as "persistent" compared with the prior image, whereas the AI and teleradiology reports noted that this had worsened, in agreement with raters (eTable in Supplement 1). As ED physicians must maintain high sensitivity for clinically significant findings when reviewing imaging, use of this AI tool could call to attention potentially overlooked abnormalities, serving in a preliminary capacity similar to teleradiologist interpretations in ED workflows.

As AI reports can be generated within seconds of radiograph acquisition, real-time review could notify physicians of potential abnormalities, aiding in triage and flagging critical findings requiring early intervention. The results of the current study suggest that the AI model was similarly proficient in identifying these clinical abnormalities as a radiologist. Notably, the AI report correctly identified all 4 pneumothoraces in the test data set. Several automated tools in clinical use screen radiology reports for relevant findings and trigger appropriate clinical workflows in response, the timeliness of which could be increased with integration of our model. With a specificity of 98.5% for abnormal findings, studies could be prioritized with high confidence.

### Spine injury [^116b8xx4]. ACS (2022). High credibility.

Obtunded and unevaluable patients — radiographic clearance strategy: The 2013 guidelines highlighted the inadequacy of dynamic imaging (flexion-extension films), and its use was not recommended for initial clearance. In CT-negative obtunded patients, an 11 study meta-analysis (1550 total patients) determined that the diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was clinically significant, altering management in 6 percent of patients, and another meta-analysis determined that MRI identified 20.9 percent of injuries not diagnosed on initial radiograph or CT imaging and recommended that MRI become the gold standard; however, these studies were criticized for serious design flaws. The 2013 guidelines recommended the possible use of MRI after a normal CT for patients who are obtunded/unevaluable.

### Multimodality imaging of diseases of the thoracic aorta in adults: from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging: endorsed by the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^113kFomb]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Chest radiography (CXR) in suspected blunt aortic injury is often an initial study but no single or combination of radiographic signs demonstrates sufficient sensitivity or specificity to reliably detect or exclude traumatic aortic rupture; therefore, further imaging should be performed whenever an abnormality is suspected on clinical presentation or on CXR or when the mechanism of injury is compatible with aortic injury, with significant CXR findings including widened mediastinum, an obscured aortic knob, rightward deviation of the trachea or nasogastric tube, and opacification of the aortopulmonary window.

### Prevalence of incidental extraspinal findings on MR imaging of the lumbar spine in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115vCAEh]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Low back pain is common worldwide. MR imaging may identify extraspinal findings that are not related to the proposed clinical question. The prevalence of extraspinal incidental findings and their clinical significance has not been well-established.

Purpose

This review aimed to evaluate the prevalence of extraspinal findings on MR imaging of the lumbar spine in adults and the prevalence of clinically significant incidental findings.

Data Sources

A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed, including studies published before June 14, 2023.

Study Selection

Studies presenting a prevalence of extraspinal findings in patients 16 years of age or older were included.

Data Analysis

A random effects meta-analysis was used to generate composite prevalence measures of extraspinal findings, patients with extraspinal findings, and clinically significant findings.

Data Synthesis

Sixteen studies were included in this meta-analysis, with a total of 19,593 patients and 6,006 extraspinal incidental findings. The overall prevalence of extraspinal findings was 19.9% (95% CI, 11.1%-30.7%). Overall, 26.7% of patients had an extraspinal finding identified (95% CI, 14.8%-40.6%). The most common subgroup of extraspinal findings was genitourinary findings in males (27.1%; 95% CI, 25.6%-28.8%). Data from 8 studies demonstrated the prevalence of clinically significant findings at 5.4% (95% CI, 3.2%-8.1%).

Limitations

Retrospective populations with small numbers of participants in clinically relevant subgroups may result in heterogeneity and imprecision within composite outcome measures.

Conclusions

Extraspinal findings are common, detected in more than one-quarter of patients. Five percent of findings are clinically significant and may require further action.

### Imaging in rheumatology: reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^115GbdTR]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Disease activity and response to treatment are usually assessed by clinical criteria and blood tests. For straightforward cases of rheumatoid arthritis, the rheumatologist might therefore not need much or any imaging input.

Imaging is, however, required for all cases that are not straightforward. Patients presenting with fairly non-specific aches, not fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory disease, might be early presentations of these disorders, and imaging can help in the differential diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic disorders. As early diagnosis results in far better long-term outcomes, a wait and see approach is no longer acceptable.

The questions asked of the radiologist in these cases are typically some or all of these.

Is there inflammation? Which joint or organ is affected? What is the anatomical pattern of involvement?

### New definition of light chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance… [^1124cBxQ]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The relative decrease in the prevalence of LC-MGUS using the new definition compared with the combination of the standard and revised kidney criteria was 82%, with a 95% relative decrease in κ LC-MGUS and a 71% relative increase in λ LC-MGUS. Based on prospective screening of more than 75 000 individuals, we propose a revision of the reference intervals for serum κ FLC, λ FLC and FLC ratio, stratified by age, along with a new definition of LC-MGUS to significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy of this disorder. In the iStopMM cohort, applying our new definition decreased the prevalence of LC-MGUS by 82% in individuals 40 years and older, without any of the previously misdiagnosed cases progressing to a lymphoproliferative disorder during a follow-up period of 4648 patient-years. In turn, the new definition of LC-MGUS may alleviate the burden of anxiety and unnecessary testing in individuals previously receiving what we can now recognize as false-positive diagnoses.

30, 31 These improvements could significantly decrease unnecessary costs from extensive work-ups and lifelong monitoring, directing limited health care resources to relevant cases. It is noteworthy that after 4648 patient-years of follow-up, no individual had been diagnosed with a lymphoproliferative disorder among those who were considered to have had a false-positive diagnosis of LC-MGUS based on the standard definition. Furthermore, none of the individuals who underwent bone marrow biopsy exhibited abnormal results. This indicates that we are unlikely to miss clinically important lymphoproliferative disorders despite the substantial reduction in overall LC-MGUS cases. Implementation will minimize the rate of false-positive results, thereby avoiding unnecessary testing and diagnostic procedures. In addition, the revised reference intervals will alter and likely optimize both risk stratification models and treatment response criteria.

However, it is of utmost importance that the new reference intervals be studied in this setting before being implemented in clinical practice. A major strength of this study is its extensive high-quality data generated by screening most of the Icelandic population older than 40 years with SPEP, IFE, and FLC. This along with readily available information on kidney function allowed for careful assessment and determination of reference intervals, eliminating the risk of selection bias. Another strength is that all screening measurements were conducted in the same laboratory using consistent methods and lot-to-lot comparisons, thereby minimizing the impact of variability between different assays.

### How to write an interpretation [^112a7EJr]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Every day we interpret examination findings and clinical tests with the aim of coming to a diagnosis. But how well do we interpret these tests? Whether it is a traditional examination technique used by doctors for centuries or a new cutting edge biomarker, the diagnostic landscape shifts over time. The aim of interpretations is to produce a library of evidence-based resources directing the use of clinical tests including examination techniques. In this article we discuss how best to tackle writing an interpretation. Interpretations are succinct evidence-based summaries that draw together research findings to provide practical answers for clinicians.

### The effect of skin-to-skin contact (kangaroo care) shortly after birth on the neurobehavioral responses of the term newborn: a randomized, controlled trial… [^111xGdg4]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

The method of skin-to-skin contact has shown physiologic, cognitive, and emotional gains for preterm infants; however, KC has not been studied adequately in term newborns. Aims. To evaluate the effect of KC, used shortly after delivery, on the neurobehavioral responses of the healthy newborn. Study Design. A randomized, controlled trial using a table of random numbers. After consent, the mothers were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: KC shortly after delivery or a no-treatment standard care. Subjects. Included were 47 healthy mother-infant pairs. KC began at 15 to 20 minutes after delivery and lasted for 1 hour. Control infants and KC infants were brought to the nursery 15 to 20 and 75 to 80 minutes after birth, respectively. Results.

During a 1-hour-long observation, starting at 4 hours postnatally, the KC infants slept longer, were mostly in a quiet sleep state, exhibited more flexor movements and postures, and showed less extensor movements. Conclusions. KC seems to influence state organization and motor system modulation of the newborn infant shortly after delivery. The significance of our findings for supportive transition from the womb to the extrauterine environment is discussed. Medical and nursing staff may be well advised to provide this kind of care shortly after birth. Comments.

### Ambiguous findings on radiographs [^111pCLq5]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Findings with uncertain clinical significance are frequently encountered on radiographs. A structure or opacity visible on radiographs could be due to several causes ranging from artifact or external structure to malignancy or a life-threatening process. The approach that a radiologist chooses to address ambiguous findings can have a significant impact on a patient's health. In this article we discuss the causes and impact of ambiguous findings on radiographs. We also discuss the various strategies radiologists can adopt to maximize clinical value and, when needed, reach a definite diagnosis.

### Association between radiographic and clinical outcomes following distal radial fractures: a prospective cohort study with 1-year follow-up in 366 patients [^113qwwm9]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between dorsal tilt and clinical outcome. Although clinical outcome after a distal radial fracture was significantly associated with increased dorsal tilt starting at 5°, the association was not clinically important at values of < 20°. From anatomic alignment to approximately 5° of dorsal tilt, the malalignment did not seem to be associated with any measured outcome parameter.

We cannot draw any conclusions regarding whether patients with greater malalignment would benefit from surgical treatment, as any benefit of intervention must substantially outweigh the harm that it potentially causes. Surgical treatment could have varying implications depending on the functional demands and hand dominance of the individual patient.

We found that dorsal malunion was associated with patient-rated disability (as measured with the QuickDASH) 1 year after a distal radial fracture. There is no clear consensus in the literature, with several authors finding that dorsal tilt had a significant effect on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) - and others finding that it did not. Likewise, conflicting conclusions have been drawn regarding the relationship between ulnar variance and PROMs -.

What all previous reports have in common is that they involved a linear or a dichotomized analysis (Table VI). The present study analyzed nonlinear associations. Mulders et al. in a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding radiographic and patient-reported outcomes, found that dorsal tilt (470 patients) and ulnar variance (471 patients), dichotomized into acceptable or not acceptable, were the 2 factors with a significant association with PROMs10. Those findings are consistent with our findings.

TABLE VI
Compilation of Studies Assessing the Relationship Between Dorsal Tilt and Clinical Outcome with PROMs

Brogren et al. reported similar findings, with dorsal tilt being significantly associated with a poorer DASH score (mean difference, 9 points).

Plant et al. in a linear analysis involving 50 patients, found that PROMs and physical measures of function correlated poorly with radiographic parameters. There was no relationship between radiographic parameters and grip strength, range of motion, or DASH scores at 1 year after a distal radial fracture. Wilcke et al. in a study of 78 patients, found no linear relationships but did find significant relationships with DASH scores when the degrees of malunion were dichotomized into acceptable or not acceptable. Finsen et al. found a linear relationship when they excluded all patients with a volar tilt of ≥ 5°.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115acLoE]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — criteria for resection following neoadjuvant therapy emphasize that decisions about resectability status should be made in consensus at multidisciplinary meetings/discussions. For neoadjuvant therapy, consider PET/CT or PET/MRI scan before and after initiation to assess response to systemic therapy and for restaging, and resection may be considered only if there is no evidence of metastatic disease. Mild increases in perivascular soft tissue can be observed, but alone should not represent a contraindication to surgical exploration, and exploration following clear local progression on neoadjuvant therapy should be undertaken only after careful consideration in a multidisciplinary conference given its implications of aggressive tumor biology. Patients who initially presented with resectable or borderline resectable disease should be explored if their CA 19–9 is at least stable or has decreased and radiographic findings do not demonstrate clear progression. For patients with borderline resectable tumors, exploration may be undertaken if there is involvement of, or thrombus in, the SMV/PV as long as there is suitable patent vessel for vascular reconstruction proximal and distal to the site of involvement, and for borderline resectable tumors involving the pancreatic head/uncinate process, mild increases in soft tissue around the SMA/CHA/ variant arterial anatomy (replaced right hepatic artery [RHA] or GDA, or aorta) should not be considered a contraindication to surgical exploration in the setting of other signs of clinical improvement (ie, improvement in PS, pain, early satiety, weight/nutritional status). For patients who presented with locally advanced disease, exploration for resection should be considered if there is a significant decrease in CA 19–9 level and clinical improvement (ie, improvement in PS, pain, early satiety, weight/nutritional status) indicating response to therapy. For locally advanced disease, patients should be counseled that the long-term benefit (ie, chance for cure) is unknown, and locally advanced disease cases should always be handled in highly specialized centers. Note that for all clinical stages, radiographic findings may appear stable despite dramatic falls in CA 19–9, and all recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Radiologic assessment of osteoporotic vertebral fractures: diagnostic and prognostic implications [^1164tf7e]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

As populations age osteoporosis becomes an increasingly important public health issue. Among osteoporotic fractures vertebral fractures are of particular relevance: they are the most common fractures, frequently are asymptomatic but have an important influence on prognosis and morbidity in the osteoporotic patient. Previous studies have suggested that these fractures are frequently not diagnosed and that radiologists miss a high percentage of osteoporotic, vertebral fractures present on lateral chest radiographs. The aims of this review are (1) to emphasize the important role that radiologists play in the accurate and clear reporting of vertebral fractures, (2) to provide guidance in assessing these fractures in radiographs, MRI and computed tomography imaging of the vertebral spine and (3) to sensitize the radiologist in diagnosing fractures in chest radiographs.

### The utility of repeated postoperative radiographs after lumbar instrumented fusion for degenerative lumbar spine [^114afmZr]. Spine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Objective

To assess the impact that routine postoperative radiographs have in clinical outcome and clinical decision-making.

Summary Of Background Data

No standard exists that outlines how often and when radiographs should be taken after lumbar fusion. Routine postoperative radiographs can be a source of inconvenience and cost to patients, radiation exposure, and possibly, confounding information.

Methods

The patients who underwent a single or multilevel lumbar instrumented fusion were investigated. At each time-point after surgery, it was noted if they demonstrated new symptoms or clinical deterioration. The Fisher exact test was used to analyze the categorical data.

Results

Sixty-three patients (25 males and 38 females) were identified with a mean age of 52 years (range, 20–87). Plain radiographs were taken at 269 visits including all time-points. In 17 (6.3%) visits, abnormal findings were found in 13 patients, including suspected pseudoarthrosis on radiographs (n = 10) and adjacent segment disease on radiographs (n = 3). They were found during 11 of 50 visits (22%) in the patients with new symptoms or clinical deterioration and during 6 of 219 visits (2.7%) in the asymptomatic patients. The probability of an abnormal finding was significantly lower in the asymptomatic patients (P < 0.001). Before the 6-month follow-up, abnormal findings were found in 1 of 111 visits (0.9%) and in 16 of 158 visits (10%) at the 6-month follow-up or later. The probability of an abnormal finding was significantly lower before the 6-month follow-up (P < 0.001). In six of the seven symptomatic patients (86%) with suspected pseudoarthrosis on radiographs, pseudoarthrosis was initially suspected between 6 and 12 months after surgery.

Conclusion

This study suggests that plain radiographs should be performed as indicated clinically rather than routinely after instrumented lumbar fusion. The vast majority of asymptomatic patients do not require routine postoperative radiographs.

### Low back pain investigations and prognosis: a review [^116pcDrz]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Low back pain is reviewed in terms of when investigations are useful and its clinical course. Despite the extensive evaluation of the accuracy of investigations such as radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and myelography, there is a surprising dearth of research to inform their use in primary care. There is no clear evidence on which to base judgments for selection of appropriate tests to confirm or exclude low back pain pathology. It appears that investigations are rarely necessary for low back pain. Specific investigations should be ordered to identify a particular pathology but should not be ordered routinely for general screening. In the absence of pathology, low back pain and its associated disability improve rapidly in the first weeks after onset, but, in contradiction to all guidelines, both commonly persist and the best evidence suggests that recurrences are common.

### Prognostic value of extracardiac incidental findings on attenuation correction cardiac computed tomography [^114QFvNX]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Attenuation corrected computed tomography (CTAC) is often performed to improve the specificity of single-photon emission tomography imaging. Extracardiac incidental findings are frequently observed. It is unclear whether these findings have any prognostic value.

Methods

Consecutive patients (n = 1139) at a tertiary care center were retrospectively evaluated for incidental findings on CTAC. Clinically significant incidental findings were defined as findings warranting physician follow-up. Information regarding subsequent resource utilization was obtained by chart review. Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for demographic and clinical variables was used to evaluate association of these incidental findings with all-cause and cancer-specific mortality.

Results

A total of 135 (12%) patients with incidental findings were identified, 83 of whom (68%) were newly diagnosed. Lung nodules were the most common finding, present in 92 (68%) patients. Over a median follow-up of 468 days, incidental findings were not significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1.34; 95% CI 0.77–2.33, P = 0.29) but was significantly associated with cancer-specific mortality (HR 3.21; 95% CI 1.26–8.14, P = 0.01). This association remained statistically significant when the analysis was limited to newly diagnosed incidental findings. Among patients with incidental findings, follow-up radiographic studies were conducted in 87%, and invasive procedures performed in 32%. Physician office-based follow-up of these findings occurred in 42% of patients and incidental finding-related hospitalization occurred in 14%.

Conclusions

This study shows that incidental findings are common and were associated with all-cause and cancer-specific mortality but only the later remained statistically significant after multivariable adjustment.

### Bridging gaps in radiology education: insights from clinical-year medical students and the risk of diminishing the radiologist's role in patient care [^114HdRTa]. Academic Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

This study investigates clinical-year medical student perceptions of the role of radiologists and medical imaging in patient care, assessing their exposure to and experiences with radiology during clinical rotations. Given radiology's critical function in modern healthcare, this study aims to highlight educational gaps and propose improvements for integrating radiology more effectively within medical curricula.

Materials and Methods

A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining a validated survey and semi-structured interviews to collect quantitative and qualitative data. The survey focused on students' familiarity with the radiologist's role, confidence in interpreting imaging findings, and experiences with radiology across different clinical rotations. Ten students were randomly selected for in-depth interviews to provide deeper insights. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, while qualitative data using thematic analysis.

Results

Out of 90 surveyed students, 50% responded, revealing varied experiences across clinical rotations and limited exposure to diagnostic and interventional radiology. Radiologists were widely viewed as ancillary service providers, with many students reporting no direct communication with them regarding image interpretation. While radiology reports were noted to influence patient treatment, few students reported patient awareness of the radiologist's contributions. The study also highlighted a moderate understanding of radiation risks and the selection of appropriate diagnostic imaging.

Conclusion

The findings underscore the necessity for an integrated radiology curriculum, including practical exposure and enhanced interprofessional collaboration. These insights advocate for an educational framework that aligns radiology's educational presence with its clinical significance, thus preparing students for the multifaceted demands of modern medical practice.

### Determinants of radiographic progression in early psoriatic arthritis: insights from a real-world cohort [^1154LZBG]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

One key finding from this study is the identification of baseline clinical factors associated with radiographic progression in early PsA. Our refined multivariable analysis observed older age and elevated mTSS at the initial as potential risk factors. Interestingly, the female sex appeared to confer a degree of resistance against radiographic changes. These findings are consistent with previous research, one of which is an age over 50 years at diagnosis correlating with deteriorated physical functionality. In another study investigating the impact of tenderness on PsA, baseline radiographic damage was the only variable significantly associated with radiographic progression, despite many factors not having a marked influence, including joint tenderness.

Complementing our data, the role of baseline SJC and disease activity level (DAPSA) in radiographic progression has been consistently underscored in earlier studies as a predictor for radiographic progression. Especially in the subgroup of patients who exhibited radiographic progression, multivariable analysis revealed high SJC and disease activity (DAPSA) as statistically significant predictors for radiographic changes. Our results resonate with studies showing that high disease activity correlates with functional impairment and structural progression on radiographs. Bond et al found that the number of actively inflamed joints, particularly the number of swollen joints, was associated with the progression of radiological damage. Furthermore, Gladman et al reported that the progression of clinical and radiographic damage in PsA has been related to disease activity and severity, both at presentation and follow-up, emphasising the significance of disease activity in radiographic progression. These findings underscore that baseline swollen joints and disease activity may play a pivotal role in the radiographic progression of PsA.

The sex-specific patterns we unearthed, suggesting that females had a protective effect against radiographic progression given existing damage, align with findings from the early PsA Sweden cohort. Nevertheless, contrasting observations have been documented, where female sex correlates with structural damage and physical disability in PsA. These sex-dichotomous trends necessitate further investigative depth.

Our investigation, conducted in a real-world cohort, offers a nuanced perspective distinct from the conventional RCTs. Indeed, real-world cohorts provide detailed insight into the natural progression of diseases, capturing the complexities commonly encountered in clinical settings. Such insights, unaffected by the constraints of clinical trial settings, make our conclusions especially relevant to daily patient care. Considering the inherent variability arising from the diverse demographic spectrum in real-world studies is crucial. Nevertheless, our data demonstrated a remarkable consistency in outcomes despite this diversity.

### Role of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis [^111HsBD2]. Arthritis Care & Research (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically evaluate the literature addressing the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis and prognosis of early undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Methods

We performed a systematic literature review of the performance characteristics of MRI for diagnosing and prognosticating RA. We searched Ovid, supplementing this with manual searches of bibliographies, journals, meeting proceedings, and the ClinicalTrials.gov web site. To identify diagnostic studies, we included studies of any duration that prospectively examined whether MRI findings predicted RA diagnosis and reported adequate information to calculate sensitivity and specificity. To identify prognostic studies, we included prospective studies with at least a 12-month followup period that measured both baseline MRI findings and clinical and/or radiographic outcomes.

Results

For diagnostic studies (n = 11), sensitivity and specificity of MRI findings for RA diagnosis ranged from 20–100% and 0–100%, respectively, depending upon the criteria used. Diagnostic performance of MRI improved when lower-quality studies or studies with longer disease duration were excluded. For prognostic studies (n = 17), MRI findings did not predict clinical remission, and the ability to predict radiographic progression varied significantly (range 18–100% for sensitivity and 5.9–97% for specificity). Restricting the analysis to specific MRI findings or earlier disease improved MRI prognostic performance. The only prognostic study reporting 100% of a priori quality criteria found MRI bone edema to be the strongest predictor of radiographic progression.

Conclusion

Data evaluating MRI for the diagnosis and prognosis of early RA are currently inadequate to justify widespread use of this technology for these purposes, although MRI bone edema may be predictive of progression in certain RA populations.

Guideline 15: Radiographic confirmation of clinically significant AV access lesion — KDOQI considers it reasonable that when clinical monitoring suggests clinically significant AV access lesion (eg, stenosis), further timely and confirmatory evaluation should proceed, including imaging of the dialysis access circuit; imaging studies are obtained when there are clinical signs and symptoms without other cause, and the timeframe, choice, and extent of imaging depend on local resources and the severity of findings, with a timeframe of less than 2 weeks deemed reasonable by the KDOQI Work Group. KDOQI considers it reasonable to use the smallest volume of iodinated contrast or non-iodinated contrast agents (eg, CO2 gas) by operators knowledgeable in their uses, contraindications, and risks to obtain the best possible image in all patients with CKD to preserve residual kidney function, and KDOQI considers it reasonable that when further confirmatory imaging studies reveal a culprit lesion responsible for clinical signs and symptoms, the clinically significant lesion is promptly treated.

### Pulmonary CTA reporting: expert panel narrative review [^115YCUPq]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary CTA is a ubiquitous study interpreted by radiologists with different levels of experience in a variety of practice settings. Pulmonary embolism (PE) can range from an incidental and clinically insignificant finding to a clinically significant thrombus that can be managed on an outpatient basis to a potentially fatal condition requiring immediate medical or invasive management. Accordingly, a clear and concise pulmonary CTA report should effectively communicate the most pertinent findings to help the treating medical team diagnose or exclude PE and provide information to guide appropriate management. In this Expert Panel Narrative Review, we discuss the purpose of the radiology report for pulmonary CTA, the optimal report format, and the relevant findings that need to be addressed and their clinical significance.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — outcomes and adverse event definitions prioritize patient-important outcomes including mortality, hospitalization, development of severe disease (e.g., need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation), clinical improvement (disease-oriented outcomes inferred by radiological findings or virologic cure), and severe adverse events leading to discontinuation; serious adverse events are death, life threatening reactions, those that require hospitalization, result in disability or permanent damage or require an intervention to prevent permanent impairment. Critical outcomes varied by population: among hospitalized patients (at any disease severity), critical outcomes included mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, failure of clinical improvement, adverse events, and serious adverse events; among ambulatory populations with COVID-19 infection, hospitalization replaced duration of hospitalization; among persons receiving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, outcomes included measures of symptomatic COVID-19 infection.

### Open reduction of radial neck fractures in children: injury severity predicts the radiographic and clinical outcomes [^116q9dta]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Radial neck fractures are the third most common elbow fracture in children. Open reduction may be required if closed or mini-open techniques are not successful in reducing the fracture. Previous reports on open reduction have noted poor outcomes and complications with this treatment approach. However, it is unknown whether it is the open procedure itself or the severity of the initial injury that leads to the poor results. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between intraoperative findings at the time of open reduction of radial neck fractures and the clinical and radiographic outcomes.

Methods

Data from patients who underwent open reduction for an acute radial neck fracture between January 2009 and December 2018 were abstracted and reviewed. Patients undergoing open treatment for a nonunion or malunion and those with inadequate follow-up were excluded. Demographic data, injury characteristics, treatment strategies, intraoperative findings, and clinical and radiographic outcomes were assessed.

Results

Twenty-two patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these patients, 14 were girls. The mean age was 9.7 ± 3 years, and the mean follow-up period was 15.8 months. Fifteen patients had a Judet grade IV displacement. Fair or poor outcomes were observed in 12 patients (55%). Ten reoperations were recorded during the study period. Age, weight, and associated injuries were not predictive of poor outcomes. Intraoperative findings of soft-tissue stripping and radial head comminution were the only significant predictors of fair or poor clinical outcomes (P < .001) and subsequent radiographic changes including fragmentation and collapse of the radial head and arthritic changes (P < .001). The quality of reduction and the choice of hardware were not significantly associated with either clinical or radiographic outcomes.

Conclusion

Our findings support the notion that the outcomes of open reduction of radial neck fractures are most closely correlated with the injury severity, with the intraoperative findings of complete soft-tissue stripping or comminution of the radial head fragment being significant predictors of poor clinical and radiographic outcomes. The choice of hardware and the quality of reduction achieved at the time of surgery have less significance than injury severity.

### Non-radiographic versus radiographic axSpA: what's in a name? [^111XD2d8]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Axial spondyloarthritis is a heterogeneous inflammatory condition with variable clinical presentations and outcomes. The complexity of its diagnosis and absence of biomarkers hamper the development of diagnostic criteria with the risk of misuse of the available classification criteria in clinical practice and its consequences. Axial spondyloarthritis should be regarded as a continuum in which some patients, but not all, will have a more severe phenotype characterized by progression into new bone formation and joint fusion. Growing understanding of the factors that might drive disease progression and treatment response will allow for better characterization of treatment options and outcome for each affected individual. The aim of this review is to update the current evidence of what is axial spondyloarthritis and to highlight the need to focus on the concept rather than its classification.

The diagnosis of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome is made based on a combination of clinical symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging studies. A detailed assessment of each of these components is important to differentiate FAI from other intra- and extra-articular hip disorders. Clinical and physical examination findings must be viewed collectively because no single pathognomonic finding exists for FAI. Nevertheless, common components of the history and physical examination do suggest a diagnosis of FAI.

### Is the scout out? The utility of scout radiographs in the pediatric upper gastrointestinal examination [^111ePsoh]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to demonstrate the scout radiograph does not change patient management, alter planning, or contribute to interpretation of the outpatient pediatric upper gastrointestinal fluoroscopic examination (UGI).

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 197 outpatient pediatric UGIs performed over a 2-year period. We performed a chart review on all patients to evaluate for potentially clinically significant findings on the scout radiograph. Scout findings were categorized into 4 groups: no new clinically significant findings (group 1), potentially clinically significant findings that were not directly addressed in the electronic medical record (group 2), incidental non-gastrointestinal (GI) findings that necessitated further workup, however, were later deemed insignificant (group 3), and clinically significant findings that changed patient GI management, altered the planning of the procedure, or contributed to the interpretation of the fluoroscopic study (group 4).

Results

A total of 197 UGIs were analyzed. A significant majority of cases (97.0%) were classified into group 1. Three cases (1.5%) were classified into group 2 with findings not addressed in the medical record. Two cases (1.0%) were classified into group 3, which, after further workup, were deemed not clinically significant. One case (0.5%) was classified into group 4, which resulted in a change in patient GI management.

Conclusions

In our review, there was only 1 case in which the scout radiograph changed patient GI management, with moderate stool burden leading to a miralax cleanout, although there were no cases, which altered the planning of the procedure or contributed to the interpretation of the study. The scout radiograph can be omitted and/or substituted with the last image hold function to decrease radiation exposure.

### Glycerin suppositories and enemas in premature infants: a meta-analysis… [^116DDGWC]. publications.aap.org (2022). Medium credibility.

n = 207) or enemas. Mortality rates ranged from 0% to 17%, and the meta-analysis revealed no differences between treatment groups. Active treatment was associated with earlier meconium evacuation but not a faster time to enteral feeds. Outcomes and Hypothesis The majority of trials on the use of glycerin suppositories or enemas were powered to detect a difference in time to full enteral feeds, and this was selected as the primary outcome measure. Additional outcomes of interest were mortality, NEC, rectal perforation, rectal bleeding, meconium evacuation, and jaundice. These outcomes were selected because of their importance and potential to be modified by the study treatment.

We hypothesized that the routine use of glycerin suppositories or enemas in premature infants may expedite meconium evacuation but would have no consistent effect on enteral feeding or other outcomes. 19 Using this approach, we assessed each outcome across multiple studies and graded the quality of evidence as very low, low, moderate, or high. Results from RCTs are presumed to be high quality, whereas those from observational studies are considered low quality. These default ratings are then upgraded or downgraded by 1 or 2 points each for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and effect size. Mortality Mortality rates ranged from 0% to 17% 27–31. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between infants who were administered glycerin suppositories or glycerin enemas compared with the control treatment. 9, 26–31 The meta-analysis demonstrated a nonsignificant trend toward a higher incidence of NEC with glycerin suppositories;.

### Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in clinical practice: application and interpretation of scans beyond the numbers [^115f8TcF]. Clinical Imaging (2002). Low credibility.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is widely used for measurement of bone mineral density (BMD). In routine clinical practice, a diversity of DXA scan findings that deviate from anticipated anatomical landmarks and require a sophisticated approach to patient positioning and scan analysis may be identified. Recognition of various artifacts and pathologic processes that can falsely increase the measured BMD is essential to accurate DXA scan analysis. Critical evaluation of the DXA scan image, and careful appraisal of numeric data on the computer-generated printout by clinicians and radiology technologists are instrumental to ensure correct DXA scan interpretation. We demonstrate a spectrum of incidental findings that may influence BMD measurements and analyze common pitfalls of DXA scan interpretation. Radiographic correlation can help further evaluate a suspected abnormality displayed on the DXA image.

### Lung cancer screening and incidental findings: a research agenda: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116NZr15]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Section IIIa: The radiologist's perspective on management of incidental findings (IFs) during lung cancer screening (LCS) emphasizes both adoption and variability: 'the ACR Lung-RADS lexicon has been widely adapted and is intended to standardize clinical reporting and management of LDCT findings from LCS', yet 'the use of the S modifier has yet to be standardized across systems because of a lack of agreement on what is clinically significant or potentially clinically significant'. The document attributes variation to multiple decision points: 'This variation is driven by 1) what an individual radiologist may determine and identify as clinically significant or insignificant, 2) what the end-using clinician decides is clinically significant or insignificant, and also (potentially) 3) what the patient's response is to reading about IFs in the LDCT report'.

### Links between radiological change, disability, and pathology in rheumatoid arthritis [^112Zg9vi]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The relationship between the development of radiographic joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis and its longterm consequences for the patient is not well understood. Two objectives for further research have been identified: elucidating this relationship and relating pathological processes to the features visible on radiographs. Extrapolation from a proposed model suggests that if radiographic progression is suppressed early in the disease, it might take many years before the benefit can be clearly appreciated against a background of variation within individual patients. Two approaches have recently been brought to bear on this issue, including a detailed modeling of medium term observations from a single dataset and a review of a large number of published studies. There are a number of reservations about the notion of a minimum clinically important change, but one possibility for defining such a change for radiographs is in relation to longterm functional outcome.

### Gastrointestinal absorption of isohemagglutinin… [^116vcU24]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Although 4 recent studies 1–4 have shown that the newborn and the neonate are capable of absorbing small amounts of fed anti-A and anti-Rh antibodies, this finding and its significance, as far as the breast feeding of erythroblastotic infants is concerned, are still disputed. Boorman et al. 5 were unable to find evidence of antibody absorption, probably because of the small amounts of antibody fed. Despite their negative findings they advise the boiling of milk of sensitized mothers for the first few weeks, in order to destroy any isohemagglutinin present in the milk. In Winnipeg, Rh-sensitized mothers have been allowed to breast feed their erythroblastotic infants if they so desired, and adverse effects have not been noted. Since milk from these mothers often does contain Rh antibody, it was decided to feed a small group of newborn babies large amounts of anti-A and anti-D isohemagglutinin.

### 'But is the difference clinically significant?' [^115EkKxU]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

The statement that a difference or change found in a research study is statistically significant is frequently met with the response, 'but is it clinically significant?'. This question seems entirely reasonable and uncontentious until one asks how to determine or define clinical significance. Significance must always have an object; significant to whom? Furthermore it needs elaboration; significant in what way? Once these questions are raised, it becomes apparent that the slick, apparently sensible question is in fact extremely difficult to answer and may have multiple answers: the patient may value being free of discomfort, but the payer may only value achieving less cost in long-term care and the clinician may wish to see change in activities. The use of this question by funding organizations may disadvantage rehabilitation. This Editorial explores the substance of this question, concluding that the question can only be answered by the individual patient concerned, and that research studies should perhaps explore more fully what is actually of significance to patients.

### International urogynecological consultation chapter 2.2: imaging in the diagnosis of pelvic organ prolapse [^112atiji]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Definition of Cases and Controls and Radiographic Markers

Three studies reported on symptoms associated with prolapse but did not use those symptoms in defining clinically significant prolapse. The clear clinical definition of prolapse was used only in one study: Groenendijk et al. defined clinically significant prolapse of the posterior wall as ≥ POP-Q stage II. The clear definition of an abnormal radiographic finding in the anterior compartment was reported by Altman et al. describing the descent of opacified urinary bladder below the pubococcygeal line as abnormal. Studies focusing on the posterior compartment used definitions of abnormal radiographic findings describing the apex of the rectocele as a common reference point. Groenendijk et al. measured the distance from the rectocele apex to the expected rectal lining of the anterior rectal wall. Finco et al. and Altman et al. measured the distance between the rectocele apex and the line extended through the anal canal axis. In addition, Finco et al. classified radiographic findings of rectocele as grades I, II, and III, using this distance, and defined radiographic rectocele as grade I when it was less than 2 cm long, grade II for 2–4 cm, and grade III when it was over 4 cm.

Diagnostic Accuracy Reporting

There were no studies clearly reporting on the sensitivity or specificity of fluoroscopic testing, in relationship to clinical examination. Studies examined only the correlation between clinical and radiological findings. There was a moderate correlation between the clinical and radiological diagnosis of anterior wall prolapse (degree of correlation r = 0.67). There was poor correlation between fluoroscopic imaging of the posterior compartment and clinical examination for posterior vaginal prolapse (degree of correlation r = 0.49). Although increasing the size of the rectocele on defecography moderately correlated with difficulty in rectal emptying (r = 0.59), there were no other significant associations between symptoms and anatomical findings on imaging.

Imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing and forecasting treatment outcomes in axial spondyloarthritis. Conventional radiography may overlook patients in the initial stages of the disease, while MRI is sensitive in identifying inflammation early on. Computed tomography reliably detects structural abnormalities.

### Types of evidence needed to assess the clinical value of diagnostic imaging [^1153k2er]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

AbstractThe evidence underlying the use of advanced diagnostic imaging is based mainly on diagnostic accuracy studies and not on well-designed trials demonstrating improved patient outcomes. This has led to an expansion of low-value and potentially harmful patient care and raises ethical issues around the widespread implementation of tests with incompletely known benefits and harms. Randomized clinical trials are needed to support the safety and effectiveness of imaging tests and should be required for clearance of most new technologies. Large, diverse cohort studies are needed to quantify disease risk associated with many imaging findings, especially incidental findings, to enable evidence-based management. The responsibility to minimize the use of tests with unknown or low value requires engagement of clinicians, medical societies, and the public.

### Imaging in rheumatology: reconciling radiology and rheumatology [^113tzheU]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

What the rheumatologists need and what they don't need

The earlier treatment is started the more favourable the long-term prognosis. It has become possible to delay or even prevent severe joint inflammation and subsequent destruction. To enable early treatment early diagnosis becomes paramount. However, inflammatory joint disorders often start gradually and the clinical features can be non-specific. Not so long ago, several years might have passed before a definite diagnosis was made, by which time irreversible joint damage or destruction had usually occurred.

To enable earlier diagnosis, various rheumatological societies have reviewed their diagnostic criteria and incorporated modern imaging methods and modalities into their diagnostic algorithms.

The role of imaging and radiologists is reviewed according to disease entities (Table 1). When assessing different types of inflammatory rheumatic disorders, the rheumatologist usually requests imaging studies to answer one or more of the following questions:
Is there evidence of an inflammatory process?
If so which anatomical sites are involved?
What is the specific diagnosis?
How is the disease responding to treatment?

### Are conventional radiographs still of value? [^1175bb2E]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Ofreview

To describe the most recent randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and long-term observational studies (LOS) of RCTs with regard to radiological endpoints, and to interpret the results in the context of methodology.

Recent Findings

Many RCTs include radiological endpoints, sometimes as primary endpoints, usually as secondary endpoints. The results of these RCTs prove that radiological assessment can still detect meaningful differences in the progression of structural RA-related damage between treatment arms. In addition, LOS provide the opportunity to investigate if radiological progression is stable over time in patients on treatment. Improvements in the selection of appropriate patients (enrichment) and in the analysis of radiological data allow a more meaningful interpretation of radiological data in RA clinical trials and LOS.

Summary

Radiological evaluation in RA clinical trials and observational studies is still valuable. Although subtle progression scores observed in clinical trials have limited direct clinical relevance, radiological treatment effects in trials may reflect subtle differences in clinical efficacy between treatment arms, and radiological progression may be considered a reflection of historic disease activity.

### Diagnosis, prognosis and classification of early arthritis: results of a systematic review informing the 2016 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis [^112Aoywk]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Previous SLR

Laboratory tests

The previous 2007 EULAR recommendations for EA management had identified a high ESR, a high CRP level and the presence of RF and/or anti-CCP antibodies as independent predictors for long-term radiographic progression.

Imaging tests

The previous SLR preceding the 2013 EULAR recommendations for the use of joint imaging tests in the clinical management of RA had identified the presence of synovitis on US or MRI, joint damage on conventional radiography and bone marrow oedema (osteitis) on MRI as predictors of subsequent radiographic progression in early RA. An independent predictor of progression of erosions was reportedly 'early bone loss' in the hand, measured as a decrease in estimated BMD in the first year of disease by digital X-ray radiogrammetry. Inflammatory changes on bone scintigraphy seemed to be associated with radiographic progression.

Current SLR

The aim of the search was to retrieve studies evaluating the prognostic value of laboratory tests and/or imaging tests in terms of radiological and functional outcome and clinical remission. Details of the selected studies are reported as online supplementary material S4.

We found 35 studies for laboratory tests and 12 studies for imaging tests.

Laboratory tests

Included studies evaluated mainly RF (19 studies) and ACPAs, in particular anti-CCP antibodies (25 studies) (see online supplementary materials S6). Apart from three studieson clinical remission, all included studies used radiographic progression as the primary outcome, although with various definitions.

The value of RF as a prognostic marker in patients with EA was reportedly heterogeneous and extremely dependent on the prevalence of radiographic progression in the cohorts. Depending on the studies, positive predictive values (PPVs) of RF for radiographic progression ranged from 20% to 92%, without a clear trend towards one or the other of these extreme values. Negative predictive values (NPVs) were better, with half of the studies reporting a NPV of RF for radiographic progression between 60% and 80%, and the other half reporting even higher NPVs (80–100%). PPVs of ACPAs for radiographic progression in patients with EA were also heterogeneous, with approximately half of the studies reporting low PPVs with values between 20% and 40%, and the other half reporting high PPVs with values over 80%. On the other hand, NPVs of ACPAs for radiographic progression were high, around 80% in the majority of the included studies.

### Rate of abnormal osteoarticular radiographic findings in pediatric patients [^116mf7yL]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of our study was to assess the rate of abnormal radiographic findings in the most frequent osteoarticular locations of traumatic injury in a pediatric population.

Subjects and Methods

During two periods of 12 weeks each, all patients admitted to the pediatric emergency department for osteoarticular trauma who underwent radiography were prospectively included in this study. A connection was drawn between the rate of abnormal radiographic findings for the seven most frequently radiographed locations and the clinical findings.

Results

Of 3128 locations of trauma in 2470 children, only 22% of the radiographic examinations were considered to reveal abnormal findings. In decreasing order, the hand and fingers, the ankle, the wrist, the knee, the elbow, the foot and toes, and the forearm were the most frequently examined locations. The rate of abnormal findings was 25.7% for the hand and fingers, 9.0% for the ankle, 42.5% for the wrist, 9.5% for the knee, 33.3% for the elbow, 18.3% for the foot, and 43.2% for the forearm. When only the direct sign of fracture was taken into account, these rates decreased for the ankle and knee to 2.6% and 1.9%, respectively. There was always a significant link between the degree of clinical suspicion and the rate of abnormal radiographic findings. However, fewer than 50% of the cases with high clinical suspicion of fracture were radiographically confirmed.

Conclusion

It appears necessary, especially in cases of lower limb trauma, to evaluate clinical tests, including the implementation of the Ottawa ankle rules, to reduce the number of unnecessary radiographic examinations. This reduction will improve some parameters of children's quality of life and will significantly decrease the cost of emergency care.

### Clinical utility of abnormal opacity overlying the vertebral column on lateral chest radiography [^117RASHx]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Chest radiography is an important component of the evaluation of patients with complaints referable to the chest. We sought to investigate the clinical utility of one particular finding on the lateral chest radiograph (CXR), namely, radioopacity obscuring the normal superior to inferior progression of vertebral radiolucency. A review of the literature yielded little published evidence to characterize the clinical utility of this finding to date.

Methods

We retrospectively identified 370 patients from a hospital database who underwent both computed tomography (CT) imaging of the chest and lateral chest radiography within 24 hours. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) associated with the presence or absence of an abnormal opacity overlying the vertebral column on lateral chest radiography using CT imaging of the chest as the reference standard. We also estimated interobserver and intraobserver reliability of this finding.

Results

Abnormal opacity overlying the vertebral column had a sensitivity of 86.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82.5%-90.3%) and specificity of 70.4% (95% CI, 59.7%-79.2%) for relevant CT-documented lower lobe and associated structural pathology. The associated summary positive LR (LR+) was 2.9 (95% CI, 2.1–4.1) and summary negative LR (LR-) was 0.19 (95% CI, 0.13–0.26). Kappa statistics were indicative of moderate intraobserver and interobserver agreement.

Conclusions

The presence of abnormal opacity overlying the vertebral column on lateral chest radiography increases the probability of lower lobe and associated structural pathology somewhat. The absence of this finding decreased the probability of such pathology to a greater degree. Thus, this finding is useful in differentiating those patients with pathology from those without.

### What is the role of imaging in the clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis and disease management? [^1152ewor]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

While OA is predominantly diagnosed on the basis of clinical criteria, imaging may aid with differential diagnosis in clinically suspected cases. While plain radiographs are traditionally the first choice of imaging modality, MRI and US also have a valuable role in assessing multiple pathologic features of OA, although each has particular advantages and disadvantages. Although modern imaging modalities provide the capability to detect a wide range of osseous and soft tissue (cartilage, menisci, ligaments, synovitis, effusion) OA-related structural damage, this extra information has not yet favourably influenced the clinical decision-making and management process. Imaging is recommended if there are unexpected rapid changes in clinical outcomes to determine whether it relates to disease severity or an additional diagnosis. On developing specific treatments, imaging serves as a sensitive tool to measure treatment response. This narrative review aims to describe the role of imaging modalities to aid in OA diagnosis, disease progression and management. It also provides insight into the use of these modalities in finding targeted treatment strategies in clinical research.

### High prevalence of new clinically significant findings in patients with embolic stroke of unknown source evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging [^112qJk4d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Definition of New Clinical Findings

Clinical CMR reports were provided for all patients by an expert CMR imaging physician according to routine clinical practice. A new clinical finding was defined as one not previously documented in the medical records. New clinical findings were categorized as cardiac or extracardiac in origin. A new clinically significant finding was determined by the need for further investigation, follow‐up, or treatment. New clinically significant findings were not required to be directly attributable to the underlying cause of the index stroke. A change in patient care was defined as initiation of medical, interventional, surgical, or palliative treatment following clinical evaluation of a newly identified clinically significant finding. Classification of a new cardiomyopathy was performed by an expert clinician as part of routine clinical care following review of clinical history, imaging, and results of further investigations if clinically required. A focal myocardial infarct of potential embolic cause was determined radiographically by typical appearance on late gadolinium enhancement imaging of a small, discrete, punctate lesion with no corresponding regional wall motion abnormality.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using RStudio, version 4.0.3. Normally distributed quantitative variables were presented as means and SDs. Nonnormally distributed data were presented as medians and interquartile ranges. Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages. Between‐group comparisons were made using χ² or Fisher exact test for categorical variables and Student t test or Mann‐Whitney U test for continuous variables, as appropriate. Relative risks were calculated between groups. A 2‐tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Frequency and clinical significance of previously undetected incidental findings detected on computed tomography simulation scans for breast cancer patients [^111vnDqD]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the frequency and clinical significance of previously undetected incidental findings found on computed tomography (CT) simulation images for breast cancer patients.

Methods and Materials

All CT simulation images were first interpreted prospectively by radiation oncologists and then double-checked by diagnostic radiologists. The official reports of CT simulation images for 881 consecutive postoperative breast cancer patients from 2009 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Potentially important incidental findings (PIIFs) were defined as any previously undetected benign or malignancy-related findings requiring further medical follow-up or investigation. For all patients in whom a PIIF was detected, we reviewed the clinical records to determine the clinical significance of the PIIF. If the findings from the additional studies prompted by a PIIF required a change in management, the PIIF was also recorded as a clinically important incidental finding (CIIF).

Results

There were a total of 57 (6%) PIIFs. The 57 patients in whom a PIIF was detected were followed for a median of 17 months (range, 3–26). Six cases of CIIFs (0.7% of total) were detected. Of the six CIIFs, three (50%) cases had not been noted by the radiation oncologist until the diagnostic radiologist detected the finding. On multivariate analysis, previous CT examination was an independent predictor for PIIF (p = 0.04). Patients who had not previously received chest CT examinations within 1 year had a statistically significantly higher risk of PIIF than those who had received CT examinations within 6 months (odds ratio, 3.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.32–9.50; p = 0.01).

Conclusions

The rate of incidental findings prompting a change in management was low. However, radiation oncologists appear to have some difficulty in detecting incidental findings that require a change in management. Considering cost, it may be reasonable that routine interpretations are given to those who have not received previous chest CT examinations within 1 year.

### Statistical significance versus clinical importance of observed effect sizes: what Do P values and confidence intervals really represent? [^111NZTMk]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Effect size measures are used to quantify treatment effects or associations between variables. Such measures, of which > 70 have been described in the literature, include unstandardized and standardized differences in means, risk differences, risk ratios, odds ratios, or correlations. While null hypothesis significance testing is the predominant approach to statistical inference on effect sizes, results of such tests are often misinterpreted, provide no information on the magnitude of the estimate, and tell us nothing about the clinically importance of an effect. Hence, researchers should not merely focus on statistical significance but should also report the observed effect size. However, all samples are to some degree affected by randomness, such that there is a certain uncertainty on how well the observed effect size represents the actual magnitude and direction of the effect in the population. Therefore, point estimates of effect sizes should be accompanied by the entire range of plausible values to quantify this uncertainty. This facilitates assessment of how large or small the observed effect could actually be in the population of interest, and hence how clinically important it could be. This tutorial reviews different effect size measures and describes how confidence intervals can be used to address not only the statistical significance but also the clinical significance of the observed effect or association. Moreover, we discuss what P values actually represent, and how they provide supplemental information about the significant versus nonsignificant dichotomy. This tutorial intentionally focuses on an intuitive explanation of concepts and interpretation of results, rather than on the underlying mathematical theory or concepts.

### Does arthroscopic partial meniscectomy result in knee osteoarthritis? A systematic review with a minimum of 8 years' follow-up [^115n1XZx]. Arthroscopy (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Our purpose is to test the hypothesis that arthroscopic partial meniscectomy results in knee osteoarthritis at long-term follow-up.

Methods

We systematically reviewed PubMed search terms "meniscus AND arthritis AND knee" and "meniscectomy AND arthritis AND knee" and included English-language, Levels I to IV evidence studies reporting either radiographic or clinical osteoarthritis outcome measures with a minimum of 8 years' follow-up after partial arthroscopic meniscectomy.

Results

Five studies met the inclusion criteria. All reported both radiographic and clinical measures. All studies compared the normal, contralateral knee as a radiographic control, but none included a clinical control group. Follow-up ranged from 8 to 16 years. In all studies operative knees showed a statistically significant incidence of radiographic signs of osteoarthritis compared with control knees. However, clinical symptoms of osteoarthritis were not observed. Furthermore, clinical outcomes did not correlate with radiographic findings.

Discussion

Our results show that radiographic signs of osteoarthritis are significant at 8 to 16 years' follow-up after knee arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, but clinical symptoms of knee arthritis were not observed. Limitations include absence of clinical control groups and heterogeneity of reported outcome measures. Future research of higher levels of evidence and with longer-term follow-up is required to determine whether the radiographic signs ultimately foreshadow clinical symptoms in patients after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy.

Conclusions

Radiographic signs of osteoarthritis are significant at 8 to 16 years' follow-up after knee arthroscopic partial meniscectomy, but clinical symptoms of knee arthritis are not significant.

Level Of Evidence

Systematic review of Level IV clinical evidence and Levels II and III radiographic evidence.

### Statistical significance and clinical relevance… [^115wMLxe]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

When evaluating the validity of a study, the reader must consider both the clinical and statistical significance of the findings. A study that claims clinical relevance may lack sufficient statistical significance to make a meaningful statement. Conversely, a study that shows a statistically significant difference in 2 treatment options may lack practicality. The concept of power of a clinical trial refers to the probability of detecting a difference between study groups when a true difference exists. We will discuss statistical power by examining studies too small to identify important differences, studies so large as to identify differences that are not clinically significant, difficult-to-design studies without very large patient populations, and those studies with both adequate power and clinically relevant findings.

Dermatologists should not focus on small P values alone to decide whether a treatment is clinically useful; it is essential to consider the magnitude of treatment differences and the power of the study. As the power of a statistical study increases, the study's ability to detect progressively smaller differences increases. The concept of a particular study having too much power must also be considered. Studies with very large sample sizes may detect statistically significant differences that are clinically irrelevant. We have arbitrarily selected from the literature examples of clinical studies that illustrate the importance of power in interpreting the clinical relevance of clinical trial results. Each example will be briefly described and followed by a discussion of the study's power and the resultant effects on the author's conclusions. A CI of 1. 001–1.

002, indicates that a statistically significant difference was found but that the magnitude of this difference was so small that it would not likely be clinically significant. A CI of 3 to 10 would indicate both a statistically and a clinically meaningful difference. Finally, a CI of 0. 8 to 10 indicates that no statistically significant difference was observed but that the power of the study was not sufficient to rule out a rather large difference between drug and placebo. The above examples serve to demonstrate the importance of thoroughly examining the methods as well as results of clinical trials reported in the literature. An assessment of study power is essential in determining both the statistical significance and clinical relevance of any study and has serious implications for any conclusions that can be drawn. Consequences of an inappropriate sample size can be dangerous in either extreme.

An excessively large sample may show statistical significance even when there is no clinical practicality; an inappropriately small sample will fail to demonstrate important clinically significant differences. When dermatologists evaluate studies reporting significant differences, they should ask whether these differences are both statistically and clinically meaningful.

### ABM clinical protocol # 30: breast masses, breast complaints, and diagnostic breast imaging in the lactating woman [^1126a3aR]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Table 1 — most common breast masses diagnosed during lactation — diagnostic considerations are summarized as follows: Lactating adenoma — Core needle biopsy recommended to establish diagnosis. Galactocele — Aspiration of milky fluid can confirm the diagnosis and is at risk for infection due to milk stasis, so may mimic abscess. Phlegmon — May or may not have antecedent and/or concomitant infectious symptoms (e.g., erythema). Abscess — Aspiration or drainage of purulent material can confirm the diagnosis. Fibroadenoma — Core needle biopsy is recommended for lesions > 2–3 cm to rule out Phyllodes tumor, significant growth rate, and/or discordance between clinical and radiographic findings. Breast cancer — Core needle biopsy, image guided in the case of nonpalpable cancers, is required for diagnosis and pathologic staging, and in the case of an equivocal percutaneous biopsy, surgical biopsy may be required.

### Need for higher quality evidence to determine the utility of postoperative radiography [^112th6bH]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Looking forward, the current evidence will benefit from prospective comparative research examining management changes in patients who do or do not undergo radiography at each of several specific postoperative time points. Types of management change should be documented in detail, and studies should be specific to separate outcomes for different fracture types and treatment methods. In addition, longer term follow-up over a minimum of 1 year will facilitate exploration into the effect on patient functional outcomes. This research is particularly necessary for children, given their greater remodeling potential, which reduces the need for immediate reintervention after loss of reduction.

Ideally, the benchmark for future research in this area would be a noninferiority randomized controlled trial comparing management changes between patients undergoing immediate or 3- to 4-week postoperative radiography. The goal of a noninferiority design is to demonstrate that not obtaining radiography at specific postoperative time points is no worse at detecting the need for management change and thus ultimately does not affect complication rates and functional outcomes. For effective comparisons to be made, overall incidences of management change should be captured with detail on whether they were indicated by radiographic or clinical findings. However, challenges exist in implementing such a trial. Because the absolute rates of management change are very small, differences between groups will likely be hard to detect, necessitating impractical sample sizes to achieve significance. Furthermore, because management change is a subjective outcome, determination of a meaningful noninferiority margin would be difficult. The next alternative would be a large, prospective observational study, which would entail prospective enrollment and collection of outcomes over a long follow-up period with documentation of all postoperative radiographs, management changes, complications, and functional outcomes in accordance with a standardized management plan. Such data would then provide insights for determining a noninferiority margin for future randomized trials with potential to inform clinical practice. Overall, higher quality prospective studies, along with more comprehensive reporting, are necessary to increase the strength of evidence in the literature.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the evaluation and disposition of acute chest pain in the Emergency department: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113JDTgA]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Initial assessment of chest pain — terminology, examination, and chest X-ray guidance include using the terms "cardiac, possible cardiac, and noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause; clinical assessment "should include the chest pain description and associated symptoms, onset, duration, location, radiation, and precipitating and relieving factors"; there are "no physical examination findings specific for coronary ischemia", so the exam "should be targeted to identify findings associated with high risk for morbidity and mortality in ACS, or to the presence of potential alternative diagnoses", with high-risk findings including "signs of low cardiac output… heart failure… and a new systolic murmur concerning for acute mitral regurgitation or a ventricular septal defect"; as part of the initial assessment, "a chest X-ray should be performed in almost all patients with possible ACS", given its potential to identify high-risk and noncardiac causes, and "performance of a chest X-ray should not delay emergent interventions such as primary percutaneous coronary intervention for those with a definitive STEMI".

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause for acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### REDUCE-PCP study: radiographs in the emergency department utilization criteria evaluation-pediatric chest pain [^112h53QD]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Many emergency physicians order chest x-rays (CXRs) for pediatric patients who present with a chief complaint of chest pain despite a paucity of research to support this testing, which exposes patients to radiation, cost, and delays.

Objectives

This study aimed to begin development of a decision making tool that will allow emergency physicians to selectively obtain CXR films in pediatric patients presenting with chest pain.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of 400 consecutive pediatric patients with a chief complaint of chest pain and reviewed charts to determine how many received a CXR and which clinical characteristics were present in all patients. Chest radiograph findings were graded for significance as follows: (1) no or minor clinical significance: normal result in the CXR film without effect on the immediate evaluation of a patient; (2) moderate clinical significance: only impact on plan for follow-up; and (3) major clinical significance: result in the CXR film directly affects immediate management. We then evaluated each chart for historical or examination findings that might identify criteria associated with positive radiographic findings to propose a set of criteria that could lead to the development of a decision rule that allows a reduced utilization while having a high sensitivity for clinically significant positive findings on CXR film.

Results

Of the 400 pediatric patients reviewed, 63.5% (n = 254) received a CXR in the emergency department (ED). Of those receiving a CXR, only 8.26% (n = 21) had a finding that affected either ED management or follow-up planning. The criteria that would have identified all patients with positive results in the CXR films were abnormal vital signs, shortness of breath, palpitations, presence of comorbidities, abnormal or unilateral breath sounds, history of trauma, murmur, or cough.

Conclusions

This pilot study demonstrates the potential for a decision rule to eliminate both cost and radiation exposure by using defined criteria to determine the need for a CXR in pediatric ED patients. We identified 8 simple criteria that would have identified all children who benefited from a CXR in this study. The next phase of this study will prospectively evaluate the utility of each of the criteria as part of a draft decision rule.

### Low back pain [^116Jihtn]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2012). Medium credibility.

Low back pain — pathoanatomical features and imaging findings emphasize broad potential pain generators and frequent false-positive imaging results. Any innervated lumbar structure can generate symptoms, and false-positive imaging is common, with herniated disc material on CT, MRI, or myelography in 20% to 76% of persons with no sciatica. Among asymptomatic individuals, 32% had "abnormal" lumbar spines, while 47% of those with low back pain had no abnormality identified. Accordingly, the association between clinical complaints and radiological findings must be considered cautiously, and physical job characteristics and psychological aspects of work were more powerful than MRI-identified disc abnormalities in predicting the need for low back pain–related medical consultation.

Despite the advent of sophisticated imaging systems, plain radiography continues to be a valuable outcome variable in clinical trials of inflammatory disorders for a number of reasons. This paper discusses the pros and cons of the different ways in which radiographic data in trials is presented; the minimum time needed to demonstrate radiographic progression in the context of a clinical trial; and the best ways to statistically analyse radiographic data.

### Chest X-ray interpretation in the EPICO pediatric COVID-19 study: addressing misconceptions [^115UvK8q]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Clinical Utility and Prognostic Value

The study was designed to characterize radiographic findings and explore associations with clinical outcomes, rather than guide treatment decisions or evaluate therapeutic response. Our results showed no consistent correlation between radiographic patterns and disease severity, clinical management, or prognosis. This suggests that chest X‐rays alone provide limited support for clinical decision‐making in pediatric COVID‐19. Further studies — including those with longitudinal follow‐up — may help define their potential role in ongoing patient care.

Chest imaging and classification in asbestos exposure — Compensation systems may require that the chest radiographs be classified by the ILO system once it is established that the patient has been exposed to asbestos, and there is no clear demarcation between 0/1 and 1/0; when radiographic or lung function abnormalities are indeterminate, HRCT scanning is often useful in revealing characteristic parenchymal abnormalities as well as correlative pleural changes that are highly suggestive of asbestos exposure, particularly when they are bilateral; the specificity of the diagnosis of asbestosis increases with the number of consistent findings on chest film, the number of clinical features present (e.g., symptoms, signs, and pulmonary function changes), and the significance and strength of the history of exposure.

### Thoracic complications of urologic laparoscopy: correlation between radiographic findings and clinical manifestations [^117BdY6E]. Journal of Endourology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The usefulness of plain film chest radiography (CXR) in evaluation for thoracic complications after laparoscopic urologic procedures is uncertain. Our objectives were to examine the association between radiographic findings and clinical manifestations of thoracic complications after laparoscopic urologic procedures and to determine the prevalence of postoperative CXR at our institution.

Patients and Methods

We performed a retrospective review of 195 patients who underwent laparoscopic renal/adrenal urologic procedures at our institution from 1998 to 2005. Chi-square analysis was used to compare the rate of radiographic abnormalities and thoracic complications between different types of laparoscopic procedures.

Results

A total of 96 patients (96/195, 49%) had postoperative CXR, and abnormalities were noted in 75 (75/96, 78%). The abnormalities seen on CXR included atelectasis, pleural effusions, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumonia. Retroperitoneal laparoscopy had significantly more incidental subclinical pneumothoraces (P = 0.000469) and subcutaneous emphysema (P = 0.043) identified by CXR than either transperitoneal, hand-assisted, or cryosurgery. Overall, eight patients (8.3%) had clinical manifestations of a thoracic complication but only five (5.2%) were clinically significant complications detected by CXR. Thus, while 75 CXRs were noted as abnormal, 70 (93%) documented incidental findings that did not affect patient care.

Conclusions

Thoracic complications after laparoscopic urologic procedures are uncommon events. Although the majority of CXRs after such procedures do contain abnormalities, most abnormalities are subclinical and do not affect postoperative management. Patients with significant radiographic findings demonstrated significant clinical symptoms. Thus, routine CXR after urologic laparoscopy does not appear to be necessary to identify thoracic complications and may be overused.

### Artificial intelligence-assisted double reading of chest radiographs to detect clinically relevant missed findings: a two-centre evaluation [^115vRbK5]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Clinically relevant missed findings on chest radiographs after review by the external radiologist

Finally, the results were returned to the respective institutions for review by an internal radiologist. The institution's radiologists confirmed clinically relevant missed findings in 21 out of 28 cases (75.0%) for institution 1, and 14 out of 19 cases (73.7%) for institution 2. The remainder of results (12/47, 25.5%) were rejected by the institution's radiologists because the finding was not unequivocally present (n = 7), was known and unchanged in comparison to prior imaging (n = 3) or was deemed not clinically relevant (n = 2). Overall, relevant missed findings were found in 0.1% (21/19,637) and 0.3% (14/5467) of all included chest radiographs for the respective institutions. The difference was statistically significant (Pearson's chi-square test, p < 0.05).

The list of confirmed unreported findings with clinical significance is shown in Table 4. There was no evidence of difference in the proportion of these findings between institutions (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.6–1). The majority were missed nodular opacities in both institutions, with an example shown in Fig. 3. This resulted in an extra 2.6% (15/567) and 1.5% (10/682) of nodules found for the respective institutions, based on the report analysis. The size of missed nodular opacities was < 1 cm in 12 cases and ≥ 1 cm in 13 cases. The second most frequently unreported finding with clinical significance was pneumothorax. The six missed pneumothoraces were limited to apical lucencies (< 3 cm). An example of a missed pneumothorax is shown in Fig. 4. A detailed list of missed findings with chest radiographs, reports, AI-generated results and radiologist's assessments is available in the Supplementary Material (Appendix A, electronic supplemental material).

### Need for higher quality evidence to determine the utility of postoperative radiography [^112hLwxA]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

An ongoing discussion exists regarding the utility and risk-to-benefit ratio of obtaining postoperative radiography as part of standard clinical practice. Studies suggest that routine radiography does not markedly change patient management after fracture fixationand has little utility in immediate postoperative management for maxillofacial fractures, total joint arthroplasty, and spine surgery. However, much practice variability and lack of consensus still exist, demonstrating a need to establish an evidence-based standard of care that optimizes patient outcomes while using hospital resources cost-effectively.

Routine radiographs can allow orthopaedic surgeons to preemptively identify complications before clinical symptoms arise to and provide objective reassurance when treating patients with ambiguous complaints. However, diagnostic radiographs are the largest man-made radiation source within the general population and account for approximately 14% of total worldwide exposure. Although a typical radiograph has a low effective radiation dose of 0.001 to 0.7 mSv, repeated doses accumulate, accounting for 3.2% of the cumulative risk of cancer in developed countries. Unfortunately, the long-term effects of radiation exposure of this sort are largely unknown, and concern exists that even small doses may be detrimental because they accumulate over the lifespan, with children particularly being nearly 10 times more sensitive than adults. Radiographs also contribute to healthcare expenditure, waiting times, and strains on personnel and resources. Thus, if evidence is strong that routine radiography has minimal utility in patient management, restricting it to patients with clinical indications would not only help decrease radiation exposure but also free resources for other hospital needs.

Recently, we published a systematic review evaluating the role of immediate postoperative radiography in patient management after fracture fixation. Results suggested that in patients with adequate intraoperative images and no clinical indications for radiography, immediate postoperative radiography does not markedly alter patient management. Although the effect sizes across studies were large, the overall evidence level was poor, with most being retrospective single-cohort studies, highlighting the need for higher quality prospective studies before definitive practice recommendations can be made. Although many studies reported relevant outcomes, no useful data could be retrieved because of a general lack of detail. Some articles reported complication rates but did not address management change, making it challenging to determine the true effect on patient management. Others reviewed outcomes without separating radiography performed at different follow-up time points, making it difficult to determine whether management changes were performed as a result of radiography taken immediately postoperatively or during subsequent follow-up. Finally, the heterogeneity of study populations made it challenging to separate effects for different fracture types and surgical methods.

### Clinical joint inactivity predicts structural stability in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis [^116DLycF]. RMD Open (2016). Low credibility.

Importantly, the time spent with a clinically active joint was significantly predicting progression of structural damage in the respective joint. This association was best for the 'overall' activity (swelling and/or tenderness), followed by swelling and tenderness. All these observations support current paradigms and recommendations of achieving full clinical remission (ie, absence of clinical joint activity) in patients with RA, since, on the basis of our findings, this would also warrant the absence of progression in any other joint in most patients.

As expected, patients with progressing joints without clinical activity in these joints showed lower overall disease activity than patients with progressing joints that were clinically active. Interestingly, however, they had significantly higher baseline radiographic scores, further supporting some of the above potential explanations for our findings, as well as the well-established concept that patients with erosive disease are the most likely ones to develop new erosions. Our data suggest that this risk even overrules the risk of progression afflicted with (ongoing) disease activity. Further, it has to be mentioned that patients with progression in clinically inactive joints even improved in HAQ values over time, thus suggesting only a small impact of radiographic progression on physical function in these patients.

### An analysis of clinical predictive values for radiographic pneumonia in children [^115gHKRY]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

The major strength of our aggregated database containing individual patient-level data is our ability to evaluate the test characteristics of combinations of signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings for the radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia. Prior single-centre studies have not been powered to identify which combinations of clinical findings could be used to identify radiographic pneumonia. Additionally, prior meta-analyses investigating the test characteristics of clinical signs and symptoms for the prediction of radiographic pneumonia observed that no single sign or symptom was highly accurate for the identification of radiographic pneumonia, and discussed the impetus for future studies to allow for the assessment of a combination of signs and symptoms to improve the care of children with suspected pneumonia. In this study, by aggregating patient-level data from ten investigations, we observed that by combining certain signs and symptoms, including tachypnoea, oxygen desaturation, and fever, we were able to improve the discriminator ability to identify radiographic pneumonia. The diagnostic performance of a combination of signs and symptoms should be explored in a prospective fashion to allow for a judicious approach to antibiotic treatment in children with suspected pneumonia.

### Utility of early postoperative radiographs after posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis [^114FuWYm]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective.

Objective

Evaluate the ability of serial full-length spine radiographs to detect clinically significant implant-related (IR) and non-implant-related (NIR) radiographical abnormalities in the first 6 months after routine posterior spinal fusion for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).

Summary Of Background Data

Patients with AIS are exposed to repeated doses of ionizing radiation during the course of their treatment with potential consequences for their long-term health. Postoperative algorithms for AIS often involve frequent standing plain radiographs during the first 6 months after surgery to detect IR and NIR abnormalities that may impact a patient's clinical course. However, the actual clinical utility of such repeated spine radiographs has not been studied.

Methods

Retrospective chart and radiographical review was conducted at a single institution for patients with AIS after posterior spinal fusion between 2007 and 2012. Radiographical abnormalities identified on full-length spine radiographs or additional imaging modalities in the first 6 postoperative months were grouped into IR or NIR findings. The findings were considered clinically significant if they resulted in a deviation from an anticipated postoperative course or additional interventions.

Results

For 129 patients, 761 full-length spine radiographs were obtained in the first 6 postoperative months. Eight patients (11 radiographs) had IR or NIR abnormalities, with only 2 of these considered clinically significant. Seven of the remaining 121 were identified to have IR or NIR abnormalities using other imaging modalities, with 2 considered clinically significant. The sensitivity and specificity of a full-length spine radiograph for detecting a clinically significant abnormality was 50% and 95%, respectively.

Conclusion

Routine full-length spine radiographs used with high frequency in the first 6 months after posterior spinal fusion rarely detected a radiographical abnormality that resulted in a meaningful change to a patient's clinical management. Blanket postoperative screening algorithms should be reconsidered to minimize patient radiation exposure.

AABIP guidelines — tumor size threshold for invasive mediastinal staging: The PICO question asks whether a 3 cm cutoff affects the likelihood of occult mediastinal metastasis in patients with peripheral tumors and a radiographically normal hilum and mediastinum. Clinicians should recognize a primary tumor size > 3 cm as a significant risk factor for occult mediastinal metastasis and consider invasive nodal staging in patients with peripheral tumors and a radiographically normal hilum and mediastinum, with the note that this is risk‑stratification guidance and that invasive staging should be individualized based on tumor size and clinical context. Background notes that according to the 2013 ACCP guidelines tumor size is not an independent criterion for invasive staging, while the 2014 European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) guidelines specifically include tumor size > 3 cm as an indication. Supporting evidence cites a meta‑analysis of 4 retrospective cohort studies finding a significantly higher risk of occult mediastinal metastasis with tumor size > 3 cm.

Modern clinical trials provide the evidence for most therapeutic advances, and that evidence, expressed in a statistical format, is used to draw inferences about a population from the study's results. Clinician judgment translates these inferences for best individual patient care, but many clinicians struggle with the statistical interpretation of trial results. This review provides a clinical and non-Bayesian perspective on some key elements in the statistical design, analysis, and interpretation of randomized, comparative, phase III clinical trials intended to demonstrate a better outcome (superiority) than with a control treatment.

Fig. 1
Selected sagittal T1 imaging of the whole spine in an 8-month-old boy with abusive head trauma demonstrates T1 hyperintense subdural haemorrhage within the posterior fossa (white arrow) and the thoracolumbar spinal canal (black arrow). There is no vertebral fracture or other evidence of local spinal or soft tissue injury

Fig. 2
Selected sagittal short tau inversion recovery (STIR) imaging of the whole spine in a 3-month-old boy demonstrates T2 hypointense subdural haemorrhage in the lumbar spinal canal (solid arrow). The spinal canal subdural haemorrhage is not identified in the upper spinal canal and would have been missed had the lower spine not been imaged. There is also evidence of suboccipital spinal ligamentous injury (dashed arrow)

In a scenario whereby there was a positive finding on spinal MRI, such as spinal subdural haemorrhage or spinal ligamentous injury, but the required spinal region had not been imaged and such findings were not documented, there would be several questions to consider:
Did we miss a clinically significant finding which requires active clinical management?
Did we miss a finding that may help establish or refute the diagnosis of abusive head trauma?
What is the overall 'value' of this missed finding (where 'value' can be considered in terms of its clinical, forensic and medicolegal significance)?

Did we miss a clinically significant finding which requires active clinical management?

Apart from a case report in an adult, no significant adverse clinical outcomes of spinal subdural haematomas have been reported. The management of ligamentous injuries of the cervical spine varies across different institutions. In most centres, cervical spine immobilisation and stabilisation by way of collar are utilised if ligamentous injury is detected. Another challenge is to distinguish the clinical impact of these spinal injuries and their potential to mask the overall significant injury to the brain. In most of these cases, we can say that the evidence is still evolving and the clinical impact is probably not certain at this point in time.

### Summary version of the standards, options and recommendations for nonmetastatic breast cancer (updated January 2001) [^114Pyzgf]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS (FIGURE 1 AND FIGURE 2)

Diagnostic work-up of an abnormality in the breast

Clinical examination

Figure 1
Diagnosis–clinically detectable breast abnormality.

Figure 2
diagnosis–impalpable mammographic abnormality.

In patients with locally and regionally advanced disease, clinical examination is likely to be of greater diagnostic value than in patients with less advanced disease (standard). Tumours with the following characteristics are unlikely to be operable, and are associated with a poor short-term prognosis: inflammatory change, deep extension, lymphadenopathy, breast oedema and/or lymphoedema in the upper limbs. These factors also indicate an increased risk of locoregional and metastatic recurrence (standard). Thus, nonoperability is not always due to difficulties associated with the surgery itself. Surgery may still be appropriate, however, to achieve local control, despite a poor prognosis. Imaging can be used to confirm findings from clinical examination. In some cases, clinical examination will be normal, so that the diagnosis will only be possible following imaging (standard).

Diagnostic imaging

A standard bilateral mammogram with two views (front and external oblique), can be complemented by other views and by ultrasonography (standard). The equipment used for mammography should undergo regular quality control (standard). To confirm the diagnosis, additional views and enlargements may be necessary (option).

Specific imaging is not indicated in the examination of lymphadenopathy. Standard reporting of mammograms should be used in which the stated diagnosis is based on the mammographic features suspicious of malignancy using the American College of Radiology classification (recommendation).

The diagnostic findings should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team. When the level of suspicion from imaging justifies histological verification, this should be done using interventional breast diagnostic techniques in an outpatient setting under a local anaesthetic.

Pretreatment diagnosis

The diagnosis of malignancy can be obtained from cytology (fine-needle aspiration) or tissue sample (core biopsy), whereas the diagnosis of an invasive carcinoma can only be made from a biopsy sample (standard).

The histological diagnosis of impalpable lesions should be compared with the diagnostic hypotheses generated from diagnostic imaging (recommendation). The diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ and atypical hyperplasia from a needle biopsy sample should always be reconfirmed using a sample obtained by surgical excision (recommendation, level of evidence: B1). Regular assessment of the diagnostic performance of image-guided biopsy systems is recommended (recommendation, expert agreement).

### Outcome assessment in clinical trials of fracture-healing [^111AQbbq]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2008). Low credibility.

Although there are numerous methods for defining fracture-healing in clinical studies, no consensus exists regarding the most valid and reliable manner for assessing union or for determining which outcomes are most important. This article summarizes and describes methods for the clinical assessment of fracture-healing and reports results from a systematic review of prevalent definitions currently used in published clinical studies. Conventional radiography and ad hoc clinical definitions continue to be the most commonly used means of assessing fracture-healing in clinical studies. Investigators must improve upon and apply more rigorous outcome assessment in clinical trials, emphasize patient-important outcomes, and report factors that may bias estimated effects.

### Is radiographic progression a realistic outcome measure in clinical trials with early inflammatory arthritis? [^114wzVZQ]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Radiographic progression is one of the most important outcome measures in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) clinical trials, because it reflects historic disease activity, is associated with loss of function over time, and can be reliably assessed. Trials involving patients with early inflammatory arthritis (EIA) will differ from those focusing on RA patients in many respects. They include a heterogeneous spectrum of patients, and some of them will have self-limiting arthritis, or arthritis with a low likelihood of ever becoming erosive. Furthermore, because of the early presentation a high proportion of patients with a high likelihood of erosions will still be non-erosive at presentation; and since EIA trials will aim at permanent clinical remission induced by therapy, the signs of progression will be very subtle. Current radiographic scoring methods may not be sensitive to the small changes that are expected to occur in EIA trials. This makes radiographic progression a rather unlikely single primary outcome in such trials. However, "permanent clinical remission" (with or without therapy) appears to be a most realistic outcome in such trials, and radiographic stability (the demonstration of "no progression") may serve as a key criterion in establishing whether the endpoint of permanent clinical remission is actually met. The moment at which the first erosion develops is also important in making the correct diagnosis and has implications for the prognosis. We propose here a number of recommendations for the use of radiographic progression as one of the obligatory outcome measures in clinical trials with EIA.

### Enhancing clinician and patient understanding of radiology reports: a scoping review of international guidelines [^116u8iK7]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Based upon the six English language guidelines we were able to access, most tend to focus on structure of the report and technical information. Three guidelines encourage radiologists to consider the specialty and background of the referring clinician, while two acknowledge that patients may access their reports. Recommendations regarding format and language are inconsistent between guidelines. Only one guideline suggests the inclusion of clinical context, and no guideline recommends inclusion of a lay summary for patients. All guidelines suggest providing recommendations for further testing or treatment where appropriate.

Imaging reports are powerful. Radiologist recommendations in the report influence whether patients are referred for further testing, while report reminders regarding evidence-based practice can result in changes in prescribing and imaging referrals. Despite this, only the RCR and RANZCR guidelines acknowledge that the way the imaging report is presented can impact patient management. The RCR guidelines state 'the purpose of a radiology report is to provide an accurate interpretation of images in a format that will prompt appropriate care for the patient', and the RANZCR guidelines acknowledge the radiology report '… has an important impact on decisions about further investigation and management. Its form and content can be influential in reducing harm to patients… '. With increasing accessibility of sensitive imaging modalities such as CT and MRI, the likelihood of identifying unexpected or incidental anatomical abnormalities has increased. Such incidental findings can be more common than the condition for which the imaging is being performed to detect. While detailed reporting can enable the clinician to match radiological features to the patient's symptoms, with increasing detection of low-risk incidental findings comes a need to ensure imaging reports convey findings in a manner that enables accurate clinical decision-making and minimises potential patient harms from overdetection.

### Current role of conventional radiology in rheumatology [^113M1JEr]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

The correct interpretation of the most common radiological findings in rheumatological diseases can be pivotal for an accurate diagnosis. X rays offer immediacy, worldwide availability, affordability, and the ability to detect subtle bone changes. Numerous scoring systems that have been developed to support clinical practice are based on joint damage that can be observed on X rays. Metabolic, degenerative, infective, and inflammatory processes manifest as distinct alterations in joints and their identification can be challenging. In this review, the authors will discuss the most common radiological findings in hands, hips, and the spine that can serve as valuable diagnostic tools.

### Treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease: an official ATS / ERS / ESCMID / IDSA clinical practice guideline [^111SqYUA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). High credibility.

Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease — diagnostic criteria: The current guideline recommends use of the 2007 clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic criteria to classify patients, with both clinical (pulmonary or systemic symptoms) and radiologic findings (nodular or cavitary opacities on chest radiograph, or a high-resolution computed tomography scan that shows bronchiectasis with multiple small nodules) Both Required. Microbiologic criteria can be satisfied by positive culture results from at least two separate expectorated sputum samples; or positive culture results from at least one bronchial wash or lavage; or transbronchial or other lung biopsy with mycobacterial histologic features (granulomatous inflammation or acid-fast bacilli [AFB]) and positive culture for NTM, or histologic features plus one or more sputum or bronchial washings that are culture positive for NTM. Because isolation may reflect contamination or nonprogressive disease, > 1 positive sputum culture is recommended for diagnostic purposes, and the same NTM species (or subspecies in the case of M. abscessus) should be isolated in ≥ 2 sputum cultures; clinically significant MAC pulmonary disease is unlikely with a single positive sputum culture during the initial evaluation but can be as high as 98% in those with ≥ 2 positive cultures.

Conclusions

We compared the 8 U.S. patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS to SARS-CoV–negative controls who met the clinical and epidemiologic criteria for suspected or probable SARS. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV infection is associated with significant lower respiratory tract disease. Patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS were more likely than controls to have dyspnea, hypoxia, and rales. Patients were also more likely than controls to have an abnormal chest radiograph at the time of first evaluation. These clinical findings are similar to those reported in case series from Asia and Canada, and contrast the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV with most viral respiratory pathogens including other human coronaviruses. When compared to controls with radiographic evidence of pneumonia, patients with SARS were more likely to manifest dyspnea and progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. This radiographic progression to multifocal infiltrates has been a prominent finding in several previous studies and may prove to be a hallmark feature of the later stages of this disease. Among U.S. case-patients, diarrhea and vomiting were also significantly associated with SARS-CoV infection. While gastrointestinal symptoms were a relatively uncommon feature in some previous reports, diarrhea was frequently reported in other case series, including a major community outbreak at a Hong Kong apartment block.

Although previous studies have described the clinical features of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS, none compared the characteristics of these patients with SARS-CoV–negative controls. Our findings suggest that the combination of gastrointestinal symptoms, dyspnea, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates may warrant a higher level of suspicion for SARS-CoV infection. By contrast, patients with findings of only upper respiratory tract infection may be unlikely to have SARS. Although moderate lymphopenia was prominent among U.S. case-patients, it was also a fairly common finding among controls who likely had other viral sources of infection. The small number of persons with laboratory-confirmed SARS in the United States limited our power to identify independent clinical predictors of SARS-CoV infection. Further data are needed to describe the full clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV infection and to clarify when specific clinical findings are most likely to occur during the course of illness.
