## Question

What is medrol dose pack instructions

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Medrol dose pack instructions, including what it is, the standard 6-day taper regimen, administration details, dose adjustments, safety, and when to avoid it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a Medrol dose pack actually contains and its pharmacology. Then, I should verify the exact 6-day taper schedule and whether it varies by indication. Next, I will review administration timing, missed-dose guidance, and whether tapering is needed for short courses. After that, I should consider dose adjustments for special populations and drug interactions. Finally, I will examine adverse effects, contraindications, and situations where a dose pack should be avoided, and close with a concise, practical summary.

> Let me first confirm the product and its contents. A Medrol dose pack is a prepackaged 6-day oral methylprednisolone taper containing 21 tablets of 4 mg each, designed for short anti-inflammatory bursts in select conditions, and it is distinct from the 4 mg to 48 mg daily range used for chronic disease management, which is individualized rather than fixed-dose [^116fjUkQ] [^11632gbF].

> Wait, let me verify the exact 6-day schedule. The standard regimen is Day 1: 24 mg (six 4 mg tablets), Day 2: 20 mg (five tablets), Day 3: 16 mg (four tablets), Day 4: 12 mg (three tablets), Day 5: 8 mg (two tablets), and Day 6: 4 mg (one tablet), for a total of 21 tablets over 6 days. Some clinicians allow the Day 1 dose to be taken all at once or divided through the day, but the total daily dose remains the same [^116fjUkQ].

> Hold on, I should confirm administration timing and missed-dose guidance. Morning administration is preferred to align with diurnal cortisol physiology and minimize HPA axis disruption; if a dose is missed, take it as soon as remembered unless it is close to the next dose, in which case skip it and do not double up, and if multiple tablets are scheduled, they can be taken together or divided through the day as convenient [^115eMZCu] [^116fjUkQ].

> I need to check whether tapering is necessary for a 6-day course. For short courses under about 2 weeks, abrupt cessation is generally acceptable because HPA suppression risk is low; however, if symptoms recur during the taper, some clinicians extend the lowest dose for a few extra days, and for longer courses or repeated bursts, a more gradual taper is prudent to mitigate withdrawal and adrenal suppression risks [^112G8gaC] [^113Pu83V].

> Let me consider dose adjustments and special populations. I initially thought dose reduction might be needed in renal impairment, but wait, I should verify that; the FDA labeling indicates no dose adjustment is required for eGFR 0–90 mL/min/1.73 m², so I should correct that assumption. In hepatic impairment, there is no specific guidance, so caution and clinical monitoring are reasonable. For pediatrics, weight-based systemic steroid regimens are used for asthma and other indications, but the Medrol dose pack is an adult formulation and not designed for pediatric dosing, which should be individualized to 1–2 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent when indicated [^115FnpgM] [^116YZvTa] [^111EEe41].

> Next, I should review safety and adverse effects. Short-course methylprednisolone can cause insomnia, mood changes, dyspepsia, hyperglycemia, fluid retention, and transient blood pressure elevation; rare but serious risks include psychosis, infections, and avascular necrosis, and patients with diabetes, hypertension, or psychiatric history warrant closer monitoring and counseling on what to watch for during the burst [^113o5BXm].

> But wait, what if the indication is one where a dose pack is inappropriate or underdosed. I should double-check condition-specific guidance: for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, guidelines explicitly recommend against methylprednisolone dose packs due to underdosing and delay in care, favoring 1 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent for 10–14 days with a taper. Similarly, for asthma exacerbations, 5–7 days of 40–50 mg prednisone equivalent without taper is standard, and for polymyalgia rheumatica, initial therapy requires 12.5–25 mg prednisone equivalent daily with a slow taper, far exceeding what a 6-day dose pack provides, so a dose pack should not be used for these indications [^115Sbbz7] [^112G8gaC] [^116BYTxr].

> I will now examine scenarios where a dose pack may be reasonable. Short bursts can be considered for brief inflammatory flares such as acute gout, acute bursitis, contact dermatitis, or mild irAEs when a rapid, limited anti-inflammatory effect is desired and the total exposure remains low; however, even in these cases, clinicians should confirm the diagnosis, screen for contraindications, and ensure no need for longer or higher-dose therapy before choosing the pack [^114H3pAn] [^1173ZmLt].

> Let me reconsider the practical counseling points to ensure nothing is missed. Patients should be instructed to take the pills with food to reduce GI upset, avoid alcohol, monitor blood glucose if diabetic, and report infection symptoms promptly; if used repeatedly, cumulative exposure increases HPA suppression risk, so clinicians should document each burst and reassess the need for steroid-sparing strategies or alternative therapy [^111ZsGgx].

> In summary, I should confirm the core message. The Medrol dose pack is a 6-day, 21-tablet methylprednisolone taper: 24 mg on Day 1, 20 mg on Day 2, 16 mg on Day 3, 12 mg on Day 4, 8 mg on Day 5, and 4 mg on Day 6, preferably taken in the morning; no taper is required for a single 6-day course, but avoid use in conditions needing higher or longer glucocorticoid therapy, and monitor for adverse effects and drug interactions throughout the burst [^116fjUkQ] [^112G8gaC] [^115Sbbz7].

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The initial dosage of MEDROL Tablets may vary from 4 mg to 48 mg of methylprednisolone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, MEDROL should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy.

IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of MEDROL for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

Multiple Sclerosis

In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective (4 mg of methylprednisolone is equivalent to 5 mg of prednisolone).

Optimizing the choice of immunosuppressive agents

Current guidelinesrely heavily on the use of steroids for management of irAEs. The duration of steroid use and cumulative dose are usually much greater for management of irAEs compared with other clinical indications for corticosteroid use. However, long-term use of steroids gives rise to several concerns.

Though the recommendation is to continue steroids until resolution of an irAE to grade 1 or better and subsequently taper the dose over a period of 4–6 weeks, efficacy of long-term steroid use in management of irAEs has not been validated. In contrast, when oral methylprednisolone was used as a 5-day tapered dose pack (steroid burst) for mild irAEs, all patients had recurrent grade 2 irAEs. Thus, the optimal dose and duration of steroid use with minimal risk of side effects in the management of irAEs are unknown.
Long-term steroid use may be associated with other complications, such as gastritis, hypertension, new-onset hyperglycemia, and opportunistic infections (eg, pneumocystis pneumonia).

Systemic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — timing and dosing: Spontaneous and steroid-related recovery is greatest in the first 2 weeks, with little benefit after 4 to 6 weeks, and more recent studies encourage treatment within 7 days of onset. For optimal treatment outcomes, the recommended oral prednisone dose is 1 mg/kg/d as a single dose (usual maximum 60 mg daily) for 10 to 14 days; representative regimens include 4 days at the maximum daily dose followed by a 10-mg taper every 2 days, 7 to 10 days at the maximum daily dose followed by a taper over the next week, or 4 weeks at the maximum daily dose followed by a taper. Dose equivalence is prednisone 60 mg = methylprednisolone 48 mg = dexamethasone 10 mg, and methylprednisolone/prednisone dose packs should be avoided for underdosing and delay.

### Solu-medrol (r) methylprednisolone sodium succinat [^112Y6xEA]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

SOLU-MEDROL may be administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection or by intravenous infusion, the preferred method for initial emergency use being intravenous injection. To administer by intravenous (or intramuscular) injection, prepare solution as directed. The desired dose may be administered intravenously over a period of several minutes. If desired, the medication may be administered in diluted solutions by adding Water for Injection or other suitable diluent (see below) to the Act-O-Vial and withdrawing the indicated dose.

To prepare solutions for intravenous infusion, first prepare the solution for injection as directed. This solution may then be added to indicated amounts of 5% dextrose in water, isotonic saline solution, or 5% dextrose in isotonic saline solution.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (3.2 to 48 mg/m2bsa/day).

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.
ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.
In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.

Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (eg, patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (eg, dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the offsteroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be reinstituted.
Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

### Bell's palsy in children (bellPIC): protocol for a multicentre, placebo-controlled randomized trial [^115qmevJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Randomisation

Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment arms: intervention (prednisolone) or matched placebo. An independent statistician has generated a randomization schedule using variable block sizes, stratified by site. This schedule will be used by the central study pharmacist at RCH to undertake the blinding, labelling and distribution of the study drugs to participating sites by putting together study packs of the required drug labelled with sequential study numbers for each site and dosing instructions. Randomization will be undertaken at the site by ED and research staff by selecting the lowest numbered study pack (next pack system) from the study drug store in ED.

Interventions

There is currently little evidence to assist in determining the best prednisolone dose in children. Adult studies of Bell's palsy have used various steroids and doses. The two large adult RCT used 50 mg prednisolone daily for 10 days or 60 mg prednisolone daily for 5 days then weaning over 5 days. The only paediatric RCT of steroid use for Bell's palsy used methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 1.25 mg/kg/day prednisolone) for 10 days, then weaned over 3–5 days. Observational data from the central study site, and unpublished survey data from the PREDICT network indicate that prednisolone is the most frequently used steroid for Bell's palsy in children, usually at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for a variable number of days. Prednisolone is also the most frequently used oral corticosteroid in children in Australia and New Zealand for various other inflammatory conditions, with routine doses of 1–2 mg/kg/day.

Noting the adult dose used by Sullivan et al. (50 mg for 10 days without taper); having sought advice from endocrinologists and rheumatologists; in consideration of the current local guidelines and with consideration to ease of preparation of study drugs, a dose of ~1 mg/kg daily for 10 days without taper was chosen for the current study. For the 10-day study treatment period, participants will therefore be assigned to receive either ~1 mg/kg/day of prednisolone (based on weight categories) up to a maximum of 50 mg/day or to receive matching placebo.

Adverse events from this dose and short duration are expected to be limited to minor behavioral changes and possible weight gain. Drug related adverse events will be recorded. Risks should be reduced by adherence to inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above.

B. Administration for Systemic Effect

The intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of MEDROL®Tablets (methylprednisolone tablets, USP) is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending upon the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient.

In patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.

Following intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks.

If signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dose of the various glucocorticoids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

### Deciding the dose to prescribe [^111JMBtc]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

The dose of a medicine prescribed is so much a part of everyday practice and prescribing guidance that it might appear a surprising subject for a symposium. In reality, however, many questions about choosing doses are unresolved. Here we summarise the talks given at our March 2004 symposium — Deciding the dose to prescribe — incorporating views raised in discussion.

### Pulse steroids: how much is enough? [^1167HuNm]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

High dose pulse intravenous steroids with 1 g of methylprednisolone (MEP) given daily, usually for three days, is an accepted practice to treat severe manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or systemic vasculitides, despite the lack of definitive data. Most studies addressing the efficacy of high dose glucocorticoids (GCs) have been uncontrolled, retrospective or did not compare different doses. A limited number of studies comparing different doses of GCs suggest that lower doses of MEP given as intravenous pulse therapy might be as effective as the very high doses currently used. In addition, while early reports did not find serious adverse effects related to very high doses of steroids, several more recent studies indicate a high risk of serious infections proportional to the current or cumulative dose of GCs. While we await more conclusive studies addressing these questions, one might wonder whether we could be using too much of a good thing.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112G8gaC]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — indications, dosing duration, and precautions: medications include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone tablets, and dexamethasone, given by tablets or suspension or by IM or IV injection; short-term treatment (usually 5–7 days in adults) is important for severe acute exacerbations with main effects seen after 4–6 hours, oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing short-term relapse, tapering is required if OCS are given for more than 2 weeks, and patients should be reviewed after any exacerbation; as a last resort, long-term OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma but serious side-effects are problematic, and such patients should be referred for specialist review if available to have treatment optimized and phenotype assessed.

### Methylprednisolone (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) [^1124pUMs]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone, or methylprednisolone in pediatric patients whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1 mg/kg/day to 2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until the patient achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or until symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

Dosage may be reduced for infants and children but should be governed more by the severity of the condition and response of the patient than by age or size. It should not be less than 0.5 mg per kg every 24 hours.

Dosage must be decreased or discontinued gradually when the drug has been administered for more than a few days. If a period of spontaneous remission occurs in a chronic condition, treatment should be discontinued. Routine laboratory studies, such as urinalysis, two-hour postprandial blood sugar, determination of blood pressure and body weight and a chest X-ray should be made at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Upper GI X-rays are desirable in patients with an ulcer history or significant dyspepsia.

In treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 160 mg of methylprednisolone for a week followed by 64 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS, Neurologic-psychiatric).

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dosage of the various glucocorticoids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

### Prednisolone sodium phosphate (orapred) [^114rhsgp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Orapred ODT are packaged in a blister. Patients should be instructed not to remove the tablet from the blister until just prior to dosing. The blister pack should then be peeled open, and the orally disintegrating tablet placed on the tongue, where tablets may be swallowed whole as any conventional tablet, or allowed to dissolve in the mouth, with or without the assistance of water. Orally disintegrating tablet dosage forms are friable and are not intended to be cut, split, or broken.

Multiple Sclerosis

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective.

Pediatric

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of Orapred may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.14 to 2 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (4 to 60 mg/m2bsa/day).

Nephrotic Syndrome

The standard regimen used to treat nephrotic syndrome in pediatric patients is 60 mg/m2/day given in three divided doses for 4 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of single dose alternate-day therapy at 40 mg/m2/day.

Asthma

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommended dosing for systemic prednisone, prednisolone or methylprednisolone in children whose asthma is uncontrolled by inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators is 1–2 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses.

It is further recommended that short course, or "burst" therapy, be continued until a child achieves a peak expiratory flow rate of 80% of his or her personal best or symptoms resolve. This usually requires 3 to 10 days of treatment, although it can take longer. There is no evidence that tapering the dose after improvement will prevent a relapse.

2.2 Recommended Monitoring

Blood pressure, body weight, routine laboratory studies, including serum potassium and fasting blood glucose, should be obtained at regular intervals during prolonged therapy. Appropriate diagnostic studies should be performed in patients with known or suspected peptic ulcer disease and in patients at risk for reactivation of latent tuberculosis infections.

### Flares in lupus: outcome assessment trial (FLOAT), a comparison between oral methylprednisolone and intramuscular triamcinolone [^115y75cK]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by a relapsing-remitting course. When a mild/moderate flare occurs, treatment with corticosteroids is often instituted. There are 2 methods of acutely giving a boost of steroids: triamcinolone injection or a short-term boost of oral prednisone or methylprednisolone. We investigated whether triamcinolone is superior to oral corticosteroids for mild/moderate flare in patients with lupus.

Methods

In a clinical trial, 50 patients with SLE presenting with a mild or moderate flare [defined using the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus: National Assessment-SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) flare instrument] were randomized to receive oral methylprednisolone with rapid tapering (medrol dose-pack) or triamcinolone 100 mg, given intramuscularly. The patients completed a Likert scale of activity and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 health status questionnaire on the randomization day, and repeated them the next day, 2 days, one week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and one month later.

Results

Complete improvement occurred in 0% at one day, 0% at 2 days, 8.3% at one week, 20.8% at 2 weeks, 20.8% at 3 weeks, and 25% at 4 weeks in the methylprednisolone group versus 4.3% at one day, 4.3% at 2 days, 8.6% at one week, 12.5% at 2 weeks, 30.4% at 3 weeks, and 34.7% at 4 weeks in the triamcinolone group. Improvement in health status by Week 4 occurred in 66.6% of the patients in the methylprednisolone group versus 73.9% in the triamcinolone group.

Conclusion

The triamcinolone and oral methylprednisolone groups did equally well. Triamcinolone may lead to a more rapid response than the oral methylprednisolone (69.5% vs 41.6% with some improvement at day one).

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^111RgahU]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

What is the role of a single dose of oral corticosteroids for those with acute sore throat? Using the GRADE framework according to the BMJ Rapid Recommendation process, an expert panel make a weak recommendation in favour of corticosteroid use. The panel produced these recommendations based on a linked systematic review triggered by a large randomised trial published in April 2017. This trial reported that corticosteroids increased the proportion of patients with complete resolution of pain at 48 hours. Box 1 shows all of the articles and evidence linked in this Rapid Recommendation package. The infographic provides the recommendation together with an overview of the absolute benefits and harms of corticosteroids in the standard GRADE format.

### Fasting with adrenal insufficiency: practical guidance for healthcare professionals managing patients on steroids during ramadan [^111wERyv]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

There are limited recommendations for fasting in many chronic diseases such as adrenal insufficiency (AI). Research in such situations highlights potential for complications and need for education for patients with AI undertaking fasting during Ramadan. This article aimed to provide up-to-date guidance for healthcare professionals to educate, discuss and manage patients with AI who are considering fasting in Ramadan and is religiously compatible. Latest guidance on this topic and the evidence base for steroid dosing are reviewed and discussed. Risk stratification for patients with AI and optimal strategies for management, including steroid dosing, are detailed. Our review highlights that patients with AI wishing to fast should undergo a thorough risk assessment ideally several months before Ramadan. 'High risk' and 'Very high risk' patients should be encouraged to explore alternative options to fasting discussed below. Prior to the commencement of Ramadan, all patients must receive up-to-date education on sick day rules, instructions on when to terminate their fast or abstain from fasting, carry steroid warning information and must have a valid intramuscular (IM) hydrocortisone pack and know how to administer this. Switching patients with AI desiring to fast from multiple daily hydrocortisone replacement to prednisolone 5 mg once daily at dawn (during Suhoor or Sehri) is recommended and discussed. Patients on fludrocortisone for AI should be advised to take their total dose at dawn. We provide practically relevant case-based scenarios to help with the application of this guidance. Future efforts need to focus on healthcare professional awareness and further research in this setting.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — Special considerations and dosing note that "The 2017 SCCM/ESICM guidelines had previously recommended giving methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/d within 14 days of the diagnosis of moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of < 200) (4)". This panel "decided to remove the qualifier based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio from the most recent recommendation". Updated analysis "did not demonstrate a differential effect based on corticosteroid timing or type or dosage", so "a specific recommendation was not made for corticosteroid molecules". Reported dosing "range from 40 mg/d to 2 mg/kg/d of methylprednisolone equivalent with a common duration ranging from 7 to 30 days", and common molecules in RCTs include "Methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone with or without fludrocortisone".

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation comparative effectiveness — initial high-dose intravenous corticosteroids versus low-dose oral corticosteroids — is illustrated across efficacy, effectiveness, and observational designs with explicit eligibility, dosing, timing, and outcomes. Efficacy trial eligibility required Age > 50 yr, 20 pack-years or more smoked, and FEV1 < 50% of predicted. The efficacy oral intervention was initiated within 6 h of presentation with 40 mg/d x 10 d, while the intravenous comparator was initiated within 6 h using methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h x 72 h, then oral prednisone 40 mg x 7 d. The efficacy primary outcome was treatment failure, defined as initiation of mechanical ventilation after the second hospital day, inpatient mortality, or readmission for acute exacerbation of COPD within 30 d of discharge. Effectiveness trial protocols initiated oral corticosteroids within 24 h of hospital admission at 40 mg/d x 10 d and intravenous corticosteroids within 24 h with methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h x 72 h, then oral prednisone 40 mg x 7 d; patient-centered outcomes included return to baseline level of functional health, hospital length of stay, and readmission or death within 30 d. Observational definitions used ICD-9 discharge codes with Age > 50 yr and no exclusions; oral exposure was prednisone via mouth at least 40 mg/d for 2 calendar days within 1 calendar day of hospital admission, and intravenous exposure was methylprednisolone 125 mg intravenously every 6 h for at least 2 calendar days within 1 calendar day of hospital admission.

EULAR/ACR 2015 polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid initiation, dosing, and tapering are specified as follows: The panel conditionally recommends using the minimum effective GC dose within a range of 12.5–25 mg prednisone equivalent daily as the initial treatment of PMR and discourages conditionally the use of initial doses ≤ 7.5 mg while strongly recommending against the use of initial doses > 30 mg/day. The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose tapering schedules and suggests initial tapering to 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks, relapse therapy by increasing to the pre-relapse dose then decreasing gradually within 4–8 weeks, and once remission is achieved tapering daily oral prednisolone by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg alternate days) until discontinuation. The panel conditionally recommends considering intramuscular methylprednisolone as an alternative to oral GCs, noting one clinical trial used a starting dose of 120 mg methylprednisolone i.m. every 3 weeks, and conditionally recommends using a single rather than divided daily doses of oral GCs, with exceptions for special situations such as prominent night pain while tapering GCs.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EEe41]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

Randomization, group allocation, and concealment

The group allocation sequence for the study was generated using a random number generator randomizing patients in a 1:1 fashion in permuted blocks of four.

Study medicine and placebo were packed in identical opaque boxes numbered randomly according to allocation. The prehospital physician and accompanying medical assistant were unblinded after opening a medicine box. The prehospital staff were not involved further in the treatment of the patient or the study following admission. The patient, all hospital personel, and all study investigators and study staff were blinded for treatment allocation.

Study intervention

If eligible for inclusion, patients were randomized to receive a bolus injection of methylprednisolone 250 mg intravenously (2 × 125 mg/2 mL) or placebo (4 mL isotonic NaCl), both administered over 5 min. The dosage was the maximum allowed for methylprednisolone bolus injection in Denmark. The intervention was performed as soon as possible following resuscitation and a minimum of 5 min from ROSC in the prehospital setting. Injection of allocated medicine was completed before hospital arrival, and only allocation number was available at admission.

### Corticosteroids for sore throat: a clinical practice guideline [^115BX2Xn]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Practical issues and other considerations

Figure 2outlines the key practical issues for patients and clinicians discussing adjunct steroids for sore throat, which are also accessible along with the evidence as decision aids to support shared decision-making in MAGICapp. Steroids are typically given as 10 mg dexamethasone (or adapted to weight for children: 0.6 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 10 mg), typically taken as pill or intramuscular injection.

Fig2 Practical issues about use of corticosteroids to treat acute sore throat

The risks may outweigh the benefits when larger cumulative doses of corticosteroids are given to patients who experience multiple episodes of sore throat, either through multiple visits or for patients who self medicate if prescribed more than one pill for their previous episode. To mitigate this issue, clinicians should administer the medication in office if possible or prescribe only one dose per visit.

Costs and resources

The panel focused on the patient perspective rather than that of society when formulating the recommendation. Given the low cost of corticosteroids for treating sore throat, implementation of this recommendation is unlikely to have an important impact on the costs for health funders. The treatment is inexpensive and likely to be offered in the context of a consultation that would have taken place anyway. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether it may increase the proportion of patients visiting a doctor to get a prescription of corticosteroids.

### Standardised nomenclature for glucocorticoid dosages and glucocorticoid treatment regimens: current questions and tentative answers in rheumatology [^116Md2Bg]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

In rheumatology and other medical specialties there is a discrepancy between the widespread use and the imprecise designation of glucocorticoid treatment regimens. Verbal descriptions of glucocorticoid treatment regimens used in various phases of diseases vary between countries and institutions. Given this background, a workshop under the auspices of the EULAR Standing Committee on International Clinical Studies including Therapeutic Trials was held to discuss this issue and to seek a consensus on nomenclature for glucocorticoid treatment. This report summarises the panel's discussion and recognises that answers derived from consensus conferences are not definitive. Nevertheless, recommendations on glucocorticoid treatment are presented that (1) reflect current and best knowledge available and (2) take into account current clinical practice. A question-answer rationale presentation style has been chosen to convey the messages, to summarise the meeting in a readable format, and to avoid dogmatism.

### Prospective, multicenter, randomized, crossover clinical trial comparing the safety and effectiveness of cooled radiofrequency ablation with corticosteroid injection in the management of knee pain from osteoarthritis [^114X8Bkj]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Intra-Articular Steroid Injection

Study subjects randomized to IAS underwent 1 corticosteroid injection in the index knee. Subjects were placed supine, with the index knee prepared in a sterile fashion. A topical anesthesia was accomplished using ethyl chloride spray or local anesthetic. An appropriately sized needle per the investigator's routine practice was placed into the suprapatellar pouch, and a steroid dose equivalent to 40 mg Depo-Medrol (methylprednisolone acetate) was injected into the joint space. Across the study, Depo-Medrol, Kenalog (triamcinolone topical), and betamethasone were used in 70%, 18%, and 12% of treatments, respectively. Subjects were discharged to home with instructions for self-care.

Study Outcomes

The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of subjects whose knee pain was reduced by 50% or greater from baseline at 6 months after treatment. The 11-point NRS captured the amount of index knee pain at all study time points. Secondary end points included (1) change in knee function detected by OKS,(2) subjects' perception of treatment effect as reflected by the Global Perceived Effect (GPE) score, and (3) opioid and nonopioid (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) analgesic use, as measured by subject self-reported average daily dosage used. Assessments of these study end points were made at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months following treatments. Outcome data were captured according to subjects' impressions made during the week preceding data collection at each study visit (baseline to 6 months).

All subjects were evaluated for adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) at each visit. Adverse events were any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the study procedure, regardless of relationship to the device. Serious AEs included events deemed life threatening or resulting in death, requiring inpatient hospitalization or prolonging existing hospitalization, resulting in persistent significant disability or incapacity, or warranting intervention to avoid the aforementioned SAEs.

Neurological Endocrine Ophthalmic Metabolic The following additional reactions have been reported following oral as well as parenteral therapy: Urticaria and other allergic, anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions. The initial dosage of MEDROL Tablets may vary from 4 mg to 48 mg of methylprednisolone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, MEDROL should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.

After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112zPiSU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Glucocorticoids should only be tapered if the underlying disease no longer requires glucocorticoid therapy. In general, glucocorticoid taper can be faster and in larger decrements if the total daily glucocorticoid dose is high (eg, greater than 30 mg of prednisone). As the total daily glucocorticoid dose is approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (greater than equivalent of 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone, see Table 1), the taper should be slower and with smaller decrements (Table 4). In certain patients with glucocorticoid-induced complications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, glucocorticoid-induced psychosis, or herpetic keratitis, a more rapid glucocorticoid taper towards physiologic daily dose equivalent may be required. The pre-test probability of adrenal atrophy and concurrent adrenal insufficiency is high for patients taking long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses; adrenal function testing is unnecessary until a physiologic glucocorticoid dose is achieved.

Table 4.
Suggested tapering regimen depending on glucocorticoid dose

HPA recovery is possible once the glucocorticoid therapy has been tapered to a near-physiologic daily dose (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). At this time, taper or assessment for HPA recovery could be performed unless glucocorticoids at this dose are required for control of the underlying condition (for example transplant, or polymyalgia rheumatica).

It is helpful to consider the likelihood of adrenal insufficiency and the risk of underlying disease flare before planning further tapering. It is also important to consider the underlying comorbidities and evaluate concurrent drugs that could impact glucocorticoid metabolism and overall glucocorticoid exposure. Although lacking systematic evidence, empirically, the patient's previous history of success or failure of glucocorticoid taper may also help design the most effective glucocorticoid taper. Additional factors that may impact the risk of adrenal insufficiency include inter-individual variability of glucocorticoid pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. A study examining oral and intravenous methylprednisolone found that 20% of individuals demonstrated increased clearance of methylprednisolone. In general, older individuals have reduced drug clearance, despite a small sample size in these studies, data suggest a considerable and multifactorial inter-individual variability in what would be considered a physiological glucocorticoid dose.

R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice)

5.4.4 Preoperative corticosteroids

Statement 108. We recommend that prior to elective surgery for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, corticosteroids should be stopped or dose minimised wherever possible to reduce risk of postoperative complications (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 94.6%).

Patients undergoing IBD surgery while on corticosteroids have an increased risk of postoperative infectious complications and anastomotic leaks. There is some evidence that risks are greater for those taking high-dose steroids (40 mg prednisolone or more). A comparison of prednisolone doses greater than 20 mg versus 20 mg or less did not show a significant difference in risk of infections. Use of more than ≥ 15 mg oral corticosteroid in UC patients within 30 days of IPAA surgery, or more than ≥ 20 mg in the setting of proctocolectomy, is associated with increased risk of complications. IBD patients having elective surgery should have their corticosteroids stopped if possible, or brought to as low a dose that can be managed without deterioration.

Statement 109. We recommend that IBD patients who have been on oral corticosteroids for more than 4 weeks prior to surgery should receive an equivalent intravenous dose of hydrocortisone while nil by mouth in the perioperative period (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Patients who are on corticosteroids at the time of their IBD surgery should be given intravenous hydrocortisone in equivalent dosage until they can resume oral prednisolone. Prednisolone 5 mg is equivalent to hydrocortisone 20 mg or methylprednisolone 4 mg. There is no value increasing steroid dosage to cover stress in the perioperative period, as shown in a randomised trial in IBD surgeryand case series. Anaesthetists will generally give a single steroid dose prior to induction (such as dexamethasone 4 mg intravenous or intramuscular) for those taking more than 5 mg prednisolone. Patients who are on physiological corticosteroid replacement because of disorders of the hypothalamic pituitary axis (such as oral hydrocortisone 20 mg mane, 10 mg nocte) should receive supplementary doses in the perioperative period. For patients who have had complete resection of active disease, it is important to avoid inappropriate prolongation of steroids after surgery, and there is virtue in standardised steroid-taper protocols in the postoperative period, dependent on the dose and duration of steroids preoperatively (table 11).

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — definitions and dose thresholds — are specified as follows: physiologic daily dose equivalent is defined as daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production with 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, and 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone, and endogenous cortisol production is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration, while long-term glucocorticoid therapy is glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks duration with glucocorticoid doses greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Exposure thresholds considered to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency include duration of glucocorticoid therapy 3–4 weeks, or greater, and any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalence of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Prednisone and prednisolone are used interchangeably, and doses vary by agent and are defined as physiologic within lower and upper ranges to reflect inter-individual differences.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with RAYOS and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy.

Patients should be warned not to discontinue the use of RAYOS abruptly or without medical supervision, to advise any medical attendants that they are taking it, and to seek medical advice at once should they develop fever or other signs of infection. Patients should be told to take RAYOS exactly as prescribed, follow the instructions on the prescription label, and not stop taking RAYOS without first checking with their healthcare providers, as there may be a need for gradual dose reduction.
Patients should discuss with their physician if they have had recent or ongoing infections or if they have recently received a vaccine.
Persons who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles. Patients should also be advised that if they are exposed, medical advice should be sought without delay.
There are a number of medicines that can interact with RAYOS. Patients should inform their healthcare provider of all the medicines they are taking, including over-the-counter and prescription medicines (such as phenytoin, diuretics, digitalis or digoxin, rifampin, amphotericin B, cyclosporine, insulin or diabetes medicines, ketoconazole, estrogens including birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy, blood thinners such as warfarin, aspirin or other NSAIDs, barbiturates), dietary supplements, and herbal products. If patients are taking any of these drugs, alternate therapy, dosage adjustment, and/or special test may be needed during the treatment.
For missed doses, patients should be told to take the missed dose as soon as they remember. If it is almost time for the next dose, the missed dose should be skipped and the medicine taken at the next regularly schedule time. Patients should not take an extra dose to make up for the missed dose.
Patients should be told to take RAYOS with food. Patients should be advised not to break, divide, or chew RAYOS.
Patients should be advised of common adverse reactions that could occur with RAYOS use to include fluid retention, alteration in glucose tolerance, elevation in blood pressure, behavioral and mood changes, increased appetite and weight gain.
Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^114YTyrW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Tapering of steroids for irAE management — taper length is individualized, but tapering should occur slowly, generally over 4–6 weeks; detailed oral and intravenous (IV) strategies, options for physiologic hydrocortisone when very low doses are reached, and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis testing guidance are provided. Oral tapering is recommended over 4–6 weeks with a reduction in prednisone or prednisolone of 10 mg every 3–7 days until the dose is 10 mg/d, then reduced by 5 mg every 3–7 days; for IV steroids, tapering is recommended over 4 weeks or longer with initial IV methylprednisolone ≥ 1 mg/kg/d converted to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/d at minimum, and longer tapers (> 4–6 weeks) may be required. When ready to drop below 5 mg of prednisone or 0.5 mg of dexamethasone after a longer course with concern for iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, transition to hydrocortisone at physiologic dosing (10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon) is an option; if needed for disease control, a simultaneous slow, low-dose taper can decrease by 1 mg prednisone per week, and HPA axis function can be tested 24 hours after the last oral hydrocortisone with AM cortisol and ACTH, with ACTH stimulation for ambiguous results.

Surgical procedure

Phaco/MP-TSCPC

A peribulbar block was performed by anesthesia with 5 mL of 1% preservative-free lidocaine and 0.375% preservative-free bupivacaine, along with monitored anesthesia care. The patient's operative eye and ocular adnexa were then sterilized with 5% Betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A sterile lid speculum was placed in the operative eye. We then proceeded with standard phacoemulsification. Afterwards, two 90-s applications (one in the inferior quadrant and one in the superior quadrant) of MP-TSCPC were done with a power between 2000–2400 mW at a 31.3% duty cycle using the Generation 1 probe.

Power was titrated based on the need for IOP lowering at the discretion of the surgeon. The 3 and 9 o'clock meridians were avoided. The main wound and the paracentesis wounds were then hydrated and found to be free of any leaks. All patients received an intracameral injection of antibiotics. Unless patients had medical comorbidities (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension) that prevented the use of systemic steroids, patients received 1 g of IV methylprednisolone intraoperatively followed by a 6-day PO methylprednisolone taper (Medrol dose pack). IOP-lowering medications were given on postoperative day 1 at the discretion of the attending surgeon.

Phaco/ECP

A peribulbar block was performed by anesthesia with 5 mL of 1% preservative-free lidocaine and 0.375% preservative-free bupivacaine, along with monitored anesthesia care. The patient's operative eye and ocular adnexa were then sterilized with 5% Betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile ophthalmic fashion. A sterile lid speculum was placed in the operative eye. Following standard phacoemulsification, endocyclophotocoagulation was applied to the ciliary processes through the main wound with a power between 0.14 W and 0.40 W, which was titrated to ciliary body shrinkage. An additional wound was created with a keratome to complete the treatment for a total of 300° to 360°. OVD material was removed with irrigation and aspiration. The corneal incisions were watertight at the end of the procedure. Triamcinolone was injected into the anterior chamber of eye and patients were instructed to resume glaucoma eye drops on the evening following surgery at the surgeon's discretion.

### Patient-reported adverse effects of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone treatment: a prospective web-based multi-center study in multiple sclerosis patients with a relapse [^115KMaap]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system (CNS), in which immune-mediated inflammation and degeneration lead to loss of myelin and axons. In four out of five patients, the disease course is initially characterized by relapses and remissions: relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Most patients fully recover after a relapse, but this can take weeks or months. Treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone shortens the relapse duration and increases the chances of recovery. A European Federation of Neurological Societies task force recommends treatment with intravenous (iv) or oral methylprednisolone in a dose of at least 500 mg daily for 5 days or iv methylprednisolone (IVMP) 1 g daily for 3 days.

Methylprednisolone, like other corticosteroids, is associated with a number of adverse effects (AEs), affecting the skin, skeleton, muscles, eyes, CNS, electrolytes, metabolism, and the endocrine, cardiovascular, immune, and gastrointestinal systems, often in a dose-dependent manner. In the USA in 2004, corticosteroids were the most common specific cause for drug-related AEs, accounting for 10.3% of all drug-related AEs and 141,000 hospital stays. Although most serious AEs are related to the long-term oral use, short-term steroid-induced symptoms are frequent, especially with high-dose treatment needed to treat relapses.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) receive growing attention in drug research. PROs are measurements of any aspect of a patient's health status that comes directly from the patient and can be used to evaluate how a treatment affects patients' functioning and well-being. Studies using PROs to evaluate the AEs of long-term oral corticosteroid treatment showed that patients experience an average of 2.1–2.3 treatment-related symptoms.

Most studies on IVMP treatment in MS did not focus on AEs. Despite their frequent occurrence, the severity of IVMP's AEs is thought to be minor, as they seldom require hospitalization or medical interventions. However, from a patient perspective, this may be questioned, as studies of corticosteroids in general show that they may bother patients and affect the quality of life. In patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura, AEs of corticosteroids were found to be more bothersome from the patients' perspectives than from the doctors' perspectives. Moreover, in MS patients, the distress from CNS-related AEs, like mood change, behavioral change, and sleep disturbance, may add to the burden of MS-related CNS symptoms.

Primary adrenal insufficiency — prevention of adrenal crisis includes patient identification, sick day rules, and emergency hydrocortisone dosing. Provide a steroid emergency card and a medical alert bracelet or necklace stating "Adrenal insufficiency — needs steroids!" Educate on sick day rule 1 to double the routine oral glucocorticoid dose for fever/illness, antibiotics, or small procedures, and sick day rule 2 to inject a glucocorticoid im or iv for severe illness, trauma, persistent vomiting, fasting for procedures, or surgery. For acute management, use 100 mg hydrocortisone iv, im, or sc followed by 200 mg hydrocortisone per continuous iv infusion or repeated boluses every 6 h, and equip patients with an emergency kit with vials of 100 mg hydrocortisone sodium. Written instructions advise to inject 100 mg hydrocortisone immediately iv or im followed by continuous infusion of 200 mg/24 h, and education should be reinforced at least annually, or more frequently if needed.

Systemic corticosteroids for allergic rhinitis — depot injection risks: "While most clinicians will use a short course (5–7 days) of oral corticosteroids for severe or intractable AR, depot parenteral corticosteroids may be viewed as attractive because the duration of action of a single injection is 3 weeks or longer". However, "studies have shown adrenal suppression following a single intramuscular injection of methylprednisolone acetate for AR", and "The suppression is usually maximal at 72 hours but persists for up to 3 weeks". Reviews report "there is no method of delivery, dosage, or duration for which the risk of adrenal suppression can be safely excluded". A Danish registry study found that "a minimum of 1 depot corticosteroid injection for at least 3 consecutive years was associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and diabetes, with the largest risk increase seen within the first 2 years of annual use". Local harms have been noted: "Although rare, local muscle atrophy and fat necrosis has also been described". Given variability in adverse effects, "the clinician is advised to always use the lowest dose of corticosteroids for the shortest period of time".

### Prednisone (predniSONE tablets, USP, 5 mg) [^111ERurU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.
ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.
In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted.
Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

EULAR/ACR 2015 polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) management algorithm — initial therapy, adjuncts, tapering, and risk modifiers: Use the minimum effective dose of an oral glucocorticoid within a dose range of 12.5–25 mg prednisone equivalent daily; a high risk of relapse/prolonged therapy favors a higher dose, while a high risk of GC side effects favors a lower dose. An intramuscular option has been studied: In one randomized controlled trial, 120 mg methylprednisolone intramuscular (i.m.) injection was used every 3 weeks as a starting dose. As an adjunct, Methotrexate (MTX) has been used at doses of 7.5–10 mg/week in clinical trials, and the algorithm advises, Consider MTX if at high risk for side effects/ relapse and/or prolonged therapy. Following improvement, the algorithm specifies Gradual tapering of glucocorticoids and ultimately to Taper prednisone until discontinuation. Baseline factors associated with higher risk of relapse/prolonged therapy include high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (> 40 mm/hour) and peripheral inflammatory arthritis.

### Glucocorticoid dosing and implications for vaccination: evolution of global definitions [^116QnqEG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite widespread adoption of "high-dose" glucocorticoid definitions across international immunisation guidelines (ie, prednisone-equivalent dosing > 20mg/day, or > 2mg/kg/day in children), the rationale remains unclear. Literature searches were performed through academic databases for this narrative review to identify relevant evidence regarding glucocorticoid dosing on vaccine responses and safety. In people receiving prednisone < 7mg/day, vaccine responses are maintained. In people on "high-dose" glucocorticoids (> 20mg/day), antibody titres and seropositivity are reduced, whereas the impact of low- to medium-dose glucocorticoids (7 to 20mg/day) on vaccine efficacy remains inconclusive. Due to inconsistent paediatric dosing regimens, data is insufficient to support a unified "high-dose" glucocorticoid threshold. Non-live vaccines are well tolerated in patients receiving glucocorticoids with rheumatic/inflammatory disorders, but enhanced reactogenicity after live vaccination may occur in those with severe immunodeficiencies. Clinicians should consider individual risk-benefit profiles, rather than following strict dosing thresholds, when curating immunisation programs for patients prescribed glucocorticoids.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^113Eguj6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, the optimal type and dose of glucocorticoids to use during the taper has not been established. There is also a lack of reliable data comparing different strategies and tapering regimens vary widely in clinical practice. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence to switch intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone to hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate to further promote the recovery of the HPA axis. The evidence of the effect of different types and dosages of glucocorticoid taper on the timing of HPA axis recovery and possible symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal remain limited and inconclusive. Consequently, an individualized approach to glucocorticoid taper is possible and necessary.

R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○)

During the initial glucocorticoid tapering, ACTH and cortisol levels remain suppressed. When the dose of glucocorticoid therapy is lowered, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland start to recover, resulting in increased production of ACTH. ACTH increase can promote the recovery of adrenal function leading to an increase and recovery in cortisol. Complete recovery of cortisol production can remain impaired in a minority of patients (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Schematic representation of HPA axis recovery following discontinuation of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy (adapted from: Prete and Bancos 2021).

There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering. Discontinuation of long-term glucocorticoid therapy necessitates a cautious approach due to an increased risk of adrenal insufficiency, though the risk of clinically relevant adrenal crisis is generally low. Although glucocorticoid dose and treatment duration are associated with the development of adrenal insufficiency, predicting the risk of adrenal insufficiency remains challenging. A uniform approach to tapering the glucocorticoid dose has not yet been established and there is a lack of sufficient data on this topic (see Clinical question II). While some authors recommend a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps, others prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated. An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOASST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved.

Glucocorticoid taper strategy and formulation choice — the use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis with adrenocortical function impairment, and HPA axis recovery is impossible with continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids; when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate, and prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements; however, the optimal type and dose for tapering has not been established, evidence remains limited and inconclusive, and an individualized approach to taper is possible and necessary.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Must be administered by a healthcare provider. (2.1)
The dose of FENSOLVI is 45 mg administered by subcutaneous injection once every six months. (2.1)
Monitor response to FENSOLVI with a GnRH agonist stimulation test, basal serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels or serum concentration of sex steroid levels at 1 to 2 months following initiation of therapy and as needed to confirm adequate suppression of pituitary gonadotropins, sex steroids, and progression of secondary sexual characteristics. (2.2)
Measure height every 3 to 6 months and monitor bone age periodically. (2.2)
See Full Prescribing Information for reconstitution and administration instructions. (2.3, 2.4)

2.1 Dosing Information

FENSOLVI must be administered by a healthcare provider.

The dose of FENSOLVI is 45 mg administered by subcutaneous injection once every six months.

Discontinue FENSOLVI treatment at the appropriate age of onset of puberty.

2.2 Monitoring

Monitor response to FENSOLVI with a GnRH agonist stimulation test, basal serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels or serum concentration of sex steroid levels at 1 to 2 months following initiation of therapy and as needed to confirm adequate suppression of pituitary gonadotropins, sex steroids, and progression of secondary sexual characteristics. Measure height (for calculation of growth velocity) every 3 to 6 months and monitor bone age periodically.

Noncompliance with drug regimen or inadequate dosing may lead to gonadotropins and/or sex steroids increasing above prepubertal levels resulting in inadequate control of the pubertal process. If the dose of FENSOLVI is not adequate, switching to an alternative GnRH agonist for the treatment of CPP with the ability for dose adjustment may be necessary.

2.3 Reconstitution Instructions

Use aseptic technique including gloves for reconstitution and administration. Allow the product to reach room temperature before reconstitution to allow for easier administration. Once reconstituted, the concentration is 45 mg/0.375 mL. Administer the product within 30 minutes or discard.

### ACR-ASNR-ASSR-SIR-SNIS practice parameter for the performance of image-guided epidural steroid injection [^111hrQF2]. SIR (2025). High credibility.

Epidural steroid injection — corticosteroid dosing and relative potency: Methylprednisolone acetate is available in 40- and 80-mg/mL doses, and triamcinolone are equivalent with relative strength approximately 5 times that of hydrocortisone; betamethasone combines a short- and long-acting form and has approximately 30 times the strength of hydrocortisone. A minimal effective dose of corticosteroid is recommended to expose the patient to the least adverse effects. In comparative data, a study comparing 40 and 80 mg of methylprednisolone found comparable results with a less adverse profile with the 40-mg dosage, and there was equivalency of 10, 20, and 40 mg of triamcinolone in TFESI for lumbar radicular pain due to a herniated disc such that the 10-mg dose was recommended by the authors.

### Expert consensus: time for a change in the way we advise our patients to use topical corticosteroids [^113LBWjF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical corticosteroids form the mainstay of treatment for many skin conditions. If used appropriately, they are safe and effective, and side-effects are generally uncommon. Current advice to patients to apply topical corticosteroid preparations 'sparingly' or 'thinly' contributes to 'steroid phobia', increasing the risk of poor clinical response and treatment failure. Such cautionary advice also overlooks the fact that the vast majority of patients are prescribed topical corticosteroids of mild potency for which the evidence suggests that the risk of harm is minimal. In the patient's mind, the current advice groups all steroids together regardless of their potential for adverse effects. The advice also tends to reinforce an erroneous concern that the risks from topical corticosteroids may be similar to those from systemic corticosteroids. We propose a change to make the pharmacy labelling of topical corticosteroids more accurately reflect the low risk of harm from corticosteroids of low to moderate potency and the importance of applying sufficient medication to achieve a satisfactory clinical response. This change could provide the focus for updated, evidence-based education for healthcare professionals in prescribing of topical corticosteroids and help in the provision of more appropriate advice to patients. We recommend that patients are informed that treatment should not exceed prescribed quantities, and continuing treatment should be under careful medical supervision. We also recommend that topical corticosteroid products include clear 'fingertip unit' instructions, preferably with images of a 'fingertip unit' and a chart to show the number of units required for specific areas of the body.

Therapeutic lumbar epidural interventions — steroid dosing, endocrine effects, and repeat intervals are detailed as follows: Dosing limits have been advocated of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight of steroid, 210 mg per year in an average person, and a lifetime dose of 420 mg of steroid. In patients receiving corticosteroids for spinal stenosis, 32 patients (20.3%) experienced cortisol reduction at 3 weeks of greater than 50% compared with 10 patients (6.7%) treated with lidocaine only, and those treated with methylprednisolone or triamcinolone had an average 3-week cortisol reduction of 41% and 41.6% from baseline respectively. Hooten et al showed triamcinolone concentrations almost 22 days. In a dose dependent methylprednisolone evaluation, Eighty-six percent of patients who received 80 mg had laboratory confirmed HPA axis suppression one week post injection compared to 53% of those receiving 40 mg, and 20% had continued suppression at 4 weeks post injection. Frequency may be based on injectate type, with potential repeat after a 2 week waiting period, for dexamethasone and betamethasone of 2 to 4 weeks and for methylprednisolone and triamcinolone 4 weeks and 4 to 6 weeks based on the dosage. Randomized controlled trials included over 12,000 patients using local anesthetic alone or steroids with a low dose base test injection ranging from 3 mg to 6 mg and reported no major complications.

Definitions

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, likely affecting the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered as a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses risk for adrenal insufficiency, is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — 3–4 weeks, or greater
Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

Physiologic daily dose equivalent: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability
Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy: Any dose greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent (see above)
Short-term glucocorticoid therapy: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration
Long-term glucocorticoid therapy: Glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks duration with glucocorticoid doses greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)
Glucocorticoid taper: Taper of glucocorticoid therapy dose, initially guided by the management of the underlying disease (= therapeutic taper), and later by the management of glucocorticoid withdrawal and adrenal insufficiency (= endocrine taper)
Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome: Symptoms experienced when lowering glucocorticoid dose within the supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dose range, that are not due to the underlying disease for which the glucocorticoids were initially prescribed for and per definition not due to untreated adrenal insufficiency, as the total glucocorticoid daily dose is still supraphysiologic

Glucocorticoid doses vary based on glucocorticoid agent and are defined as physiologic within the lower and upper ranges to illustrate the inter-individual differences. In the recommendations, prednisone and prednisolone are used interchangeably.

48. The structural formula is represented below: Each MEDROL Tablet for oral administration contains 2 mg, 4 mg, 8 mg, 16 mg or 32 mg of methylprednisolone. The initial dosage of MEDROL Tablets may vary from 4 mg to 48 mg of methylprednisolone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, MEDROL should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage.

Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of MEDROL for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis.

Consider following the following principles of corticosteroid dose tapering:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Initial tapering|- Taper dose to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks|
|Treatment of relapse|- Increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually to the dose at which the relapse occurred|
|Tapering once remission is achieved following initial and relapse therapies|- Taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks until discontinuation, as long as remission is maintained.|

Systemic lupus erythematosus glucocorticoid therapy — in organ- or life-threatening SLE flares, the guideline conditionally recommends pulse methylprednisolone treatment (250–1,000 mg for 1–3 days) followed by oral glucocorticoid taper over high-dose oral glucocorticoid taper without pulse treatment. For stable controlled SLE on prednisone > 5 mg/day, it strongly recommends tapering the prednisone to a dose of ≤ 5 mg daily (and ideally to zero) within 6 months. For sustained remission on prednisone ≤ 5 mg/day, it conditionally recommends a slow taper toward zero, and for those unable to taper prednisone to ≤ 5 mg/day, it conditionally recommends initiating or escalating immunosuppressive therapy.
