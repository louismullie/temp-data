## Question

knee MRI indications

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when knee MRI is indicated versus not indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal first-line imaging principle and the role of history and examination. Then, I should verify the specific indications for MRI in acute trauma. Next, I will examine indications in degenerative disease and osteoarthritis. After that, I need to check special scenarios like OCD, infection, tumor, and pediatric injuries. I will then review postoperative contexts and research or surgical planning uses. Finally, I should quantify overuse and outline a practical decision algorithm with quality-improvement levers, ensuring I double-check areas where MRI is commonly misused or where evidence is limited.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: MRI is not first-line for knee complaints. A thorough history and physical examination followed by weight-bearing radiographs is the standard starting point, and repeating imaging for a known OA flare with typical symptoms is discouraged, so I need to ensure I anchor decisions to this sequence before considering MRI [^116gKEzY] [^116U6LHU] [^1144Bs6U].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in acute trauma. I should verify when MRI is appropriate after the initial workup. If radiographs are normal but there is persistent suspicion for meniscal or ligamentous injury, MRI is appropriate, and in knee dislocations, MRI plus vascular assessment is indicated. In children with acute hemarthrosis or suspected ACL injury, MRI helps confirm diagnosis and detect concomitant meniscal or osteochondral lesions, so I need to keep age-specific pathways in mind [^116gKEzY] [^1116iWUn] [^114pLDv4].

> Wait, let me verify the degenerative disease and OA domain because this is where overuse is common. MRI is not recommended to diagnose or manage OA; weight-bearing radiographs suffice, and MRI rarely changes management in moderate-to-severe OA, so I should avoid MRI in straightforward OA unless there are atypical features or surgical planning needs after specialist consultation; Choosing Wisely and VA/DoD guidelines converge here, and I should double-check that I'm not ordering MRI for "confirmation" of OA that is already radiographically evident [^1144Bs6U] [^116yh22G] [^115QNYmp] [^116sfeRa].

> I need to ensure I articulate the exceptions in degenerative knees. MRI can be considered when symptoms are disproportionate to radiographs, when there are red flags suggesting alternative pathology such as osteonecrosis or infection, or when mechanical symptoms like locking raise concern for a displaced meniscal fragment or loose body; otherwise, routine MRI for degenerative meniscal tears without mechanical symptoms is low-value care, and I should confirm that conservative therapy has been attempted before escalating imaging or intervention [^1144Bs6U] [^116sfeRa] [^116HnEUn].

> Let me consider osteochondritis dissecans carefully. In a patient with a known OCD lesion on radiographs, MRI is an option to characterize stability and detect concomitant injuries; however, I should confirm the nuance that the AAOS downgraded the strength of this recommendation because evidence on incremental diagnostic value is limited, so MRI is reasonable but not mandatory in all cases, and clinical judgment plus radiographs may suffice in many patients [^111nUQWv] [^114HcrR5] [^114kZGMb] [^112pfpAV].

> Next, I should review suspected infection, tumor, or inflammatory arthropathy. When clinical suspicion is high and radiographs are non-diagnostic, MRI can identify effusions, synovitis, bone marrow changes, or soft-tissue abnormalities that guide aspiration, biopsy, or targeted therapy; I need to ensure I'm not substituting MRI for clinical correlation, but rather using it to refine differential diagnoses that alter management [^113NWopa] [^116jD4mB].

> For pediatric patients, I should double-check that MRI is used judiciously. After acute injury with hemarthrosis, obtain radiographs first to exclude fractures, then use MRI to confirm ACL injury and evaluate meniscal or osteochondral lesions. In a locked knee, urgent MRI is warranted to assess for bucket-handle meniscal tears or osteochondral injuries that may require prompt surgery, so timing and clinical urgency matter here [^1116iWUn] [^114pLDv4].

> Now, postoperative contexts require a careful balance. MRI can evaluate meniscal repair or transplant, cartilage repair, and ACL graft complications, but artifacts and post-surgical changes complicate interpretation. I should confirm that MRI is reserved for specific clinical questions after surgery and that the protocol is tailored to the procedure and suspected complication [^116Ceb38] [^114aaxSu] [^113qihzE].

> But wait, what about preoperative planning or research settings. MRI can assist surgical planning for complex ligamentous reconstructions, cartilage restoration, or tumor surgery, and it is central in OA research and DMOAD trials for whole-organ assessment; I need to ensure these are specialist-driven indications rather than routine use in primary care [^111E9duF] [^1166xN5L] [^114eQ8Ca].

> I should quantify overuse to contextualize stewardship. In France, 61% of patients lacked prior radiographs before lower-extremity MRI, and in the U.S., approximately 22–28% of knee MRIs are performed without recent radiographs. In TKA candidates, 7.68% had MRI within a year of surgery, incurring substantial costs, so I need to actively screen for these low-yield scenarios and redirect to radiographs first [^116U6LHU] [^111gLBMh] [^111KbvAw].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm and sanity-check each branch. Start with history, exam, and weight-bearing radiographs. If radiographs are abnormal and explain symptoms, treat accordingly without MRI. If radiographs are normal but suspicion persists for internal derangement, proceed to MRI. If radiographs show advanced OA, avoid MRI unless there are atypical features or surgical planning needs. If there are red flags or mechanical symptoms, consider MRI sooner. If the patient is a child with hemarthrosis or locked knee, prioritize MRI after initial radiographs. If postoperative, tailor MRI to the specific clinical question. And if the request is for routine OA evaluation, decline MRI and reinforce radiographs and conservative care [^116gKEzY] [^1144Bs6U] [^116U6LHU].

> I should confirm quality-improvement levers that actually move the needle. Mandatory appropriateness checklists reduce inappropriate knee MRIs and overall volume, and decision-support tools increase first-line radiograph use. Education for primary care and standardized referral pathways also improve adherence, so embedding these into order entry is a high-yield strategy [^114jJWYt] [^115R5wj1].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic performance claims I'm making. MRI is highly specific but variably sensitive for cartilage lesions depending on sequence, field strength, and lesion grade, and clinical examination can rival MRI for meniscal pathology in experienced hands; thus, I need to avoid overcalling MRI findings that may be incidental, especially in degenerative knees where symptoms often correlate poorly with imaging [^116LCPDt] [^112Du2AM] [^1172c6uL].

> Finally, I need to ensure my bottom line is crisp and actionable. MRI is indicated when radiographs are normal but clinical suspicion for meniscal, ligamentous, or osteochondral injury remains high. MRI is indicated when there are red flags or mechanical symptoms suggesting alternative pathology. MRI is indicated in pediatric acute injuries with hemarthrosis or locked knee. MRI is indicated for postoperative complications. MRI is indicated for surgical planning in complex cases. MRI is not indicated as first-line for knee pain, for routine OA diagnosis or management, or for degenerative meniscal tears without mechanical symptoms, and adherence to these principles reduces waste without compromising care [^116gKEzY] [^1144Bs6U] [^1116iWUn] [^116sfeRa].

Knee MRI is indicated for **internal derangement** (meniscal, ligamentous, or cartilage injury) [^116gKEzY] when radiographs are normal or equivocal and symptoms persist, and for **preoperative planning** in complex or revision cases [^1116neou]. It is also indicated for suspected infection, tumor, or avascular necrosis, and for postoperative evaluation of persistent symptoms or complications [^116Ceb38]. MRI is not first-line for routine osteoarthritis or nontraumatic pain without red flags; **weight-bearing radiographs should precede MRI** [^1144Bs6U] [^116U6LHU]. Use MRI selectively to avoid overuse and unnecessary costs [^115V84kK].

## Indications for knee MRI

### Traumatic injuries

- **Internal derangement**: Suspected meniscal, ligamentous (ACL, PCL, MCL, LCL), or cartilage injuries, especially when radiographs are normal or equivocal and symptoms persist [^116gKEzY] [^111EiTS2].

- **Complex injuries**: Multi-ligamentous injuries, knee dislocations, or suspected associated injuries requiring detailed soft tissue assessment [^116gKEzY].

- **Postoperative evaluation**: Persistent pain, swelling, or instability after surgical intervention, including evaluation of meniscal repairs, ACL reconstructions, or cartilage repair procedures [^116Ceb38].

---

### Non-traumatic conditions

- **Suspected infection or tumor**: Persistent knee pain, swelling, or systemic symptoms suggestive of infection, malignancy, or avascular necrosis [^notfound].

- **Inflammatory arthritis**: Evaluation of synovitis, bone marrow edema, or erosions in suspected inflammatory arthropathies [^113NWopa].

- **Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)**: Characterization of lesion stability and extent, particularly in pediatric or adolescent patients [^117FvjwH].

---

### Preoperative planning

Preoperative planning includes **complex or revision surgeries**, in which detailed assessment of soft tissue structures, cartilage, and bone is required for surgical planning [^115cGE21]. It also includes **cartilage repair procedures**, for which MRI is used to evaluate cartilage defects, subchondral bone, and surrounding soft tissues before intervention [^114aaxSu].

---

## Situations where MRI is not routinely indicated

MRI is not routinely indicated for **routine osteoarthritis (OA)**, in which diagnosis and management are typically based on clinical evaluation and weight-bearing radiographs [^1144Bs6U] [^116HnEUn]. It is also not indicated for **nontraumatic knee pain without red flags**, where initial management should focus on clinical evaluation, physical therapy, and conservative measures [^116HnEUn] [^116yh22G].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Mri indicated?** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Acute trauma with suspected internal derangement | Yes | - Radiographs first <br/> - MRI if symptoms persist or radiographs are inconclusive [^116gKEzY] |
| Chronic knee pain without trauma | No | - Radiographs first <br/> - MRI only if symptoms persist or red flags are present [^1144Bs6U] [^116HnEUn] |
| Suspected infection or tumor | Yes | MRI is indicated for detailed evaluation [^113wt7kS] |
| Postoperative complications | Yes | MRI is indicated for persistent symptoms or complications [^116Ceb38] |
| Routine osteoarthritis evaluation | No | Weight-bearing radiographs are sufficient [^1144Bs6U] [^115V84kK] |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Knee MRI is most appropriate for **traumatic injuries with suspected internal derangement**, **suspected infection or tumor**, and **postoperative complications**. It is not routinely indicated for routine osteoarthritis or nontraumatic knee pain without specific clinical indications. Adherence to clinical guidelines and appropriate use criteria ensures optimal patient care, reduces unnecessary imaging, and minimizes healthcare costs [^114jJWYt] [^115V84kK].

### The role of radiography and MRI for eligibility assessment in DMOAD trials of knee OA [^111E9duF]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Currently, no disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) have been approved. Past clinical trials have failed for several reasons, including the commonly applied definition of eligibility based on radiographic assessment of joint structure. In the context of precision medicine, finding the appropriate patient for a specific treatment approach will be of increasing relevance. Phenotypic stratification by use of imaging at the time of determining eligibility for clinical trials will be paramount and cannot be achieved using radiography alone. Furthermore, identification of joints at high risk of rapid progression of osteoarthritis is needed in order to enable a more efficient DMOAD trial design. In addition, joints at high risk of collapse need to be excluded at screening. The use of MRI might offer advantages over radiography in this context. Technological advances and simplified image assessment address many of the commonly perceived barriers to the application of MRI to assessment of eligibility for DMOAD clinical trials.

### Physician provider type influences utilization and diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging of the knee [^114mYbfn]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee is expensive and is neither needed nor useful for all patients presenting with knee pain. Our objective was to determine the completeness of evaluation prior to ordering magnetic resonance imaging of the knee correlated to the ordering providers' postgraduate medical training and the rate of positive findings on the subsequent magnetic resonance imaging.

Methods

Six hundred consecutive knee magnetic resonance images were reviewed, including 200 consecutive knee magnetic resonance imaging examinations from each of three provider types: orthopaedic surgeons, non-surgical physicians with sports medicine training, and primary care providers. Positive findings on magnetic resonance imaging were recorded as well as a history of present illness, a physical examination, and radiographs made prior to ordering magnetic resonance imaging of the knee. Patient and injury factors were recorded. Differences in patient factors, evaluation before magnetic resonance imaging, and positive findings were examined. A modified Poisson regression approach was used to determine predictors of a proper evaluation before magnetic resonance imaging and positive findings on knee magnetic resonance imaging.

Results

Orthopaedists and non-surgical sports physicians were significantly more likely to document a physical examination, to evaluate radiographs made prior to ordering a magnetic resonance image, and to identify positive findings on the magnetic resonance image (all p < 0.001). In multivariate models, orthopaedists were more likely to document a history of present illness (relative risk, 1.05; p = 0.043). Compared with primary care physicians, a physical examination was more likely to be documented by both non-surgical sports medicine physicians (relative risk, 1.61; p < 0.001) and orthopaedists (relative risk, 1.60; p < 0.001) and positive magnetic resonance imaging findings were more likely to be found by non-surgical sports medicine physicians (relative risk, 1.41; p = 0.012) and by orthopaedists (relative risk, 1.44, p = 0.009). Other independent predictors of a magnetic resonance imaging study with positive findings were the presence of an acute injury by history (relative risk, 2.04; p < 0.001) and younger age (relative risk, 0.99; p = 0.021).

Conclusions

Orthopaedists and non-surgical sports physicians are more likely to perform and to document a complete evaluation prior to ordering a knee magnetic resonance image with a positive finding. More musculoskeletal training may be useful to enable primary care physicians to use magnetic resonance imaging of the knee in a more efficient manner.

Box 1. SMART intervention

Clinical champions (July 2017): local clinical leaders who encouraged colleagues to follow the clinical practice guidelines developed for diagnosing and treating patients aged 50 years and over with degenerative knee disease (e.g. during team meetings about patients).
Education to increase knowledge about the Dutch Choosing Wisely recommendation (July 2017): to increase knowledge of orthopaedic surgeons about the Dutch Choosing Wisely recommendation against the use of low value MRIs and knee arthroscopies for diagnosis and treatment of degenerative knee disease in patients aged 50 years and over, clinical champions were educated about this recommendations and the corresponding literature. Clinical champions subsequently disseminated this information among their colleagues using a power point presentation that was prepared by the research team.
Training to improve skills to manage patient expectations (September 2017)): to improve orthopaedic surgeons' skills to manage expectations regarding the value of MRI and arthroscopy within diagnosis and treatment of degenerative knee disease, orthopaedic surgeons and residents were trained how to explain patients why it is not recommended to perform an MRI or knee arthroscopy for patients with degenerative knee disease. This was done in a meeting in each hospital/private clinic making use of videos of a consultation with a patient with degenerative knee disease. These videos included were developed in collaboration with specialised Dutch orthopaedic surgeons (RJ, RD, EvL), and included scenarios in which an orthopeadic surgeon prescribed an MRI or arthroscopy, but also scenarios in which the orthopaedic surgeons succeeded to explain to the patients that a MRI and/ or arthroscopy were not indicated. These videos were used to initiate a discussion among colleagues.
Feedback of data regarding MRI and arthroscopy use (September 2017, February 2018): data about the total number of patients with degenerative knee disease (including diagnosis code 1801 arthrosis and 1805 meniscus lesion), and the number of patients with degenerative knee disease who received a MRI and/ or arthroscopy was requested from each participating hospital/private clinic from 2016 until 2018. The data were analysed and presented twice to all orthopaedic surgeons in the participating hospitals/private clinics with a specialization in the treatment of knee injuries and to the residents (September 2017 and February 2018). Feedback was presented once by a researcher and once by the clinical champion or by e-mail.
Patient Brochure (January 2018): a patient brochure was developed to provide patients information about degenerative knee complaints, recommended treatments and an explanation why and in which cases MRI's and arthroscopies can be regarded as low value care in diagnosis and treatment of degenerative knee disease. The patient brochure could be used during the consultation or could be given after the consultation to provide information about a stepped care strategy and the risks of an MRI and knee arthroscopy.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^113NWopa]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

X-ray, MRI, CT, Bone Scan

X-ray: According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria, radiographs should be the initial imaging modality utilized for the evaluation of knee pain. Radiographs provide adequate evaluation of the joint space, osteophyte and subchondral cyst formation, displaced or chronic stress fractures, joint effusions, and sclerosis in the subarticular region.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): If radiographs are normal, or demonstrate a joint effusion, the ACR recommends an MRI without intravenous (IV) contrast as the next most appropriate study. MRI accurately demonstrates the soft tissues of the knee, without the use of ionizing radiation, and depicts tendon and ligamentous damage, tears and other abnormalities of the meniscus, the presence of synovitis, the extent of effusions, the presence and/or rupture of a popliteal cyst, the extent of cartilage loss, bone marrow lesions, subchondral insufficiency fractures, tibial stress fractures, and osteonecrosis.
MRI with and without IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or a joint effusion is detected. However, the utilization of IV contrast may be beneficial to help more accurately diagnose such causes of chronic knee pain as infrapatellar bursitis, adhesive capsulitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome ("runner's knee"), pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), and Hoffa's fat pad syndrome.
Computed tomography (CT): While not a first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of knee pain, according to the ACR, under certain circumstances, a CT without IV contrast may be indicated for the evaluation of knee pain, especially in settings where MRI may be contraindicated (ie, in a patient with a non-MRI compatible pacemaker, spinal column stimulator, or deep brain stimulator). CT offers enhanced bony detail and may be useful to confirm a prior osseous injury such as a subtle acute non-displaced fracture or chronic stress fracture. In the setting of chronic knee pain related to patellofemoral syndrome, CT may be helpful in evaluating the patellofemoral anatomy.CT with IV contrast is not usually indicated but may be used to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose bodies.
Bone scan: Bone scan is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with knee pain. Bone scan has low specificity and decreased anatomic resolution when compared to CT or MRI. However, bone scan may help to distinguish between bone and soft-tissue origins for pain.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not often useful as a diagnostic tool for the comprehensive examination of the knee. It may be appropriate to use ultrasound to confirm a suspected effusion or popliteal cyst, and can be utilized to guide in aspiration of synovial fluid which can be evaluated for crystal disease or infection. It also may be utilized to evaluate for synovial pathology, where the use of power Doppler ultrasound can demonstrate increased synovial blood flow that is associated with knee pain. Ultrasound is also useful for following patients with iliotibial (IT) band syndrome and in evaluating medial plicae. Ultrasound can also demonstrate an extrusion of the meniscus (with is suggestive of an underlying meniscal tear) and, on occasion, can detect peripheral meniscus tears, and chondrocalcinosis.

### The use of MRI in evaluating knee pain in patients aged 40 years and older [^1141D3Dd]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The use of MRI is increasing when evaluating patients with knee pain because it is highly sensitive for detecting intra-articular pathology. However, such changes can be associated with degenerative joint disease, which may be demonstrated with weight-bearing radiographs. The purpose of this study was to determine how often MRI was obtained before orthopaedic referral in patients aged ≥ 40 years with knee pain, how often weight-bearing radiographs were obtained before MRI, and whether such imaging influenced treatment recommendations.

Methods

In a study of 599 new patients, participating physicians documented the presence of a prereferral MRI and/or plain radiographic studies, the results of weight-bearing radiographs, treatment recommendations, and the impact of any prereferral imaging.

Results

Prereferral use of MRI occurred in 130 patients (22%). Of these patients, plain radiographic studies were obtained for 58% before MRI and 13% had weight-bearing radiographs. Ultimately, 17% had weight-bearing radiographs that demonstrated > 50% loss of joint space. Forty-eight percent of prereferral MRIs did not contribute to treatment recommendations. In patients with > 50% loss of joint space, MRI was considered unnecessary in 95% of the cases.

Discussion

Many prereferral MRIs do not contribute to clinical decision making. Weight-bearing radiographs can help identify those patients in whom MRI is unlikely to be helpful.

Level Of Evidence

Level III.

### 2018 international olympic committee consensus statement on prevention, diagnosis and management of paediatric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries [^1116iWUn]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Section 2: diagnosis, clinical tests and imaging

This section addresses the fundamental clinical question: how does the clinician diagnose ACL injury in the child? High-quality injury prevention programs are the first-line defence against the potential negative short- and long-term consequences of ACL injury. However, if injury prevention efforts fail, timely and accurate diagnosis is important, since diagnosis is the starting point for effective management planning and shared decision-making. The clinician combines information from the patient's history, examination and clinical tests, and imaging to build the clinical picture that will inform diagnosis and treatment. Typically, a thorough history and clinical examination will enable the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis.

Clinical pearl 1 Haemarthrosis (acute swelling in the knee within 24 h after a trauma due to intra-articular bleeding) following acute knee injury is an important clue suggesting structural knee injury.

Clinical pearl 2 Diagnosis can be more challenging than in adults because children may be poor historians, they may have greater physiologic joint laxity (be sure to examine both knees), and MRI interpretation is more difficult given developmental variants in children.

Clinical pearl 3 Due to the immature skeleton, children may sustain different knee injuries (e.g. sleeve fracture of the patella, epiphysiolysis) than adults.

Consider starting the assessment by ordering plain knee radiographs for all paediatric patients with a haemarthrosis/suspected acute knee injury. This is because tibial eminence fractures and an ACL tear can present with a similar history and physical examination findings. It is also important to rule out other paediatric fractures (e.g. epiphyseal fracture, sleeve fracture of the patella). Perform an MRI to confirm the diagnosis of ACL injury and evaluate other soft tissue structures. In children with an ACL injury, MRI may yield additional information to identify meniscal tears, other ligament injury, or osteochondral injury. In children with a locked knee, an acute MRI is warranted to assess the presence of a displaced bucket-handle meniscal tear or an osteochondral injury that may need prompt surgical treatment.

### Knee pain and mobility impairments: meniscal and articular cartilage lesions revision 2018 [^116rzN67]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Medium credibility.

Meniscal and articular cartilage lesions — clinical examination and MRI use — state that Clinical examination by well-trained clinicians appears to be as accurate as MRI in regard to the diagnosis of meniscal lesions. A lower threshold of suspicion of a meniscal tear is warranted in middle-aged and elderly patients. Magnetic resonance imaging may be reserved for more complicated or confusing cases and may assist an orthopaedic surgeon in preoperative planning and prognosis. Imaging may be used to monitor the status of meniscus repair or articular cartilage repair or restoration procedures.

### Survey of inappropriate use of magnetic resonance imaging [^1115SK8h]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Altogether 11,836 MRI examinations were performed at the Department of Diagnostic Radiology of Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland, in 2007. We analysed 150 common MRI examinations: MRI of the upper abdomen or liver (30), lumbar spine referred from the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) (30), knee (30), head (30) and head of children performed under anaesthesia (30). As lower back pain complaints are common and MRI of the lumbar spine is often requested by PMR, we decided to survey that subgroup. We also chose the group of MRI of the head of children done under anaesthesia because there should be good indications for the examination as anaesthesia carries its own risks. Examinations of these groups were extracted from the electronic patient files of our hospital consecutively from the beginning of the year 2007. The evaluation of this study was done in 2009.

Referrals, indications of the examinations, and corresponding patient files were analysed by a senior radiology specialist. Using this information and the referral criteria for imaging recommended by the European Commission (EC), it was decided whether the examination had been indicated. After this, appropriateness of all the MRIs was evaluated by another radiologist trained in neuroradiology (MRIs of the head), abdominal radiology (MRIs of the upper abdomen or the liver) or musculoskeletal radiology (MRIs of the knee or the lumbar spine) by using the data collected. If necessary, consensus was used.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee — states that in a patient with a known OCD lesion on x-ray, an MRI of the knee is an option to characterize the OCD lesion or when concomitant knee pathology is suspected such as meniscal pathology, ACL injury, or articular cartilage injury. Strength of Recommendation: High.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in the year prior to total knee arthroplasty: a potential overutilization of healthcare resources [^111KbvAw]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a common procedure for late-stage degenerative changes, a situation for which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically not considered useful. In an era attempting to contain healthcare expenditures, the rate, timing, and predictors for MRI before TKA were assessed in a large, national, administrative data set.

Methods

The 2010 to Q3 2020 MKnee PearlDiver data set was used to identify patients undergoing TKA for osteoarthritis. Those with lower extremity MRI for knee indications within 1 year before TKA were then defined. Patient age, sex, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, region in the country, and insurance plan were characterized. Predictors of having had an MRI were assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. The costs and timing of the obtained MRIs were also assessed.

Results

Of 731,066 TKAs, MRI was obtained within 1 year prior for 56,180 (7.68%) with 28,963 (51.9%) within the 3 months of TKA. Independent predictors of having had an MRI included younger age (odds ratio [OR], 0.74 per decade increase), female sex (OR, 1.10), higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index (OR, 1.15), region of the country (relative to South, Northeast OR, 1.08, West OR, 1.22, Midwest OR, 1.36), and insurance (relative to Medicare, Medicaid OR, 1.36 and Commercial OR, 1.35) with P < 0.0001 for each. The total cost of MRIs among patients who received a TKA is $44,686,308.

Conclusion

Noting that TKA is typically done for advanced degenerative changes, MRI should rarely be indicated in the preoperative period for this procedure. Nonetheless, this study found that MRI was done within the year before TKA for 7.68% of the study cohort. In an era striving for evidence-based medicine, the almost $45 million dollars spent on MRI in the year before TKA may represent overutilization.

### Lower extremity MRI: are their requests always appropriate in France? [^111yCxgN]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, this descriptive study did not have the objective to analyze the determining factors of inappropriate MRI. Analyzing whether specific age groups, genders, or other demographic factors are more likely to receive inappropriate MRIs could inform targeted educational or policy interventions. In the same way, analyzing the appropriateness rate of MRIs according to different categories of physicians could inform which physician to target. It can be noted that the physician requesting the MRI is the GP for 70.5% of the patients in our study. Although this proportion may be overestimated, we can assume that the GP is the requesting physician in at least half the cases, since in the 3 months prior to the index MRI, half the patients (52.2%) had at least one consultation with a GP, with no consultation with another medical specialty. Pending analysis of the key factors of inappropriate requests for lower extremity MRI, one of the first targets for intervention could be the GP.

Finally, it was not possible to analyze imaging practices in specific cases of knee pain. In fact, in the SNDS, only X-ray and orthopedic procedures are specific to the knee; the other imaging and outpatient procedures studied here do not allow us to distinguish the precise location of the lower extremities. We found no French data in the literature on the proportion of knee MRI among lower extremity MRI. We have performed a request on a single French hospital database and found that knee MRI represented 59% of lower extremity MRI. Nevertheless, this data does not represent the MRI practices at the national level. However, according to clinicians' feedback on their practice, lower extremity MRI mainly concerns the knee. Subsequently, even if these results need to be tempered by the available data, they encourage us to disseminate the messages on the appropriateness of imaging in cases of knee pain published by HAS and G4 in 2022 to physicians requesting MRI (GPs in particular), but also to radiologists. We hope that the results of this study will contribute to a change in imaging practices, especially in case of knee pain. It would be interesting to evaluate these changes in a few years' time.

### Reduction in inappropriate MRI knee studies after implementation of an appropriateness checklist: experience at a tertiary care centre [^114jJWYt]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate reduction in inappropriate knee MRI requests following implementation of a mandatory knee MRI appropriateness checklist.

Methods

A retrospective review was performed at a single tertiary care centre. A knee MRI appropriateness checklist was developed based on the ACR Appropriateness Criteria and adherence from referring physicians was mandatory. Reports from 200 consecutive knee MRI studies one year prior to implementation were compared to 200 consecutive knee MRI studies following implementation. The presence of moderate or greater osteoarthritis on MRI reports was used as a marker for inappropriate knee MRIs. Patient demographics, wait times, number of knee MRIs, and number of all MRIs at our centre over a six month period post-intervention and pre-intervention were recorded. Differences between pre-intervention and post-intervention presence of moderate or greater osteoarthritis, patient demographics, wait times, and number of MRIs analyzed.

Results

A significant decrease was found in moderate or greater grade osteoarthritis following intervention, decreasing from 36.5% to 20.5% (73 studies versus 41 studies, p = 0.023). Of these, the most profound decrease occurred in studies with severe osteoarthritis, with an 80% decrease (35 studies versus 7 studies, p < 0.001). Post intervention, 48% fewer knee MRIs were performed in the same time interval (652 studies pre-intervention versus 336 studies post intervention, p < 0.001). No significant differences were found in the patient demographics.

Conclusion

Mandatory knee MRI appropriateness checklists are associated with a significant reduction in the number of inappropriate studies performed. Follow up studies will be required to assess long-term impact in a larger population.

### MRI protocols for whole-organ assessment of the knee in osteoarthritis [^111gT1yY]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2006). Low credibility.

One of the critical challenges in developing structure-modifying therapies for arthritis, especially osteoarthritis (OA), is measuring changes in progression of joint destruction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers considerable promise in this regard. Not only can MRI quantify articular cartilage volume and morphology with high precision and accuracy, but it can also examine several other important articular components, and thus offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the knee and other joints as whole organs. On December 5 and 6, 2002, OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials) and OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International), with support from various pharmaceutical companies listed at the beginning of this supplement, held a Workshop for Consensus on Osteoarthritis Imaging in Bethesda, MD. The aim of the Workshop was to provide a state-of-the-art review of imaging outcome measures for OA of the knee to help guide scientists and pharmaceutical companies who want to use MRI in multi-site studies of OA. Applications of MRI were initially reviewed by a multidisciplinary, international panel of expert scientists and physicians from academia, the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies. The findings of the panel were then presented to a wider group of participants for open discussion. The following report summarizes the results of these discussions with respect to MRI acquisition techniques for whole-organ assessment of the knee in OA. The discussion reviews the selection and qualification of imaging sites for clinical trials, designing imaging protocols for whole-organ assessment of OA, and key considerations in image quality (IQ) control and data management.

### Failed knee replacement: incorrect indication? [^117Cspea]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 52-year-old woman sustained a direct soft tissue injury to the right knee following a fall onto the right knee. X-rays did not identify any bony injury. Physiotherapy decreased pain but instability persisted. MRI scans identified early degeneration. An orthopaedic opinion recommended total knee replacement. Following a total knee replacement, the pain has worsened and she remains functionally impaired 2 years following the surgical intervention. Knee replacements are commonly performed successful surgical interventions. The increased numbers of replacements might be due to the lowered threshold in recommending surgical intervention by health professionals. This may increase the failure rate. It also raises the question whether adequate non-operative measures were attempted?

### Preferences and beliefs of Dutch orthopaedic surgeons and patients reduce the implementation of "Choosing wisely" recommendations in degenerative knee disease [^112poATm]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately, 25% of patients aged 50 years and over experience knee symptoms from degenerative knee disease. These patients suffer from pain during walking, climbing stairs and squatting, and have functional loss. In some cases, knee range of motion is limited due to a meniscal tear, also known as locking symptoms. These degenerative meniscal tears could be symptoms of early stage osteoarthritis.

For diagnosing patients with degenerative knee disease, clinical practice guidelines and literature recommend weight-bearing radiographs (fixed flexion view — Rosenberg view) to determine the presence and severity of degenerative knee disease and to exclude other causes of knee pain, such as osteonecrosis of the femoral condyle or tibial plateau. Although MRI has high sensitivity and specificity in detecting meniscal tears in older patients, routine use of MRI is not recommended for diagnosis because of the poor correlation with patient symptoms. Similarly, clinical practice guidelines do not recommend the use of arthroscopic surgery as there is no benefit shown of arthroscopic surgery over non-surgical treatments such as exercise therapy, analgesic medication and dietary advice. If locking symptoms are present, or if pain is not reduced after non-surgical treatments, arthroscopy may be warranted. So, MRI and arthroscopic surgery without prior conservative management in degenerative knee disease can be considered as unnecessary or low value care as these provide no benefit for the patient, waste resources and may even cause harm to the patient.

### Imaging of sports-related knee injuries [^113GNXP9]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

This article reviewed the major sports medicine conditions affecting the knee and their MR imaging appearance. MR imaging of the knee is considered efficacious especially in the setting of indeterminate clinical findings and can stratify patients, guiding further surgical management. MR imaging affects the diagnosis and management of acute knee injury by improving clinician diagnostic certainty, assisting in management decisions, and decreasing the number of arthroscopic procedures. From a societal perspective, knee MR imaging can be considered a cost-effective modality when compared with diagnostic and borderline therapeutic arthroscopies (e.g., debridement alone). For these and other reasons, knee MR imaging has shown a substantially increased use for the evaluation of sports medicine conditions.

### MRI for the evaluation of knee pain: comparison of ordering practices of primary care physicians and orthopaedic surgeons [^112Jarjw]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Knee pain is one of the most common reasons for outpatient visits in the U.S. The great majority of such cases can be effectively evaluated through physical examination and judicious use of radiography. Despite this, an increasing number of magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the knee are being ordered for patients with incomplete work-ups or for inappropriate indications. We hypothesized that MRIs ordered by orthopaedic providers were more likely to result in changes in diagnoses and/or plans for care than those ordered by non-orthopaedic providers.

Methods

We reviewed the charts of all consecutive new patients seen at our orthopaedic outpatient office between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2011, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for meniscal or unspecific sprains and strains of the knee. A total of 1592 patients met our inclusion criteria and were divided into two groups: those initially evaluated and referred by their primary care physician (PCP) (n = 747) and those initially evaluated by one of our staff orthopaedic surgeons (n = 845).

Results

MRI-ordering rates were nearly identical between orthopaedic surgeons and PCPs (25.0% versus 24.8%; p = 0.945). MRIs ordered by orthopaedic surgeons, however, resulted in significantly more arthroscopic interventions than those ordered by PCPs (41.2% versus 31.4%; p = 0.042). Orthopaedic surgeons ordered MRIs for patients who were more likely to benefit from arthroscopic intervention, including patients who were younger (mean age, 45.1 years versus 56.5 years for those with PCP-ordered MRIs; p < 0.001), patients with acute symptoms (39.3% versus 22.2%; p < 0.001), and patients with a history of trauma (49.3% versus 36.2%; p = 0.019). Finally, orthopaedic surgeons were less likely than PCPs to order MRIs for patients with substantial osteoarthritis who subsequently underwent total knee arthroplasty (4.3% versus 9.2%; p = 0.048).

Conclusions

MRI utilization by orthopaedic surgeons results in more appropriate interventions for patients with symptoms and findings most amenable to surgical intervention.

### Prevalence of knee osteoarthritis features on magnetic resonance imaging in asymptomatic uninjured adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1172c6uL]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

MRI is the most reliable non-invasive diagnostic technique to assess internal derangement of the knee joint. Increasing MRI availability has resulted in a rapid rise in its utilisation to help inform clinical management of patients with knee symptoms. Over $14 billion is spent on diagnostic imaging in the USA annually, yet the overall clinical benefit of the current use of knee MRI is uncertain. Findings such as meniscal tears, cartilage defects, bone marrow lesions (BMLs), osteophytes and other features suggestive of knee osteoarthritis (OA) are often interpreted as causes of pain and symptoms, triggering medical and surgical interventions. However, the relationship between MRI features of OA and knee pain is imprecise.

In patients with knee OA, there is moderate evidence that MRI-assessed BMLs and effusion/synovitis are associated with knee pain, but conflicting or limited evidence for other MRI findings. Features associated with OA have also been observed on MRI in asymptomatic uninjured knees, suggesting that MRI-assessed OA features may not necessarily be the source of pain in symptomatic patients. However, estimates of the prevalence of MRI features of OA in asymptomatic uninjured knees vary across studies, from 0% to 75%. Given the large number of adults undergoing MRI to investigate the cause of knee symptoms, a reliable estimate of the prevalence of MRI features of OA in asymptomatic uninjured knees is important to inform efforts to diagnose and treat knee symptoms across the lifespan. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the prevalence of, and factors contributing to, MRI features of OA in asymptomatic uninjured knees.

### Lower extremity MRI: are their requests always appropriate in France? [^116U6LHU]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) today enables diagnostic evaluation for many clinical indications, including lesion detection, characterization, functional assessment, and response to treatment. The main advantages of MRI are that it is non-irradiating and non-invasive. However access to MRI can take a long time in France: a study commissioned by the National Union of the Medical Technology Industry (Syndicat national de l'industrie des technologies médicales) showed that in 2018, the estimated waiting time for an MRI scan in oncology was 32.3 days.

According to international guidelines, lower extremity MRI is not a first-line imaging: its request should be discussed after the X-rays have been performed. As lower extremity MRI mainly concerns the knee, according to clinicians' feedback in France, the National Authority for Health (Haute Autorité de Santé [HAS]) and the National Professional Council for Radiology and Medical Imaging (G4) published two guidelines in 2022 on the relevant imaging in cases of non-traumatic knee pain or after knee trauma in adults. In the case of non-traumatic knee pain, the main recommendations are:
carry out a thorough history and clinical examination before any knee imaging;
knee X-rays are the first-line imaging procedure;
MRI should not be performed as a first-line imaging procedure;
imaging should not be repeated in the event of a new episode of knee pain in a patient with a known pathology (e.g. osteoarthritis) and usual symptomatology.

A review of the practice showed a steady increase in the use of lower extremity MRI in France. According to the analysis of patient care 3 months before and after the request for a lower extremity MRI by a general practitioner (GP) in the first half of 2012, MRI was not always relevant. In fact, this study showed that 61% of patients did not have a prior X-ray (recommended before MRI), and 6% underwent a repeat MRI examination.

The main objective of our observational study is to establish an up-to-date overview of lower extremity MRI practices almost ten years after this study, with a secondary focus on the knee.

### Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging in children-how and why? A systematic review [^111RqBrP]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our results show that whole-body MRI is commonly used in many institutions, particularly to assess chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis, lymphoma and malignancy/metastasis. However, the body area covered, the sequences used and the technical details vary significantly. More importantly, only a few studies address the validity of MRI findings.

We found that the term "whole-body MRI" is used interchangeably for examinations covering from two-thirds to the whole body. For instance, whole-body MRI performed for staging of malignant disease sometimes covers skull-base to mid-thigh only, similar to what is often being used for PET-CT. According to some authors, important additional clinical information, like therapy-related osteonecrosis of the knees/ankles or distant metastases in the extremities could be missed due to this limited FOV, hence a clear definition of what should be covered in the scan must be defined when recommending whole-body MRI for specific diseases. To standardize the nomenclature, we agree with Greer et al. in defining whole-body MRI as a "multiregional contiguous imaging of the entire body" and arguing that the term "whole-body MRI" should be reserved for "head-to-feet or vertex-to-heel imaging unless otherwise specified". Moreover, Greer et al. states that "where smaller FOV is sufficient, whole-body MRI can be truncated and should be annotated accordingly".

### Imaging of osteoarthritis of the knee [^112t195h]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis is rising in prevalence, and more imaging studies are being requested to evaluate these patients. Although conventional radiographs of the knee are the most widely requested and available studies, other imaging modalities such as MRI, CT, and ultrasound may also be used. This article reviews commonly used imaging modalities, advantages and limitations of each, and their clinical applicability in diagnosing and monitoring knee osteoarthritis. New and advanced imaging techniques are also discussed as possible methods of early diagnosis and improved understanding of osteoarthritis pathophysiology.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^116yh22G]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

VA/DoD osteoarthritis guideline — Appendix D 2014 recommendations for non-surgical management state the following: Clinicians should conduct a history and physical examination for all patients, with an emphasis on the musculoskeletal examination. Clinicians may use plain radiography to confirm the clinical diagnosis of hip and knee osteoarthritis. Clinicians should not use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an evaluative tool to diagnose, confirm, or manage the treatment of osteoarthritis. Clinicians should avoid routine use of laboratory examinations or synovial fluid analysis to diagnose osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee. The decision to prescribe any intervention should be based on consideration of assessment findings, risk vs. benefit analysis, pain severity, functional status, patient preference, and resource utilization. For patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee, clinicians should attempt the core non-surgical therapies prior to referral to surgery. For patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and/or knee, clinicians should refer for physical therapist services early on, as part of a comprehensive management plan. Clinicians should refer overweight or obese patients (defined by a BMI > 25 kg/m²) with osteoarthritis of the knee to a weight management program to lose a minimum of five percent body weight and maintain this new level of weight.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaChronic knee Pain [^114moX4L]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic knee pain is a condition that is frequently encountered. Imaging often plays an important role in narrowing down the potential causes and determining the most effective next steps. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria for Chronic Knee Pain provides clinicians with the best practices for ordering imaging examinations. The following narrative and accompanying tables should serve as useful guides to any clinician. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Performing a knee arthroscopy among patients with degenerative knee disease: one-third is potentially low value care [^113mf1NW]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

The Medical Ethical Committee (CME P16.190/NV/nv) of the Leiden University Medical Center waived the need for ethical approval under Dutch law for this retrospective study using administrative data and medical record review in 13 Dutch orthopedic centers (hospitals and private clinics). The data used were collected as part of the baseline measurement of the 'SMART (Step-down MRI's and ARThroscopies) study', an intervention study that aimed to reduce the use of low value MRI and arthroscopies for patients with degenerative knee disease.

Administrative data were collected and all patients aged 50 years and over with knee complaints (surgical Diagnosis Treatment Codes (DTC) 1801–1899), treated in 2016 in one of the 13 Dutch orthopedic centers, were selected. Collected data included: a unique anonymized patient ID, Diagnosis Treatment Code, type of care trajectory (initial or follow-up treatment), performed arthroscopy (yes/no), age at the start of the care trajectory. An initial care trajectory starts when a patient first visits a hospital for knee complaints. A follow-up trajectory can be opened after the initial trajectory when the patient still suffers from the same complaints. The maximum duration of an initial and follow-up trajectory is 120 days.

Each orthopedic center kept a data file which linked the unique anonymized patient IDs to the actual local patient numbers, which was not accessible for the researchers. Subsequently, the researchers randomly selected a sample of 50 patients who underwent a knee arthroscopy in each orthopedic center for retrospective chart review, and each orthopedic center looked up the patient charts matching the anonymized ID. All participating orthopedic centers gave permission and if required by hospital regulations, individual patients' permission was asked for reviewing their medical record. From the medical records, the surgical indications for knee arthroscopy (recorded on a date preceding the knee arthroscopy) were retrieved for each patient. Based on the Dutch knee arthroscopy guideline and expert opinion from an orthopedic surgeon specialized in knee problems, an arthroscopy was coded as performed for a valid or invalid surgical indication (Table 1). An arthroscopy performed without a valid indication was considered as potentially low value care. The valid indications in the category "other symptoms" were all reviewed by an orthopedic surgeon specialized in knee problems (RD) and considered as being potentially performed for a valid indication (based on the information reported in the medical record).

### Imaging in osteoarthritis [^112HdhXx]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Conventional radiography is still the first and most important imaging examination in a clinical setting when evaluating a patient with a known or suspected diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA). In research and clinical trials, it still is a valuable tool for stratifying patients who have OA into different categories for inclusion criteria and eligibility. MRI has become crucial in understanding the natural history of the disease and in guiding future therapies because of its ability to image the knee as a whole organ and to assess cartilage morphology and composition directly and in a three-dimensional manner. The other modalities discussed in this article are valuable additional techniques indicated on a case-by-case basis.

### What, if any, are the indications for arthroscopic debridement of the osteoarthritic knee? [^116d63zC]. Arthroscopy (2006). Low credibility.

Arthroscopic debridement is a reliable and effective treatment for knee arthritis in appropriately selected patients. Debridement may include lavage, loose body removal, partial meniscectomy, and/or chondroplasty. Patient selection criteria include acute effusion, well localized joint line tenderness, or catching or locking, often associated with a specific mechanism of injury, patients with imaging studies confirming loose bodies, patients with earlier stages of degenerative joint disease, and patients with realistic understanding that the goal of arthroscopy is to diminish pain and improve function and not to cure their arthritis. Surgeons are cautioned, in patients with an osteoarthritic knee, MRI may be overly sensitive and inadequately specific with regard to correlation between pathologic findings (with the exception of loose bodies) and predictably treatable disease. In conclusion, the authors cite the Arthroscopy Association of North America Position Statement on Osteoarthritis: "There is… sub-group of patients with knee arthritis that can be significantly helped with appropriate arthroscopic surgery".

Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the most commonly performed joint replacement procedure in the United States and annual demand for primary TKA is expected to grow by 673% by 2030. The first part provides an overview of imaging modalities (radiographs, CT, MRI, ultrasound, and various nuclear medicine studies) and discusses their usefulness in the imaging evaluation of TKA. The second part focuses on evidence-based imaging and imaging-guided intervention algorithms for the workup of TKA and its complications, including routine follow-up, component wear, periprosthetic infection, aseptic loosening, granulomas/osteolysis, conventional and rotational instability, periprosthetic fracture, patellar complications, and a variety of periprosthetic soft tissue abnormalities. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Osteoarthritis: a review of strengths and weaknesses of different imaging options [^113JLb5U]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Slowing of radiographic joint space narrowing represents the only recommended imaging-based outcome measure to assess structural disease progression in osteoarthritis (OA) clinical trials. There are no effective disease-modifying OA drugs. The ability of magnetic resonance (MR) to image structures within the knee and to visualize cartilage morphology and composition gives MR imaging a critical role in understanding the natural history of the disease and in the search for therapies. In this article, the roles and limitations of conventional radiography and MR imaging, focusing on knee OA, and the use of other modalities in clinical practice and OA research are described.

Imaging

What is the role of knee radiographs in the assessment of middle-aged or older patients with a painful knee?

Knee radiography should be used as a first-line imaging tool to support a diagnosis of osteoarthritis or to detect certain rarer pathologies of the knee. Therefore, at least a posterior-anterior weight-bearing semi-flexed knee radiograph and a lateral view should be included in the work-up of the middle-aged or older patient with knee pain (Grade B).

How should we make the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis on a daily practical basis?

The clinical diagnosis of osteoarthritis can typically be made on the basis of the duration and character of the knee joint symptoms, patient history (including the presence of strong risk factors for osteoarthritis such as age, limb malalignment, obesity, heredity, prior knee injuries and surgeries) and findings from clinical examination. In the orthopaedic setting, weight-bearing semi-flexed knee radiographs (such as the Lyon Schuss or Rosenberg view) should be included in the work-up of the middle-aged or older patient with knee pain. A skyline patella view is also important for the detection of radiographic evidence of patella-femoral osteoarthritis. Please note that plain knee radiography does not necessarily capture early stages of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (Grade B).

What is the role of knee MRI in the assessment of a middle-aged or older patient with a painful knee?

Knee MRI is typically not indicated in the first-line work-up of the middle-aged or older patients with knee joint symptoms. However, knee MRI may be indicated in selected patients with refractory symptoms or in the presence of "warning flags" or localised symptoms indicating a rarer disease that needs to be ruled out, e.g. osteonecrosis. Hence, if a surgical indication is considered, based on history, symptoms, clinical exam and knee radiography, knee MRI may be useful to identify structural knee pathologies that may (or may not) be relevant for the symptoms (Grade B).

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^111nUQWv]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Knee MRI for osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) with a known lesion on x-ray is presented as optional: "an MRI of the knee is an option to characterize the OCD lesion or when concomitant knee pathology is suspected such as meniscal pathology, ACL injury, or articular cartilage injury". The page lists "Strength of Recommendation: High", but the rationale states that "AAOS conducted a systematic review that identified two diagnostic studies" that were "evaluated as a Level II study" and "also evaluated as a Level II study"; it further notes that "both x-ray and MRI are good rule in tests and do not address the incremental diagnostic value of an MRI in the setting of known OCD determined by x-ray", concluding "therefore we downgraded the strength of this recommendation to limited".

### MRI-based patient-specific nomogram for diagnostic risk stratification of patients with early knee OA [^114dTHio]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The goal and status of early OA diagnosis

Patients with OA are currently stratified based on clinical symptoms and traditional imaging (X-ray and morphological MRI). However, early-stage OA symptoms like knee pain and swelling are often subtle and may not lead to diagnosis until years after onset. X-ray, while accessible, cannot reveal early cartilage lesions, while morphological MRI can only identify advanced cartilage damage such as deep fissuring or extensive fibrillation. Although morphological MRI can assess other knee structures like the meniscus, bone marrow lesions (BMLs) and synovium, current studies lack direct comparisons with histopathology, the gold standard. Thus, X-ray and morphological MRI alone are insufficient for early OA diagnosis. Within the framework of the current standard guidelines, the lag in the acquisition of clinical symptoms and traditional imaging has resulted in the treatment paradigm for OA still leaning towards reactive medicine.

With the development and prevalence of predictive, preventive and personalized medicine (PPPM), the focus on the precise stratification of patients based on various biological and clinical characteristics has increased. With more precise stratification of patients, earlier prevention, stratified treatment and further improvements in personalized treatment plans will achieve better prognoses for patients. As pointed out in the EULAR Recommendations (2023), people with knee OA should be offered an individualized, multicomponent management plan that includes the recommended core non-pharmacological approaches. For patients with OA symptoms but without radiological signs, early diagnosis of knee OA (KOA) in asymmetrical stages is essential for the timely management of patients using preventive strategies. Therefore, the need to develop a new tool, which can help clinicians identify patients at early-stage OA and recommend appropriate exercise load and physical therapy, is growing.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteochondritis dissecans [^117FvjwH]. AAOS (2023). High credibility.

Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) knee — MRI diagnostic performance and study populations: a single study of a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon's pre-operative diagnosis, which included clinical examination, radiographs, and MRI findings, enrolled 131 patients, 19 with arthroscopically confirmed OCD; analysis indicated diagnosis based on exam, x-rays, and MRI findings is a good rule in and a good, moderately good, or weak rule out test for OCD. Two studies assessing MRI to distinguish OCD from other lesions enrolled 256 patients, 41 with OCD; likelihood ratios indicated MRI is a good or moderately good rule in test and a good, moderately good, or weak rule out test for OCD. In the three remaining studies (n = 124), MRI was evaluated for diagnosing instability using criteria including high signal rims/lines, cysts, and focal defects; one study reported skeletally mature separately from skeletally immature patients, with 91% skeletally immature in one and 81% skeletally mature in the other, so analyses were stratified. In skeletally immature patients, MRI is reported as good, moderately good, weak, or poor as a rule in and rule out test for instability of OCD.

### The effect of magnetic resonance imaging scans on knee arthroscopy: randomized controlled trial [^115tTEqv]. Arthroscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients waiting for knee arthroscopy could reduce arthroscopy rates and improve patient outcome.

Methods

A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in a teaching hospital setting. All participating patients had knee MRI before arthroscopy. In the intervention group the MRI report was seen by surgeons, and in the control group it was not. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who did not have an arthroscopy. Secondary outcome measures included the Short Form 36, EuroQol EQ-5D, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Score, and Knee Society Score.

Results

Surgeons changed both their diagnosis and management plan in 47% of patients in the intervention group compared with 1% in the control group, with no difference between groups in the proportion of patients who underwent an arthroscopy. In the intervention group 7 of 125 patients (5.6%) did not have an arthroscopy compared with 8 of 127 patients (6.3%) in the control group. In one instance a surgeon decided against arthroscopy based on the MRI report. There was no significant difference between groups in other outcome measures.

Conclusions

We found no effect of MRI on the decision to perform arthroscopy or patient outcome. Performing MRI in patients already on the waiting list for arthroscopy may not be effective in reducing utilization of surgery.

Level Of Evidence

Level I, therapeutic randomized controlled trial with no statistically significant difference but with narrow confidence intervals.

### New-generation 0.55 T MRI of the knee-initial clinical experience and comparison with 3 T MRI [^112Xa94M]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Internal derangement of the knee is one of the most common indications for MRI of the musculoskeletal system, and consequently, the knee is a commonly imaged joint. Magnetic resonance imaging is considered the imaging standard, due to the superior soft tissue contrast when compared with other imaging modalities. Although both 1.5 T and 3 T MRI can provide diagnostic images, 3 T MRI is generally preferred at most institutions, providing higher image resolution. This is in keeping with a contemporary meta-analysis, suggesting benefits of 3 T over 1.5 T knee MRI. Moreover, increasing literature is published regarding the potential of ultra-high field 7 T MRI of the knee, possibly offering superior assessment of joint cartilage. Perhaps contradicting this trend of greater field strength knee MRI for ever more detailed analyses, we hypothesized that new-generation low-field MRI allows for diagnostic knee examinations in clinical practice and is able to answer common referrer queries. These include the identification of trauma sequelae of the ligaments, tendons, menisci, bone, and joint cartilage. Thus, the purpose of our study was to compare the detection rate of and reader confidence in new-generation 0.55 T knee MRI findings with 3 T knee MRI in patients with knee pain after acute trauma.

### Editorial commentary: evaluation for cartilage lesions on magnetic resonance imaging continues to improve: artificial intelligence applications may result in higher sensitivity and specificity [^115bGSGq]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Accurate detection of cartilage lesions of the knee is required to offer patient-specific care and can alter surgical intervention options. To date, diagnostic arthroscopy remains the gold standard yet often requires the need for staged operative procedure for treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accurate imaging modality with high specificity, yet even with recent advances, MRI has limited specificity. Newer scanners (3T) and updated scanning sequences (3-dimensional MRI and quantitative MRI) are most sensitive in characterizing cartilage lesions of the knee, but these resources are not available to all users. Promising new avenues for patient-specific MRI scans along with the utilization of artificial intelligence will more accurately identify and quantify lesion size, location, and depth.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^1144Bs6U]. DoD/VA (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis — hip and knee osteoarthritis imaging: We suggest against obtaining magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee (Weak against | Reviewed, New-replaced). The reviewed evidence did not show a clear benefit of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over plain radiographs for the diagnosis of OA of the knee and/or hip, and it should not be routinely used in the diagnosis or workup of OA. The overall burdens associated with MRI (e.g., increased resource use, cost, time, and logistic difficulty), far outweigh those associated with weight-bearing radiographs, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of evidence was very low. The reviewed literature did not demonstrate the superiority of MRIs to plain, weight-bearing radiographs in the diagnosis of moderate to severe hip and knee OA. Some surgeons may request an MRI for surgical planning; however, this applies to a minority of patients and should be left to surgeon discretion following surgical consultation.

### Accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance arthrography and computed tomography for the detection of chondral lesions of the knee [^116LCPDt]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the diagnostic test accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) and computed tomography arthrography (CTA) for the detection of chondral lesions of the patellofemoral and tibiofemoral joints.

Methods

A review of published and unpublished literature sources was conducted on 22nd September 2011. All studies assessing the diagnostic test accuracy (sensitivity/specificity) of MRI or MRA or CTA for the assessment of adults with chondral (cartilage) lesions of the knee (tibiofemoral/patellofemoral joints) with surgical comparison (arthroscopic or open) as the reference test were included. Data were analysed through meta-analysis.

Results

Twenty-seven studies assessing 2,592 knees from 2,509 patients were included. The findings indicated that whilst presenting a high specificity (0.95–0.99), the sensitivity of MRA, MRI and CTA ranged from 0.70 to 0.80. MRA was superior to MRI and CTA for the detection of patellofemoral joint chondral lesions and that higher field-strength MRI scanner and grade four lesions were more accurately detected compared with lower field-strength and grade one lesions. There appeared no substantial difference in diagnostic accuracy between the interpretation from musculoskeletal and general radiologists when undertaking an MRI review of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral chondral lesions.

Conclusions

Specialist radiological imaging is specific for cartilage disease in the knee but has poorer sensitivity to determine the therapeutic options in this population. Due to this limitation, there remains little indication to replace the 'gold-standard' arthroscopic investigation with MRI, MRA or CTA for the assessment of adults with chondral lesions of the knee.

### The role of preoperative MRI in knee arthroscopy: a retrospective analysis of 2, 000 patients [^117PLFLB]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate, to what extent routine preoperative MRI scans could set the indications for knee arthroscopies and reduce the number of diagnostic arthroscopies. For this retrospective cohort study, 1,000 patients who had knee arthroscopies documented in 1994/1995 were compared with 1,000 patients that were treated in 2004/2005. The preoperative diagnoses that gave indications for knee arthroscopy were compared with the intraoperative findings. The congruence of preoperative diagnosis with the intraoperative findings was evaluated comparing both study populations. The number of patients who were referred to orthopaedic trauma surgeons with MRI increased from 24% to 56%. A high congruence of preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative findings was found in 49% in 1994/1995 and 55% in 2004/2005. However, regarding the most important outcome parameter, the number of diagnostic arthroscopies, no improvement was found (3% in both periods). The presented data suggests that MRI scans are not routinely necessary as an indication for knee arthroscopy, as clinical examination and plain radiograph are sufficient. However, MRI scans do allow a more detailed characterization of the expected findings and can therefore be helpful in therapy planning.

### MRI-arthroscopy correlation of knee anatomy and pathologic findings: a teaching guide [^117QBCWc]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study is to familiarize the radiologist with knee arthroscopy, including the setup, equipment, and standard procedure used. This is followed by a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of knee MRI and arthroscopy and presentation of images showing normal knee anatomy and pathologic findings.

Conclusion

By having an understanding of basic arthroscopic principles as well as the strengths and limitations of MRI and arthroscopy in the diagnosis of knee abnormalities, radiologists will improve image interpretation and add value to interactions with the consulting orthopedic surgeon.

### MR imaging of autologous chondrocyte implantation of the knee [^112k84S6]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) is a surgical technique that is increasingly being used in the treatment of full-thickness defects of articular cartilage in the knee. It involves the arthroscopic harvesting and in vitro culture of chondrocytes that are subsequently implanted into a previously identified chondral defect. The aim is to produce a repair tissue that closely resembles hyaline articular cartilage that gradually becomes incorporated, restoring joint congruity. Over the long term, it is hoped that this will prevent the progression of full-thickness articular cartilage defects to osteoarthritis. This article reviews the indications and operative procedure performed in ACI. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences that provide optimal visualization of articular cartilage in the post-operative period are discussed. Normal appearances of ACI on MRI are presented along with common complications that are encountered with this technique.

### A tailored intervention does not reduce low value MRI's and arthroscopies in degenerative knee disease when the secular time trend is taken into account: a difference-in-difference analysis [^116dtkdu]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The most important finding of the present study was that a secular time trend reduced the weighted monthly percentage of patients with degenerative knee disease receiving a MRI and arthroscopy across both intervention and the control hospitals. The tailored intervention designed to reduce low value care did not further reduce the percentage of patients receiving a MRI or arthroscopy.

Previous research has shown that de-implementation of low value care in orthopaedic surgery is challenging and that providing a substitute will likely be more effective than doing nothing. This might explain the lack of an effect in the present study, as no clear substitute was provided as part of the intervention, although the orthopaedic surgeons could offer patients non-surgical treatments, like advice on possible weight loss in overweight patients, physical exercises, short periods of pain killers and even adequate explanation for the presence of the knee symptoms. That substitution may be more effective is also supported by the recent study of Barlow et al. who showed that providing a substitute conservative care pathway rather than knee arthroscopy is able to reduce low value knee arthroscopies. However, the study of Barlow did not use a control group, so that the observed reduction may have been part of a secular trend. Therefore, more research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of such substitute interventions.

Increasing awareness among clinicians has been shown previously to result in changes in clinical practice, particularly for issues receiving widespread attention. For instance, Kiadaliri et al. showed that the development of national guideline's recommendation against the use of knee arthroscopy in patients with knee osteoarthritis was associated with a decrease in knee arthroscopy in Sweden. In addition, Reeves et al. showed, that clinical practice change occurred even before actual findings of orthopaedic trials were published. The latter phenomenon is known as the 'rising tide' i.e. a pronounced secular trend created by social responses to a particular issue which has gained widespread attention. The current study could be another example of changing overall awareness regarding non-indicated procedures, substantiated by the growing number of studies published about the non-indicated use of MRI and arthroscopy as well as by discussions about the Dutch guideline for knee arthroscopy at meetings of the Netherlands Orthopaedic Association from 2017 onwards and the dissemination of (inter)national clinical guidelines.

Module 8: 'Open surgery for PFP and PT'

Scoping question: What is the value of open surgery for patients with PFP and PT?

Background: When PFP and PT are unresponsive to conservative treatments, patients are sometimes referred to an orthopaedic surgeon for evaluation, confirmation of diagnosis, potential supplementary diagnostics and appraisal of indications for surgical treatment. The Dutch Guideline on Knee Arthroscopy recommends not performing arthroscopy for PFP and exercising caution in performing arthroscopy for PT. However, the role of open surgery in the surgical treatment of PFP and PT remains unclear.

Evidence review: No studies have been conducted on open surgery for PFP. One systematic review of open surgery for PT was included ('low GRADE').

Rationale: Recommendations of the expert panel were based solely on clinical expertise. Imaging assessments (magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography) are obligatory and should be evaluated for post‐traumatic, degenerative, or congenital morphological causes of PFP. When open surgery for PT is indicated, the expert panel recommends magnetic resonance imaging assessment to confirm the exact location and degree of patellar tendon abnormalities before surgery.

Recommendations:

Initially, PFP and PT should only be treated with non‐operative treatments for at least 6 months (see Module 2: 'Exercise therapy for PFP', Module 3: 'Additional conservative treatments for PFP', Module 5: 'Exercise for PT' and Module 6: 'Additional conservative treatments for PT').
Surgery should only be considered when conservative treatment fails; the variable and unpredictable outcomes and potential risks of open surgery for PFP and PT should be discussed, and shared decision‐making should be employed when choosing the treatment.
Open surgery should be considered only when, following at least 6 months of non‐operative treatments, including exercise therapy, the patient continues to experience persistent and disabling symptoms and functional limitations, and o Anatomical morphology is determined to be the cause of persistent PFP confirmed by imaging assessments or o PT is confirmed by imaging assessments.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of articular cartilage of the knee [^113AaBaq]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

Recently developed magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques allow accurate detection of moderate- and high-grade articular cartilage defects. There has been increased interest in MR imaging of articular cartilage in part because it is useful in identifying patients who may benefit from new articular cartilage replacement therapies, including chondrocyte transplantation, improved techniques for osteochondral transplantation, chondroprotective agents, and cartilage growth stimulation factors. The modality also has the potential to play an important role in the follow-up of patients during and after treatment. Detection of articular cartilage defects is beneficial for patients undergoing arthroscopy for other injuries, such as meniscal tears, because the presence of articular cartilage injury worsens prognosis and may modify therapy options.

### Knee MRI primary care ordering practices for nontraumatic knee pain: compliance with ACR appropriateness criteria and its effect on clinical management [^111Psxeu]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the appropriateness of MRI ordering practices and their effect on clinical management for nontraumatic knee pain at the primary care clinics of a large public urban hospital.

Materials and Methods

In all, 196 consecutive MRIs for nontraumatic knee pain ordered from primary care clinics in a large public urban hospital over an 18-month period were studied. ACR Appropriateness Criteria (AC) scores for nontraumatic knee pain were retrospectively calculated from medical record reviews. The record was also reviewed to assess whether knee MRI changed clinical management. Knee osteoarthritis grading was performed. Tests were performed for differences in age, body mass index (BMI), gender, and ethnicity among appropriate and inappropriate MRIs.

Results

Of the MRIs, 57% (108 knees) had "usually appropriate" (ie, 7–9) and 43% (8 knees) had "usually not appropriate" (ie, 1–3) AC scores (P > .1). Clinical management was changed in 26% of knees with "usually appropriate" and 20% of knees with "usually inappropriate" scores (P < .05), and 70% of the knees with "usually appropriate" and 61% of the knee with "usually not appropriate" scores had moderate to severe osteoarthritis. Age, BMI, gender, and ethnicity had no significant effect on AC scores.

Conclusion

In patients referred from primary care for MRI for nontraumatic knee pain, adherence to AC was low. Additional focus on reducing "appropriate" studies that do not impact clinical management (eg, cases with radiographically evident moderate to severe osteoarthritis) is also warranted.

### The diagnosis of meniscus tears: the role of MRI and clinical examination [^112Du2AM]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2007). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical examination are tools commonly used in the diagnosis of meniscus tears. It has been suggested routine MRI before therapeutic arthroscopy for clinically diagnosed meniscus tears will reduce the number and cost of unnecessary invasive procedures. We designed a systematic review of prospective cohort studies comparing MRI and clinical examination to arthroscopy to diagnosis meniscus tears. Thirty-two relevant studies were identified by a literature review. Careful evaluation by an experienced examiner identifies patients with surgically treatable meniscus lesions with equal or better reliability than MRI. MRI is superior when indications for arthroscopy are solely diagnostic. However, the methods by which such a clinician arrives at a conclusion have not been identified. To create an evidence-based algorithm for the diagnosis of a meniscus tear future investigations should prospectively assess the value of commonly used aspects of the patient history and meniscus tests. MRI is useful, but should be reserved for situations in which an experienced clinician requires further information before arriving at a diagnosis. Indications for arthroscopy should be therapeutic, not diagnostic in nature.

### The accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging scanning and its influence on management decisions in knee surgery [^1171uTxo]. Arthroscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the impact of preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment of articular knee pathology on the clinical management of patients presenting with joint line pain.

Methods

A preliminary study on 100 patients was performed to assess the accuracy of specific MRI sequences, using arthroscopy as a gold standard. Six hundred and eighteen consecutive patients with knee symptoms presenting to 2 specialist knee surgeons were then recruited. A clinical diagnosis of an arthroscopically treatable lesion was made in all cases. Clinical assessment data were correlated to subsequent MRI findings, recording any discrepancy and in particular whether or not MRI findings influenced management decisions.

Results

In the preliminary study, MRI sequences had an overall sensitivity of 83.2% and a specificity of 94.3% for the detection of chondral lesions. However, when considering arthroscopic grade III and IV lesions, MRI sensitivity and specificity were improved to 84.5% and 97.1%. In the second phase of the study, 141 (22.8%) of the 618 patients presenting with knee symptoms had an altered clinical management subsequent to MRI. The presence of unexpected chondral lesions was found in 77 of these patients. Conversely, 22 patients with clinical symptoms suspicious for simple chondral degeneration had unstable meniscal tears.

Conclusions

We suggest that preoperative MRI scanning identifies a group of patients who have more advanced degenerative joint disease than the clinical assessment and the plain radiographs suggest. This would expedite definitive surgery in patients with advanced osteoarthritis on MRI scans.

Level Of Evidence

Level II, development of diagnostic criteria on basis of consecutive patients with universally applied gold standard.

### Evaluation and management of traumatic knee injuries in the emergency department [^115SwUaP]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic knee pain is a common presentation in the emergency department (ED). The use of clinical decision rules can rule out reliably fractures of the knee and reduce the unnecessary cost and radiation exposure associated with plain radiographs. If ligamentous or meniscal injury to the knee is suspected, the ED physician should arrange for expedited follow- up with the patient's primary care physician or an orthopedic specialist for consideration of an MRI and further management. Patients presenting after high-energy mechanisms are at risk for occult fracture and vascular injuries. ED providers must consider these injuries in the proper clinical setting.

Measurement properties for clinical examination and MRI

'No isolated question, test or image can accurately identify an ACL injury, every time'.
No isolated question, test or image can accurately identify an ACL injury, every time. The measurement tools available to the clinician are not perfect, but they do yield valuable information in the clinical context. Knowledge of the measurement properties of clinical tools helps the clinician balance the information gained from these tools. The negative predictive values of clinical examination and MRI for ACL tear and meniscal pathology are higher than the positive predictive values (table 1). This means that if the clinical examination and MRI are negative for injury, the chance of the patient having an injury is low. However, if the tests are positive, it does not mean that the clinician can always reliably rule the diagnosis in.

Diagnostic accuracy of clinical examination and MRI in intra-articular knee disorders (adapted from Kocher et al)

Section 3: treatment of ACL injuries in children

This section addresses the fundamental clinical question: what are the treatment options for the child with ACL injury? Once the clinician is certain of the injury diagnosis, he or she first needs to know the available treatment options, and discuss these options with the child and the child's parents/guardian, so a shared decision can be made about how best to manage the knee injury.

The goals of treatment for the child with ACL injury are:
To restore a stable, well-functioning knee that enables a healthy, active lifestyle across the lifespan.
To reduce the impact of existing or the risk of further meniscal or chondral pathology, degenerative joint changes and the need for future surgical intervention.
To minimise the risk of growth arrest and femur and tibia deformity.

There are two treatment options that can help the child with ACL injury (with or without associated knee injuries) achieve these goals: high-quality rehabilitation alone (non-surgical treatment) and ACL reconstruction plus high-quality rehabilitation. In this section, the key components of high-quality rehabilitation for the child with ACL injury, and the options for ACL reconstruction surgical technique are described. Potential treatment decision modifiers are outlined in Section 4.

### MRI of the knee and shoulder performed before radiography [^111gLBMh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Available data are limited on the level of adherence to established guidelines for appropriate utilization of MR in musculoskeletal imaging. This study estimates the percentage of MRI examinations for knee and shoulder pain or tendonitis performed without prior radiography, which thus may fall outside the ACR Appropriateness Criteria for the Medicare and commercially insured populations.

Methods

The percentage of MRI examinations for knee and shoulder pain or tendonitis performed without prior radiography was estimated among patients in the Medicare 5% carrier claims limited data set and among commercially insured patients in the Truven Marketscan Treatment Pathways database in 2010.

Results

Approximately 28% of all knee MRIs, and 35%-37% of all shoulder MRIs were performed without recent prior radiographs. The extrapolated expense of these potentially unwarranted MRIs in the entire fee-for-service Medicare population was between $20 and $35 million. Between 20% and 23% of patients undergoing knee MRI, and 27%-32% undergoing shoulder MRI, did not have radiographic examination at any point before the MRI in the same calendar year.

Conclusions

MRI performed without prior radiography represents a potential gap in care and should be considered as an area for establishment of performance measures.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage repair procedures [^114aaxSu]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Cartilage injuries in the knee are common and can be a persistent source of pain or dysfunction. Many new surgical strategies have been developed to treat these lesions. It is important for the radiologist to have an understanding of these procedures and their appearance on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

### Survey of inappropriate use of magnetic resonance imaging [^115wTAzK]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

There are concerns that not all costly advanced imaging is appropriate. However, studies about the appropriateness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are sparse. The aim of this study was to review various MRI examinations done at a university hospital to determine whether there is inappropriate use.

Methods

Altogether 150 common MRIs (upper abdomen or liver, lumbar spine, knee, head and head of children performed under anaesthesia, 30 each) were reviewed consecutively. The referrals and corresponding patient files were analysed by senior radiologists and the indications of the examinations were compared to the referral criteria.

Results

Seven per cent of the examinations were deemed inappropriate. All the MRIs of the head done on children were indicated. One to three examinations in all other subgroups were not indicated. The most common appropriate indications were ambiguous hepatic, pancreatic or adrenal lesions, prolonged lower back pain, suspicion of meniscus rupture, brain malignancy and developmental disorder of a child, respectively.

Conclusions

Although the proportion of inappropriate examinations was not high; financial issues and the growing number of patients referred for MRI are of concern. Education and regular use of up-to-date referral guidelines could help to further improve appropriateness.

Main Messages

- Seven per cent of the MRI examinations analysed were inappropriate at a university hospital.
- Everyday practices of a hospital may contribute to the level of appropriateness.
- A survey of indications for previous MRI examinations might be helpful in various institutions.

### Knee MRI: vascular pathology [^115kKAd4]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Patients who undergo knee MRI for presumed musculoskeletal disease can have unexpected vascular findings or pathology in the imaged field. Some vascular processes are limb threatening and affect treatment planning and patient outcome.

Conclusion

Unexpected vascular findings on knee MRI can range from incidental to symptomatic and can include such processes as variant anatomy, aneurysm, traumatic injury, and neoplasm. The assessment for vascular pathology should be a key component of every radiologist's search pattern when evaluating knee MRI.

### Management of traumatic meniscus tears: the 2019 ESSKA meniscus consensus [^115Vi8pZ]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The importance of meniscus integrity in the prevention of early osteoarthritis is well known, and preservation is accepted as the primary goal. The purpose of the ESSKA (European Society for Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery and Arthroscopy) European consensus on traumatic meniscus tears was to provide recommendations for the treatment of meniscus tears based on both scientific evidence and the clinical experience of knee experts.

Methods

Three groups of surgeons and scientists elaborated and ratified the so-called formal consensus process to define the recommendations for the management of traumatic meniscus tears. A traumatic meniscus tear was defined as a tear with an acute onset of symptoms caused by a sufficient trauma. The expert groups included a steering group of eight European surgeons and scientists, a rating group of another nineteen European surgeons, and a peer review group. The steering group prepared twenty-seven question and answer sets based on the scientific literature. The quality of the answers received grades of A (a high level of scientific support), B (scientific presumption), C (a low level of scientific support) or D (expert opinion). These question and answer sets were then submitted to and evaluated by the rating group. All answers were scored from 1 (= totally inappropriate) to 9 (= totally appropriate) points. Thereafter, the comments of the members of the rating group were incorporated by the steering group and the consensus was submitted to the rating group a second time. Once a general consensus was reached between the steering and rating groups, the finalized question and answer sets were submitted for final review by the peer review group composed of representatives of the ESSKA-affiliated national societies. Eighteen representatives replied.

Results

The review of the literature revealed a rather low scientific quality of studies examining the treatment of traumatic meniscus tears. Of the 27 questions, only one question received a grade of A (a high level of scientific support), and another received a grade of B (scientific presumption). The remaining questions received grades of C and D. The mean rating of all questions by the rating group was 8.2 (95% confidence interval 8.1–8.4). A general agreement that MRI should be performed on a systematic basis was not achieved. However, MRI was recommended when arthroscopy would be considered to identify concomitant pathologies. In this case, the indication for MRI should be determined by a musculoskeletal specialist. Based on our data, stable left in situ lateral meniscus tears appear to show a better prognosis than medial tears. When repair is required, surgery should be performed as early as possible. Evidence that biological enhancement such as needling or the application of platelet-rich plasma would improve healing was not identified. Preservation of the meniscus should be considered as the first line of treatment because of an inferior clinical and radiological long-term outcome after partial meniscectomy compared to meniscus repair.

Discussion

The consensus was generated to present the best possible recommendations for the treatment of traumatic meniscus tears and provides some groundwork for a clinical decision-making process regarding the treatment of meniscus tears. Preservation of the meniscus should be the first line of treatment when possible, because the clinical and radiological long-term outcomes are worse after partial meniscectomy than after meniscus preservation. The consensus clearly states that numerous meniscus tears that were considered irreparable should be repaired, e.g., older tears, tears in obese patients, long tears, etc. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.

Of the 5 therapeutic studies included in the guideline, three reported acquisition of an MRI at enrollment and three reported acquisition at follow-up evaluation. One prognostic study predicted the healing potential of stable OCD lesions using a multivariable logistic regression model, and among variables considered only knee symptoms plus normalized length and normalized width of the lesion on MRI were found to be predictive of healing potential. Three studies correlated MRI with arthroscopic findings in patients with OCD of the knee, and the evidence for assessment of stability of an OCD lesion was inconsistent.

### Knee pain and mobility impairments: meniscal and articular cartilage lesions [^1116neou]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2010). Medium credibility.

Imaging studies for acute knee injury — meniscal and articular cartilage lesions — outline radiograph indications and MRI use as follows: The Ottawa Knee rule indicates that a knee radiograph series is required with any of the following criteria: Age 55 or older, isolated tenderness of patella, tenderness of head of fibula, inability to flex knee to 90°, and inability to bear weight both immediately and in the emergency department for 4 steps regardless of limping. For meniscal diagnosis, clinical examination by well-trained clinicians may be as accurate as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a lower threshold of suspicion of a meniscal tear is warranted in middle aged and elderly patients. MRI may be reserved for more complicated or confusing cases with persistent pain and swelling suggesting occult cartilage or meniscal pathology, and in asymptomatic individuals with risk factors such as joint injury early articular cartilage damage may be present and MRI or arthroscopy may be needed. When compared to arthroscopy as the reference standard, conventional MRI sequences have an overall sensitivity of 83.2% and a specificity of 94.3% for the detection of chondral lesions, and MRI may assist an orthopaedic surgeon in preoperative planning and predicting the prognosis.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute trauma to the knee [^116gKEzY]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Acute trauma to the knee is a common presentation seen in the emergency department. After a routine clinical examination, imaging is frequently performed to facilitate the diagnosis and almost always starts with radiographs. If clinically indicated, advanced cross-sectional imaging may then be performed for further evaluation. CT is often performed for preoperative planning of the complex tibial plateau and distal femur fractures. Currently, MRI is the study of choice for evaluation of bone marrow, internal derangements, and other soft-tissue injuries about the knee joint. In patients with knee dislocations, MR angiography may be performed simultaneously with MRI for evaluation of internal derangements and vascular injuries with less morbidity compared to conventional angiography. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^115cGE21]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Many studies and systematic reviews have been published about MRI of the knee and its structures, discussing detailed anatomy, imaging findings, and correlations between imaging and clinical findings. This paper includes evidence-based recommendations for a general radiologist regarding choice of imaging sequences and reporting basic MRI examinations of the knee. We recommend using clinicians' terminology when it is applicable to the imaging findings, for example, when reporting meniscal, ligament and tendon, or cartilage pathology.

### How to optimize the use of MRI in anatomic ACL reconstruction [^1166xN5L]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The goal of anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is the restoration of the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation and insertion sites. The ACL consists of two functional bundle, the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral bundle (PL), which together provide both anterior and rotatory stability of the knee.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most frequent diagnostic imaging procedure for suspected ACL injuries. It is an accurate, highly sensitive and specific tool for the diagnosis of ACL tears, graft tears and associated injuries. The application of MRI in anatomic ACL reconstruction is rapidly expanding. Currently, MRI is used not only for diagnosis, but also for the measurement of the size and inclination angle of the ACL, pre-operative assessment of the size of autograft sources and post-operative evaluation of graft healing. MRI has also been used in several other evaluations related to ACL reconstruction, such as tunnel enlargement, roof impingement, tibiofemoral relation and cartilage degenerative changes after ACL injury. This paper focuses on all applications of MRI in anatomic ACL reconstruction. It will also describe an MRI ACL protocol for ACL injury and reconstruction.

### A systematic approach to magnetic resonance imaging interpretation of sports medicine injuries of the knee [^113sj2AW]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging is performed more commonly on the knee than on any other joint, and it is an excellent diagnostic tool that can aid in the evaluation of a host of sports-related injuries involving the ligaments, tendons, menisci, osseous structures, and articular surfaces. A thorough evaluation of the images, however, can be a daunting task, as the study often contains dozens of images obtained with multiple pulse sequences and in several imaging planes. A systematic approach will facilitate an accurate and timely evaluation of this complex examination and will ensure that all of the clinically relevant structures are adequately assessed. This article will provide a systematic approach to the interpretation of a magnetic resonance examination of the knee. The normal imaging appearance of each anatomical structure will be described, and the optimal pulse sequence and imaging plane for the evaluation of each structure will be discussed. Finally, the signs of injury will be described and illustrated.

### Preferences and beliefs of Dutch orthopaedic surgeons and patients reduce the implementation of "Choosing wisely" recommendations in degenerative knee disease [^113JHeTo]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Although practice guidelines and the underlying evidence do not recommend routine use of MRI and arthroscopy, many patients aged 50 years and over with degenerative knee disease receive an MRI and/or a knee arthroscopy. Arthroscopic knee surgery is even the most common orthopaedic procedure in countries with available data and is, on a global scale, performed more than two million times each year.

In an effort to reduce the unnecessary use of MRIs and knee arthroscopies for patients with degenerative knee disease, medical societies in several countries have formulated "Choosing Wisely" recommendations regarding their use. A recent study of Rosenberg et al. showed that developing such recommendations does not necessarily eradicate low value care. To stimulate the implementation of the CW recommendations, interventions should be adapted to the factors associated with implementation of specific CW recommendations — in this case 'do not order an MRI for suspected degenerative meniscal tears' and 'do not perform knee arthroscopy for patients with degenerative meniscal tears of degenerative knee disease without mechanical symptoms'. Previous research has suggested that conducting knee arthroscopies is driven by clinician beliefs in the effectiveness, the need to meet patient expectations, perverse financial incentives for clinicians/hospitals, fragmented clinical decision pathways, and insurance coverage. However, no study has systematically studied factors influencing the implementation of these CW recommendations on degenerative knee complaints in patients of 50 years and older.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate which factors are associated with implementation of CW recommendations among patients and orthopaedic surgeons in the Netherlands which aim to reduce the number of unnecessary MRIs and arthroscopies in patients aged 50 years and over with degenerative knee disease. Based on the previous research above, it was hypothesized that orthopaedic surgeons' beliefs in the effectiveness of MRI and knee arthroscopy, the need to meet patient expectations, perverse financial incentives and insurance coverage all hamper the implementation of CW recommendations.

### 2018 international olympic committee consensus statement on prevention, diagnosis and management of paediatric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries [^114pLDv4]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Section 2: diagnosis, clinical tests and imaging

This section addresses the fundamental clinical question: how does the clinician diagnose ACL injury in children? High-quality injury prevention programs are the first-line defence against the potential negative short-term and long-term consequences of ACL injury. However, if injury prevention efforts fail, timely and accurate diagnosis is important, since diagnosis is the starting point for effective management planning and shared decision-making. The clinician combines information from the patient's history, examination and clinical tests, and imaging to build the clinical picture that will inform diagnosis and treatment. Typically, a thorough history and clinical examination will enable the clinician to make an accurate diagnosis.

Clinical pearl 1

Haemarthrosis (acute swelling in the knee within 24 hours after a trauma due to intra-articular bleeding) following acute knee injury is an important clue suggesting structural knee injury.

Clinical pearl 2

Diagnosis can be more challenging than in adults because children may be poor historians, they may have greater physiological joint laxity (be sure to examine both knees) and MRI interpretation is more difficult given developmental variants in children.

Clinical pearl 3

Due to the immature skeleton, children may sustain different knee injuries (eg, sleeve fracture of the patella, epiphysiolysis) than adults.

Consider starting the assessment by ordering plain knee radiographs for all paediatric patients with a haemarthrosis/suspected acute knee injury. This is because tibial eminence fractures and an ACL tear can present with a similar history and physical examination findings. It is also important to rule out other paediatric fractures (eg, epiphysial fracture, sleeve fracture of the patella). Perform an MRI to confirm the diagnosis of ACL injury and evaluate other soft tissue structures. In children with an ACL injury, MRI may yield additional information to identify meniscal tears, other ligament injury or osteochondral injury. In children with a locked knee, an acute MRI is warranted to assess the presence of a displaced bucket handle meniscal tear or an osteochondral injury that may need prompt surgical treatment.

### MR imaging assessment of arthritis of the knee [^116jD4mB]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging presentations of arthritis of the knee are important for radiologists to recognize because these disorders are often clinically unsuspected. When they are known or clinically suspected, knowledge of imaging features allows for the confirmation and characterization of the extent of disease. This article reviews the fundamental MR imaging manifestations of rheumatologic disorders of the knee and their presentation in specific arthropathies.

### Preferences and beliefs of Dutch orthopaedic surgeons and patients reduce the implementation of "Choosing wisely" recommendations in degenerative knee disease [^113P33hR]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Previous studies also showed that clinicians felt CW recommendations were hard to accept for patients, were worried about malpractice claims and did not have enough time to discuss the risks and benefits of imaging with the patient. Around 70% of the orthopaedic surgeons reported in this survey that they thought patients had difficulties in accepting the CW recommendations (Table 5), but these were not independently associated with implementation in multivariate regression analyses. In addition, fear of malpractice claims and lack of time to discuss risks and benefits of imaging with the patients were also not found to hamper implementation: less than 11% of the orthopaedic surgeons felt they needed to request an MRI or perform an arthroscopy for medicolegal substantiation (Table 5). Sixty-six percent of orthopaedic surgeons reported they had enough time to explain treatment options to patients (Table 5) and 69% of the patients felt that their orthopaedic surgeon spent sufficient time to explain treatment options including risks and benefits (Table 3). This underlines the importance of assessment of factors influencing the implementation of every CW recommendation for different countries and also to include both the clinician and the patient perspective.

That the implementation of CW recommendations can also be influenced by patients was shown by this study, in addition to other studies. While previous studies regarding the use of MRI and arthroscopies in degenerative knee disease mainly mentioned clinician-related barriers, it was shown by this study that also patients' preferences for MRIs and positive experiences of people in their environment with arthroscopies hampered implementation of the CW recommendations. This is an important finding for future initiatives to improve implementation of CW recommendations. These should include both patient- and orthopaedic surgeon-directed strategies.

Implications for clinical practice are that the use of unnecessary MRIs and knee arthroscopy for patients with degenerative knee disease can potentially be reduced by strategies tailored to the identified barriers for implementation of the CW recommendations. This reduction is of great importance as MRIs and arthroscopies for patients with degenerative knees provide no benefit for the patient, waste resources and may even cause harm to the patient.

### A pragmatic approach to the imaging and follow-up of solitary central cartilage tumours of the proximal humerus and knee [^113wt7kS]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Central cartilage tumours of bone range from the benign enchondroma to the malignant chondrosarcoma. They are an incidental finding in up to 2.8% of routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations performed of the shoulder and knee. The purpose of this review is to provide a current appraisal of the imaging and histological challenges of distinguishing enchondroma from low-grade chondrosarcoma. The general radiologist, encountering these lesions in the proximal humerus and around the knee, is introduced to the Birmingham Atypical Cartilage Tumour Imaging Protocol (BACTIP). This provides a guide to the initial assessment and diagnosis, a stepwise imaging follow-up plan, and the indications for onward specialist orthopaedic oncology referral or discharge from follow-up.

### Does MRI add value in general practice for patients with traumatic knee complaints? A 1-year randomised controlled trial [^116MDNE2]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To determine whether referral to MRI by the general practitioner (GP) is non-inferior to usual care (no access to MRI by GPs) in patients with traumatic knee complaints regarding knee-related daily function.

Methods

This was a multicentre, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial with 1-year follow-up. GPs invited eligible patients during or after their consultation. Eligible patients (18–45 years) consulted a GP with knee complaints due to a trauma during the previous 6 months. Patients allocated to the MRI group received an MRI at (median) 7 (IQR 1–33) days after the baseline questionnaire. Patients in the usual care group received information on the course of knee complaints, and a referral to a physiotherapist or orthopaedic surgeon when indicated. The primary outcome measure was knee-related daily function measured with the Lysholm scale (0 to 100; 100 = excellentfunction) over 1year, with a non-inferiority margin of 6 points.

Results

A total of 356 patients were included and randomised to MRI (n = 179) or usual care (n = 177) from November 2012 to December 2015. MRI was non-inferior to usual care concerning knee-related daily function during 1-year follow-up, for the intention-to-treat (overall adjusted estimate: 0.33; 95%CI -1.73 to 2.39) and per-protocol (overall adjusted estimate: 0.06; 95%CI -2.08 to 2.19) analysis. There were no differences between both groups in the amount of patients visiting other healthcare providers.

Conclusion

MRI in general practice in patients with traumatic knee complaints was non-inferior to usual care regarding knee-related daily function during 1-year follow-up.

### Editorial commentary: indications for needle arthroscopy as an alternative to magnetic resonance imaging: more to the picture than meets the eye [^111GwTwU]. Arthroscopy (2021). Medium credibility.

Needle arthroscopy (using a 1- to 1.9-mm diameter arthroscope) is not new, and new interest is a result of the expense and inconvenience of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including time out of work, prolonged diagnostic dilemmas, and finite advanced imaging resources. Improvements in the image quality with the modern needle arthroscope have made it a viable option for use as a diagnostic tool in the operative setting, and eventually, if surgeons are able to create strict criteria for proper diagnostic use of the needle arthroscope, it may become an excellent tool for in-office use despite financial or legal hurdles. Specific clinical scenarios for use of an diagnostic needle arthroscopy instead of an MRI (and typically immediately followed by therapeutic arthroscopy in the same setting) include (1) a patient with a clinically obvious meniscus tear with a locked knee, (2) a patient with an outdated but previously positive MRI with recurrent injury such as a recurrent shoulder or patella dislocations, (3) a patient who is ineligible for an MRI such as those with pacemakers or spinal implants who have clear and obvious clinical findings to suggest intra-articular pathology, and (4) a patient who is over the age of 50 years with positive rotator cuff testing after a shoulder dislocation in which I have a high degree of suspicion of a rotator cuff tear. In the future, we envision using multiple needle arthroscopes to provide simultaneous views from different angles during surgery and giving ourselves a 360° view. I envision an operating room in the future with multiple small needle scopes in joint and multiple viewing monitors providing a new 3-dimensional world of arthroscopy.

### Survey of inappropriate use of magnetic resonance imaging [^1141sdNj]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Seven per cent of all the 150 examinations (10/150) were not appropriate (Table 1). Four out of 30 MRI examinations of the upper abdomen or the liver were not indicated (Table 1). If CT does not reveal any intra-abdominal mass, MRI is not needed. In another patient, suspicion of liver metastases should have been followed by biopsy, not by MRI control. Additionally, CT would be able to show any abnormalities associated with a liver calcification, and the calcification is usually not visible on MRI. A patient with mild upper abdominal pain and without any suspicious symptoms or signs would not have needed MRI. The major indications for appropriate examinations were unclear lesions or status of the liver, pancreas or adrenal gland (20/26 patients) (Table 2).

*Some patients had more than one symptom/indication

GIST, gastrointestinal stromal tumour

In the group of MRI examinations of the lumbar spine, 2 out of 30 cases were not appropriate. The problems of the lower legs of one patient were related to a previous assault on the head, not to the lumbar spine. The other patient with mild lower back pain had no specific indications for MRI. Most of the indicated examinations (25/28) had been done for prolonged lower back pain.

Three out of 30 MRIs of the knee were considered non-indicated. MRI does not reveal any special findings in painful knees related to previous Osgood-Schlatter disease. Limited flexion and extension of the knee were the only information concerning the other patient while referring and performing MRI and would not have indicated MRI. The indication for an appropriate examination was suspicion of meniscus rupture in 19/27 cases.

One out of 30 MRI examinations of the head was not appropriate. There was no indication for MRI after many CT examinations in the case of an elderly terminal patient. The most common appropriate indications were control of a brain tumour or suspicion of brain metastases (9/29). All the MRI examinations of the head performed in children under anaesthesia were indicated. The major indication for MRI was a developmental disorder (9/30).

### ESR essentials: MRI of the knee-practice recommendations by ESSR [^115gfjP5]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Many studies and systematic reviews have been published about MRI of the knee and its structures, discussing detailed anatomy, imaging findings, and correlations between imaging and clinical findings. This paper includes evidence-based recommendations for a general radiologist regarding choice of imaging sequences and reporting basic MRI examinations of the knee. We recommend using clinicians' terminology when it is applicable to the imaging findings, for example, when reporting meniscal, ligament and tendon, or cartilage pathology. The intent is to standardise reporting language and to make reports less equivocal. The aim of the paper is to improve the usefulness of the MRI report by understanding the strengths and limitations of the MRI exam with regard to clinical correlation. We hope the implementation of these recommendations into radiological practice will increase diagnostic accuracy and consistency by avoiding pitfalls and reducing overcalling of pathology on MRI of the knee.

Clinical relevance statement

The recommendations presented here are meant to aid general radiologists in planning and assessing studies to evaluate acute and chronic knee findings by advocating the use of unequivocal terminology and discussing the strengths and limitations of MRI examination of the knee.

Key Points

- On MRI, the knee should be examined and assessed in three orthogonal imaging planes.

- The basic general protocol must yield T2-weighted fluid-sensitive and T1-weighted images.

- The radiological assessment should include evaluation of ligamentous structures, cartilage, bony structures and bone marrow, soft tissues, bursae, alignment, and incidental findings.

### A tailored intervention does not reduce low value MRI's and arthroscopies in degenerative knee disease when the secular time trend is taken into account: a difference-in-difference analysis [^116sfeRa]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Due to the ageing population, more people will suffer from degenerative knee disease in the future. Nowadays, around 25% of patients aged 50 years and over experience symptoms of degenerative knee disease. These patients suffer from complaints during walking, climbing stairs and squatting. Some patients also experience locking symptoms: a limited range of motion of the knee due to loose bodies or meniscal tears. Meniscal tears in this age group occur as part of a degenerative process and can be considered a feature of an early stage of osteoarthritis.

Since 2014, clinical practice guidelines from professional orthopaedic associations as well as literature on diagnosis and treatment of these patients advise regular weight bearing radiographs including a fixed flexion view (Rosenberg view) to examine the cartilage status of the knee, and non-surgical treatment modalities including pain medication, dietary advice and exercise therapy. Routine use of an MRI for diagnosis of degenerative knee disease is not recommended for this specific patient group due to the poor association with symptoms. Similarly, arthroscopic interventions are not recommended for routine use in degenerative knee disease because limited benefits are found that are absent 1 to 2 years after surgery. Only when locking symptoms are present, a knee arthroscopy may be warranted. As the use of MRI and knee arthroscopy provides limited benefit, require resources and — as for any procedure — may cause harm to the patient, both are considered low value care for patients with degenerative knee disease.

### How useful is MRI in diagnosing isolated bundle ACL injuries? [^116R4PB1]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Selective bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and/or remnant ACL preservation may be reasonable options for some patients. However, the frequency of isolated anteromedial (AM) or posterolateral (PL) bundle injuries in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction is unknown, and the value of MRI for prediction of this injury pattern is likewise unknown.

Questions/Purposes

We sought to determine (1) the proportion of knees with an intact AM or PL bundle in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction; (2) whether MRI predicted the bundle conditions seen at the time of surgery; and (3) whether the accuracy of the MRI prediction was affected by the timing of MRI after injury.

Methods

During primary ACL reconstructions of 156 knees, conditions of AM and PL bundles were separately examined and classified into three categories: (1) completely torn; (2) attenuated; and (3) intact. Then, the bundles were assessed by blinded observers on MRI and classified into the corresponding three categories for 77 patients who had an MRI at our institution using a standard protocol. Diagnostic accuracy of MRI was computed, and the early MRI group (≤ 6 weeks from injury to MRI acquisition) was compared with the late MRI group (> 6 weeks).

Results

Only 11 (7%) of the 156 knees we treated had an intact AM (one knee) or PL bundle (10 knees). Another 55 knees (35%) had a structurally continuous but attenuated AM or PL bundle. The overall diagnostic accuracy of MRI was 83%; accuracy was better for the AM bundle than the PL bundle (91% versus 78%; p = 0.026). MR prediction was less accurate in the early MRI group, particularly for PL bundle injury.

Conclusions

An isolated bundle tear is uncommon in patients with ACL tears undergoing reconstruction. MRI can help surgeons predict bundle injury pattern with satisfactory precision, but caution should be used in predicting PL bundle injury using MRI with early acquisition time from injury.

Level III, diagnostic study. See the Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### A tailored intervention does not reduce low value MRI's and arthroscopies in degenerative knee disease when the secular time trend is taken into account: a difference-in-difference analysis [^116fvF4X]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, many patients are still referred for a MRI or knee arthroscopy for symptomatic degenerative knee complaints. Smith et al. showed that in Australia knee MRI rates for patients aged 55 years and older increased from 216 per 100 000 to 1509 per 100 000 in 2017. Parent et al. showed that only 38% of patients 50 years and over with degenerative knee disease had a plain radiograph in the 24 months preceding the MRI. Regarding knee arthroscopy, Rietbergen et al. showed that in 2016 35% of knee arthroscopies in the Netherlands was performed without a documented valid surgical indication. Even more important 26% of these arthroscopies were performed on the patient's request.

To create more awareness and reduce the routine use of MRI and knee arthroscopy in degenerative knee disease, "Choosing Wisely" recommendations were developed in several countries. These are evidence-based recommendations by professional medical specialist societies regarding use of diagnostic tests and surgical procedures. It has been shown that low value care is not reduced by a passive approach of only publishing these "Choosing Wisely" recommendations. Tailored, active, interventions are more likely to succeed in orthopaedic centers that still routinely perform these low value care diagnostics and surgical procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of such a tailored intervention to reduce low value MRIs and arthroscopies in patients ≥ 50 years with degenerative knee disease in 13 Dutch orthopaedic centers (intervention group) compared with all other Dutch orthopaedic centers (control group). The hypothesis was that orthopaedic centers receiving the tailored intervention will reduce the use of low value MRI and knee arthroscopy to a greater extent than all other Dutch orthopaedic centers.

### Academy of orthopaedic surgeons clinical practice guideline summary: management of acute isolated meniscal pathology [^114JTF3E]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Indications for acute surgical intervention — acute isolated meniscal pathology include two consensus opinions: In the absence of sufficient evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that patients with a displaced or displacing acute meniscal tear, particularly those restricting knee range of motion, can benefit from acute surgical intervention. In the absence of sufficient evidence, it is the opinion of the workgroup that patients with a symptomatic acute meniscal tear who could benefit from a repair should be considered for early surgical intervention. Quality of Evidence: Very Low and Strength of Option: Consensus, with the guideline noting that there is no supporting evidence, or limited level evidence was downgraded due to major concerns addressed in the EtD framework and that in the absence of reliable evidence, the guideline work group is making a recommendation based on their clinical opinion. There is a paucity of research comparing outcomes from operative and nonoperative treatment of isolated acute meniscal tears, and surgery carries general risks including death, neurovascular injury, infection, thromboembolic events, and postoperative sequelae such as joint stiffness or degeneration. Nondisplaced tears unlikely to be repairable have little downside if delayed surgical treatment is necessary after initial nonoperative management, whereas displaced meniscal tears blocking knee motion or meniscal tears likely to be repairable have potential downsides of delaying surgical intervention. Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation is less accurate than direct arthroscopic visualization to determine meniscal tear type, location and tissue viability, which guide the decision to repair or resect, treatment plans may change during surgery and modify postoperative rehabilitation and recovery.

### Is magnetic resonance imaging overused among patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty? [^115V84kK]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 58.5 million people (24% of all adults) live with arthritis. Of the 58.5 million, 14 million people endure symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA). Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a standard surgical treatment of individuals with late-stage OA who have not benefited from conservative treatment. By 2030, the number of TKAs done will reach 3.48 million annually. As the prevalence of knee OA and surgical treatment increases, healthcare systems must implement cost-effective diagnostic tools and management for individuals with moderate-to-severe arthritis.

Patients indicated for TKA often have moderate-to-severe arthritis, which can be adequately diagnosed through weight-bearing radiography. Radiography remains the benchmark imaging modality for assessing the severity of arthritic changes in the knee. Specifically, weight-bearing radiography with four or more views allows comprehensive visualization of the progression of knee OA and can identify characteristic features of osteoarthritis, such as osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis and cysts, and joint space narrowing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also used as a diagnostic tool for musculoskeletal derangements after first-line radiographic imaging. However, MRIs are considered inappropriate as a diagnostic tool in late-stage OA but are often overused by referring providers.

Previous studies have found that MRIs are overused by referring providers for patients with moderate-to-severe OA who have been diagnosed through a thorough physical examination and radiography. In addition, studies have found that some MRIs are done without adequate first-line radiographic imaging.MRIs can be used in cases when an individual presents with symptoms that are out of proportion to what is reported on an initial radiograph and to further visualize the various soft tissues in the joint, such as cartilage, menisci, bone, and soft tissue. Although knee MRIs can provide more insight into soft-tissue changes, MRIs are generally deemed unnecessary before orthopaedic surgery consultation if a patient has had previous radiographic imaging demonstrating moderate or severe arthritis. This overutilization of MRIs can lead to increased healthcare costs, increased financial burdens on patients, and delay of care for individuals who have a more urgent need for MRI.

### A biomechanical approach to MRI of acute knee injuries [^112cYwYm]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

MRI is routinely performed to evaluate acute complex knee injuries. This article will review the fundamental biomechanical forces underlying the most important and common injuries and correlate MRI findings with specific traumatic mechanisms.

Conclusion

MRI findings can reveal the traumatic mechanisms in many acute knee injuries. By applying a biomechanical approach in MRI interpretation, it is possible to use easily detected lesions, such as osseous contusion and ligament rupture, to predict subtle but important abnormalities that might otherwise be missed. This systematic focused analysis enables a more accurate and rapid interpretation of knee MR studies.

This article reviews the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the native and reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). MRI is the most accurate non-invasive modality to evaluate the ACL. Tears of the ACL manifest with direct and indirect signs. The reconstructed ACL has several complications including re-tear and anterior arthrofibrosis, which are also accurately assessed using MRI.

### Knee arthroscopy: evidence for a targeted approach [^1151eh23]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Targeted lesions: recent views on indications

Arthroscopy continues to have a role in the management of knee conditions. Arthroscopy has increased our understanding of intra-articular pathology and enables surgery to be performed with lower morbidity and less pain than open surgery. Focusing on knee surgery, scientific study has clearly shown that arthroscopic 'washout' for degenerative knee conditions is not better than non-operative treatment. However, many of the procedures where arthroscopy is used have not been subjected to such study, and a blanket condemnation of arthroscopy is inappropriate.

Substantial global efforts have directed the current place of arthroscopy in knee surgery. The British Association for Surgery of the Knee published a concept of targeted lesions where arthroscopy has a role and a practical approach that clinicians can follow. We agree that, for patients with advanced osteoarthritis on imaging or arthritic symptoms only, arthroscopic meniscal surgery is not recommended. Few would contest that in patients with a meniscal lesion and a locked knee, urgent arthroscopic surgery is recommended, and yet no trials have been performed in this setting. The challenging area is the role of partial meniscectomy in the degenerative knee where data are marred by broad inclusion criteria and trials with a high cross-over rate in patients recruited to a non-arthroscopic treatment arm. When authors questioned outcome from arthroscopic partial meniscectomy versus skin incisions only in a sham-controlled randomised trial in patients aged 35–55 years with knee pain and an MRI-verified meniscal tear, greater improvement was reported following surgery at 2 years. However, citing statistical uncertainty, underpowering and one-third crossover, the authors who had previously reported that arthroscopy was not beneficial, concluded that the results could not be generalised to the greater patient population.

### MRI of articular cartilage in OA: novel pulse sequences and compositional / functional markers [^113GYdxu]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2006). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its unique ability to image and characterize soft tissue non-invasively, has proven valuable in assessing cartilage in OA. The development of new, fast imaging methods with high contrast show promise to improve the magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of this disease. In addition to morphologic MRI methods, MRI contrast mechanisms under development may reveal detailed information about the physiology of cartilage. It is anticipated that these and other MRI techniques will play an increasingly important role in assessing the success or failure of therapies for OA. On December 5 and 6, 2002, OMERACT (Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Clinical Trials) and OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) held a workshop in Bethesda, MD aiming at providing a state-of-the-art review of imaging outcome measures for OA of the knee to help guide scientists and pharmaceutical companies in the use of MRI in multi-site studies of OA. Applications of MRI were initially reviewed by a multidisciplinary, international panel of expert scientists and physicians from academia, the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies. The findings of the panel were then presented to a wider group of participants for open discussion. The following report summarizes the results of these discussions with respect to novel MRI pulse sequences for evaluating articular cartilage of the knee in OA and notes any additional advances that have been made since.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute trauma to the knee [^112hM4aN]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

More than 500,000 visits to the emergency room occur annually in the United States, for acute knee trauma. Many of these are twisting injuries in young patients who can walk and bear weight, and emergent radiographs are not required. Several clinical decision rules have been devised that can considerably reduce the number of radiographs ordered without missing a clinically significant fracture. Although a fracture is seen on only 5% of emergency department knee radiographs, 86% of knee fractures result from blunt trauma. In patients with a fall or twisting injury who have focal tenderness, effusion, or inability to bear weight, radiographs should be the first imaging study obtained. If the radiograph shows no fracture, MRI is best for evaluating for a suspected meniscus or ligament tear, or the injuries from a reduced patellar dislocation. Patients with a knee dislocation should undergo radiographs and an MRI, as well as an angiographic study such as a fluoroscopic, CT, or MR angiogram. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures, by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

Apart from the 2012 CNAM study, we have not found any other study about the relevance of lower extremity MRI or knee MRI in France. A survey carried out in 2020 by the Académie Nationale de Médecine among 260 patients seen consecutively on the same day at an osteoarticular imaging center showed that 70% of MRI requests were incomplete, with the reason for the request specified for only 14% of patients. The authors underline the importance of integrating the obligation to provide sufficient clinical information into e-prescription software. Internationally, a recent systematic review of the literature concerning the appropriateness of diagnostic imaging found that for MRI of extremities, the overall appropriateness rate was 66% (n = 352/535). It is worth noting that the four underlying studies varied in sample size (55–300) and results (55–83%). One of the studies is focused on the knee; based on the availability of an electronic medical record (EMR) for every MRI performed in the Elche Health Department in Spain, the authors found that in 45% of cases (N = 135/300) the MRI prescription was inappropriate. The main situations of inappropriateness included the use of MRI as the initial imaging technique. The inappropriateness of knee MRI has also been studied in other countries and has shown that practices could be improved. In the USA, George et al, found that 22.8% of MRI examinations for non-traumatic knee pain realized in 2010 among Medicare and private insurance patients had been performed without prior radiography in the same calendar year. In a study conducted in Atlanta (Georgia), in 2019, Gonzalez et al observed that of 196 MRIs (over an 18-month period), 57% (108 knees) had "usually appropriate" (i.e. 7–9) and 43% (8 knees) had "usually not appropriate" (i.e. 1–3) appropriateness criteria scores (p > 0.1). In Italy, in 2016, a panel of experts compared a set of guidelines with data from 400 patients who underwent previous knee MRI and found that almost 21% of prescriptions were totally inappropriate and 18.8% were uncertain. The diffusion of guidelines could improve these practices. For example, a recent study by the North Bristol NHS Trust in the United Kingdom showed that the number of patients who underwent an MRI of the knee without a prior plain radiograph was 55/118 (47%) compared with 14/69 (20%) after the definition and dissemination of a referral pathway for a knee MRI. In Canada, the eHealth Center of Excellence in collaboration with clinicians showed that the rate of ordering X-rays as the proper initial imaging scan for patients presenting with knee pain has steadily increased by 10% over the year for users of the eReferral platform (an integrated clinical decision support tool for diagnostic imaging requests) compared to a decrease of 7% for those using fax.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute trauma to the knee [^111EiTS2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

There are more than 1 million visits to the ER annually in the United States for acute knee trauma. Many of these are twisting injuries in young patients who can walk and bear weight, and emergent radiography is not required. Several clinical decision rules have been devised that can considerably reduce the number of radiographic studies ordered without missing a clinically significant fracture. Although fractures are seen on only 5% of emergency department knee radiographs, 86% of knee fractures result from blunt trauma. In patients with falls or twisting injuries who have focal tenderness, effusion, or inability to bear weight, radiography should be the first imaging study performed. If radiography shows no fracture, MRI is best for evaluating for a suspected meniscal or ligament tear or patellar dislocation. Patients with knee dislocation should undergo radiography and MRI, as well as fluoroscopic angiography, CT angiography, or MR angiography. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria(®) are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The clinical utility and diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging for identification of early and advanced knee osteoarthritis: a systematic review [^111DWDk5]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Current diagnostic strategies for detection of structural articular cartilage abnormalities, the earliest structural signs of osteoarthritis, often do not capture the condition until it is too far advanced for the most potential benefit of noninvasive interventions.

Purpose

To systematically review the literature relative to the following questions: (1) Is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a valid, sensitive, specific, accurate, and reliable instrument to identify knee articular cartilage abnormalities compared with arthroscopy? (2) Is MRI a sensitive tool that can be utilized to identify early cartilage degeneration?

Study Design

Systematic review.

Methods

A systematic search was performed in November 2010 using PubMed MEDLINE (from 1966), CINAHL (from 1982), SPORTDiscus (from 1985), SCOPUS (from 1996), and EMBASE (from 1974) databases.

Results

Fourteen level I and 13 level II studies were identified that met inclusion criteria and provided information related to diagnostic performance of MRI compared with arthroscopic evaluation. The diagnostic performance of MRI demonstrated a large range of sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies. The sensitivity for identifying articular cartilage abnormalities in the knee joint was reported between 26% and 96%. Specificity and accuracy were reported between 50% and 100% and between 49% and 94%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for identifying early osteoarthritis were reported between 0% and 86%, 48% and 95%, and 5% and 94%, respectively. As a result of inconsistencies between imaging techniques and methodological shortcomings of many of the studies, a meta-analysis was not performed, and it was difficult to fully synthesize the information to state firm conclusions about the diagnostic performance of MRI.

Conclusion

There is evidence in some MRI protocols that MRI is a relatively valid, sensitive, specific, accurate, and reliable clinical tool for identifying articular cartilage degeneration. Because of heterogeneity of MRI sequences, it is not possible to make definitive conclusions regarding its global clinical utility for guiding diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Clinical Relevance

Traumatic sports injuries to the knee may be significant precursor events to early onset of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Magnetic resonance imaging may aid in early identification of structural injuries to articular cartilage as evidenced by articular cartilage degeneration grading.

### Editorial commentary: magnetic resonance imaging of the knee anterolateral ligament: does It really matter? [^117ENArK]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Great interest remains in the structures of the knee anterolateral complex and how they work synergistically with the anterior cruciate ligament to control anterolateral rotatory laxity. Many studies have now used magnetic resonance imaging to assess the degree of damage to the anterolateral ligament. The systematic review described in this commentary rigorously highlights the many deficiencies that exist within our current understanding of the imaging analysis of these structures. Marked variability in the definition of anterolateral ligament injury, significant methodological differences, and the lack of a gold standard reference make it very challenging to translate the findings of these imaging studies into clinical practice. More information is required to fully understand the injury pattern, and then clinical studies are needed to guide treatment. Hopefully we will then have the ability to better treat our patients with these challenging complex laxity patterns that exist over and above an isolated anterior cruciate ligament injury.
