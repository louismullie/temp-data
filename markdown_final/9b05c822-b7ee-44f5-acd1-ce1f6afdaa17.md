## Question

Lewy body dementia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Lewy body dementia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about nomenclature and the 1-year rule that differentiates dementia with Lewy bodies from Parkinson's disease dementia. Then, I should verify core clinical features and the consensus diagnostic criteria with biomarkers. Next, I will review prodromal states and differential diagnosis, including biomarker-assisted distinctions from Alzheimer's disease. After that, I need to evaluate a pragmatic management approach emphasizing safety, neuroleptic sensitivity, and evidence-based pharmacologic choices. Finally, I will consider prognosis, monitoring tools, standardized scales to improve detection, and research gaps, making sure to self-check key claims against the cited literature throughout.

> Let me first confirm the conceptual framework and nomenclature. Lewy body dementia is best used as an umbrella term encompassing two related syndromes: dementia with Lewy bodies when dementia precedes or occurs within one year of parkinsonism onset, and Parkinson's disease dementia when dementia follows well-established Parkinson's disease by more than a year; I should verify that maintaining the 1-year rule remains the prevailing recommendation for clinical practice and research stratification, which multiple expert groups continue to endorse despite its arbitrariness in individual cases [^1124mNA6] [^113WS4vW] [^114tdASn].

> Wait, let me verify the pathological foundation before moving further. The shared substrate is α-synuclein aggregation into Lewy bodies and neurites, but I need to check how often co-pathology with Alzheimer-type changes occurs; contemporary data indicate that approximately half of Lewy body disease cases harbor concomitant amyloid and tau pathology, which substantially modifies phenotype, accelerates progression, and complicates biomarker interpretation and diagnostic sensitivity, reinforcing the need for integrated clinical-biological assessment [^116bUGrT] [^116MfVLr] [^111wTxUv].

> Next, I will examine the core clinical features to anchor bedside recognition. I should confirm that early, prominent deficits in attention, executive function, and visuospatial abilities with fluctuations, recurrent formed visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and REM sleep behavior disorder define the syndrome; I also need to remember the high risk of severe neuroleptic sensitivity as a red flag that should immediately heighten suspicion and shape management decisions [^113tumy2].

> Hold on, I should verify the current criteria framework and biomarker categories. I initially wrote "suggestive biomarkers", but wait, the 2017 Fourth DLB Consortium uses "indicative biomarkers", including reduced dopamine transporter uptake on SPECT, abnormal cardiac 123-I MIBG scintigraphy, and REM sleep without atonia on polysomnography; α-synuclein seed amplification assays in CSF or skin are emerging with high diagnostic promise for detecting Lewy pathology, though I need to be cautious about availability and standardization in routine practice, while DAT-SPECT retains good diagnostic utility in specialized settings [^113tumy2] [^116bUGrT] [^1149Kv74].

> I will now examine prodromal and early-stage presentations. Let me first confirm that MCI with Lewy bodies has operationalized research criteria and that psychiatric-onset and delirium-onset phenotypes are recognized but not yet fully codified for clinical use; I should double-check that the hazard of conversion to dementia increases with each additional Lewy feature in MCI cohorts, with cognitive fluctuations conferring particularly high risk, which underscores the value of systematic screening for fluctuations and hallucinations in MCI [^115frHog] [^117X7J89] [^114YZ1De].

> Next, I should review how to execute a biomarker-assisted differential diagnosis, especially versus Alzheimer's disease. I initially stated that DLB typically shows normal CSF Alzheimer biomarkers early, but wait, I need to correct that oversimplification because AD co-pathology is common in LBD and will often shift CSF Aβ42 and tau into AD-like ranges; therefore, a multimodal approach using DAT imaging, polysomnographic confirmation of REM sleep without atonia, quantitative EEG features of slowing and fluctuating spectral power, and careful cognitive profiling is essential to adjudicate mixed presentations and avoid misclassification, particularly early in the disease course [^114xibzN] [^113tumy2] [^114CdwZE].

> Let me consider bedside-to-biology integration for DLB versus PDD. The practical clinical differentiator remains the 1-year rule for temporal sequencing of motor and cognitive syndromes, acknowledging that both fall on a clinicopathological continuum of α-synuclein disease; I should confirm that while this distinction is operational and clinically useful, it does not imply fundamentally different biology, and both phenotypes should generally be included across therapeutic trials targeting Lewy pathology [^113WS4vW] [^1123n7Wu] [^1124mNA6].

> I will now outline a management strategy, taking care not to jump to conclusions that a single intervention will address all domains. First-line nonpharmacologic measures should be prioritized, including structured exercise, cognitive training focused on attention/executive deficits, caregiver education, environmental adjustments for safety, and sleep and autonomic optimization; this helps mitigate symptom burden and reduce exposure to medications that may precipitate delirium or worsen neuropsychiatric symptoms [^111G9Qjq].

> Turning to pharmacotherapy, I need to ensure I prioritize treatments with the strongest evidence and safest profiles. Cholinesterase inhibitors are first-line for cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms, with randomized evidence for donepezil efficacy in DLB and meta-analytic support for donepezil and rivastigmine; memantine may confer additional benefit for some patients but with more variable effects, and I should avoid anticholinergics and use dopaminergic agents judiciously due to psychosis risk, reserving quetiapine or clozapine with close monitoring if antipsychotics are absolutely necessary because of severe neuroleptic sensitivity in this population [^113V4EVd] [^113GwBhF] [^111G9Qjq].

> But wait, I should also address prognostication and monitoring cadence. Median survival in DLB may be shorter than in typical AD, and I need to verify that structured follow-up detects clinically meaningful changes over six-month intervals; given the frequent AD co-pathology driving faster progression and shorter survival, I should schedule biannual cognitive assessments, yearly motor, psychiatric, sleep, and autonomic reviews, and frequent medication reconciliation to prevent iatrogenic decompensation, with earlier reassessment if fluctuations or delirium emerge [^115XsmjW] [^112x4b5h] [^116MfVLr].

> Hold on, I should verify how to improve detection in routine practice where sensitivity is lowest. Standardized tools like the Lewy Body Composite Risk Score with a cut-off of 3 markedly improve discrimination for both dementia and MCI stages, and the LeSCoD scale further enhances clinic-based detection; where accessible, α-synuclein seed amplification assays can augment diagnostic confidence, though workflows should still integrate clinical core features and indicative biomarkers to maintain specificity [^111mifxy] [^114hx6TW] [^116bUGrT].

> Let me reconsider the role of AD biomarkers and co-pathology when counseling patients. I should confirm that integrating CSF or PET AD biomarkers into the evaluation of LBD improves prognostic precision, helps anticipate treatment response heterogeneity, and may justify earlier and more frequent monitoring in mixed cases, but clinicians must communicate that biomarker positivity does not linearly map to neuropathological severity in LBD as it often does in pure AD, necessitating clinical correlation [^116bUGrT] [^116MfVLr].

> Finally, I need to address research gaps and future directions, and I should double-check that my wording does not overstate current capabilities. Although α-synuclein assays are promising, they are not yet universally standardized for routine staging or phenotypic discrimination, and disease-modifying therapies remain an unmet need; future work should refine biological staging that incorporates timing and interactions among α-synuclein, amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration to optimize selection for trials and the timing of targeted interventions, while expanding access to reliable biomarkers across settings [^111189Sx] [^112N68kY] [^115GMLnY].

Lewy body dementia (LBD) is a neurodegenerative disorder defined by **alpha-synuclein aggregates** (Lewy bodies) in the brain, causing progressive cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and fluctuating cognition [^111G9Qjq]. It is the **second most common dementia** after Alzheimer's disease, with a median survival of approximately 4.1 years from diagnosis [^115XsmjW]. Diagnosis relies on **clinical criteria** supported by **biomarkers** such as dopamine transporter imaging and polysomnography [^111G9Qjq] [^1149Kv74]. Management is **symptomatic** — using cholinesterase inhibitors [^113V4EVd] for cognition and cautious antipsychotic use given severe neuroleptic sensitivity [^113GwBhF] [^115GMLnY]. No disease-modifying therapies exist, and prognosis is poor, especially with coexisting Alzheimer's pathology [^116bUGrT].

---

## Clinical features

LBD presents with a **characteristic constellation of symptoms**, including:

- **Cognitive impairment**: Early deficits in attention, executive function, and visuospatial abilities, with relatively preserved memory initially [^111hCseh].

- **Fluctuating cognition**: Marked fluctuations in attention and alertness, often with transient confusion and communicative difficulties [^114CdwZE].

- **Visual hallucinations**: Recurrent, well-formed visual hallucinations are a core feature [^111hCseh].

- **Parkinsonism**: Spontaneous motor features such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability [^111b3XuQ].

- **REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)**: Acting out dreams due to loss of normal muscle atonia during REM sleep [^111G9Qjq].

- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Orthostatic hypotension, urinary incontinence, and constipation [^115GMLnY].

- **Neuroleptic sensitivity**: Severe reactions to antipsychotic medications, including rigidity, confusion, and autonomic instability [^111hCseh].

---

## Pathophysiology

The **hallmark pathological feature** of LBD is the accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates (Lewy bodies) [^111189Sx] within neurons, particularly in cortical and subcortical regions. This pathology overlaps substantially with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), prompting ongoing debate about classification [^111b3XuQ]. Coexisting Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology — including amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles — is common and associated with accelerated cognitive decline and poorer prognosis [^116bUGrT].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and biomarkers

Diagnosis of LBD is based on **clinical criteria**, established by the Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) Consortium:

- **Core clinical features**: Fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and RBD [^111G9Qjq].

- **Indicative biomarkers**: Reduced dopamine transporter uptake on SPECT or PET imaging, polysomnographic confirmation of REM sleep without atonia, and abnormal cardiac MIBG scintigraphy [^1149Kv74].

- **Supportive clinical features**: Severe neuroleptic sensitivity, autonomic dysfunction, and hypersomnia [^111G9Qjq].

- **Supportive biomarkers**: FDG-PET showing occipital hypometabolism, MRI showing relative preservation of medial temporal lobe structures, and EEG showing prominent posterior slow-wave activity [^111G9Qjq].

---

## Differentiation from Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia

LBD can be **differentiated from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD)** by clinical features and biomarkers [^1124mNA6]:

| **Feature** | **LBD** | **AD** | **PDD** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cognitive impairment | Early visuospatial and executive deficits | Early memory impairment | Cognitive impairment after established PD |
| Visual hallucinations | Common | Rare | Less common |
| Parkinsonism | Early or concurrent with dementia | Rare | Established PD before dementia |
| Fluctuating cognition | Common | Rare | Less common |
| REM sleep behavior disorder | Common | Rare | Common |
| Dopamine transporter imaging | Reduced uptake | Normal | Reduced uptake |
| Amyloid-beta pathology | Commonly coexists | Primary pathology | Rare |

---

## Treatment and management strategies

Currently, there are **no disease-modifying therapies** for LBD; management focuses on **symptomatic treatment** [^115GMLnY]:

- **Cognitive symptoms**: Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine) [^113V4EVd] are effective in improving cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^113GwBhF].

- **Motor symptoms**: Levodopa may be used cautiously, but motor symptoms are less responsive than in PD [^111G9Qjq].

- **Neuropsychiatric symptoms**: Antipsychotics should be avoided due to severe neuroleptic sensitivity; if necessary, quetiapine or clozapine may be used cautiously [^111hCseh].

- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Exercise, cognitive training, and caregiver education are recommended [^111G9Qjq].

---

## Prognosis and progression

LBD carries a **poor prognosis**, with median survival of approximately 4.1 years from diagnosis and 95% mortality at 10 years [^115XsmjW]. Coexisting Alzheimer's pathology accelerates cognitive decline and worsens prognosis [^116bUGrT].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research and future directions focus on **biomarker development** — including alpha-synuclein assays and imaging — to enable early diagnosis and differentiation from other dementias [^111189Sx]. Efforts also target disease-modifying strategies to reduce alpha-synuclein aggregation and related pathology, and ongoing clinical trials are evaluating novel therapeutic agents and interventions to slow disease progression.

---

Lewy body dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by alpha-synuclein aggregates, leading to cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and fluctuating cognition. Diagnosis relies on **clinical criteria and biomarkers**, and management is **symptomatic**, with **no disease-modifying therapies** currently available.

### Diagnosis and management of dementia with Lewy bodies: Fourth consensus report of the DLB Consortium [^111G9Qjq]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of patients with DLB is complex, requiring a multifaceted approach. Key elements include a thorough initial evaluation to ensure accurate diagnosis; early identification of signs and symptoms requiring intervention; engagement, education, and support of care providers; and a multidisciplinary team approach. Patients with DLB are prone to mental status worsening, including delirium, in the face of comorbid medical disorders. Dopaminergic therapies and anticholinergic medications can adversely affect cognition and behavior, leading to confusion and psychosis. Treatment of DLB is focused on the cognitive, psychiatric, motor, and other nonmotor symptoms that represent the core or most common features of the disorder. A combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches is optimal. As the evidence base to support particular treatments remains limited, the recommendations outlined below remain based, in part, upon consensus expert opinion.

- **Nonpharmacologic interventions**: Given both the limited evidence for efficacy and the potential increased morbidity and mortality risks associated with pharmacologic treatments in DLB, there is a need to develop and test nonpharmacologic management strategies. Interventions can be patient- or caregiver-focused, or both. More research in this area has been conducted in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) than in DLB, with promising preliminary evidence for exercise (both motor and cognitive benefits), cognitive training, and caregiver-oriented education and training to manage psychiatric symptoms including agitation.

### Clinical and diagnostic implications of Alzheimer's disease copathology in Lewy body disease [^116bUGrT]. Brain (2024). High credibility.

Concomitant Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is a frequent event in the context of Lewy body disease (LBD), occurring in approximately half of all cases. Evidence shows that LBD patients with AD copathology exhibit an accelerated disease course, a greater risk of cognitive decline, and an overall poorer prognosis. However, LBD-AD cases may display heterogeneous motor and non-motor phenotypes with a higher risk of dementia, leading to frequent misdiagnosis. In this review, we summarize the understanding of LBD-AD by discussing the synergistic effects of AD neuropathological changes and Lewy pathology, as well as their clinical relevance.

Furthermore, we provide an extensive overview of neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers under assessment for use in LBD-AD, evaluating their potential diagnostic and prognostic values. AD pathology can be predicted in vivo using CSF, MRI, and PET markers, whereas the most promising technique for identifying Lewy pathology in various biological tissues at the time of writing is the α-synuclein seed amplification assay. While pathological imaging and CSF AD biomarkers are associated with a higher likelihood of cognitive decline in LBD, they do not always reflect the neuropathological severity as in pure AD. Implementing the use of blood-based AD biomarkers might allow faster screening of LBD patients for AD copathology, thereby improving the overall diagnostic sensitivity for LBD-AD.

Finally, we discuss the literature on novel candidate biomarkers being explored in LBD-AD to investigate other aspects of neurodegeneration, such as neuroaxonal injury and glial activation.

### Prevalence, timing and characteristics of delirium preceding dementia with Lewy bodies: a retrospective case series [^115XsmjW]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia after Alzheimer's dementia (AD), accounting for 4.2% of dementia diagnoses in community-dwelling populations. The combined prevalence, including neuropathological studies, is higher at around 15%, reflecting high rates of misdiagnosis due to the variable cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor presentations associated with heterogeneous Lewy body pathology distributions, and varying AD-related co-pathology. Criteria for a clinical diagnosis of probable DLB require the presence of dementia in association with two or more core clinical features, including spontaneous visual hallucinations, cognitive fluctuations, parkinsonism, and rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), with or without indicative biomarkers, or the presence of one core clinical feature with one or more indicative biomarkers.

Patients diagnosed with DLB have a median survival of 4.1 years from diagnosis, with 95% mortality at 10 years, despite their first clinical symptoms and signs manifesting up to 15 years or more before diagnosis. This means that clinicians, researchers, and, most importantly, patients are likely missing the opportunity for disease modification and disease-specific management strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality at the earliest point in time where they might be most effective. To address this shortfall, three prodromal phenotypes were proposed: mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB), psychiatric-onset DLB, and delirium-onset DLB.

### Dementia with Lewy bodies [^111hCseh]. The Lancet Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia in older people. It is part of the range of clinical presentations that share a neuritic pathology based on abnormal aggregation of the synaptic protein alpha-synuclein. DLB has many clinical and pathological characteristics similar to the dementia that occurs during the course of Parkinson's disease. Here, we review the state of scientific knowledge on DLB. Accurate identification of patients is crucial because they have specific symptoms, impairments, and functional disabilities that differ from those of other common types of dementia. Severe neuroleptic sensitivity reactions are associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors is well tolerated by most patients and substantially improves cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Clear guidance on the management of DLB is urgently needed. Virtually unrecognized 20 years ago, DLB could, within this decade, become one of the most treatable neurodegenerative disorders of late life.

### Systematic review of pharmacological interventions for people with Lewy body dementia [^113GwBhF]. Aging & Mental Health (2023). Low credibility.

Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia, causing earlier mortality and more morbidity than Alzheimer's disease. Reviewing evidence on its pharmacological management is essential for developing evidence-based clinical guidelines and improving the quality of clinical care. Hence, we systematically reviewed all studies that investigated the efficacy of any medication for managing various symptoms of LBD.

- **Method**: We identified eligible studies through comprehensive searches of 15 databases. We completed quality assessment, extracted relevant data, and performed a GRADE assessment of available evidence. We conducted meta-analyses when appropriate (PROSPERO:CRD42020182166).

- **Results**: We screened 18,884 papers and included 135 studies. Our meta-analyses confirmed level-1 evidence for Donepezil's efficacy in managing cognitive symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (SMD = 0.63; p < 0.001) and Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD) (SMD = 0.43; p < 0.01), as well as managing hallucinations in DLB (SMD = -0.52; p = 0.02). Rivastigmine and Memantine have level-2 evidence for managing cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms of DLB. Olanzapine and Yokukansan have similar evidence for managing DLB neuropsychiatric symptoms. Level-2 evidence supports the efficacy of Rivastigmine and Galantamine for managing cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms of PDD.

- **Conclusion**: We list evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacological management of DLB and PDD, and propose specific clinical guidelines for improving their clinical care.

### Dopamine transporter imaging for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies [^1149Kv74]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common cause of neurodegenerative dementia in the elderly. Accurate recognition of DLB is important in clinical management and is essential for developing disease-modifying treatments. The clinical diagnostic criteria are notably limited by relatively poor sensitivity. Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is the most developed supplementary test for DLB and is now included as a suggestive feature in the consensus diagnostic criteria. However, there is uncertainty about its accuracy and role in clinical practice. It is most commonly used in individuals already suspected of having DLB.

- **Objectives**: We had two objectives in this review: (A) to estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for diagnosing DLB in people with dementia in secondary care (specialist dementia services), and (B) to estimate the accuracy of DAT imaging for diagnosing DLB in people with dementia in secondary care who are already suspected of having DLB based on a prior clinical work-up.

- **Search methods**: We searched MEDLINE (1946 to February 2013), Embase (1980 to February 2013), BIOSIS Previews (1926 to February 2013), PsycINFO (1806 to February 2013), CINAHL (1982 to February 2013), LILACS (February 2013), and Web of Science and Conference Proceedings (ISI Web of Science) (1945 to February 2013). Several of these sources contain conference abstracts. We also searched four specialized databases containing diagnostic reviews: Meta-analyses van Diagnostisch.

### Progression of clinical features in Lewy body dementia can be detected over 6 months [^112x4b5h]. Neurology (2021). High credibility.

This study analyzed data from 127 participants with Lewy body dementia (77 with dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB] and 50 with Parkinson's disease dementia [PDD]) as part of a cluster randomized trial. The Diagnosis and Management of Neurodegenerative Dementia (DIAMOND-Lewy) Study (ISRCTN11083027) was conducted between 2016 and 2017 in 23 memory or movement disorder services across eight jurisdictions of the UK National Health Service (NHS). These included four trusts in North East England as well as four trusts in East Anglia. Participants were clinically assessed and diagnosed with probable DLB or PDD according to consensus criteria.

In the study, half of the services were randomized to receive a management toolkit that included a summary of evidence-based guidelines for symptomatic treatment of Lewy body dementia. These guidelines have been freely available since the conclusion of the study. The remaining services continued with standard care, serving as a control group. From these services, a total of 131 participants were recruited, with assessments scheduled at baseline, three months, and six months. Of these, 127 participants underwent baseline assessments.

For final analysis, only participants with data from at least two time points were considered, given the study's focus on assessing the rate of change. This criterion led to the exclusion of 11 participants who could not be followed up after the baseline measurement. Consequently, 116 participants were included in the final analysis (72 DLB and 44 PDD), with data collected for all three time points in 107 patients, baseline and three months in seven patients, and baseline and six months in two patients. Results regarding the main intervention of the trial have been recently published.

The differential diagnoses in this case include Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and normal pressure hydrocephalus.

### Consensus guidelines for the clinical and pathologic diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB): Report of the Consortium on DLB International Workshop [^116q8Hgk]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) was considered to be an uncommon cause of dementia until improved neuropathological staining methods for ubiquitin were developed in the late 1980s. Subsequent recognition that 10–15% of dementia cases in older people were associated with Lewy body pathology led to the publication in 1996 of consensus clinical and pathological diagnostic criteria for the disorder. These have greatly raised global awareness of DLB and helped to generate a body of knowledge which informs modern clinical management of this pharmacologically sensitive group of patients. They have also enabled important issues surrounding the relationships of DLB with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease to be addressed and partially resolved. A recent re-evaluation of the consensus criteria has confirmed many aspects of the original recommendations, supplementing these with suggestions for improved pathological characterization, clinical detection, and management. Virtually unrecognized 20 years ago, DLB could within this decade be one of the best characterized and potentially treatable neurodegenerative disorders of late life.

### Research criteria for the diagnosis of prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies [^115frHog]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The prodromal phase of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) includes (1) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), (2) delirium-onset, and (3) psychiatric-onset presentations. The purpose of our review is to determine whether there is sufficient information available to justify the development of diagnostic criteria for each of these. Our goal is to achieve evidence-based recommendations for the recognition of DLB at a predementia, symptomatic stage. We propose operationalized diagnostic criteria for probable and possible mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies, intended for use in research settings pending validation for clinical practice. They are compatible with criteria for other prodromal neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. Although there is still insufficient evidence to propose formal criteria for delirium-onset and psychiatric-onset presentations of DLB, it is important to characterize them, raising the index of diagnostic suspicion and prioritizing them for further investigation.

### Validation of the neuropathologic criteria of the Third Consortium for Dementia with Lewy bodies for prospectively diagnosed cases [^112dr14R]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

There is limited information on the validity of the pathologic criteria of the Third Consortium on Dementia with Lewy bodies (CDLB), and none are based on prospectively diagnosed cases. In this study, the core clinical features of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and the suggestive clinical feature of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder were assessed using a battery of standardized clinical instruments in 76 patients with the clinical diagnosis of either DLB or Alzheimer disease.

At autopsy, 29 patients had high-likelihood, 17 had intermediate-likelihood, and 6 had low-likelihood DLB pathology. The frequency of core clinical features and the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of probable DLB were significantly greater in high-likelihood than in low-likelihood cases. This is consistent with the concept that the DLB clinical syndrome is directly related to Lewy body pathology and inversely related to Alzheimer pathology.

Thus, the Third Consortium on DLB neuropathologic criteria scheme performed reasonably well and are useful for estimating the likelihood of the premortem DLB syndrome based on postmortem findings. In view of differences in the frequency of clinically probable DLB in cases with Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages V (90%) and VI (20%) and diffuse cortical Lewy bodies, a possible modification of the scheme is to consider cases with neurofibrillary tangle stage VI to be low-likelihood DLB.

### Are dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia the same disease [^1124mNA6]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's Disease Dementia (PDD), which share many clinical, neurochemical, and morphological features, have been incorporated into DSM-5 as two separate entities of major neurocognitive disorders with Lewy bodies. Despite their clinical overlap, diagnosis is based on an arbitrary distinction concerning the time of onset of motor and cognitive symptoms — namely, early cognitive impairment in DLB and later onset following motor symptoms in PDD. Their morphological hallmarks — cortical and subcortical α-synuclein/Lewy body plus β-amyloid and tau pathologies — are similar, yet clinical differences at onset suggest some dissimilar profiles. Based on recent publications, including the fourth consensus report of the DLB Consortium, a critical overview is provided herein.

- **Discussion**: The clinical constellations of DLB and PDD include cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, and fluctuating attention. Intravitam PET and postmortem studies have revealed a more pronounced cortical atrophy, elevated cortical and limbic Lewy body pathologies, and higher Aβ and tau loads in the cortex and striatum in DLB compared to PDD, as well as earlier cognitive defects in DLB. Conversely, multitracer PET studies have shown no differences in cortical and striatal cholinergic and dopaminergic deficits. Clinical management of both DLB and PDD includes cholinesterase inhibitors and other pharmacologic and non-drug strategies, yet with only mild symptomatic effects. Currently, no disease-modifying therapies are available.

Pathologic assessment and diagnostic criteria for DLB

The previously published methods for pathologic assessment and diagnosis of Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) should continue to be used with only a few modifications, as shown in Table 2, which predicts the likelihood that the pathologic findings will be associated with a typical DLB clinical syndrome, i.e. cases with a high likelihood are expected to fulfill clinical criteria for probable DLB, whereas low-likelihood cases may have few or no DLB clinical features.

Table 2: Assessment of the likelihood that the pathologic findings are associated with a typical dementia with Lewy bodies clinical syndrome

Table 2 assigns categories of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) neuropathologic change according to National Institute on Aging–Alzheimer's Association criteria (no, low, intermediate, and high) and adds previously omitted categories of Lewy-related pathology, including olfactory bulb only and amygdala predominant. Both of these are considered to be low-likelihood DLB but may, in the future, be useful in assessing prodromal disease. Further efforts are required to develop better interrater reliability for Lewy-related disease subtypes (olfactory bulb only, amygdala predominant, brainstem, limbic [transitional], and diffuse neocortical). Table 2 also includes an assessment of substantia nigra neuronal loss (none, mild, moderate, and severe) to subclassify cases into those likely or not to have parkinsonism (DLB-P and DLB-no P).

### Research diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117X7J89]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). High credibility.

We followed the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Inclusion criteria involve original data investigating the presence of one or more of the diagnostic features in MCI-LB. The presence of diagnostic features in MCI-LB could be demonstrated by:
	1. Data from the MCI phase in cases of autopsy-confirmed Lewy body (LB) disease (post mortem studies).
	2. Data from the MCI phase in participants diagnosed with clinical DLB at later follow-up assessments.
	3. Data from cohorts of clinically diagnosed MCI-LB, defined using recognized criteria (e.g. McKeith 2020 or previous McKeith DLB criteria applied to MCI cases).

	- For prevalence rates of core clinical features, only data from articles demonstrating MCI-LB by methods 1 or 2 were included, to avoid circularity. For reports of diagnostic accuracy of proposed biomarkers, only cases diagnosed in the absence of the biomarker of interest were included to avoid circularity. It was necessary for inclusion that data were available relating exclusively to MCI-LB participants (i.e. not data that included MCI-LB and DLB or MCI-LB and Parkinson's disease [PD]-MCI mixed together).

- **Exclusion criteria**: Cohorts only reporting Parkinson's disease PD-MCI (defined by the 1-year rule); cross-sectional or longitudinal cohorts of idiopathic RBD without MCI, or mixed RBD with/without MCI; reviews; editorials; case studies or clinical case series with fewer than 10 cases.

### It is time to share Alzheimer biomarker results in dementia with Lewy bodies [^116MfVLr]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

The presence of AD co-pathology in individuals with DLB is associated with differences in clinical presentation and progression. As the degree of AD neuropathology increases, individuals with Lewy body pathology are increasingly likely to have a DLB clinical phenotype (i.e. early dementia) compared to the phenotype of PD or PD dementia. DLB diagnostic criteria are less sensitive for individuals with transitional and diffuse Lewy body pathology in the presence of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles (NFT); however, this leads to longer latencies in diagnosis.

AD co-pathology also affects the frequency of core features, with less frequent parkinsonism and RBD in individuals with DLB and higher Braak NFT stages. Hallucinations were more common in individuals with DLB and AD co-pathology in one study but not in others. Individuals with DLB and AD co-pathology have worse cognitive impairment and worse performance in memory and language domains than individuals with DLB but no evidence of AD.

Numerous studies now show that individuals with clinically diagnosed DLB and either biomarker or pathologic evidence of AD co-pathology have faster clinical and cognitive progression, though this is not universal. Multiple studies also show shorter survival in individuals with DLB and evidence of AD co-pathology, though one study found that survival was driven more by the severity of Lewy pathology. In a recent systematic review, all studies assessed as having a low risk of bias found that co-morbid AD pathology in individuals with DLB was associated with faster cognitive and functional decline.

### Progression to dementia in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies or Alzheimer disease [^114YZ1De]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

To determine whether mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies or mild cognitive impairment with Alzheimer disease differ in their rates of clinical progression to dementia, we undertook longitudinal observation of mild cognitive impairment cases with detailed clinical assessment of Lewy body diagnostic characteristics.

- **Methods**: Two prospective longitudinal cohorts, including 111 individuals aged 60 years or older with mild cognitive impairment, were assessed annually to track cognitive and clinical progression. This included evaluating the presence or absence of core clinical features and proposed biomarkers of dementia with Lewy bodies. Multistate modeling was employed to assess the associations of diagnostic characteristics of dementia with Lewy bodies with clinical progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, considering death as a competing outcome.

- **Results**: After a mean follow-up period of 2.2 years (range 1–6.7 years), 38 of the 111 participants (34%) progressed to dementia: 10 with Alzheimer's disease, 3 with possible dementia with Lewy bodies, and 25 with probable dementia with Lewy bodies. The presence of any Lewy body disease characteristic was associated with an increased hazard of transition to dementia. This risk increased further with more observed diagnostic characteristics (hazard ratio 1.33 per characteristic, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.60) and was especially high for those experiencing complex visual hallucinations (hazard ratio 1.98, 95% CI 0.92–4.29) or cognitive fluctuations (hazard ratio 3.99, 95% CI 2.03–7.84).

- **Conclusions**: Diagnostic characteristics of Lewy body disease were associated with an elevated risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia.

### Clinicians' ability to diagnose dementia with Lewy bodies is not affected by β-amyloid load [^111bFn9R]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

To investigate whether an increasing load of β-amyloid and/or neuritic plaques influences the phenotype, and thus the clinical diagnostic accuracy, of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

- **Methods**: A series of 64 subjects with autopsy-proven DLB was studied. The last diagnosis before death was used to determine the clinical diagnostic accuracy of DLB in relation to Lewy body distribution and the extent of Alzheimer β-amyloid and/or neuritic pathology. The DLB pathologic diagnosis was made according to consensus criteria, using α-synuclein immunostaining for Lewy body identification. β-amyloid immunostaining was used for quantifying β-amyloid deposits. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease criteria and Braak stage were applied for semiquantitative grading of neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathology.

- **Results**: Overall clinical diagnostic accuracy for the entire DLB cohort was high (80%), reflecting the high prevalence of core clinical features: fluctuations (81%), parkinsonism (77%), and visual hallucinations (70%). Lower frequencies of core clinical features of DLB, resulting in lower accuracy of its clinical diagnosis, were associated with decreasing Lewy body distribution (p < 0.0001) and with increasing neuritic plaque pathology (p = 0.035), but not with the number of β-amyloid plaque deposits.

- **Conclusions**: The likelihood of occurrence of the DLB clinical syndrome is positively related to the extent of Lewy body pathology and negatively related to the severity of Alzheimer neuritic pathology, while β-amyloid load has no effect.

### Using cerebrospinal fluid marker profiles in clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease [^114xibzN]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is difficult to differentiate from other neurodegenerative diseases. Patients are often mistaken to suffer from Parkinson's disease (PD) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of the overlapping clinical appearances concerning cognition and movement.

- **Objective**: We investigated the possibility for a valid differential diagnosis using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers.

- **Methods**: In the context of a large retrospective study, we analyzed data of patients suffering from degenerative, ischemic, or inflammatory CNS (central nervous system) diseases and identified those with DLB (n = 34), PD (n = 37), and AD (n = 47) for further analyses.

- **Results**: We detected abnormalities in the CSF profiles of those patients with DLB while using a combination of decreased amyloid-β (Aβ)42 and increased tau levels. By stratification of data by disease severity, we observed a high sensitivity of this combination especially in the subgroup of patients with advanced stages, while the sensitivity in early forms was lower. In addition, with clinical deterioration, the abnormalities in the CSF profile became more pronounced.

- **Conclusion**: We conclude that DLB can be distinguished from PD, in spite of both being synucleinopathies, by CSF profiles using neurodegenerative marker analysis. The pathophysiology of increased tau and decreased Aβ levels in those conditions has to be elucidated further, since both proteins are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD, but no clear explanation has been postulated for DLB yet.

### Are dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia the same disease [^115PEz5g]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

An essential problem in distinguishing between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is the impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology and its co-occurrence with Lewy body pathology (LBP). Although both types of lesions have been shown to be strongly correlated with one another, recent clinicopathological studies indicate that the clinical features of DLB result from multiple regional pathologies that are less pronounced in PDD. Nevertheless, the genetic and molecular mechanisms responsible for the different pathogenetic factors, at least partially, for both disorders await further elucidation.

- **Therapy**: Currently, there are no disease-modifying therapies for Lewy body disorders (LBDs) available, although robust evidence supports the use of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) to treat these disorders due to the reduction of cholinergic markers in both PDD and DLB. Meta-analyses have indicated beneficial effects of both donepezil and rivastigmine for cognitive and psychiatric symptoms in both disorders, while only one study found an effect of memantine in PDD. The efficacy of memantine in DLB is less clear but may have benefits either as monotherapy or as adjunctive to a ChEI; furthermore, it induced longer survival in patients with DLB and PDD. Although the effects were relatively small, ChEIs demonstrated a better response in cognitive impairment in DLB and PDD than in AD and may reduce apathy, visual hallucinations, and delusions. The use of antipsychotics should be avoided given the risk of serious reactions in DLB. When atypical antipsychotic agents are needed, quetiapine, and particularly clozapine, are preferred.

### Improving the clinical detection of Lewy body dementia with the Lewy body composite risk score [^116TFmu1]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

The Lewy body dementias, composed of two related disorders, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), present a significant diagnostic challenge, especially outside expert centers. One major challenge in the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders is attributing clinical symptoms to specific pathologies to guide treatment choices and discussions about prognosis and clinical course. Although PDD provides a potentially easier route to diagnosis due to the cognitive disorder beginning in the presence of an established movement disorder — and criteria defining a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) state — DLB is more difficult to diagnose. Delays in diagnosing DLB can approach 18 months, causing significant burdens to patients and caregivers. Patients with dementia often receive a misdiagnosis, with a neurologist eventually establishing a diagnosis of DLB or PDD in 62% of cases. Although consensus criteria for DLB have excellent specificity (79%–100%), there is no standardized method to assess or operationalize many cognitive and behavioral symptoms, which markedly decreases sensitivity in clinical practice (range 12%–88%).

To address the difficulty in diagnosing DLB and to assist in the diagnosis of PDD, we developed the Lewy body composite risk score (LBCRS). The LBCRS aims to improve the detection of DLB and PDD in clinical and research populations and increase the likelihood of determining whether Lewy bodies are contributing pathology to the cognitive diagnosis. The LBCRS was derived from clinical features in autopsy-verified cases of healthy controls.

### Research diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^116GzS65]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). High credibility.

- **Information sources**: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched for all English language publications on 28 September 2022. The search strategies were as follows:

	**PubMed**: ((impairment, mild cognitive[MeSH Terms]) OR (impairments, mild cognitive[MeSH Terms]) OR (cognitive impairments, mild[MeSH Terms]) OR (cognitive impairment, mild[MeSH Terms]) OR (mild cognitive impairment[MeSH Terms]) OR (prodromal symptoms[MeSH Terms])) AND ((bodies, lewy[MeSH Terms]) OR (body, lewy[MeSH Terms]) OR (cortical lewy body disease[MeSH Terms]) OR (dementia, lewy body[MeSH Terms]) OR (diffuse lewy body disease[MeSH Terms]) OR (alpha synuclein[MeSH Terms]) OR (synuclein[MeSH Terms]) OR (synucleins[MeSH Terms]))

	**MEDLINE**: (Subject headings: "Lewy bodies" OR "Lewy body disease" OR "Synucleins" OR "alpha-synuclein") AND (keywords: "MCI" OR "mild cognitive impairment" OR Subject Heading: "Prodromal Symptoms")

	**Embase**: (Subject headings: "Lewy body" OR "diffuse Lewy body disease" OR "alpha synuclein" OR "Synuclein") AND (Subject heading: "mild cognitive impairment" OR "prodromal symptom")

- **Selection process**: A team of four reviewers evaluated articles to ensure rapid assessment. At the title and abstract screening stages, each article was independently assessed by two reviewers. In cases of disagreement, a third reviewer reviewed the article for inclusion or exclusion. At the full-text screening stage, all articles were independently reviewed by two reviewers. In cases of disagreement, the two reviewers met to discuss the article.

### Are dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia the same disease [^111kZeqM]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The term dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is widely accepted and demonstrates significant clinical utility, particularly in the differential diagnosis of cases that present with cognitive decline. This term's clinical utility supports its continued use. DLB is beneficial in determining the likelihood of patients developing extrapyramidal symptoms (like those seen in DLB) compared to other conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which in turn has prognostic value. This differentiation points to the type of therapy needed, such as typical or atypical neuroleptics, highlighting its clinical importance.

Although there is support for the concept of a continuum between DLB and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), it is recognized that biological factors dictate whether synucleinopathy initially presents with cognitive decline or with extrapyramidal features. Identifying these factors is critical scientifically and could lead to the development of disease-modifying therapies.

### Accuracy of clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112WQfRZ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is based on diagnostic clinical criteria, which have been updated over the years.

- **Objective**: To evaluate, through a systematic review, the accuracy of the diagnostic criteria, testing a possible improvement over time.

- **Methods**: We searched MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases for studies reporting diagnostic parameters regarding the clinical diagnosis of DLB until October 2016. We performed a meta-analysis, using a Bayesian approach, on studies using pathological examination as the gold standard, subclassified based on the different diagnostic criteria used.

- **Results**: We selected 22 studies on 1585 patients. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 60.2%, 93.8%, and 79.7%, respectively, for criteria antecedents to McKeith 1996. For McKeith 1996-possible, pooled sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 65.6%, 80.6%, and 77.9% in early stages, and 72.3%, 64.3%, and 66% in late stages, respectively. For McKeith 1996-probable, pooled sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 19.4%, 95.1%, and 77.7% in early stages, and 48.6%, 88%, and 79.2% in late stages, respectively. McKeith criteria 2005 were evaluated only in late stages: pooled sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 91.3%, 66.7%, and 81.6%, respectively, for possible diagnosis (only one study), and 88.3%, 80.8%, and 90.7% for probable diagnosis, decreasing to 85.6%, 77.1%, and 81.7% if only considering clinical settings focused on dementia diagnosis and care.

- **Conclusions and relevance**: Diagnostic criteria have become more sensitive and less specific over time, without substantial change in the overall accuracy of diagnosis.

### Speech and language characteristics differentiate Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies [^116i1E27]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Low credibility.

Early differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is important, but it remains challenging. Different profiles of speech and language impairments between AD and DLB have been suggested, yet direct comparisons have not been thoroughly investigated.

We collected speech responses from 121 older adults comprising AD, DLB, and cognitively normal (CN) groups and analyzed their acoustic, prosodic, and linguistic features. The AD group displayed larger differences from the CN group in linguistic features, while the DLB group exhibited larger differences in prosodic and acoustic features. Machine-learning classifiers based on these speech features achieved 87.0% accuracy for AD versus CN, 93.2% for DLB versus CN, and 87.4% for AD versus DLB.

Our findings highlight distinct differences in speech features between AD and DLB, suggesting the potential of using these features in combination as a screening tool for identifying and differentiating AD and DLB.

### Regional multiple pathology scores are associated with cognitive decline in Lewy body dementias [^111wTxUv]. Brain Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: All cases were selected based on clinicopathological consensus diagnoses. The clinical classification of PDD (Parkinson's disease dementia) was made when parkinsonism preceded dementia by more than a year. The diagnosis of DLB (dementia with Lewy bodies) was made when cognitive impairment or hallucinations were present before or within one year of the onset of parkinsonism. All cases were prospectively assessed by experienced clinicians using validated clinical rating instruments. AD (Alzheimer's disease) cases were clinically diagnosed based on meeting the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria for a diagnosis of probable or definite AD, DLB according to international consensus criteria, and PDD according to Movement Disorders Society criteria.

Neuropathological assessment was performed according to standardized neuropathological scoring/grading systems, including neurofibrillary Braak staging (threads and tangles), CERAD scores (neuritic plaques), Newcastle/McKeith Criteria for Lewy body disease (Lewy bodies and neurites), National Institute on Aging — Alzheimer's Association guidelines, and phases of amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition. Cognitive impairment data were assessed annually and are presented as the annual decline in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores from the time of dementia diagnosis, usually over the 8–10 years prior to death (MMSE decline).

The demographics and clinical state of the PDD, DLB, and AD patients are shown in Table 1. Full details of the patient cohorts are presented elsewhere.

### Cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia with Lewy bodies [^113a8A63]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) was first described in 1983, and clinical diagnostic criteria were published in the early to mid-1990s. It has been suggested that DLB may account for up to 15–25% of dementia cases among people aged over 65; however, autopsy suggests much lower rates. Characteristic symptoms include dementia, marked fluctuation of cognitive ability, early and persistent visual hallucinations, and spontaneous motor features of Parkinsonism. Falls, syncope, transient disturbances of consciousness, neuroleptic sensitivity, and hallucinations in other modalities are also common. This combination of features can be challenging to manage as neuroleptics can exacerbate the Parkinsonian and cognitive symptoms.

Evidence suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors may be beneficial in managing this disorder. Small case series indicate that cholinesterase inhibitors are safe and can improve both cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB.

- **Objectives**: To assess the use of cholinesterase inhibitors in DLB.

- **Search strategy**: The trials were identified from a search of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group on 25 February 2002 using the terms 'lewy body', 'Lewy bodies', and 'Lewy'. This register contains records from all major health care databases and trial databases and is updated regularly.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized, double-blind trials in which treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors was administered and compared with alternative interventions in patients with DLB are included.

### Lescod: A new clinical scale for the detection of Lewy body disease in neurocognitive disorders [^114hx6TW]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies remains underdiagnosed in clinical practice, mainly because of the low sensitivity of existing diagnostic criteria and a strong overlap with Alzheimer's pathology that can mask the Lewy phenotype.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a new clinical scale designed to detect signs of Lewy body disease, called LeSCoD, for Lewy body Screening scale in Cognitive Disorders.

- **Methods**: A total of 128 patients who fulfilled the clinical criteria of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; n = 32), Alzheimer's disease (AD; n = 77), or both (n = 19) were prospectively enrolled. 18 F-DOPA PET imaging and/or CSF biomarkers were available in some patients. The LeSCoD scale was systematically administered, and the potential correlation with 18 F-DOPA PET imaging was evaluated in a subgroup of patients.

- **Results**: The LeSCoD scale showed robust internal and external validity. We determined a cut-off of 10, above which the sensitivity and specificity for Lewy body disease diagnosis were 86% and 95%, respectively. The LeSCoD scale correlated with striatal dopamine uptake in 18 F-DOPA PET.

- **Conclusion**: The LeSCoD scale is a simple and reliable tool for the evaluation of Lewy body disease in routine clinical practice, with higher sensitivity and specificity than existing criteria. It might be an alternative to the use of dopamine-specific imaging.

### Arguing against the proposed definition changes of PD [^113WS4vW]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

As members of the Lewy Body Dementia Association Scientific Advisory Council, we aim to address some of the issues raised in the article titled "Time to Redefine PD? Introductory Statement of the MDS Task Force on the Definition of Parkinson's Disease". In particular, we suggest that the one-year rule distinguishing Parkinson's disease dementia from dementia with Lewy bodies is worth maintaining because it serves an important purpose in clinical practice and clinical and basic science research, and when helping the lay community understand the complexity of these different clinical phenotypes.

Furthermore, we believe that adding an additional diagnostic label, "PD (dementia with Lewy bodies subtype)", will confuse rather than clarify the distinction between dementia with Lewy bodies and PD or PD dementia, and it will not improve management or expedite therapeutic development. We present arguments supporting our contentions.

---

### Arguing against the proposed definition changes of PD [^1123n7Wu]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

We argue that the statements from the 2005 Consensus Group on DLB continue to hold true. Therefore, we propose the following:

- **Maintain the 1-year rule**: The 1-year rule distinguishing PDD from DLB is worth maintaining. It serves an important purpose in clinical practice, clinical and basic science research, and in helping the lay community understand the complexity of these apparently different clinical phenotypes. Modification of the 1-year time period may be justified when the genetic underpinnings, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and prodromal states of these disorders are better understood.

- **Diagnosis considerations**: Modifying the diagnosis of patients who meet diagnostic criteria for DLB based on whether they meet diagnostic criteria for PD is unjustified at this time. Additionally, the inclusion of a further diagnostic category, "PD (DLB subtype)", is not necessary and could potentially cause confusion.

- **Focus on early manifestation identification**: Continued attention should be given to identifying the mild or early manifestations of Lewy body disease and characterizing the longitudinal clinical and biomarker changes associated with evolving Lewy body disease.

- **Development of interventions**: Symptomatic and disease-modifying interventions should be developed using both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic modalities for the syndromes associated with Lewy body disease.

- **Clinical trials inclusion**: Both phenotypes should be included in clinical trials of new therapies for Lewy body dementia (as opposed to lumping them into one phenotype) until further research improves knowledge about the differences and similarities between PDD and DLB.

### Research criteria for the diagnosis of prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies [^1124xMw4]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The prodromal phase of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) includes: (1) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), (2) delirium-onset, and (3) psychiatric-onset presentations. The purpose of our review is to determine whether there is sufficient information available to justify the development of diagnostic criteria for each of these stages. Our goal is to achieve evidence-based recommendations for recognizing DLB at a predementia, symptomatic stage. We propose operationalized diagnostic criteria for probable and possible mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies, which are intended for use in research settings pending validation for use in clinical practice. These criteria are compatible with those for other prodromal neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Although there is still insufficient evidence to propose formal criteria for delirium-onset and psychiatric-onset presentations of DLB, we feel it is important to characterize them, raising the index of diagnostic suspicion and prioritizing them for further investigation.

### Research diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117K1irV]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). Low credibility.

Recommendations:

The DLB research community and funders should support ongoing MCI-LB cohorts and the development of new MCI-LB cohorts in order to increase the evidence available on which to base our diagnostic criteria for this disease stage and validate the criteria for routine clinical use. This review has focused on MCI-LB, but research is also needed into presentation prior to the onset of MCI and other prodromal presentations, such as psychiatric-onset and delirium-onset DLB, which may occur with or without concurrent MCI. Recruitment strategies and inclusion/exclusion criteria for longitudinal cohorts should seek to include the broad spectrum of presentations of prodromal DLB.

MCI-LB cohorts should, wherever possible, collect dopaminergic imaging and cardiac MIBG to determine the accuracy of these biomarkers and their predictive validity at this disease stage. Established cohorts that have not yet published articles allowing the extraction of the sensitivity and specificity of these biomarkers when they are excluded from the diagnostic algorithm (i.e. avoiding circularity) should consider doing so. Similarly, cohorts with data on core and suggestive clinical features should present these data in future publications.

Promising results have been reported for quantitative EEG and FDG PET. Further studies are needed to determine their diagnostic utility.

Wherever possible, MCI cohorts should include the option of brain donation for participants. This will allow the comparison of diagnostic features and biomarkers with pathological diagnosis.

### Dysfunctional brain dynamics and their origin in Lewy body dementia [^114CdwZE]. Brain (2019). Low credibility.

Lewy body dementia, which includes dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia, is characterized by transient clinical symptoms such as fluctuating cognition. This fluctuation might be driven by dysfunction of the brain's intrinsic dynamic properties. In this study, we investigated whole-brain dynamics on a subsecond timescale in 42 Lewy body dementia patients, comparing them to 27 Alzheimer's disease patients and 18 healthy controls using an EEG microstate analysis in a cross-sectional design. Microstates are transiently stable brain topographies, and their temporal characteristics provide insight into the brain's dynamic repertoire.

Our additional aim was to explore the processes driving microstate dynamics in the brain. We studied associations between microstate dynamics and temporal aspects of large-scale cortical-basal ganglia-thalamic interactions using dynamic functional MRI measures, given the putative role of these subcortical areas in modulating widespread cortical function and their known vulnerability to Lewy body pathology.

Microstate duration was increased in Lewy body dementia for all microstate classes compared to Alzheimer's disease (P < 0.001) and healthy controls (P < 0.001), while microstate dynamics in Alzheimer's disease were largely comparable to healthy control levels, albeit with altered microstate topographies. Correspondingly, the number of distinct microstates per second was reduced in Lewy body dementia compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001) and Alzheimer's disease (P < 0.001). In the dementia with Lewy bodies group, mean microstate duration was rela

### Csf amyloid-beta-peptides in Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia [^113MxBKY]. Brain (2006). Low credibility.

As the differential diagnosis of dementias based on established clinical criteria is often difficult, biomarkers for applicable diagnostic testing are currently under intensive investigation. Amyloid plaques deposited in the brain of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) mainly consist of carboxy-terminally elongated forms of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides, such as Abeta1–42. Absolute Abeta1–42 levels in CSF have shown diagnostic value for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, but the discrimination among Alzheimer's disease, DLB, and PDD was poor.

A recently established quantitative urea-based Abeta-sodium-dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide-gel-electrophoresis with Western immunoblot (Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot) revealed a highly conserved Abeta peptide pattern of the carboxy-terminally truncated Abeta peptides 1–37, 1–38, 1–39, in addition to 1–40 and 1–42 in human CSF. We used the Abeta-SDS-PAGE/immunoblot to investigate the CSF of 23 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 21 with DLB, 21 with PDD, and 23 non-demented disease controls (NDC) for disease-specific alterations of the Abeta peptide patterns in its absolute and relative quantities. The diagnostic groups were matched for age and severity of dementia.

The present study is the first attempt to evaluate the meaning of Abeta peptide patterns in CSF for the differential diagnosis of the three neurodegenerative diseases — Alzheimer's disease, DLB, and PDD. The Abeta peptide patterns displayed disease-specific variations and the ratio of the differentially alt

### Distinct patterns of amyloid-dependent tau accumulation in Lewy body diseases [^114xATFa]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In addition to Lewy body pathology, amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease are also frequently found in Lewy body diseases.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this study was to investigate tau accumulation patterns in dementia with Lewy bodies and other Lewy body diseases using in vivo 18 F-AV-1451 PET.

- **Methods**: The study included 12 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with normal cognition, 22 PD patients with cognitive impairment, and 18 dementia with Lewy bodies patients. In addition, 25 Alzheimer's disease patients and 25 healthy controls were included for comparison. All participants underwent 18 F-AV-1451 and 18 F-florbetaben PET scans, and cortical binding values were compared between the controls and each disease group.

- **Results**: When compared with the controls, dementia with Lewy bodies patients showed slightly increased 18 F-AV-1451 binding in the primary sensorimotor and visual cortices and the parieto-temporal cortices, which failed to survive multiple comparisons. Amyloid-positive dementia with Lewy bodies patients showed significantly increased binding in the same regions when compared with controls, and even greater binding in the primary sensorimotor and visual cortices than Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, binding in the lateral and medial temporal cortices was less prominent than in Alzheimer's disease. In dementia with Lewy bodies, 18 F-AV-1451 binding in the occipital cortex correlated with 18 F-florbetaben binding. Amyloid-negative patients with normal cognition, patients with cognitive impairment…

### New evidence on the management of Lewy body dementia [^115GMLnY]. The Lancet Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia, jointly known as Lewy body dementia, are common neurodegenerative conditions. Patients with Lewy body dementia present with a wide range of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, sleep, motor, and autonomic symptoms. Presentation varies between patients and can vary over time within an individual. Treatments can address one symptom but worsen another, which makes disease management difficult. Symptoms are often managed in isolation and by different specialists, making high-quality care difficult to accomplish. Clinical trials and meta-analyses now provide an evidence base for the treatment of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and motor symptoms in patients with Lewy body dementia. Furthermore, consensus opinion from experts supports the application of treatments for related conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, for the management of common symptoms (e.g. autonomic dysfunction) in patients with Lewy body dementia. However, evidence gaps remain, and future clinical trials need to focus on the treatment of symptoms specific to patients with Lewy body dementia.

### Characteristics of drawing process differentiate Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies [^113d66ZX]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Early differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is important for treatment and disease management, but it remains challenging. Although computer-based drawing analysis may help differentiate AD and DLB, it has not been studied.

- **Objective**: We aimed to identify the differences in features characterizing the drawing process between AD, DLB, and cognitively normal (CN) individuals, and to evaluate the validity of using these features to identify and differentiate AD and DLB.

- **Methods**: We collected drawing data with a digitizing tablet and pen from 123 community-dwelling older adults in three clinical diagnostic groups of mild cognitive impairment or dementia due to AD (n = 47) or Lewy body disease (LBD; n = 27), and CN (n = 49), matched for their age, sex, and years of education. We then investigated drawing features in terms of the drawing speed, pressure, and pauses.

- **Results**: Reduced speed and reduced smoothness in speed and pressure were observed particularly in the LBD group, while increased pauses and total durations were observed in both the AD and LBD groups. Machine-learning models using these features achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.80 for AD versus CN, 0.88 for LBD versus CN, and 0.77 for AD versus LBD.

Our results indicate how different types of drawing features were particularly discriminative between the diagnostic groups, and how the combination of these features can facilitate the identification and differentiation of AD and DLB.

### Progression to dementia in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies or Alzheimer disease [^111Jzf81]. Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

To determine whether mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies or mild cognitive impairment with Alzheimer disease differ in their rates of clinical progression to dementia, we undertook longitudinal observation of mild cognitive impairment cases with detailed clinical assessment of Lewy body diagnostic characteristics.

- **Methods**: Two prospective longitudinal cohorts including 111 individuals aged 60 years or older with mild cognitive impairment were assessed annually to track cognitive and clinical progression, including the presence or absence of core clinical features and proposed biomarkers of dementia with Lewy bodies. Multistate modeling was used to assess the associations of diagnostic characteristics of dementia with Lewy bodies with clinical progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia, with death as a competing outcome.

- **Results**: After a mean follow-up of 2.2 years (ranging from 1 to 6.7 years), 38 of the 111 participants (34%) progressed to dementia: 10 with Alzheimer's disease, 3 with possible dementia with Lewy bodies, and 25 with probable dementia with Lewy bodies. The presence of any Lewy body disease characteristic was associated with an increased hazard of transition to dementia; this risk further increased as more diagnostic characteristics were observed (hazard ratio 1.33 per characteristic, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–1.60). The risk was especially high for those experiencing complex visual hallucinations (hazard ratio 1.98, 95% CI 0.92–4.29) or cognitive fluctuations (hazard ratio 3.99, 95% CI 2.03–7.84).

Diagnostic characteristics of Lewy body disease are critical in understanding the progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia.

### Dlb and pdd boundary issues: diagnosis, treatment, molecular pathology, and biomarkers [^1175LL2C]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

For more than a decade, researchers have refined criteria for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and at the same time have recognized that cognitive impairment and dementia occur commonly in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). This article addresses the relationship between DLB, PD, and PD with dementia (PDD). The authors agreed to endorse "Lewy body disorders" as the umbrella term for PD, PDD, and DLB, to promote the continued practical use of these three clinical terms and to encourage efforts at drug discovery that target the mechanisms of neurodegeneration shared by these disorders of alpha-synuclein metabolism.

We concluded that the differing temporal sequence of symptoms and clinical features of PDD and DLB justify distinguishing these disorders. However, a single Lewy body disorder model was deemed more useful for studying disease pathogenesis because abnormal neuronal alpha-synuclein inclusions are the defining pathologic process common to both PDD and DLB. There was consensus that improved understanding of the pathobiology of alpha-synuclein should be a major focus of efforts to develop new disease-modifying therapies for these disorders.

The group agreed on four important priorities:

- **Continued communication between experts**: Specialize in PDD or DLB.
- **Initiation of prospective validation studies**: Include autopsy confirmation of DLB and PDD.
- **Development of practical biomarkers**: Focus on alpha-synuclein pathologies.
- **Accelerated efforts to find more effective treatments**: Target these diseases with urgency.

### Research criteria for the diagnosis of prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies [^114kQghn]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

In summary, it is not yet clear how to identify patients with prominent late-onset psychiatric symptoms who may have underlying Lewy body (LB) disease and subsequently progress to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). It is premature to try to construct formal criteria for psychiatric-onset DLB. However, clinicians in mental health and other settings need to be aware that this possibility exists, not least because of the risk of severe antipsychotic sensitivity reactions with increased morbidity and mortality. The small available literature, including reports, provides some useful guidance but requires replication and further investigation.

### Are dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia the same disease [^111b3XuQ]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The nosologic relationship between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), both major neurocognitive disorders characterized by α-synuclein (αSyn) deposition and Lewy bodies (LB), is continuously debated, as defined by DSM-5.

The clinical features of DLB and PDD are similar, including dementia, cognitive fluctuations, and visual hallucinations, often occurring in the setting of clinical or latent parkinsonism. Both disorders show overlap in cognitive domains, with progressive executive dysfunctions, visual-spatial abnormalities, and memory disorders. According to international consensus, DLB is diagnosed when cognitive impairment precedes parkinsonian motor signs or begins within one year of their onset. In contrast, PDD is characterized by cognitive impairment developing in the context of well-established Parkinson's disease (PD). DLB patients eventually develop parkinsonism of increasing severity, although 25% never exhibit parkinsonian symptoms.

Despite differing temporal sequences of motor and cognitive deficits and several quantitative clinical differences, both disorders exhibit largely convergent, although locally and quantitatively divergent, neuropathological lesions. These are associated with increased Aβ and tau loads in DLB. The overlap of clinical and morphological features has led to the debate: are DLB and PDD the same disease, different phenotypic expressions of the same αSyn/Lewy body disease (LBD) spectrum, or distinct diseases sharing genetic risk features with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease? Recent studies are contributing to this ongoing discussion.

### Initial biological classification of Lewy body diseases: No consensus on terminology [^113rdAye]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

To the editor,

We read with considerable interest the revised criteria for the diagnosis and staging of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by Jack et al. This summarizes the long history and multi-staged development and evolution of biological concepts underlying their updated proposal. Given the frequency of Lewy body co-pathology in AD, we agree with the inclusion of alpha synuclein as a biomarker for non-AD co-pathology in AD, especially given its potential impact on the clinical course (e.g. Levin et al.). Conversely, we also propose to consider amyloid beta and tau as potential co-pathology which may be of relevance in biologically defined Parkinson's disease (PD). However, when discussing biomarkers for alpha synuclein, the authors state that PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) "have recently been re-labeled as NSD" (NSD: "neuronal synuclein disease"), and this is repeated throughout the article.

We wish to highlight that the term "NSD" is not currently an accepted designation by the PD or DLB communities. This terminology and concept have not been carefully evaluated in the way AD proposed criteria have. The term NSD and its accompanying integrated staging system have only recently been proposed in a single article and have not been sufficiently considered, vetted, and supported by large segments of the research community dealing with alpha synuclein–related diseases. The community at large currently rather uses the term "Lewy body disorder" or "Lewy body disease" as the umbrella term for PD and DLB, and we have also argued that the diagnosis of PD should not be restricted.

### Dementia with Lewy bodies: An emerging disease [^1156uoCt]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies appears to be the second most common form of dementia, accounting for about one in five cases. The condition is characterized by dementia accompanied by delirium, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. Other common symptoms include syncope, falls, sleep disorders, and depression. The presence of both Lewy bodies and amyloid plaques with deficiencies in both acetylcholine and dopamine neurotransmitters suggests that dementia with Lewy bodies represents the middle of a disease spectrum ranging from Alzheimer's disease to Parkinson's disease. The diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies is based on clinical features and exclusion of other diagnoses.

Individualized behavioral, environmental, and pharmacologic therapies are used to alleviate symptoms and support patients and their families. Cholinesterase inhibitors are more effective in patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies than in those with Alzheimer's disease. Conversely, patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies do not respond as well to antiparkinsonian medications. Anticholinergic medications should be avoided because they exacerbate the symptoms of dementia. Traditional antipsychotic medications can precipitate severe reactions and may double or triple the rate of mortality in patients who have dementia with Lewy bodies.

### Neuropsychological test performance in mild cognitive impairment with Lewy bodies: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115eCkmn]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Low credibility.

Diagnosing and treating neurodegenerative diseases at their prodromal stages has become a priority, particularly with the development of disease-modifying therapies. This is reflected by a high proportion of people who seek cognitive assessment and receive a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), often considered a prodromal phase of dementia. However, MCI is a heterogeneous clinical entity that can progress to different types of dementia, remain stable, or even return to normal cognition. Cognitive screenings and neuropsychological assessments are a critical component of the workup for MCI. The ability to detect MCI and determine its potential etiology will partially depend on the availability of sensitive neuropsychological tests and the definition of distinct cognitive profiles in the predementia phase of different neurodegenerative diseases.

The diagnostic criteria and cognitive signature of MCI due to Alzheimer's disease (MCI-AD) are well established. Diagnostic criteria and cognitive profiles for MCI due to Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI) have also been defined. As a result of emerging literature regarding MCI with Lewy bodies (MCI-LB), prodromal research criteria were established in 2020. This was an important first step in formalizing the diagnostic criteria and suggested disproportionate attention/executive and visual processing difficulties as the cognitive profile associated with MCI-LB. In 2020, a review by Ciafone et al. summarized the available evidence suggesting that the cognitive signature of MCI-LB typically involves attention/executive and visual processing difficulties.

### Improving the clinical detection of Lewy body dementia with the Lewy Body Composite Risk Score [^111mifxy]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). High credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is challenging to diagnose, particularly outside of expert centers, with long delays in diagnosis leading to significant burdens on patients and caregivers. While consensus criteria have excellent specificity, there is no standardized way to assess symptoms, reducing sensitivity. We developed the Lewy Body Composite Risk Score (LBCRS) from autopsy-verified cases to improve the ability to detect DLB in clinical and research populations.

- **Methods**: The LBCRS was tested in a consecutive series of 256 patients compared with the Clinical Dementia Rating and gold standard measures of cognition, motor symptoms, function, and behavior. Psychometric properties including floor and ceiling effects, concurrent, construct, and known-groups validity, and internal consistency of the LBCRS were determined. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves assessed the ability of LBCRS to differentiate: (a) DLB from Alzheimer's disease (AD); (b) DLB from all dementia; and (c) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to DLB from MCI due to AD. The LBCRS was completed independent of the clinical evaluation.

- **Results**: Mean LBCRS scores were significantly different between DLB and AD (6.1 ± 2.0 vs. 2.4 ± 1.3, p < .001) and between MCI-DLB vs. MCI-AD (3.2 ± 0.9 vs. 1.0 ± 0.8, p < .001). The LBCRS was able to discriminate DLB from other causes of dementia. Using a cut-off score of 3, areas under ROC for DLB vs. AD = 0.93 (0.89–0.98), and for MCI-DLB vs. MCI-AD = 0.96 (0.91–1.0).

- **Discussion**: The LBCRS increases the diagnostic probability that Lewy body pathology is contributing to t.

### Diagnostic procedures for Parkinson's disease dementia: Recommendations from the Movement Disorder Society Task Force [^117BpBq9]. Movement Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

A preceding article described the clinical features of Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-D) and proposed clinical diagnostic criteria for "probable" and "possible" PD-D. The main focus of this article is to operationalize the diagnosis of PD-D and to propose practical guidelines based on a two-level process, depending upon the clinical scenario and the expertise of the evaluator involved in the assessment.

- **Level I**: Aimed primarily at the clinician with no particular expertise in neuropsychological methods, requiring a simple, pragmatic set of tests that are not excessively time-consuming.

Level I can be used alone or in concert with Level II, which is more suitable when there is a need to specify the pattern and the severity of dementia in PD-D for clinical monitoring, research studies, or pharmacological trials.

- **Level II**: Tests can also be proposed when the diagnosis of PD-D remains uncertain or equivocal at the end of a Level I evaluation.

Given the lack of evidence-based standards for some tests when applied in this clinical context, the article attempts to make practical and unambiguous recommendations, based on the available literature and the collective experience of the Task Force. It is acknowledged, however, that further validation of certain tests and modifications in the recommended cut-off values will be required through future studies.

### Diagnosis and management of dementia with Lewy bodies: third report of the DLB Consortium [^114tdASn]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

The dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) Consortium has revised criteria for the clinical and pathological diagnosis of DLB, incorporating new information about the core clinical features and suggesting improved methods to assess them. REM sleep behavior disorder, severe neuroleptic sensitivity, and reduced striatal dopamine transporter activity on functional neuroimaging are given greater diagnostic weighting as features suggestive of a DLB diagnosis. The 1-year rule distinguishing between DLB and Parkinson disease with dementia may be difficult to apply in clinical settings and, in such cases, the term most appropriate to each individual patient should be used. Generic terms such as Lewy body (LB) disease are often helpful.

The authors propose a new scheme for the pathological assessment of LBs and Lewy neurites (LN) using alpha-synuclein immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative grading of lesion density, with the pattern of regional involvement being more important than total LB count. The new criteria take into account both Lewy-related and Alzheimer disease (AD)-type pathology to allocate a probability that these are associated with the clinical DLB syndrome.

Finally, the authors suggest patient management guidelines, including the need for accurate diagnosis, a target symptom approach, and use of appropriate outcome measures. There is limited evidence about specific interventions, but available data suggest only a partial response of motor symptoms to levodopa, severe sensitivity to typical and atypical antipsychotics in approximately 50%, and improvements in attention and visual hallucinations.

### α-synuclein species as potential cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for dementia with Lewy bodies [^1113WPhQ]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common form of dementia in people older than 65 years, accounting for 10%‐20% of dementia cases. DLB is characterized by cognitive decline coupled with visual hallucinations, fluctuating cognition, parkinsonism, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) autonomic dysfunction. Due to heterogeneity in clinical presentation and overlap with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), accurate diagnosis of DLB is often challenging, particularly in the early stages of the disease.

Currently, the diagnosis of DLB relies on clinical diagnostic consensus criteria, which possess high specificity (80%‐100%) but low sensitivity (20%‐60%). Consequently, over 80% of DLB cases are initially misdiagnosed, often as AD or PD. Postmortem pathological confirmation of cortical Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites — intraneuronal inclusions primarily composed of α‐synuclein (α‐syn) aggregates — constitutes the diagnostic gold standard. However, achieving an accurate diagnosis antemortem is crucial for appropriate clinical management and patient care, highlighting the urgent need to discover biomarkers that can assist in an accurate and early diagnosis of DLB.

### Donepezil for dementia with Lewy bodies: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113V4EVd]. Annals of Neurology (2012). High credibility.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common form of dementia in the elderly and constitutes the second largest group of patients with dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD). The core clinical features of DLB include neuropsychiatric symptoms and motor symptoms of parkinsonism, as well as cognitive impairment characterized by deficits of attention, executive function, and visual perception. Fluctuating cognition, hallucinations, and delusions are major sources of difficulties and distress for both patients and caregivers. The motor and autonomic features further impair activities of daily living and lead to poorer quality of life. However, the pharmacological management of DLB remains challenging because it is complicated by the risk of adverse reactions to medication. Treatments for one aspect of the disease may exacerbate other symptoms. It is well recognized that DLB patients can be exquisitely sensitive to antipsychotic agents and can develop life-threatening sensitivity reactions. Antiparkinson medication given to improve motor symptoms can exacerbate neuropsychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations. There are no approved treatments for DLB.

Cholinergic loss in DLB is associated with deficits in attention and cognition, as well as with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neuropathological and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that cholinergic neurotransmission is more defective in DLB than in AD. Although cholinergic losses in DLB affect both brainstem and basal forebrain presynaptic nuclei, in contrast to AD, postsynaptic cortical muscarinic and nicotinic receptors are maintained.

### Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia - the same or different and is it important [^112N68kY]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

Biological definitions of neurological diseases are now becoming a reality, although still in the research phase. This development will recategorize neurological diseases, providing objective diagnostics and the promise of therapeutics that target biological mechanisms — similar to the strategy that has proven successful in tumors and other conditions.

In this Perspective article, we discuss this development for dementias with dominant Lewy pathology, as the availability of biological assays for this pathology has sparked new interest in a single disease diagnosis for all individuals positive for α-synuclein. Based on evidence, we argue that an α-synuclein assay alone is unlikely to be a specific criterion for a spectrum of clinical syndromes with Lewy pathology or a definitive diagnostic marker for Lewy body dementia. We advocate that one biological assay will not reflect the complex spatiotemporal features of brain pathology. Diverse sequential mechanisms underpin the highly heterogeneous phenotypes and clinicopathological processes of Lewy body dementias. Disease modification, if possible, will be most effective when it targets the early underlying mechanisms, especially those leading to aggressive phenotypes.

### The clinical phenotype of psychiatric-onset prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies: A scoping review [^111Jtmyy]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Methods**:

- **Inclusion and exclusion criteria**: Cohort or case studies that longitudinally followed up patients who presented after age 50 years with a primary psychiatric illness that subsequently developed dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) were included. Articles describing cross-sectional data without longitudinal follow-up or describing diagnosis of other Lewy body disorders (i.e. Parkinson's disease dementia) were excluded.

- **Search strategy**: Terms for three psychiatric diseases (depression, psychosis, and schizophrenia) were combined with terms encompassing dementia with Lewy bodies. Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched for English language articles up to 11/2/2023. Keywords included: ("depression") OR Keyword ("psychosis") OR Keyword ("manic" OR "mania") OR Keyword ("schizophrenia") OR ("schizoaffective") OR ("paranoid") AND Keyword ("dementia with Lewy bodies") OR Subject heading ("diffuse Lewy body disease") AND Keyword ("dementia with Lewy Bodies") OR Subject Heading ("dementia with Lewy Bodies"). For Medline: Keyword ("depression") OR MeSH Terms ("depression") OR Keyword ("psychosis") OR MeSH Terms ("psychotic disorders") OR Keyword ("schizophrenia") OR MeSH Terms ("schizophrenia spectrum" OR "other psychotic disorders" OR "schizophrenia" OR "paranoid schizophrenia" OR "schizophrenia" OR "catatonic schizophrenia" OR "treatment-resistant schizophrenia, disorganized") AND Keyword ("dementia with Lewy Bodies") OR ("Lewy Body Disease"). A parallel search strategy was also conducted by consulting reference lists and citing studies of included publications.

- **Selection process**: A total of 2558 results were obtained from the search strategy.

### Research criteria for the diagnosis of prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies [^116BArHo]. Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

Some published guidance about the early clinical diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) does already exist. DSM-5 recommends a diagnosis of mild neurocognitive disorder (NCD) with Lewy bodies (LB) for individuals who present with the core or suggestive features at a stage when cognitive or functional impairments are not of sufficient severity to fulfill criteria for major NCD. This recommendation is based on the 2005 version of DLB guidelines and requires updating. ICD-11 takes a similar approach toward diagnosing mild NCD at a syndromic level and lists both Lewy body disease and Parkinson's Disease (PD) as possible causes.

The diagnostic position for other prodromal manifestations of DLB, such as delirium-onset and psychiatric-onset, is less clear than for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Operationalization of specific criteria for these syndromes is not yet justified, and the reliable differentiation of the minority of delirious and psychiatrically ill patients with underlying LB pathology from the majority who do not is likely only achievable when routinely applicable biomarkers are developed. Currently, LB disease is seldom, if ever, considered part of the differential diagnosis of delirium or late-onset psychiatric disorder. We hope that the information provided in the text and accompanying boxes will raise clinicians' awareness of this possibility.

### Biological effects of pathologies in Lewy body diseases: why timing matters [^111189Sx]. The Lancet Neurology (2025). High credibility.

The emergence of promising biomarkers of α-synuclein Lewy pathology has led to new biological definitions and staging systems for Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. These research frameworks aim to enhance patient selection for studies of biomarkers and disease-modifying therapies. Building on approaches developed for Alzheimer's disease, these new frameworks focus on hallmark neuropathological findings in Lewy body diseases, including abnormal α-synuclein aggregates and neurodegeneration, particularly nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss. Understanding the temporal inter-relationships between Lewy pathology, Alzheimer's disease, and other co-pathologies and symptom manifestation is central to any biological staging system.

Neuropathological and in vivo evidence demonstrates substantial temporal and biological heterogeneity in the progression of clinical and pathological events across Lewy body disorders, highlighting knowledge gaps. Staging systems must incorporate this evidence into a nuanced conceptual framework of biological progression. Such revision will be crucial for the appropriate selection of participants and correct timing of targeted interventions in clinical research.
