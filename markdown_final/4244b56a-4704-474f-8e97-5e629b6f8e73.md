## Question

Table summarizing and comparing afib vs aflutter.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a table that summarizes and compares atrial fibrillation versus atrial flutter. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about scope and structure so definitions, pathophysiology, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, complications and prognosis, and management can be addressed coherently. Then, I should verify the highest-credibility guideline recommendations for anticoagulation, rate and rhythm control, and ablation. Next, I will integrate the interrelationship between AF and AFL and check where the evidence is weaker. Finally, I will self-audit key figures and statements and flag any uncertainties or necessary corrections as I proceed.

> Let me first confirm the core definitions to anchor the comparison. Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia with diffuse, chaotic atrial activation, typically > 350 bpm, producing an irregularly irregular ventricular rhythm and it is often classified as valvular versus nonvalvular depending on mitral stenosis or prosthetic valves. Atrial flutter, in contrast, is a supraventricular arrhythmia with rapid but organized atrial activity, typically 250–350 bpm, most commonly due to a macroreentrant circuit in the right atrium producing the classic "sawtooth" flutter waves. Hold on, I should verify the definitional sources: AF definitions and classification are consistent with internal medicine reviews, and typical right atrial isthmus-dependent flutter is well characterized in electrophysiology literature, so these working definitions are sound.

> Now, I will examine the pathophysiology and make sure I do not overgeneralize. AF mechanisms include multiple wavelets, rapidly firing ectopic foci arising particularly from the pulmonary veins, electrical and structural remodeling, and autonomic influences, whereas typical AFL reflects a stable reentrant macro-circuit around the tricuspid annulus engaging the cavotricuspid isthmus as a critical isthmus. Wait, let me verify the right-sided predominance for typical flutter and recognize atypical left atrial flutters as well; the mechanistic distinction is still clinically valid because CTI dependence uniquely enables curative ablation for typical flutter, unlike the more heterogeneous AF substrate that often necessitates pulmonary vein isolation and adjunctive strategies [^114xjxRz] [^117H1FU9] [^1173km1Z].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and double-check the numbers. AF remains the most common sustained arrhythmia in adults, with U.S. prevalence estimated around 700–775 per 100,000 and a global burden exceeding 30 million, rising steeply with age. AFL is far less prevalent; some sources cite approximately 200,000 prevalent cases in the U.S., but I need to be cautious because robust contemporary global estimates often aggregate AF and AFL together. Both arrhythmias are strongly age-dependent, with roughly three-quarters of cases occurring in those aged 65 years or older globally, so the age gradient is a common theme, though precise AFL-specific prevalence varies by dataset and methodology. Hold on, I should note that the 200,000 AFL estimate is lower-credibility and that many high-credibility data sources report AF/AFL combined, so I will qualify that figure accordingly [^1113c8E3].

> I will now consider risk factors and ensure the distinctions are accurate. Shared risk factors include advancing age, hypertension, heart failure, obesity, sleep apnea, and thyroid disease. For AF, valvular pathology, especially rheumatic mitral stenosis and mechanical valves, is central to the valvular versus nonvalvular classification schema and influences antithrombotic strategy. For AFL, let me check unique drivers: class IC antiarrhythmic drugs can organize AF into typical flutter, and prior atrial surgery or scarring can provide the substrate for macroreentry. Wait a minute, I should confirm that COPD and congenital heart disease are often associated with AFL as well; yes, those associations are consistent across electrophysiology and modeling literature [^112Ljm8a] [^112TYRQW] [^117H1FU9].

> Next, I should review clinical presentation and avoid conflating exam findings. AF often presents with palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, and sometimes chest discomfort or dizziness; the hallmark is an irregularly irregular pulse with variable R–R intervals. AFL typically presents with palpitations and exertional intolerance; on ECG, regular atrial activity with sawtooth F waves, often with fixed conduction ratios like 2:1 or 3:1, is classic, and patients may be somewhat more hemodynamically tolerant than in rapid AF, though that is not universal. Let me double-check that both can be asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, which is true and clinically important for stroke prevention [^112Ljm8a] [^117H1FU9].

> For diagnosis, I should confirm the role of ECG, monitoring, imaging, and advanced signal analysis. AF diagnosis rests on ECG showing absent P waves with irregularly irregular R–R intervals, with ambulatory monitoring used to define burden and patterns, and echocardiography to assess structure and thromboembolic risk. AFL diagnosis uses ECG demonstration of flutter waves and atrial rate regularity; electrophysiology study delineates the macroreentrant circuit when needed. But wait, what if the surface ECG is ambiguous or shows "coarse AF"? Spectral analysis of atrial activity can help by revealing a dominant narrow frequency peak in AFL versus a broader spectrum in AF, and guidelines support device-based or algorithmic burden quantification when available, with echocardiography indicated if structural disease is suspected. I should confirm those points with both guideline and signal-processing data [^1162bRjC] [^114Vswzd] [^117NybjZ].

> Let me review complications and prognosis carefully and cross-check numbers. AF is associated with a fivefold increase in ischemic stroke and approximately twofold higher mortality, with left atrial appendage thrombus formation driving embolic events. AFL also increases risks of stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and mortality, and although some observational cohorts suggest numerically lower ischemic stroke rates than AF, multiple studies and guidelines generally treat thromboembolic prevention equivalently because the risk is clinically meaningful. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while several cohort analyses report differences, these are sensitive to anticoagulation use, population size, and ascertainment, so the safest, guideline-concordant stance is to apply AF-derived risk stratification to AFL for anticoagulation decisions [^112Ljm8a] [^116UX1mA] [^116QBWRt].

> Anticoagulation comes next, and I need to ensure complete alignment with current guidelines. I should confirm that both AF and AFL use the same CHA2DS2-VASc risk framework to guide initiation of oral anticoagulation, that peri-cardioversion anticoagulation is required, and that post-ablation continuation is guided by ongoing stroke risk rather than rhythm status alone. The 2024 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS and ESC guidance advise initiating OAC in AFL according to AF risk profiles, continuing anticoagulation for at least four weeks post-cardioversion or post-ablation, and considering long-term OAC after cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in typical AFL if the thromboembolic risk remains elevated or if AF has been documented or is likely to develop. Wait, let me double-check the specific AFL language; yes, those recommendations are explicitly extended to AFL and emphasize vigilant follow-up for silent AF after CTI ablation as well [^115zyyay] [^114srEj8] [^117PnEu1] [^115L7xZo] [^1163kV9u].

> For rate control, I need to check pharmacologic preferences and exceptions. Beta blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are first-line agents for both AF and AFL in hemodynamically stable patients without HFrEF, with digoxin as an adjunct in selected settings such as hypotension or HFrEF. Let me verify whether guidelines provide any nuance specific to AFL when ablation is not feasible; ESC SVT guidance suggests beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers when ablation is not desirable or unsuccessful, which aligns with typical AF rate control practice but is worth stating explicitly for AFL. I should confirm that rate targets and symptom relief remain pragmatic goals individualized to the patient's comorbidities [^116AJKtc] [^111yoNhZ].

> For rhythm control, I should confirm the indications for cardioversion and highlight the ablation distinctions. Immediate electrical cardioversion is recommended for hemodynamically unstable AF, and in stable patients, biphasic energy of at least 200 J and vector optimization improve success; pharmacologic cardioversion is a reasonable alternative when electrical cardioversion is not feasible. Now, let me verify ablation guidance: typical AFL is uniquely curable with cavotricuspid isthmus ablation with high success rates, and guidelines endorse considering catheter ablation to improve symptoms and reduce recurrence when AFL is symptomatic or clinically significant. Conversely, AF ablation generally centers on pulmonary vein isolation with variable success influenced by AF type and substrate. I should confirm these points precisely against contemporary guideline recommendations [^114C7n2g] [^111pV5Xi] [^111pjzec] [^116AJKtc].

> I need to capture the interrelationship between AF and AFL without overstating certainty. My initial thought was that AF precedes AFL in almost all instances, forming functional lines of block that enable a flutter circuit; wait, let me reconsider because that statement derives mainly from older EP mapping literature and is not uniformly generalizable. The safer synthesis is that AF and AFL often coexist and can transition into one another, with drivers and lines of block dynamically shaping the observed rhythm; after successful typical AFL ablation, AF emerges during follow-up in a substantial proportion of patients, which is why guidelines recommend structured surveillance for silent AF and risk-guided anticoagulation decisions. I should double-check that the post-AFL ablation AF incidence can be as high as 20–50% in longer follow-up series and that guideline surveillance language is explicit [^111FLSF8] [^1164cLun] [^11588iUV] [^111jU6ah].

> Finally, I should verify source credibility weighting and emphasize where I am leaning on guidelines versus observational or modeling data. Management statements here rely primarily on the 2023–2024 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS AF guideline set and the 2024 ESC AF guideline for anticoagulation, cardioversion, and ablation extension to AFL. Definitions, mechanisms, and epidemiology are supported by high-credibility clinical reviews and population data, supplemented by lower-credibility AFL-specific prevalence and interrelationship studies that I have explicitly qualified. Hold on, I should double-check that every major management recommendation is guideline-backed and that any numerical prevalence claims from lower-credibility sources are clearly caveated, which I have done above.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) are distinct arrhythmias with different mechanisms, ECG findings, and management considerations [^112Ljm8a]. AF is characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm driven by multiple micro-reentrant circuits [^114xjxRz], whereas AFL has a regular rhythm due to a single macro-reentrant circuit [^117H1FU9]. AF carries a higher stroke risk and is managed with rate or rhythm control [^111yoNhZ], with anticoagulation guided by CHA2DS2-VASc [^116oV7Wb]; AFL is often treated with catheter ablation [^112NKrMi], with anticoagulation guided by AF risk profiles [^115zyyay].

| **Feature** | **Atrial fibrillation (AF)** | **Atrial flutter (AFL)** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Multiple micro-reentrant circuits; irregular atrial activation [^112Ljm8a] | Single macro-reentrant circuit; regular atrial activation [^117H1FU9] |
| ECG characteristics | Irregularly irregular rhythm; absent P waves; fibrillatory baseline [^112Ljm8a] | Regular rhythm; sawtooth flutter waves; atrial rate 250–350 bpm |
| Clinical presentation | Palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, syncope, chest pain [^112Ljm8a] | Palpitations, dyspnea, fatigue, dizziness, syncope, chest pain [^112vDy4U] |
| Stroke risk | Higher stroke risk; anticoagulation based on CHA2DS2-VASc [^114jCWBp] | Lower stroke risk than AF; anticoagulation per AF risk profiles |
| Rate control | Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin [^112Ljm8a] | Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin [^116AJKtc] |
| Rhythm control | Antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, dofetilide) [^112Ljm8a]; electrical cardioversion [^1137M2Xt]; catheter ablation [^114RzN3h] | Antiarrhythmics (ibutilide, dofetilide, amiodarone); electrical cardioversion [^116wRKRT]; catheter ablation (cavotricuspid isthmus) [^112NKrMi] |
| Catheter ablation | Pulmonary vein isolation [^112Ljm8a]; moderate success; recurrence common [^114RzN3h] | Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation [^112NKrMi]; high success (> 90%); low recurrence |
| Anticoagulation | Required based on CHA2DS2-VASc score [^114jCWBp] [^116oV7Wb] | Required if high thromboembolic risk or history of AF [^115zyyay] [^114jCWBp] |
| Progression | Progressive; can become persistent or permanent [^112Ljm8a] [^117HXFhq] | Less progressive; may convert to AF [^112vDy4U] [^116UX1mA] |
| Prognosis | Higher risk of stroke, heart failure, mortality [^112Ljm8a] [^114xjxRz] | Lower risk than AF; prognosis improves with ablation |

Overall, AF and AFL differ in mechanism, ECG findings, and management: AF carries a higher stroke risk, and AFL is often managed with ablation [^112NKrMi]; anticoagulation is guided by AF risk profiles [^115zyyay].

The following constitutes key background information on atrial flutter:

- **Definition**: Atrial flutter is a supraventricular arrhythmia characterized by rapid, regular atrial contractions, primarily confined to the right atrium.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology involves the formation of a reentrant circuit, often around the tricuspid valve or along the right atrial wall. This circuit results in a rapid and regular atrial rhythm. Abnormal intraatrial conduction, slow conduction paths, and areas of low voltage in the atria can contribute to the initiation and maintenance of these reentrant circuits.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of idiopathic neonatal atrial flutter in Europe is estimated at 1.5 per 100,000 population.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors include advancing age, particularly prevalent in the elderly population, and underlying cardiac conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, and congenital heart disease. Additional risk factors include pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism, and the use of specific medications, such as class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs.

- **Disease course**: The clinical features often include palpitations, dyspnea, and chest discomfort. However, the diagnosis is often confirmed through a 12-lead ECG or an electrophysiology study and mapping. Complications can include stroke, heart failure, thromboembolism, and progression to atrial fibrillation.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis can be influenced by several factors. The presence of underlying heart disease can complicate the condition and lead to poor outcomes.

The 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation, developed in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS), specifically address the recommendations for patients with atrial flutter. The guidelines advise initiating oral anticoagulation in patients with atrial flutter who are at an elevated thromboembolic risk. This is to effectively prevent ischemic stroke and thromboembolism.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116oV7Wb]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

The risk of stroke varies among different patient groups with atrial fibrillation (AF), depending on the presence of various stroke risk factors. We provide recommendations for antithrombotic treatment based on net clinical benefit for patients with AF at varying levels of stroke risk and in various common clinical scenarios.

- **Methods**: Systematic literature reviews were conducted to identify relevant articles published since the last formal search performed for the Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (9th Edition). The overall quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted, voted on, and revised until consensus was reached.

- **Results**: For patients with AF without valvular heart disease, including those with paroxysmal AF, who are at low risk of stroke (e.g. CHA₂DS₂-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 (doubled), diabetes, stroke (doubled)-vascular disease, age 65–74, and sex category (female)] score of 0 in males or 1 in females), we suggest no antithrombotic therapy. The next step is to consider stroke prevention (i.e. oral anticoagulation therapy) for patients with one or more non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factors. For patients with a single non-sex CHA₂DS₂-VASc stroke risk factor, we suggest oral anticoagulation rather than no therapy, aspirin, or combination therapy.

Regarding medical management for atrial flutter, specifically concerning rhythm control, long-term ESC 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) in the absence of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), if ablation is not desirable or feasible. It is advisable to consider initiating β-blockers for the management of patients with atrial flutter if ablation is neither possible nor successful.

### Atrial fibrillation [^112Ljm8a]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on atrial fibrillation:

- **Definition**: AF is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by a diffuse and abnormal pattern of electrical activity in the atria of the heart. AF is classified as valvular or nonvalvular based on the presence or absence of valvular heart disease, specifically mitral stenosis (MS), or a prosthetic heart valve.

- **Pathophysiology**: The development of AF is related to structural and electrophysiological abnormalities resulting from comorbid conditions (including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, myocardial infarction, and heart failure), genetics, sex, and other factors.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of AF in the US is estimated at 700–775 cases per 100,000 persons.

- **Disease course**: In patients with AF, rapid and irregular atrial contractions lead to tachyarrhythmias, which cause symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea, and an increased risk of heart failure, as well as stasis of blood in the left atrial appendage (LAA), which increases the risk of stroke and systemic embolism.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AF is estimated to cause 15% of all strokes and is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of stroke and a 2-fold risk for all-cause mortality, respectively.

The 2023 guidelines recommend considering electrical cardioversion as the initial rhythm-control strategy or after unsuccessful pharmacological cardioversion in hemodynamically stable patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). This recommendation emphasizes the importance of rhythm control in the management of AF and aligns with the comprehensive approach outlined by the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS for managing this cardiac condition.

### Evaluation of quantitative decision-making for rhythm management of atrial fibrillation using tabular Q-learning [^111ZjKmK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Turning to the actual Q-values within the Q-table, we can draw some inferences regarding how different subtypes of patients might have better outcomes under a given treatment approach. For example, clusters 2 and 8 appeared to correspond to subtypes of patients with heart failure, for which an inspection of the Q-table indicates that for both clusters a rhythm-management strategy was favored, with nonischemic heart failure (cluster 8) having a clear favored treatment approach of ablation. This finding is consistent with the highly cited CASTLE-AF (Catheter Ablation Versus Standard Conventional Therapy in Patients With Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Atrial Fibrillation) trial, which found a statistically significant improvement in mortality with ablation in patients with heart failure compared with rate control.

Similarly, among patients in cluster 7 with "lone AF", we observed ablation to be the preferred treatment approach, which is also consistent with prior clinical trials showing favorability of AF ablation in this subtype of patient. Additional inferences could be made in other clusters; for example, cluster 5, which corresponded with patients having coronary artery disease, where the use of an additional rhythm-control modality beyond external cardioversion did not seem as preferable. One could infer validation of this finding from the extensive body of literature supporting lack of benefit from rhythm-control agents among early studies before the ablation era.

Of course, such speculation should be tempered due to the inherent bias in this observational study.

### The interrelationship between atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter [^111FLSF8]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

For a long time, it has been known that atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have a close clinical interrelationship. Recent electrophysiological studies, especially mapping studies, have significantly advanced our understanding of this interrelationship.

- **Relationship of atrial fibrillation with atrial flutter**: Atrial fibrillation of variable duration precedes the onset of atrial flutter in almost all instances. During atrial fibrillation, the functional components needed to complete the atrial flutter reentrant circuit, principally a line of block between the venae cavae, are formed. If this line of block does not form, classical atrial flutter does not develop. If this line of block shortens or disappears, classical atrial flutter disappears. In fact, it is fair to say that the major determinant of whether atrial fibrillation persists or classical atrial flutter develops is whether a line of block forms between the venae cavae.

- **Relationship of atrial flutter with atrial fibrillation**: Studies in experimental models and now in patients have demonstrated that a driver (a rapidly firing focus or a reentrant circuit of very short cycle length) can cause atrial fibrillation by producing fibrillatory conduction to the rest of the atria. When the driver is a stable reentrant circuit of very short cycle length, it is, in effect, a very fast form of atrial flutter. There probably is a spectrum of reentrant circuits of short cycle length, i.e. "atrial flutter", that depend, in part, on where the reentrant circuit is located.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy [^117HXFhq]. BMC Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, affecting at least 1% of the population, which amounts to 5.5 to 7 million patients with AF in Europe. AF is characterized by very rapid, irregular electrical activation of the atria (350 to 400 bpm), resulting in:

- **Loss of coordinated contraction**: This affects the transport function in the atria.
- **Irregular ventricular rate**: It also leads to loss of ventricular rate adaptation to increased demands (arrhythmia absoluta).

In an aging population, the prevalence and incidence of AF are expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades. Unlike most other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation cannot usually be cured. Most patients progress from paroxysmal AF, where AF alternates with periods of sinus rhythm, to sustained forms, even when currently available therapeutic options are applied. This sobering finding is aggravated by the dramatic consequences that AF implies for affected individuals and society.

Other relevant outcomes in AF are indicated in.

- **Figure 1**: Natural time course of atrial fibrillation. It shows a typical chaotic pattern of time in atrial fibrillation (black) and time in sinus rhythm (grey) over time (x-axis). Atrial fibrillation progresses from undiagnosed, to first diagnosed, paroxysmal, persistent, to permanent. Flashes indicate cardioversions as examples of therapeutic interventions that influence the natural time course of the arrhythmia.

### Global burden of atrial fibrillation and flutter by national income: Results from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 database [^1137WP55]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Both atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) prevalence, as well as deaths, are strongly age-dependent. The age-specific relative prevalence increases with age, peaking in the 90 to 94 years age group and slightly decreasing in the age group ≥ 95 years across all income groups. The difference in age-specific relative prevalence between low-income countries and the other three income groups is less than the overall relative AF/AFL prevalence (Figure 2A).

The age group ≥ 65 years accounts for 73.0% of global absolute AF/AFL prevalence: 79.0% of AF/AFL cases in high-income countries, 71.2% in upper-middle-income countries, 68.0% in lower-middle-income countries, and 65.5% in low-income countries occur in this age group. The peak of absolute prevalence differs between income groups. In high-income countries, the highest absolute prevalence of AF/AFL is observed among individuals aged 75 to 79 years. In contrast, in upper-middle-, lower-middle-, and low-income countries, the highest absolute prevalence occurs in the 70 to 74 years age group.

Until the age of 70 to 74 years, upper-middle-income countries exhibit the highest absolute prevalence. In contrast, high-income countries lead in absolute prevalence from the age group of 75 to 79 years onwards. Until the age of 60 to 64 years, lower-middle-income countries show a higher absolute prevalence than high-income countries (Figure 2B). The age-specific death rate continuously increases with age, with comparatively small differences between income groups (Figure 2C).

### Large-scale screening studies for atrial fibrillation - is it worth the effort [^11375zMu]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Why is atrial fibrillation a candidate for medical screening? Wilson and Jungner presented the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for medical screening in 1968. Atrial fibrillation (AF) seems to fulfill most of these criteria, but there are remaining uncertainties.

AF is a common disease with a rising prevalence, even when only symptomatic cases are considered. It undoubtedly has asymptomatic forms. It is common to find episodes of AF with and without symptoms within the same individual. Even if less is known about predictors for symptoms in AF, asymptomatic forms seem to be more common with persistent forms and a normal heart rate.

As there is no diagnostic test with 100% sensitivity or specificity, the screening process will result in false-positive and false-negative cases. The diagnostic performance of a screening test is summarized in a two-by-two table, as would be shown in a figure. For most individuals with risk factors for stroke, the risk of having AF without oral anticoagulation (OAC) treatment is higher than the risk of having OAC treatment without an AF diagnosis. Hence, a missed diagnosis of AF constitutes a higher risk than a falsely positive diagnosed AF, and high sensitivity is very important for the screening test. On the other hand, if the disease prevalence is low in the screened population, the proportion of false positives will grow in importance in the balance between sensitivity and specificity. For example, with an untreated disease prevalence of 5%, sensitivity and…

### Management of newly detected atrial fibrillation: A clinical practice guideline from the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians [^116XDtfT]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The Joint Panel of the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians, in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Evidence-based Practice Center, systematically reviewed the available evidence on the management of newly detected atrial fibrillation and developed recommendations for adult patients with first-detected atrial fibrillation. These recommendations do not apply to patients with postoperative or post-myocardial infarction atrial fibrillation, patients with class IV heart failure, patients already taking antiarrhythmic drugs, or patients with valvular disease. The target physician audience is internists and family physicians dedicated to primary care.

The recommendations are as follows:

- **Recommendation 1**: Rate control with chronic anticoagulation is the recommended strategy for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation. Rhythm control has not been shown to be superior to rate control (with chronic anticoagulation) in reducing morbidity and mortality and may be inferior in some patient subgroups to rate control. Rhythm control is appropriate when based on other special considerations, such as patient symptoms, exercise tolerance, and patient preference. Grade: 2A.

- **Recommendation 2**: Patients with atrial fibrillation should receive chronic anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin, unless they are at low risk of stroke or have a specific contraindication to the use of warfarin (e.g. thrombocytopenia, recent trauma or surgery, alcoholism). Grade: 1A.

### Treatment timing and the effects of rhythm control strategy in patients with atrial fibrillation: Nationwide cohort study [^112w9rgz]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of mortality and morbidity from stroke and congestive heart failure, and impairs quality of life, even for patients with optimal anticoagulation and rate control treatment. Rate control is integral to the management of atrial fibrillation and is often sufficient to improve related symptoms. Rhythm control refers to attempts to restore and maintain sinus rhythm using antiarrhythmic drug treatment, cardioversion, and atrial fibrillation ablation together with adequate rate control. Such treatment improves symptoms and the quality of life of patients.

Several randomized trials have compared rhythm control with rate control, including the landmark Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Sinus Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) trial, and shown no significant differences between these treatment strategies in their effect on mortality and stroke. It has been suggested that ablation improves outcomes in selected patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure in comparison with antiarrhythmic drug treatment combined with rate control. One trial showed that, in comparison with a placebo, the antiarrhythmic drug dronedarone reduced the composite outcome of death from any causes or the first admission to the hospital for cardiovascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation. Data on the prognostic effect of rhythm control treatment are inconclusive, with no clear indication of benefit or harm.

Recently, the Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET 4) showed that rhythm control treatment was a

### Expert consensus document: Defining the major health modifiers causing atrial fibrillation: A roadmap to underpin personalized prevention and treatment [^114cZXZW]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite remarkable advances in antiarrhythmic drugs, ablation procedures, and stroke-prevention strategies, atrial fibrillation (AF) remains an important cause of death and disability in middle-aged and elderly individuals. Unstructured management of patients with AF sharply contrasts with our detailed, although incomplete, knowledge of the mechanisms that cause AF and its complications. Altered calcium homeostasis, atrial fibrosis and ageing, ion-channel dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, fat-cell infiltration, and oxidative stress, in addition to a susceptible genetic background, contribute to the promotion, maintenance, and progression of AF. However, clinical management of patients with AF is currently guided by stroke risk parameters, AF pattern, and symptoms.

In response to this apparent disconnect between the known pathophysiology of AF and clinical management, we propose a roadmap to develop a set of clinical markers that reflect the major causes of AF in patients. Thereby, the insights into the mechanisms causing AF will be transformed into a format that can underpin future personalized strategies to prevent and treat AF, ultimately informing better patient care.

### Systematic review: Comparative effectiveness of radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^114RzN3h]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia, and medical treatment often fails to control symptoms.

- **Purpose**: To compare the benefits and harms of radiofrequency catheter ablation and medical therapy in adults with atrial fibrillation.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2000 to December 2008) were searched for English-language reports of studies involving adults.

- **Study selection**: Six independent reviewers screened abstracts to identify longitudinal studies of adults with atrial fibrillation who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation. Studies were required to report on arrhythmia or other cardiovascular outcomes at least six months after ablation or any adverse events.

- **Data extraction**: Data were extracted by one of four reviewers and verified by a cardiac electrophysiologist. Study quality and overall strength of evidence for each question were rated by two independent reviewers, with disagreements resolved by consensus.

- **Data synthesis**: A total of 108 studies met the eligibility criteria. Moderate strength of evidence (3 trials; n = 30 to 198) indicated that radiofrequency ablation following a failed course of medication was more likely than continued drug therapy alone to maintain sinus rhythm. Low strength of evidence (4 trials [n = 30 to 137] and 1 retrospective study [n = 1171]) suggested that radiofrequency ablation improved quality of life, promoted avoidance of anticoagulation, and decreased readmission rates compared with medical treatment. Major adverse events occurred in fewer than 5% of patients in most of the 84 studies.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115u6DyL]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

For patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF), particularly following cardiac surgery, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend rhythm assessment at a 30–60-day follow-up if they are being treated with a rate control strategy. It is advisable to consider cardioversion after an adequate duration of anticoagulation if AF does not revert to sinus rhythm spontaneously.

### Methodologic differences across studies of patients with atrial fibrillation lead to varying estimates of stroke risk [^117GQ6DP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be made available to other researchers for the purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the analyses. The studies analyzed have been previously published and are easily accessible for review. This article is an analysis of previously published data and methods from multiple reports. No new data were collected, and institutional review board approval was not required to undertake this analysis of published data.

- **Study selection**: The analysis focuses on a subgroup of studies from our previous systematic review of studies reporting stroke rates among patients with AF not taking OAC (Figure 1). We excluded randomized controlled trials, which contribute only a small fraction of follow-up of AF patients off anticoagulants, and we focus exclusively on large observational cohort studies where design and analysis methods are more variable. To this end, we restricted our analyses to studies that included at least 5,000 patients. These remaining nine studies represented 1,137,597 person-years or 95% of total follow-up from the original set of 24 studies, and also included all cohorts that are repeatedly cited in AHA/ACC/HRS and ESC guidelines.

- **Description of cohort methods and composition**: Published articles, online supplements, and cited references (where applicable) were reviewed, and the methodologic characteristics of each study were recorded and categorized.

Selection of worldwide atrial fibrillation observational cohort studies is depicted in Figure 1.

### Quinidine sulfate [^115F8KaZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Quinidine sulfate is indicated for several specific uses in the treatment and management of atrial fibrillation/flutter and ventricular arrhythmias.

- **Conversion of atrial fibrillation/flutter**: In patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation/flutter whose symptoms are not adequately controlled by measures that reduce the rate of ventricular response, quinidine sulfate is indicated to restore normal sinus rhythm. If this use of quinidine sulfate does not restore sinus rhythm within a reasonable time (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION), then quinidine sulfate should be discontinued.

- **Reduction of frequency of relapse into atrial fibrillation/flutter**: Chronic therapy with quinidine sulfate is recommended for some patients at high risk of symptomatic atrial fibrillation/flutter. This generally applies to patients who have had previous episodes that were frequent and poorly tolerated, outweighing the risks of prophylactic therapy with quinidine sulfate. The increased risk of death should specifically be considered. Quinidine sulfate should only be used after alternative measures, such as the use of other drugs to control the ventricular rate, have been found inadequate. For patients with histories of frequent symptomatic episodes, the goal of therapy should be to increase the average time between episodes. It is common for the tachyarrhythmia to recur during therapy, and a single recurrence should not be interpreted as therapeutic failure.

- **Suppression of ventricular arrhythmias**: Quinidine sulfate is also indicated for the suppression of documented ventricular arrhythmias.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^114Vswzd]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to ECG monitoring, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the inference of AF frequency, duration, and burden using automated algorithms available from ECG monitors, implantable cardiac monitors, and cardiac rhythm devices with an atrial lead in patients with a diagnosis of AF. It is recognized that periodic review can be required to exclude other arrhythmias.

### Rate control versus rhythm control in atrial fibrillation: Lessons learned from clinical trials of atrial fibrillation [^111yoNhZ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Ample evidence supports the statement that in patients with atrial fibrillation for whom treatment is warranted, either rhythm control or rate control are acceptable primary therapeutic options. If a rhythm control strategy is chosen, it is important to consider that recurrence of atrial fibrillation is not treatment failure per se; occasional recurrence, with cardioversion if necessary, may be quite acceptable. The frequency, duration, and symptoms associated with recurrence will dictate whether a change in rhythm control therapy is required, such as altering the antiarrhythmic drug or initiating or repeating atrial fibrillation ablation. A rhythm control strategy should also include careful attention to, and treatment of, comorbidities such as hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes.

Conversely, if a rate control strategy is preferred, treatment with a beta blocker or a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is almost always necessary to achieve adequate rate control. Digoxin is often useful for obtaining satisfactory rate control in combination with these agents and may serve as a primary therapy in the presence of hypotension or heart failure. Satisfactory ventricular rate control is generally a resting rate of less than 110 beats per minute, though resting rates below 90 beats per minute are probably wiser. Finally, when pursuing a rhythm control strategy, due to the common recurrence of atrial fibrillation, rate control therapy should be part of the treatment regimen.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^114srEj8]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly concerning patients with atrial flutter anticoagulation, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend continuing anticoagulation for at least four weeks after successful cardioversion or ablation, resulting in the restoration of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial flutter.

### Different implications of heart failure, ischemic stroke, and mortality between nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter-a view from a national cohort study [^116QBWRt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Few studies have investigated differences in clinical outcomes between atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) in a real-world setting. The Canadian Registry of Atrial Fibrillation reported incident stroke rates were 1.33/100 person‐years in AF patients and 1.24/100 person‐years in AFL patients, whereas incident stroke rates were 3.2/100 person‐years in AF patients and 2.8/100 person‐years in AFL patients in the Framingham study.

Although a meta‐analysis reported embolic events in patients with AFL after cardioversion, and the Framingham study reported that AFL significantly contributed to stroke, they both concluded that the impact of AFL and AF on stroke was similar, which is different from our findings. This may be due to several reasons.

- **Study population size and anticoagulant therapy**:
	- The two studies included a small number of patients with AFL (our study included 5,000 patients with AFL and more than 100,000 patients with AF) and had a longer observation period. We excluded patients receiving anticoagulant therapy, whereas the other two studies did not. Anticoagulation therapy is known to reduce the risk of stroke.

- **Type of stroke**:
	- Ischemic stroke, but not hemorrhagic stroke, is the major type of stroke related to AF, and previous studies did not specialize in ischemic stroke as we did.

- **Heart failure and mortality**:
	- Although the Framingham study reported no differences in heart failure and mortality between patients with AF and AFL in age‐ and sex‐adjusted analysis, the authors still suggested that future studies with a larger number of cases were needed.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111jU6ah]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

For patients with atrial flutter, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend close follow-up and arrhythmia monitoring to detect silent atrial fibrillation (AF) after successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation. This is particularly crucial for those deemed to be at high thromboembolic risk without any known previous history of AF, especially if they are not receiving ongoing anticoagulation. Such measures are advised due to the significant risk of AF in these patients.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^112BvycQ]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically in relation to rhythm control and electrical cardioversion, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the use of biphasic energy of at least 200 J as the initial energy. This approach aims to improve the success of the initial electrical shock in patients with AF undergoing elective electrical cardioversion.

### Atrial fibrillation: Common questions and answers about diagnosis and treatment [^115TCGPH]. American Family Physician (2024). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of stroke and all-cause mortality. It is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia in adults in the primary care setting, and its prevalence increases with age. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults older than 50 years for atrial fibrillation.

Many patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic. However, symptoms can include palpitations, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, and chest pain. Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination findings and should be confirmed with 12-lead electrocardiography or another recording device. The initial evaluation should include transthoracic echocardiography; serum electrolyte levels; complete blood count; and thyroid, kidney, and liver function tests.

Stroke risk should be assessed in patients with atrial fibrillation using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of stroke by preventing atrial thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral or systemic emboli.

- **Management of hemodynamically unstable patients**: Hemodynamically unstable patients, including those with decompensated heart failure, should be evaluated and treated emergently.

- **Management of hemodynamically stable patients**: Most hemodynamically stable patients should be treated initially with rate control and anticoagulation. Rhythm control, using medications or procedures, should be considered in patients with hemodynamic instability or, in some patients, based on risk factors and shared decision-making. Electrical cardioversion may be appropriate as a first-line treatment.

### Atrial flutter: More than just one of a kind [^1173km1Z]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Since its first description about one century ago, our understanding of atrial flutter (AFL) circuits has considerably evolved. One AFL circuit can have variable electrocardiographic (ECG) manifestations depending on the presence of pre-existing atrial lesions or impaired atrial substrate. Conversely, different atrial circuits, whether right-sided or even left-sided, including various mechanisms (macroreentrant, microreentrant, or focal), can present with a very similar surface ECG manifestation.

The development of efficient high-resolution electroanatomical mapping systems has improved our knowledge about AFL mechanisms and facilitated their curative treatment with radiofrequency catheter ablation. This article will review ECG features for typical and atypical flutters and emphasize the limitations for circuit location from the surface ECG.

### Non-pharmacologic management of atrial fibrillation [^112F86zc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice today. Contemporary medical treatment options include atrioventricular nodal blocking agents to control heart rates during AF, antiarrhythmic drugs aimed at maintaining normal sinus rhythm, and anticoagulation therapies to reduce stroke risk.

Invasive treatment of AF has emerged because of the toxicities and lack of long-term efficacy of available antiarrhythmic medications, along with the lack of improvement in symptoms for rate-controlled patients. The investigators review the evolution of the catheter-delivered AF procedures, starting with surgical maze up to and including left atrial appendage occlusion devices. Individual catheter ablation targets, both anatomic and electrophysiologic, are discussed, with a particular focus on the use of an incremental ablation target strategy dependent on the type of AF being treated.

In conclusion, the history of invasive AF therapy provides a basic understanding of contemporary ablation strategies and a backdrop for the cutting-edge rhythm and stroke prevention therapies of today.

### Efficacy and safety of ablation for people with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^113s3h2m]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

The optimal rhythm management strategy for people with non-paroxysmal (persistent or long-standing persistent) atrial fibrillation is currently not well defined. Antiarrhythmic drugs have been the mainstay of therapy, but recently, for individuals who have not responded to these drugs, ablation (both catheter and surgical) has emerged as an alternative method to maintain sinus rhythm and avoid long-term atrial fibrillation complications. However, evidence from randomized trials regarding the efficacy and safety of ablation in non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is limited.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy and safety of ablation (catheter and surgical) in people with non-paroxysmal (persistent or long-standing persistent) atrial fibrillation compared to antiarrhythmic drugs.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, conference abstracts, clinical trial registries, and the Health Technology Assessment Database. These databases were searched from their inception to 1 April 2016 with no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized trials evaluating the effect of radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) or surgical ablation compared with antiarrhythmic drugs in adults with non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, regardless of any concomitant underlying heart disease, with at least 12 months of follow-up.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data. We evaluated the risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool.

### Atrial fibrillation is common after ablation of isolated atrial flutter during long-term follow-up [^11588iUV]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Previous studies have shown that the incidence of atrial fibrillation after atrial flutter ablation is approximately 20% among patients presenting with typical atrial flutter and no history of fibrillation. However, studies involving this population have been small, with follow-up typically less than 2 years.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to provide a more accurate perspective on the long-term risk of atrial fibrillation in patients presenting with isolated typical flutter.

- **Methods**: Clinical records of consecutive patients who had flutter ablations at Presbyterian Medical Center between 1999 and 2004 were assessed (n = 254). Patients with no apparent history of atrial fibrillation before their flutter ablation were identified. Retrospective follow-up data on these patients were obtained by review of medical records from our institution, from patients' cardiologists and primary care physicians, and by direct patient questionnaires. Postablation atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias were identified by electrocardiography, Holter monitoring, and subsequent clinical records.

- **Results**: Postablation atrial fibrillation was identified in 40 (50%) of 80 patients, and an additional three patients presented with atypical atrial flutter, following a mean follow-up of 29.6 ± 21.7 months. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was progressive, with 49% occurring after 2 years. There was no difference in age, left atrial size, hypertension, structural heart disease, or left ventricular dysfunction in patients who developed atrial fibrillation compared with those who did not.

Regarding the medical management of atrial fibrillation, specifically in terms of rhythm control and electrical cardioversion, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend optimizing the electrode vector and using higher energy. Additionally, the guidelines suggest administering pretreatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to facilitate the success of electrical cardioversion in patients with AF undergoing elective cardioversion, particularly those with a longer duration of AF or an unsuccessful initial shock.

### Separating atrial flutter from atrial fibrillation with apparent electrocardiographic organization using dominant and narrow F-wave spectra [^1162bRjC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to separate atrial flutter (AFL) with atypical F waves from atrial fibrillation (AF) with "apparent organization". We hypothesized that F-wave spectra should reveal a dominant and narrow peak in AFL, reflecting its single macro-re-entrant wavefront, but broad spectra in AF, reflecting multiple wavefronts.

We identified 39 patients with electrocardiograms (ECGs) classified as "AFL/AF" or "coarse AF" from 134 consecutive patients referred for ablation: 21 had AFL (18 atypical, 3 typical), 18 had AF, and all were successfully ablated. Filtered atrial ECGs were created by cross-correlating F waves to successive ECG time points. Dominant peaks between 3 and 10 Hz were identified from power spectra of X (lead V5), Y (aVF), and Z (V1) axes. For each, we calculated height (relative to two adjacent spectral points) and area ratio to envelopes of bandwidths 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, and 5 Hz (range 0 to 1, where higher ratios reflect narrower peaks).

Dominant peaks had greater relative height for AFL than AF (three-axis mean: 14.2 ± 6.4 dB vs. 6.6 ± 2.1 dB; p < 0.001). The area ratio was also higher for AFL (0.52 ± 0.22 vs. 0.33 ± 0.09; p < 0.001). Spectral measures were combined into a decision metric with estimated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ≥ 0.44 to identify all cases of AFL from AF (p < 0.001). A panel of seven cardiologists blinded to clinical data provided lower diagnostic accuracy (82.1%; p < 0.01).

In ambiguous ECGs with atypical F waves, spectral evidence for a solitary activation pattern can help distinguish AFL from AF.

### Different implications of heart failure, ischemic stroke, and mortality between nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter-a view from a national cohort study [^111YYYe5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

This case-control cohort study included a large number of cases and showed different prognoses between atrial flutter (AFL) and atrial fibrillation (AF). In a real-world setting without any preventative ischemic stroke strategy, AF and AFL were associated with different comorbidities and incidences of ischemic stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality. These differences in the incidences of ischemic stroke, heart failure hospitalization, and all-cause mortality still existed after propensity score matching.

### Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation [^114xjxRz]. Heart (2019).

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, currently affecting over 33 million individuals worldwide, and its prevalence is expected to more than double over the next 40 years. AF is associated with a twofold increase in premature mortality and important major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart failure, severe stroke, and myocardial infarction.

Significant effort has been made over a number of years to define the underlying cellular, molecular, and electrophysiological changes that predispose individuals to the induction and maintenance of AF. Progress has been limited by the realization that AF is a complex arrhythmia that can result from various pathophysiological processes, demonstrating significant heterogeneity between individual patients and between species.

In this focused review article, we aim to succinctly summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of AF for the non-specialist. We address all aspects of pathophysiology, including the basic electrophysiological and structural changes within the left atrium, the genetics of AF, and the links to comorbidities and wider systemic and metabolic perturbations that may be upstream contributors to the development of AF. Finally, we outline the translational implications and future rhythm control strategies for patients with AF.

### Inter-relationships of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter mechanisms and clinical implications [^1164cLun]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

There is a close interrelationship between atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL). Atrial fibrillation of variable duration precedes the onset of AFL in almost all instances; during AF, the functional components needed to complete the AFL re-entrant circuit, principally a line of block (LoB) between the vena cavae, are formed; if this LoB does not form, classical AFL does not develop. In contrast, there seems to be a spectrum of atrial re-entrant circuits (drivers) of short cycle lengths (CLs) (i.e. AFL). When the CL of the AFL re-entrant circuit is so short that it will only activate portions of the atria in a 1:1 manner, the rest of the atria will be activated rapidly but irregularly (i.e. via fibrillatory conduction), resulting in AF.

In short, there are probably several mechanisms of AF, one of which is due to a very rapid AFL causing fibrillatory conduction. All of these interactions of AF and AFL have important clinical implications.

### Electrical cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and flutter [^116wRKRT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation increases stroke risk and adversely affects cardiovascular hemodynamics. Electrical cardioversion may, by restoring sinus rhythm, improve cardiovascular hemodynamics, reduce the risk of stroke, and obviate the need for long-term anticoagulation.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation or flutter on the risk of thromboembolic events, strokes, and mortality (primary outcomes), as well as the rate of cognitive decline, quality of life, use of anticoagulants, and risk of re-hospitalization (secondary outcomes) in adults over 18 years.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials (1967 to May 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2004), Embase (1980 to May 2004), CINAHL (1982 to May 2004), and proceedings of the American College of Cardiology, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (1983 to 2003). Additional searches were conducted on www.trialscentral.org, www.controlled-trials.com, and reference lists of articles. We hand-searched the indexes of the Proceedings of the British Cardiac Society published in the British Heart Journal (1980 to 1995) and in Heart (1995 to 2002), proceedings of the European Congress of Cardiology and meetings of the Joint Working Groups of the European Society of Cardiology, published in the European Heart Journal (1983–2003), and scientific sessions of the American Heart Association published in Circulation (1990–2003). Personal contact was made with experts.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials of electrical cardioversion plus 'usual care' versus other interventions were included.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with postoperative AF, rate and rhythm control, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend performing direct cardioversion in combination with antiarrhythmic drug therapy in patients with poorly tolerated AF (lasting > 48 hours) after cardiac surgery and not receiving anticoagulation. Consider obtaining imaging to rule out left appendage thrombus before cardioversion.

### Atrial flutter: Clinical risk factors and adverse outcomes in the Framingham Heart Study [^116UX1mA]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Low credibility.

Few epidemiologic cohort studies have evaluated atrial flutter (flutter) as an arrhythmia distinct from atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical correlates of flutter and its associated outcomes to distinguish them from those associated with AF in the Framingham Heart Study.

- **Methods**: We reviewed and adjudicated electrocardiograms (ECGs) previously classified as flutter or AF/flutter and another 100 ECGs randomly selected from AF cases. We examined the clinical correlates of flutter by matching up to 5 AF and 5 referents to each flutter case using a nested case referent design. We determined the 10-year outcomes associated with flutter with Cox models.

- **Results**: During mean follow-up of 33.0 ± 12.2 years, 112 participants (mean age 72 ± 10 years, 30% women) developed flutter. In multivariable analyses, smoking (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54–5.23), increased PR interval (OR 1.28 per SD, 95% CI 1.03–1.60), myocardial infarction (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.05–4.80), and heart failure (OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.26–21.64) were associated with incident flutter. In age- and sex-adjusted models, flutter (vs referents) was associated with a 10-year increased risk of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 5.01, 95% CI 3.14–7.99), myocardial infarction (HR 3.05, 95% CI 1.42–6.59), heart failure (HR 4.14, 95% CI 1.90–8.99), stroke (HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.13–4.17), and mortality (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.44–2.79).

- **Conclusion**: We identified the clinical correlates associated with flutter and observed that flutter was associated with multiple adverse outcomes.

### Atrial fibrillation [^1124KDUb]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac rhythm disorder, with its prevalence increasing alongside age and cardiovascular comorbidities. AF is characterized by a rapid and irregular heartbeat, which can be asymptomatic or cause symptoms such as palpitations, dyspnea, and dizziness. The condition is associated with serious complications, including an increased risk of stroke.

Recent developments in the clinical epidemiology and management of AF have significantly informed our approach to this arrhythmia. This Primer provides a comprehensive overview of AF, including its epidemiology, mechanisms, pathophysiology, diagnosis, screening, prevention, and management. Management strategies, including stroke prevention, rate control, and rhythm control, are considered. Quality of life issues are also addressed, alongside an outlook on future developments and ongoing clinical trials in managing this common arrhythmia.

### Case studies with the experts: Management decisions in atrial fibrillation [^112jtifC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common outpatient arrhythmia. The recent ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines outline a variety of approaches to the management of AF, but their implementation into clinical practice requires multi-faceted patient evaluations and assessments for optimizing patient care. Using a case-based approach, issues such as rate versus rhythm control, anticoagulation, cardioversion, pharmacological and catheter ablation for maintenance of sinus rhythm, and the pathophysiology of AF are discussed. These data were originally presented at a satellite symposium titled "Case Studies with the Experts: Management Decisions in AF", held on May 10, 2007, during the annual Heart Rhythm Society meeting.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1163kV9u]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly with respect to patients with atrial flutter, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of long-term anticoagulation after successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in patients with typical atrial flutter without any known previous history of atrial fibrillation. This is particularly important for those at high risk for the development of atrial fibrillation, such as patients with left atrium enlargement, inducible atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or heart failure. If the thromboembolic risk assessment suggests a high risk (greater than 2% annual risk) for stroke, long-term anticoagulation should be considered.

### Long-term outcomes after hospitalization for atrial fibrillation or flutter [^114zpppF]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Categorical data are presented as frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation or as median and interquartile range (IQR). Differences between groups were tested using the χ² or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables, and the Student's t-test or Mann–Whitney U test for continuous variables, where appropriate. Comorbidities were derived using the Condition Category (CC) classification, which groups ICD-10 diagnoses into 180 clinically meaningful conditions based on the selected secondary diagnoses of the index admission and all diagnosis codes from hospitalizations in the preceding 12 months.

Survival probability was estimated using Kaplan–Meier time-to-event analysis, with results reported as percentages and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A flexible parametric survival model was used to estimate the expected survival, observed survival, and the loss in life expectancy. These estimations were adjusted for patient characteristics and comorbidities impacting survival. Variables for adjustment were identified by fitting a multivariable Cox regression model with mortality as the outcome variable. Independent variables included age, sex, presenting region, treatment at a private hospital, receipt of catheter ablation, cardioversion, or coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention during the index hospitalization, and all comorbidities with a statistically significant relationship (P < .25) in a univariate analysis, or a clinically plausible relationship with the outcome of death.

### Atrial fibrillation burden: a new outcome predictor and therapeutic target [^116AWPiA]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation burden and stroke rate in patients with different atrial fibrillation patterns:

Anticoagulants prevent stroke in patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) via ECG. The risk of stroke in patients with paroxysmal AF without anticoagulation is 2% per year, which is lower than the 3% per year risk in patients with chronic forms of AF. The average AF burden in patients with paroxysmal AF is approximately 5%–11%. Conceptually, the arrhythmia burden should be 100% in patients with persistent and permanent AF. Occasional regression of AF leads to an estimated AF burden of 70%–100% in patients with persistent AF. Still, the AF burden is approximately 10-fold higher in persistent AF than in paroxysmal AF.

Rhythm control therapy achieves a 10-fold reduction of AF burden compared with paroxysmal AF without rhythm control, reducing it to 0.5%–3%. Early rhythm control therapy has been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes, including stroke, to below 1% per year as demonstrated in the EAST-AFNET 4 trial. The rate of stroke appears to be less than 1% per year after AF ablation, which is the most effective rhythm control therapy.

The effectiveness of oral anticoagulation after successful AF ablation is currently being studied in the ongoing OCEAN trial (Optimal Anti-Coagulation for Enhanced-Risk Patients Post–Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation). This stroke rate is similar to the rate of stroke in patients with DDAF who receive anticoagulation (0.7% per year) and have an even lower AF burden than those with AF on rhythm control at 0.13%.

### Emergency department management of atrial fibrillation and flutter and patient quality of life at one month postvisit [^111AQG13]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We identify characteristics of patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter associated with favorable assessments of emergency department (ED) effectiveness and 30-day quality of life. As part of a prospective observational study of ED management and short-term outcomes of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or flutter, we adapted a disease-specific quality-of-life instrument. By telephone, we administered the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-life survey to patients 30 days after an ED visit in which they were treated for newly diagnosed or recent-onset atrial fibrillation or flutter and discharged home. We also asked respondents to rate the effectiveness of ED treatment. Using data prospectively collected in the ED and extracted from electronic health records, we recorded rhythm management (cardioversion attempts and type) and patient and ED treatment characteristics. Using multivariable regression, we examined the association between these characteristics and patient-reported effectiveness of ED treatment ("very effective" or not) and any atrial fibrillation or flutter quality-of-life effect.

Six hundred fifty-two eligible ED patients (response rate 89%) treated between May 2011 and November 2012 completed follow-up. Of these patients, 454 (69.6%) reported that their ED treatment was "very effective" and 113 (17.3%) reported no quality-of-life influence. In multivariable analyses, there was an association between ED electrocardioversion and perceived ED effectiveness (p < 0.05) but none between treatment strategy and 30-day quality of life outcomes.

### Stroke with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter: A descriptive population-based study from the Brest stroke registry [^11414LHG]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

In 2008, the prevalence of atrial arrhythmia-related stroke was analyzed based on age and gender. Of the 733 patients with ischemic stroke recorded that year, 231 had atrial arrhythmia (AA), accounting for 31.5%.

The CHADS2 score, which assesses stroke risk in patients with AA, was calculated for 207 patients known to have AA prior to their stroke. Among these, 10 patients (4.8%) scored 0, and 33 (15.9%) scored 1. Antithrombotic therapy based on the CHADS2 score is detailed in Table 2. Of the 152 patients with a CHADS2 score of 2 or more, 73.4% received Vitamin K Antagonists (VKA), with 35.5% receiving VKA alone and three patients combining it with aspirin. In two cases, INR, which measures the effectiveness of VKA, was undetermined.

- **CHADS2 score and therapy**:
	- Antithrombotic therapy was administered according to the CHADS2 score (Table 2).
	- INR levels in patients on VKA varied according to CHADS2 scores (Table 3).

- **Age-related findings**:
	- The proportion of at-risk patients receiving VKA decreased with age: 50% for those aged 50–74, 43.8% for ages 75–84, and 25% for those 85 and older.

The CHA2DS2-VASc score was also calculated for the same group of 207 patients. Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of patients based on CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores, with 195 patients classified as high risk on CHA2DS2-VASc versus 152 on CHADS2.

### Catheter ablation vs. antiarrhythmic drug treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation: a multicentre, randomized, controlled trial (SARA study) [^112T7GaJ]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

In an intention-to-treat analysis, the proportion of patients free of any recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter (lasting > 30 seconds) at the end of follow-up was higher in the catheter ablation (CA) group compared to the antiarrhythmic drug treatment (ADT) group (60.2% vs. 29.2%; P < 0.001), with a 31% absolute risk difference (95% CI 14.9–47.1).

- **Need for cardioversion**: This was higher in the ADT group than in the CA group (50% vs. 34.7%; P = 0.018). During the blanking period, the ADT group had a higher rate of recurrences compared with the CA group (54.2% vs. 29.6%, respectively; P = 0.004), without significant differences in the rate of cardioversions (33.3% vs. 23.5%, respectively; P = 0.206).

Of those patients in the ADT group with recurrences during the blanking period, 65.4% were treated with class III antiarrhythmics, and 34.6% were under class Ic. All patients treated with class III drugs remained under this therapy after the recurrence, whereas 33.3% of patients treated with class Ic switched to class III, and 33.3% increased the dose of the same drug. Only 13 patients (13.3%) in the CA group and 7 (14.6%) in the ADT group recurred only during the blanking period.

- **Early recurrences in CA arm**: These implied an increased risk for the occurrence of the primary endpoint (OR 5.30; 95% CI 2.05–13.69; P = 0.002).

At the end of the follow-up, 23 patients (47.9%) in the ADT group underwent CA after reaching the primary endpoint, with four requiring two procedures. None of the patients in the ADT group underwent CA before reaching the primary endpoint (0% crossovers). In the CA arm, 35.7% of patients received ADT before…

### Rates of atrial fibrillation in Black versus White patients with pacemakers [^115TVFJ3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

- **Cumulative rate of atrial flutter**: In patients with pacemakers, stratified by Black versus White race. The difference between groups was not significant (P = 0.08 for the log-rank test).

- **Cumulative rate of atrial fibrillation or flutter**: In patients with pacemakers, stratified by Black versus White race. The difference between groups was significant (P < 0.001 for the log-rank test).

Despite their lower rate of atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter, Black patients had a higher cumulative rate of ischemic stroke (7.3%; 95% CI 6.4–8.3) than White patients (5.1%; 95% CI 4.8–5.3; P < 0.001 for the log-rank test). The higher hazard of stroke in Black patients persisted after adjustment for demographic characteristics and vascular risk factors, including AF and atrial flutter (hazard ratio 1.58; 95% CI 1.42–1.76). This association was not substantially different in a sensitivity analysis limited to embolic stroke or in a matched Cox analysis.

### Cross-trial comparisons: A source of confusion, use, or both in the management of patients with atrial fibrillation [^112a349r]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Many medical therapies are shaped by clinical trial data. However, individual clinical trial results sometimes appear discordant for the same tested treatments, and competing treatment strategies are often not directly tested. Clinicians are forced to make decisions by extrapolating information from different trials of similar but nonidentical therapies. In an era where increasing medical complexity demands sound evidence-based decisions, clinicians must navigate through these issues to arrive at optimal patient-specific management decisions. Using trials investigating therapies for atrial fibrillation, we attempt to highlight the important points for practitioners to consider when making these comparative intertrial judgments.

### Contemporary management of atrial fibrillation: What can clinical registries tell us about stroke prevention and current therapeutic approaches [^112K1DhH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Cataloging AF registries: Tables 1 through 4 provide overviews of the registries identified, which have been grouped into the following broad categories: (1) those focused on thromboprophylaxis and stroke prevention (Table 1); (2) those on cardioversion and AAD therapy (Table 2); (3) those on ablation (Table 3); and (4) LAAC (Table 4). Several registries address multiple aspects of AF diagnosis and management and could be allocated to more than one category.

To enable some key findings to be visualized more clearly, registries that provide information on medical treatments for AF (including use of agents for rhythm and rate control, warfarin, aspirin, and new oral anticoagulants [NOACs]) are also shown separately in Table 5.

### Global burden of atrial fibrillation and flutter by national income: Results from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 database [^111sVm5e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The GBD database is a freely accessible resource delivered by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation of the University of Washington. The GBD's goal is to improve the understanding of global diseases and their causes. The study was designed in compliance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting recommendations. Extensive descriptions of the methodology of the GBD 2019 data set are available in the manuscript and appendix of a systematic analysis by the GBD 2019 Diseases and Injuries Collaborators.

In brief, we summarize the most important aspects of this methodology. The underlying primary data are collected by an international collaborative network to which over 9,000 researchers from more than 160 countries contribute. Most primary data are gathered by collaborating external organizations. Methods to collect such primary data include, but are not limited to, censuses, interviews, scientific literature, health care records and claims, and measurement of biometric data. In total, over 86,000 sources were used in the GBD 2019 data set. The update cycles of these collected data depend on the primary sources.

After collection, these primary data are then processed by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. The metadata and, if publicly available, the primary datasets are catalogued on the Global Health Data Exchange data page. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were computed by the addition of years of life lost and years lost to disease specifically for each age-sex-location group, with repeated draws to account.

### Current controversies in determining the main mechanisms of atrial fibrillation [^114mpeUv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite considerable basic research into the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation (AF), not much progress has been made in the prognosis of patients with AF. With the exception of anticoagulant therapy, treatments for AF still do not improve major cardiovascular outcomes. This may be due partly to the diverse etiology of AF, with increasingly more factors found to contribute to the arrhythmia.

In addition, a strong increase has been seen in the technological complexity of the methods used to quantify the main pathophysiological alterations underlying the initiation and progression of AF. Because of the lack of standardization in the technological approaches currently used, the perception of basic mechanisms of AF varies widely in the scientific community. Areas of debate include:

- **Ca(2+) handling alterations**: The role of Ca(2+) handling alterations associated with AF.
- **Atrial fibrosis**: The contribution and noninvasive assessment of the degree of atrial fibrosis.
- **Electrophysiological drivers**: The best techniques to identify electrophysiological drivers of AF.

In this review, we will summarize the state of the art of these controversial topics and describe the diverse approaches to investigating and the scientific opinions on leading AF mechanisms. Finally, we will highlight the need for transparency in scientific reporting and standardization of terminology, assumptions, algorithms, and experimental conditions used for the development of better AF therapies.

### Motpoly XR [^116QKyEp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In the short-term investigational trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures, there were no cases of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. However, both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in open-label partial-onset seizure trials and in postmarketing experiences. In adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 0.5% of patients treated with lacosamide experienced an adverse reaction of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients. Motpoly XR administration may predispose some individuals to atrial arrhythmias, especially in patients with diabetic neuropathy and/or cardiovascular disease.

- **Syncope**: In the short-term controlled trials of lacosamide in adult patients with partial-onset seizures and no significant systemic illnesses, there was no increase in syncope compared to placebo. However, in short-term controlled trials involving adult patients with diabetic neuropathy, for which lacosamide is not indicated, 1.2% of patients treated with lacosamide reported syncope or loss of consciousness, compared with 0% of placebo-treated patients. Most cases of syncope were noted in patients receiving doses above 400 mg/day. While the cause of syncope was not determined in most instances, several cases were linked to changes in orthostatic blood pressure, atrial flutter/fibrillation (and associated tachycardia), or bradycardia.

### A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with recurrent persistent atrial fibrillation [^115izmTN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). High credibility.

Maintenance of sinus rhythm is the main therapeutic goal in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, recurrences of atrial fibrillation and side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs offset the benefits of sinus rhythm. We hypothesized that ventricular rate control is not inferior to the maintenance of sinus rhythm for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned 522 patients who had persistent atrial fibrillation following a previous electrical cardioversion to receive treatment aimed at rate control or rhythm control. Patients in the rate-control group received oral anticoagulant drugs and rate-slowing medication. Patients in the rhythm-control group underwent serial cardioversions and received antiarrhythmic drugs and oral anticoagulant drugs. The end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, heart failure, thromboembolic complications, bleeding, implantation of a pacemaker, and severe adverse effects of drugs.

- **Results**: After a mean (± SD) of 2.3 ± 0.6 years, 39 percent of the 266 patients in the rhythm-control group had sinus rhythm, as compared with 10 percent of the 256 patients in the rate-control group. The primary end point occurred in 44 patients (17.2 percent) in the rate-control group and in 60 (22.6 percent) in the rhythm-control group. The 90 percent (two-sided) upper boundary of the absolute difference in the primary end point was 0.4 percent (the prespecified criterion for noninferiority was 10 percent or less). The distribution of the various components of the primary end point was similar in the rate-control group.

### Atrial fibrillation pathophysiology: Implications for management [^115GyDrS]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is an important contributor to population morbidity and mortality. An arrhythmia that is particularly common in the elderly, AF is growing in prevalence with the aging of the population. Our understanding of the basic mechanisms that govern AF occurrence and persistence has been increasing rapidly.

This article reviews the basic pathophysiology of AF over a broad range of levels, touching on:

- **Tissue mechanisms**: Mechanisms that maintain the arrhythmia.
- **Clinical presentation and basic mechanisms**: Relationship between presentation and mechanisms.
- **Ion channel and transporter abnormalities**: Abnormalities leading to ectopic impulse formation.
- **Basic models and tissue determinants of reentry**: Including ion channel determinants of reentry.
- **Electric and structural remodeling**: Nature and roles of remodeling.
- **Autonomic neural components**: Contribution of neural factors.
- **Anatomic factors**: Impact on AF.
- **Interactions between atrial and ventricular functional consequences of AF**: Understanding the interactions.
- **Basic determinants of atrial thromboembolism**: Determinants related to thrombosis.

We then review the potential implications of the basic pathophysiology of the arrhythmia for its management. We first discuss:

- **Consequences for improved rhythm control pharmacotherapy**: Targeting underlying conditions, identifying new atrium-selective drug targets, focusing on new targets for focal ectopic source suppression, and exploring upstream therapy aimed at preventing remodeling.

- **Implications of basic mechanistic considerations**: For rate control therapy, AF ablation, and the prevention of thromboembolic events.

We conclude with some thoughts about the future of translational research related to AF mechanisms.

### Different implications of heart failure, ischemic stroke, and mortality between nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter-a view from a national cohort study [^1113c8E3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia. AF is characterized by an irregularly irregular atrial rhythm with a rate of more than 350 beats per minute and electrophysiological mechanisms involving rapidly firing foci and random multiple micro‐ or macro‐reentrant activation wavelets. The number of patients with AF worldwide was reportedly 33.5 million in 2010, and it is expected to double by 2050. The Framingham Heart Study reported that AF is associated with an approximately 5‐fold increased risk of embolic stroke, 2‐fold increased risk of heart failure, and 2‐fold higher risk of mortality. Therefore, public awareness of AF and its related complications is an urgent and important issue.

Atrial flutter (AFL) is a macro‐reentrant atrial tachycardia characterized by an organized atrial rhythm with a rate usually between 250 and 350 beats per minute. The prevalence of AFL is around 200,000 in the United States, and AFL has been reported to increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, and mortality. AF and AFL have been observed to switch back and forth to one another clinically. Therefore, AF and AFL are conceptually recognized as the same risk factor in terms of preventing complications related to atrial tachyarrhythmias, and it is generally recommended according to guidelines and expert opinions that AFL patients should be risk stratified and treated in the same manner as AF patients.

Although AF and AFL share several common risk factors with regard to occurrence, and both have been reported to contribute to similar complications, further studies are necessary to explore these associations comprehensively.

### Class IC antiarrhythmic drug induced atrial flutter: Electrocardiographic and electrophysiological findings and their importance for long term outcome after right atrial isthmus ablation [^112TYRQW]. Heart (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the electrocardiographic and electrophysiological findings of new atrial flutter developing in patients taking Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs for recurrent atrial fibrillation. The study also aimed to report the long-term results of right atrial isthmus ablation in relation to the ECG pattern of spontaneous atrial flutter.

The study design was a retrospective analysis conducted in a tertiary care academic hospital. The patient cohort comprised 24 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation (mean age 54 ± 12 years; 5 female, 19 male) who developed atrial flutter while taking either propafenone (n = 12) or flecainide (n = 12).

- **Results**: The ECG was classified as typical (n = 13; 54%), atypical atrial flutter (n = 8), or coarse atrial fibrillation (n = 3). Counterclockwise atrial flutter was the predominant arrhythmia observed. Acute success following isthmus ablation was similar among patients with typical (12/13) and atypical (8/8) atrial flutter. After long-term follow-up (average 13 ± 6 months, range 6–26 months), continuation of antiarrhythmic drug treatment appeared to provide better control of atrial fibrillation recurrences in patients with typical atrial flutter (11/13) than in those with atypical atrial flutter (4/8); however, the difference was not statistically significant. Ablation for coarse atrial fibrillation was unsuccessful.

- **Conclusions**: New atrial flutter developing in patients taking Class IC antiarrhythmic drugs for recurrent atrial fibrillation exhibits either typical or atypical flutter wave morphology on ECG. The endocardial activation pattern and the acute results of ablation suggest that the flutter circuit was located in the right atrium.

### Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in pregnant women-a population-based study [^112bYM87]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) differed by race/ethnicity. AF prevalence (per 100,000 women) was 111.6 in white women, 101.7 in black women, 45.0 in Asian women, and 34.3 in Hispanic women. Compared to white women, the odds ratio (OR) of having AF was 0.3 (95% CI: 0.2–0.5) in Hispanic women and 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2–0.8) in Asian women.

Prevalence of AF also differed by age. There was no significant difference in the rate of AF in mothers who were under 25 years and those 25–29 years of age (P = 0.8). The rate of AF significantly increased after age 30, with a rate of 87.1 per 100,000 pregnancies in mothers aged 30 to 34 (P < 0.001), increasing to 104.7 per 100,000 pregnancies in mothers aged 35 to 39 (P < 0.001), and reaching 109.7 per 100,000 pregnancies in mothers aged 40 and above (P < 0.001). Compared to women under 25 years of age, the OR of having AF was 4.1, 4.9, and 5.2 in women aged 30 to 34, 35 to 39, and 40 and above, respectively.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^111pjzec]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning rhythm control and pharmacological cardioversion, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering pharmacological cardioversion as an alternative to electrical cardioversion in hemodynamically stable patients with atrial fibrillation, or in situations when electrical cardioversion is preferred but cannot be performed.
