## Question

troponin leak vs demand ischemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking to distinguish "troponin leak" from "demand ischemia" and integrate the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction framework. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions and the diagnostic framework. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie troponin release. Next, I will examine how to differentiate troponin leak from demand ischemia using clinical context, serial troponin kinetics, and supportive testing. After that, I should review prognostic implications and management strategies. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm, making sure I double-check areas of uncertainty and correct any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I don't build on a shaky premise. Troponin leak refers to low-level troponin release into the circulation without clear evidence of myocardial ischemia, often reflecting reversible membrane injury, apoptosis, or cytosolic pool release rather than overt necrosis, whereas demand ischemia (type 2 myocardial infarction) requires a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile plus objective evidence of myocardial ischemia attributable to a supply–demand mismatch unrelated to acute coronary atherothrombosis, such as new ischemic ECG changes, ischemic symptoms, or imaging evidence of new regional wall motion abnormality in an ischemic pattern [^115Z2cYr] [^114sVKDR] [^117R6ijB].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanistic distinctions because this drives interpretation. Troponin leak can arise from increased sarcolemmal permeability with stress or stretch, proteolytic degradation and release of fragments, apoptosis, or normal turnover, and these processes can release small amounts of troponin without classic necrosis; by contrast, demand ischemia reflects a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand that, when sufficiently severe or prolonged, can cause myocyte injury and necrosis with a dynamic rise and/or fall of troponin and clinical or objective ischemia, although the magnitude of troponin elevation is often lower than in type 1 MI [^116amhT5] [^1155NWLs] [^115Z2cYr] [^1112ozjV].

> Hold on, I should verify how to separate these entities at the bedside. The key is to integrate clinical context, serial troponin kinetics, and supportive evidence of ischemia. If there is a dynamic rise and/or fall of troponin above the 99th percentile and at least one ischemic criterion is present (symptoms, new ischemic ECG changes, new wall motion abnormality, or angiographic thrombus), that meets type 2 MI; if troponin is elevated with a rise/fall but there are no ischemic features, that is acute myocardial injury; if troponin is chronically elevated with minimal variation, that is chronic myocardial injury, which I should not mislabel as acute MI [^117R6ijB] [^112taSra] [^112brj5w].

> I need to check the role of serial sampling and delta criteria because misapplying thresholds can misclassify patients. A relative change greater than about 20% helps distinguish acute injury from chronic elevation, but I should confirm that the timing of sampling relative to symptom onset matters; in sepsis and other critical illnesses, the time–concentration curve can be blunted, so a small delta does not exclude acute injury, and clinical judgment remains essential to avoid overcalling or undercalling MI in the ICU [^111L8TPT] [^111qdWyP] [^112taSra].

> Let me consider supportive testing that can tilt the diagnosis one way or the other. ECG changes, echocardiographic regional wall motion abnormalities in an ischemic territory, and coronary angiography can corroborate ischemia in type 2 MI, whereas their absence favors troponin leak or nonischemic injury; importantly, angiography may reveal obstructive CAD in some presumed type 2 cases, reminding me not to anchor prematurely on a nonthrombotic mechanism without considering mixed etiologies or unrecognized plaque rupture in high-risk phenotypes [^115Z2cYr] [^111WHVTt] [^112f8X7T].

> Next, I should review prognosis because it influences how aggressively I investigate and treat. Both troponin leak and demand ischemia carry adverse prognostic implications, but the long-term mortality of type 2 MI often approximates that of type 1 MI over time, and even small perioperative troponin elevations, including microleaks, are associated with increased short- and long-term mortality; this argues for risk stratification and secondary prevention even when the acute presentation is not classic ACS [^112iA1AJ] [^113NAyjt] [^113muWbg].

> I will now examine management principles, making sure I tailor therapy to mechanism. For troponin leak, the priority is to treat the underlying precipitant and optimize comorbidities, reserving invasive coronary evaluation for patients with high-risk features or persistent concern for CAD; for demand ischemia, I should correct the supply–demand mismatch drivers such as hypoxemia, anemia, tachyarrhythmias, hypotension, or hypertension while initiating guideline-directed medical therapy as tolerated, and I should consider coronary angiography selectively when there is suspicion of concomitant plaque rupture or high-risk anatomy after weighing bleeding and procedural risks [^113GWvmM] [^115ZR6FY] [^116JmiJV].

> But wait, what if the patient is perioperative or critically ill, where the signal is often muddied. In perioperative patients, most myocardial injury is type 2 rather than type 1, and even asymptomatic troponin elevations carry substantial mortality; algorithms emphasize recognizing MINS, addressing triggers, and initiating cardioprotective medications when feasible, with invasive angiography reserved for appropriate scenarios after risk–benefit assessment; in the ICU, hs-troponin is common and nonspecific, so I should avoid reflexive cath and instead target evaluation to those with objective ischemia or very high pretest probability [^115ZR6FY] [^116JmiJV] [^114o1awW].

> Let me reconsider special populations so I don't overgeneralize. In sepsis, troponin elevation is frequent and multifactorial, often reflecting microvascular dysfunction, cytokine toxicity, or catecholamine surge rather than plaque rupture; mortality is typically driven by the underlying illness, and serial troponin deltas may not add incremental prognostic value beyond an elevated admission value, so I should avoid overinterpreting small kinetic changes in this context [^111L8TPT] [^113z9QAr]. In heart failure, troponin elevation is common due to wall stress, subendocardial ischemia, and neurohormonal toxicity, and strict application of ischemia criteria is necessary to distinguish type 2 MI from myocardial injury, which affects both prognosis and follow-up planning [^114fYqhr] [^1165kMCb].

> I should double-check the diagnostic reliability of the classification itself because misclassification is common. Interobserver agreement for distinguishing type 1 MI, type 2 MI, and myocardial injury is only moderate even among trained adjudicators, and real-world studies show that patients with type 2 MI are variably recognized and undertreated, which can perpetuate disparities and missed opportunities for secondary prevention; this means I need to be systematic and transparent in documenting how I arrived at the diagnosis [^114K3fdx] [^116xBozu].

> Next, I should review emerging tools that might refine discrimination, while keeping expectations realistic. Novel assays that quantify intact long-form troponin versus fragments, and biomarker panels reflecting endothelial or microvascular dysfunction, show promise for distinguishing type 1 from type 2 MI, but they are not yet ready for routine clinical use; in the meantime, hs-cTn alone has only modest discrimination, so clinical integration remains paramount [^114WzuCE] [^1112ozjV].

> Let me synthesize a practical diagnostic algorithm and sanity-check each step. First, confirm troponin elevation above the 99th percentile and establish whether there is a dynamic rise and/or fall on serial testing; second, search rigorously for ischemic symptoms, new ischemic ECG changes, new wall motion abnormality, or angiographic evidence of thrombus; third, identify reversible supply–demand mismatch drivers such as hypoxia, anemia, tachyarrhythmias, hypotension, or hypertension; fourth, classify as type 2 MI if there is both dynamic troponin change and objective ischemia in the setting of a mismatch, as acute myocardial injury if there is no ischemic evidence, and as chronic myocardial injury if troponin is stable; finally, tailor management to the mechanism and prognosis, and document the reasoning to support the diagnosis and plan [^117R6ijB] [^112taSra] [^112brj5w].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure I am not conflating mechanism with prognosis. Troponin leak and demand ischemia are overlapping but distinct: leak reflects low-grade release without overt ischemia, whereas demand ischemia meets MI criteria via supply–demand mismatch with ischemic evidence; both portend risk, and the correct distinction guides testing and treatment without delaying care for the underlying precipitant, which is the linchpin of improving outcomes [^115Z2cYr] [^112iA1AJ] [^114sVKDR].

Troponin "leak" refers to **low-level troponin release without ischemia** [^117R6ijB], often from reversible membrane injury, apoptosis, or normal turnover [^116amhT5], and is not diagnostic of MI [^115Z2cYr]. Demand ischemia (**type 2 MI**) reflects a **supply–demand mismatch** [^115Z2cYr] with troponin rise/fall and ischemic symptoms or ECG/imaging changes [^112taSra]. Troponin leak alone does not meet MI criteria; type 2 MI requires both **dynamic troponin change and ischemic evidence** [^115vaLWX]. Management differs: treat the underlying cause for troponin leak, and correct the mismatch plus consider invasive evaluation for type 2 MI [^113MGDSh] [^116JmiJV].

## Definitions and pathophysiology

Key definitions and mechanisms:

| **Aspect** | **Troponin leak** | **Demand ischemia (type 2 myocardial infarction)** |
|-|-|-|
| Definition | Low-level troponin release without clinical ischemia; reflects reversible injury, apoptosis, or normal turnover [^117R6ijB] [^116amhT5] | Myocardial ischemia from supply–demand mismatch without acute coronary plaque disruption [^115Z2cYr] |
| Mechanisms | Increased membrane permeability, apoptosis, proteolytic release, or blebbing [^116amhT5] [^1155NWLs] | Hypotension, anemia, hypoxia, tachyarrhythmias, hypertension, or sepsis causing mismatch [^111MiWTg] [^112qhKP8] [^113DkKj5] |

## Diagnostic criteria and biomarker kinetics

| **Attribute** | **Troponin leak** | **Demand ischemia (type 2 mi)** |
|-|-|-|
| Troponin kinetics | Mild, stable elevation; minimal rise/fall | Dynamic rise/fall ≥ 20% with ≥ 1 value > 99th percentile [^117R6ijB] [^115vaLWX] |
| Ischemic symptoms | Absent or non-specific | Present (chest pain, dyspnea, syncope) [^115Z2cYr] |

| Clinical context | Heart failure, renal dysfunction, myocarditis, sepsis, exercise | Hypotension, anemia, hypoxia, tachyarrhythmias, hypertensive crisis, sepsis [^113GWvmM] |

---

## Clinical significance and prognosis

Troponin leak is associated with adverse outcomes (e.g. heart failure, arrhythmias, mortality) [^113J4CWj], especially in chronic disease or critical illness [^114fYqhr]. Demand ischemia carries **higher short- and long-term risk** than troponin leak, with mortality comparable to type 1 MI in some settings [^113NAyjt].

---

## Management strategies

### Troponin leak

Management focuses on **treating the underlying cause** (e.g. heart failure, renal dysfunction, sepsis, arrhythmias) [^113GWvmM]. Supportive care includes optimizing hemodynamics, correcting electrolytes, and managing comorbidities [^notfound]. Cardiac catheterization is generally not indicated unless there is suspicion of obstructive CAD [^116JmiJV].

---

### Demand ischemia (type 2 MI)

- **Correct mismatch**: Treat hypotension, anemia, hypoxia, tachyarrhythmias, or hypertension [^116JmiJV] [^112qhKP8].
- **Medical therapy**: Beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and antiplatelet therapy as appropriate [^notfound].
- **Invasive evaluation**: Consider angiography if obstructive CAD is suspected or if symptoms persist despite correction of mismatch [^116JmiJV] [^115ZR6FY].

---

## Clinical scenarios and examples

- **Troponin leak**: Chronic heart failure with stable mild troponin elevation; no ischemic symptoms or ECG changes [^114fYqhr].
- **Demand ischemia**: Sepsis with hypotension, elevated troponin with rise/fall, and ischemic ECG changes [^notfound].

---

## Challenges and controversies

- **Differentiation**: Distinguishing troponin leak from demand ischemia can be difficult, especially in critical illness [^111qdWyP].
- **Misclassification**: Frequent misclassification leads to under- or overtreatment [^1164oNyN] [^116xBozu].
- **Evidence gap**: Limited data guide optimal management of type 2 MI [^113GWvmM] [^112d9YLe].

---

Troponin leak reflects **low-level release without ischemia**, whereas demand ischemia reflects **supply–demand mismatch with ischemia** [^113muWbg] [^115Z2cYr]. Accurate differentiation and targeted management are essential to optimize outcomes.

### Supply / demand type 2 myocardial infarction: should we be paying more attention? [^116cvAQw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Supply/demand (type 2) myocardial infarction is a commonly encountered clinical challenge. It is anticipated that it will be detected more frequently once high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays are approved for clinical use in the United States. We provide a perspective that is based on available data regarding the definition, epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, prognosis, management, and controversies regarding type 2 myocardial infarction. Understanding these basic concepts will facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of these patients as well as ongoing research efforts.

### A prospective study of the impact of serial troponin measurements on the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and hospital and six-month mortality in patients admitted to ICU with non-cardiac diagnoses [^113jssdj]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Ammann et al. demonstrated, with echocardiography or autopsy as appropriate, that 70% of patients with troponin elevation did not have significant coronary artery disease. However, documented IHD (that is, previously known and recorded at admission) is common in ICU patients in general, as it was in our study group.

Several previous papers confirmed that troponin elevation is associated with increased ICU and hospital mortality in critically ill patients. Our data demonstrate that the increased risk of dying persists even after discharge from hospital up to at least 180 days with no statistically significant difference between possible and definite MIs. Several potential mechanisms might explain troponin release in critically ill patients. These include demand ischaemia with or without a degree of coronary vasospasm, the effects of catecholamines and sepsis on the myocardium causing membrane leak and microscopic circulatory thrombosis or maldistribution. We noted that patients with MI had higher median and maximum troponin levels than those with troponin elevations alone without contemporaneous ECG changes. Mortality was low in patients who had normal troponin measurements throughout their ICU admission. We also found that significantly more patients with a possible or definite MI were receiving vaso-active drugs at the time of elevated troponin levels compared to patients who did not have a troponin rise. These findings support the hypothesis that a proportion of patients with a troponin rise may indeed have suffered from critical coronary artery disease and the acute illness, sepsis and/or treatment with catecholamines may have acted as a "stress test" and identified a cohort of patients with a very high risk of dying in six months.

The strengths of this study include the selection of patients who were admitted for non-cardiac reasons and the ECG interpretation by two senior cardiologists with adjudication by a third cardiologist in case of disagreement. Patients were also followed for 180 days which is longer than in previous studies.

It is important to acknowledge some limitations, too. Firstly, we conducted a single centre study. Although we enrolled more patients than the majority of previous studies, we were limited in our subgroup analyses by patient numbers. Our recording of smoking history was incomplete, and we did not collect any information on the use of cardio-protective medication. Finally, we were unable to perform Kaplan-Meier analyses and do not know the exact causes of death.

### Machines running for phenotyping of Myocardial injury: the end to anConundrum? [^115dYXYe]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Myocardial injury is defined as at least 1 elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) level above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, further subclassified as either acute or chronic injury. Despite this seemingly slender definition, the conditions potentially underlying such injury to myocardial cells are heterogeneous. In case of additional evidence for myocardial ischemia, criteria for myocardial infarction (MI) are fulfilled. Even MI incorporates several subtypes including type 1 MI (classical plaque disruption) or type 2 MI (oxygen supply demand mismatch). Accurate delineation of these subtypes and identification of the underlying etiology is by far not a simple academic formality — there are pivotal differences in treatment strategies, ranging from evidence-based coronary revascularization in type 1 MI to primarily targeting the trigger for supply demand mismatch in type 2 MI in a more holistic approach. However, this is all far from black and white — imaging studies showed that unrecognized and untreated coronary disease is present in many patients with type 2 MI.

### Impact of type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) on hospital-level MI outcomes: implications for quality and public reporting [^113DkKj5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The most likely reason for the higher mortality observed with type 2 MI is the presence of an alternate factor responsible for demand/supply mismatch. In our study, > 70% of the deaths in the type 2 MI cohort were from noncardiovascular causes, compared with only a quarter of the deaths in the type 1 MI cohort. This suggests that although these alternate factors have potential to cause demand/supply mismatch leading to type 2 MI, the mortality among these patients is not secondary to a cardiac process but rather driven by their primary disease process, such as sepsis and other noncardiovascular causes. Troponin elevation in heart failure has been attributed to small vessel obstruction and endothelial dysfunction. 13 Troponin elevation in stroke patients may occur related to myocardial stretch, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular spasm, cytokine‐mediated myocardial injury, or catecholamine‐mediated myocardial toxicity. 14, 15 Compared with stroke, demand/supply mismatch in seizures has been largely attributed to massive catecholamine release related to muscular activity, leading to an elevation in heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility. 16 A similar mechanism has been attributed to causing neurocardiogenic injury in intracranial hemorrhage. 17, 18 The underlying mechanism of cardiac injury in sepsis continues to be investigated. Although sepsis is known to cause increased coronary blood flow, 19 it also has been linked to improper oxygen utilization. 20 Other mechanisms such as upregulation of endothelin 1 have also been demonstrated to play a role in these patients and could be the trigger for endothelial dysfunction. 21 Furthermore, an increase in cardiac myocyte permeability in septic patients may also play a role in troponin leakage. 22 Elevated levels of troponins in critical illness or after surgery can be caused by increased levels of both endogenous or exogenous catecholamines. 23

Type 2 myocardial infarction — diagnostic criteria require detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac troponin (cTn) values with at least 1 value above the 99th percentile URL and evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to acute coronary atherothrombosis, requiring at least 1 of the following: symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia; new ischemic ECG changes; development of pathological Q waves; or imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology.

### Mortality in sepsis: comparison of outcomes between patients with demand ischemia, acute myocardial infarction, and neither demand ischemia nor acute myocardial infarction [^113z9QAr]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Elevation in cardiac troponins is common with sepsis despite unclear impact.

Hypothesis

We investigated whether demand ischemia(DI) resulted in variable outcomes compared to acute myocardial infarction(AMI) and those with neither DI nor AMI in sepsis.

Methods

We analyzed data from the 2011–2014 National Inpatient Sample among patients admitted for sepsis. We compared outcomes among patients with DI i) versus AMI and ii) versus neither DI nor AMI, respectively using propensity matching. Primary study end-point was in-hospital mortality.

Results

We studied 666,154 patients, with mean age 63.7 years and 50.8% female participants. Overall, 94.7% of the included patients had neither DI nor AMI, 4.4% had AMI and 0.83% had DI. Between 2011 and 2014, we observed an increasing trend for DI but decreasing trend for AMI in sepsis. Patients with DI experienced higher rates of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, had longer length of stay and higher cost of stay compared to patients with neither demand ischemia nor AMI. Despite higher hospital mortality at baseline with DI, post-propensity matching revealed no difference in hospital mortality between patients with DI and those with neither (26.9% vs. 27.0%, adjusted odds ratio 0.99, 95% confidence intervals 0.92–1.07; p = 0.87). Patients with DI experienced lower hospital mortality compared to those with AMI pre (28.5% vs. 48.3%; p < 0.001) and post-propensity matching (41.1% vs. 29.1%, aOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.54–0.63; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Among patients with sepsis, those with DI had similar adjusted in-hospital mortality compared to those with neither DI nor AMI. Patients with AMI had the highest in-hospital mortality among all groups.

### Exercise-induced cardiac troponin elevations: from underlying mechanisms to clinical relevance [^116VAHNM]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

cTn elevations may indicate demand ischemia, so several studies have explored the association between the magnitude of exercise-induced cTn increases and significant CAD, but the results are inconsistent. – Several studies have found no increase in cTn after a short-duration (< 15 minutes) clinical exercise test in individuals with CAD. Other studies have reported significant cTn increases after clinical exercise or dobutamine stress tests. A recent meta-analysis including studies published between 2008 and 2016 found only minor increases in cTn concentrations after clinical exercise stress tests, with no difference in exercise-induced elevations of cTn concentrations between patients with inducible and noninducible ischemia (cTnT: 0.5 [0–0.9] ng/L versus 1.1 [0–2.2] ng/L, P = 0.29; cTnI: 2.4 [0.2–4.7] ng/L versus 1.8 [0.6–3.0] ng/L, P = 0.61). Similar findings were reported for pharmacological stress testing. Overall, these findings may be attributable to (1) exercise intensity or duration at the ischemia threshold being insufficient to produce cTn elevations sufficient to discriminate between those with and without severe CAD or myocardial ischemia; (2) cTn concentrations being measured too early after exercise and missing the cTn peak (Figure 3 A); or (3) the lack of an association between myocardial ischemia and exercise-induced cTn elevations.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the universal definition of myocardial infarction [^115ZaBH4]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The lack of a specific cardiac biomarker to distinguish type 1 myocardial infarction and the increasing frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury poses challenges to clinicians in practice on a daily basis. As observed in this trial, type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are responsible for almost half of all elevations in cardiac troponin concentration, and have been shown to be more frequent than type 1 myocardial infarction in hospitalized patients over the age of 75. Less than half of these patients are referred to cardiology, with the majority managed by general physicians, and a lack of evidence has led to inconsistency in investigation and treatment.

The classification of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury is based on expert consensus, and to date no prospective clinical trials have evaluated the utility of this classification. These conditions arise because of a wide range of pathologies including coronary or structural heart disease, arrhythmias, myocarditis, and many noncardiac conditions. The latest guidance, requiring evidence of myocardial ischemia and oxygen supply-demand imbalance, has reduced the frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction. Our observations add to previous studies suggesting that any myocardial injury is prognostically important, irrespective of whether myocardial ischemia was present, but strategies to guide further investigation and treatment in patients without type 1 myocardial infarction require prospective evaluation.

### Assessment and classification of patients with myocardial injury and infarction in clinical practice [^114sVKDR]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Mechanisms of myocardial injury

The majority of cardiac troponin is intracellular, with > 90% of troponin isoforms located within the sarcomere, and the remainder unbound within the cytoplasmic pool. The mechanisms of cardiac troponin release into the circulation are thought to include myocyte necrosis, apoptosis, formation and release of membranous blebs, increased membrane permeability and release of proteolytic troponin degradation products.

It is now recognised that cardiac troponin may be released out with the context of myocardial ischaemia and necrosis, with several purported mechanisms. Cardiomyocytes undergo mechanical stretch in response to pressure or volume overload, and this may trigger activation of intracellular proteases associated with intracellular degradation of troponin. Furthermore, there is evidence that tachycardia may stimulate stress-responsive integrins within the cardiomyocyte, triggering release of intact cardiac troponin I from viable cardiomyocytes in the absence of necrosis. Troponin release has also been demonstrated in vivo in patients who develop reversible ischaemia during nuclear perfusion imaging with stress testing. Using an ultrasensitive cardiac troponin I assay with single-molecule counting technology, change in cardiac troponin concentration following stress testing was associated with the extent of myocardial ischaemia.

The universal definition makes a distinction between type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury based on the presence or absence of symptoms and signs of myocardial ischaemia; however, there remains considerable overlap and to date there have been no prospective mechanistic studies to evaluate the range of underlying pathophysiology in these patients. Acute myocardial injury may occur in a variety of cardiac and non-cardiac illnesses (table 1) as a consequence of myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch (hypotension, tachycardia or hypoxaemia), or due to direct injury in sepsis or viral myocarditis, or as part of the pathophysiological process in acute left ventricular failure. However, in some cases the presenting illness may be associated with a proinflammatory and prothrombotic state with myocardial injury due to embolisation of platelet aggregates and thrombus from an otherwise silent vulnerable plaque. Furthermore, myocardial injury can occur due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch in the presence of prognostically important, but unrecognised stable coronary artery disease. It is not, therefore, appropriate to dismiss episodes of acute myocardial injury as a mere bystander phenomenon of no clinical consequence.

### Role of admission troponin-T and serial troponin-T testing in predicting outcomes in severe sepsis and septic shock [^111L8TPT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

No prior studies have evaluated the role of serial TnT or TnI testing in septic patients. The current investigation demonstrated that elevated admission TnT predicted higher short‐ and long‐term mortality without an incremental prognostic benefit of serial TnT testing in these patients. The presence or absence of cardiac injury, as defined by elevated admission TnT level, appears to be more relevant than the magnitude of cardiac injury, as defined by delta TnT levels. Nonetheless, log 10 TnT values had an independent linear association with short‐ and long‐term mortality.

Despite its increasingly frequent recognition, the etiopathogenesis of TnT elevation in sepsis remains unclear. 5 Flow‐limiting coronary artery disease is infrequently documented in these patients, alluding to alternate mechanisms of TnT elevation other than AMI. 8 Electrocardiography and echocardiography in these patients rarely demonstrate ischemic changes, and few patients have inducible ischemia on stress testing or occlusive coronary thrombus on autopsy. 8, 26, 30 Postulated causes for troponin elevations in septic patients include ischemic mechanisms (eg, supply–demand imbalance or microvascular spasm or thrombosis) and nonischemic mechanisms (eg, reversible myocardial membrane leakage of cytosolic TnT pool or direct cellular toxicity from inflammatory mediators, microbial toxins, or excessive catecholamine levels). 7, 31, 32 While relative hypovolemia, inadequate resuscitation, and prolonged hypotension may contribute to myocardial injury in patients with septic shock, fluid resuscitation does not appear to influence the subsequent values of hs‐TnT on serial testing. 12

A characteristic rise and fall of TnT in the presence of ischemic symptoms or other evidence of myocardial ischemia defines AMI. Ischemia is often difficult to identify in critically ill patients, adding to uncertainty regarding the need for serial measurement of TnT. 33 This study identified a significant delta TnT in one fifth of patients with elevated admission TnT, yet this carried no incremental prognostic value. The slow downslope of the time–concentration curve for TnT complicates interpretation of single TnT values or delta TnT values when the sampling time is not consistent with respect to sepsis onset time. A changing pattern of results is documented early after events when the concentration–time curve is rising, but subsequently even AMI does not always manifest a recognizable changing pattern of values. 34 Thus, it is unclear how strong this consideration is for clinical care in the population with sepsis and septic shock, which could confound our assessment of this cardiac biomarker in the critically ill population.

### The appropriateness of coronary investigation in myocardial injury and type 2 myocardial infarction (ACT-2): a randomized trial design [^112d9YLe]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Elevated troponin level findings among patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or another intercurrent illness undeniably identifies patients at increased risk of mortality. Whilst enhancing our capacity to discriminate risk, the use of high-sensitivity troponin assays frequently identifies patients with myocardial injury (i.e. troponin rise without acute signs of myocardial ischemia) or type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI; oxygen supply-demand imbalance). This leads to the clinically challenging task of distinguishing type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI; coronary plaque rupture) from myocardial injury and T2MI in the context of concurrent acute illness. Diagnostic discernment in this context is crucial because MI classification has implications for further investigation and care. Early invasive management is of well-established benefit among patients with T1MI. However, the appropriateness of this investigation in the heterogeneous context of T2MI, where there is high competing mortality risk, remains unknown. Although coronary angiography in T2MI is advocated by some, there is insufficient evidence in existing literature to support this opinion as highlighted by current national guidelines.

Objective

The objective is to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of early invasive management with coronary angiography in T2MI in terms of all-cause mortality and cost effectiveness.

Design

This prospective, pragmatic, multicenter, randomized trial among patients with suspected supply demand ischemia leading to troponin elevation (n = 1,800; T2MI [1,500], chronic myocardial injury [300]) compares the impact of invasive angiography (or computed tomography angiography as per local preference) within 5 days of randomization versus conservative management (with or without functional testing at clinician discretion) on all-cause mortality by 2 years. Randomized treatment allocation will be stratified by baseline estimated risk of mortality using the Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III risk score. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated by follow-up on clinical events, quality of life, and resource utilization over 24 months.

Summary

Ascertaining the most appropriate first-line investigative strategy for these commonly encountered high-risk T2MI patients in a randomized comparative study will be pivotal in informing evidence-based guidelines that lead to better patient and health care outcomes.

### Sensitive troponin assay and the classification of myocardial infarction [^114vYaE9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Significance

- Lowering the diagnostic threshold for troponin preferentially increases the number of patients identified with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury.
- Patients reclassified as having type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury remained in the hospital for longer and were more likely to undergo cardiac investigations but, in contrast to type 1 myocardial infarction, were discharged without additional cardiac therapies and clinical outcomes remained poor and unchanged.

The Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction proposes a classification for patients with myocardial infarction based on cause to accommodate more sensitive markers of myocardial necrosis. The classification differentiates between type 1 myocardial infarction, due to thrombosis of an atherosclerotic plaque, and type 2 myocardial infarction, due to an imbalance of myocardial blood supply and demand that may arise in many acute medical and surgical conditions. The expert consensus further defines evidence of myocardial necrosis in the absence of clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia as myocardial injury. Although this classification has been used in recent clinical trials to refine clinical outcomes, type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury are difficult to distinguish or diagnose definitively, and the frequency in clinical practice and implications of these diagnoses are uncertain.

After improvements in assay performance, a sensitive troponin assay was introduced into our institution. The validation and subsequent implementation of this assay provided an opportunity to assess the impact of lowering the diagnostic threshold on the incidence, management, and clinical outcome of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: JACC review topic of the week [^113GWvmM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (MI) can occur from increased myocardial oxygen demand and/or reduced supply in the absence of acute atherothrombotic plaque disruption; a condition called type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI). As with any MI subtype, there must be clinical evidence of myocardial ischemia to make the diagnosis. This condition is increasingly diagnosed due to the increasing sensitivity of cardiac troponin assays and is associated with adverse short-term and long-term prognoses. Limited data exist defining optimal management strategies because T2MI is a heterogeneous entity with varying etiologies and triggers. Thus, these patients require individualized care. A major barrier is the absence of a uniform definition that can be operationalized with high reproducibility. This document provides a synthesis of the data about T2MI to assist clinicians' understanding of its pathobiology, when to deploy the diagnosis, and its associated treatments. It also clarifies prognosis, identifies gaps in knowledge, and provides recommendations for moving forward.

### Interpreting troponin elevations: do we need multiple diagnoses? [^111c5Da8]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Assessing troponin elevations in sick patients can also be complicated because chronic, low-level elevations in troponin have been documented in stable patients with renal failure, heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and diabetes mellitus, and the list of causes of elevated troponin appears to be growing. These diagnoses are common in intensive care units, and it is clear that a single elevated troponin requires a comparison to baseline, with follow-up to determine its relative stability.

Multiple advantages of using the diagnosis of TYPE 2 MI are evident, but are the diagnostic criteria optimal? TYPE 2 MI fits as a diagnosis for our example patient because the troponin elevation was felt to be due to the episode of hypoxia and hypotension, rather than a new plaque rupture/erosion/dissection/ or fissuring (TYPE 1 MI). Unfortunately, TYPE 2 is not specific to non-coronary myocardial injury, because it also includes MI caused by coronary spasm or embolism. Although not related to atherosclerotic plaque, both spasm and embolism are coronary events and have more in common with a ruptured plaque than with myocardial injury induced by hypoxia, hypotension, myocarditis, etc. It would appear of primary importance to differentiate a new coronary event from a non-coronary source of myocardial damage, especially when assessing the need for urgent therapy or intervention. In our case, for example, the atrial fibrillation provides a potential source of emboli. If a new coronary occlusion is strongly suspected, it would be quite difficult to know whether it is thrombotic or embolic in origin, even by coronary angiography. The indications for anticoagulation and/or invasive intervention would likely be similar in either case, but not necessarily so if hypotension and hypoxia were the culprit.

The non-descriptive nature of the term TYPE 2 MI is also of concern. Biomarker release from the heart in the absence of a new coronary event has been recognized for some time. The ACC/AHA guidelines for management of unstable angina/non-ST-elevation MI used 'secondary UA' to describe enzyme elevation precipitated by a condition extrinsic to the coronary arterial bed. Since angina may not be present, this appears to be a less desirable alternative. 'Non-specific troponin elevation' and 'non-thrombotic troponin elevation'as well as 'troponin leak' have also been used. The terms 'concomitant myocardial injury' and 'troponin positive non-ACS' are additional possibilities. We would prefer the term 'secondary myocardial injury' because there is usually an obvious illness or acute event related to the cardiac injury.

### Troponin: a risk marker beyond heart disease [^1153tzYR]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

The advent of cardiac troponin assays has revolutionised the daily assessment and management of patients presenting to emergency rooms with undifferentiated chest symptoms suspicious for acute cardiac ischaemia. This has enhanced the identification of myocyte necrosis thus forming a key part of the contemporary definition for myocardial infarction (MI).

Seminal work by Katus et al led to the demonstration by Hamm et al of the clinical applicability of the test in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Negative troponin being associated with a good prognosis and a positive troponin with an increased frequency of adverse cardiovascular events. Subsequent technical refinements have produced four generations of assays in order to attain the guideline standard of < 10% coefficient of variation at the 99th centile of a normal reference population. Point-of-care systems have also been developed and deployed by some to reduce the turnaround time of results and improve patient's flow in busy departments.

The relationship between troponin detection in these assays and poor prognosis has been seen not only in ACS but also in myocardial disease, following cardiac procedures, non-cardiac procedures, acute neurological disease, acute respiratory disease chronic renal disease, pulmonary embolism, exposure to certain toxins, sepsis and critical illness of any aetiology. Indeed, the prognosis of troponin-positive non-ACS is generally worse than in troponin-positive ACS.

Recently high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays have become commercially available. These assays mark a seismic shift in the ability to detect troponin at much lower concentrations such that for the majority of the normal reference population there will be a detectable level. While the increased sensitivity of these tests for diagnosing disease above threshold 99th centile values has been a welcome advance, particularly for emergency care practitioners, the loss in specificity has posed challenges to other physicians trying to determine the diagnosis or primary source of disease process as well as the acuity of disease. The use of assay-specific absolute or percentage changes in troponin level has been utilised to help navigate these challenges by identifying acute injury. Nevertheless, the distinction between type 1 MI (spontaneous 'wild-type' MI), type 2 MI (secondary to ischaemia related to supply/demand imbalance rather than plaque rupture or coronary occlusion) and myocardial injury has been made much more taxing.

### Exercise-induced cardiac troponin elevations: from underlying mechanisms to clinical relevance [^11284Jkr]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Exercise of different types, durations, and intensities commonly increases cTn. cTn transiently increases after the performance of endurance exercise with peak values typically 2 to 6 hours after exercise. The underlying mechanisms are not clearly defined, but evidence supports the hypothesis that sarcolemmal permeability from reversible cardiac injury permits cTn fragments from an early releasable pool to leak from the cardiomyocyte. Evidence also suggests increased apoptosis or accelerated cardiomyocyte turnover attributable to myocardial stress or brief ischemia. Few studies have investigated the predictive value of exercise-induced cTn for cardiovascular events, but older long-distance walkers with a postexercise cTn concentration > URL experienced increased cardiovascular events. These findings need to be confirmed and the prognostic significance of cTn in younger athletic subjects needs to be determined.

Classification, evaluation, and management of myocardial injury — myocardial injury is defined as any cardiac troponin (cTn) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL), and it is acute when there is a dynamic rise and/or fall exceeding assay variation (> 20% relative change) with at least 1 value above the 99th percentile; chronic injury remains elevated but stable on serial measurements. Diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) requires both acute myocardial injury and evidence of myocardial ischemia, which can be met by the following: symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia, new ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, new pathological Q waves, new ischemic regional wall motion abnormalities on cardiac imaging, or acute coronary thrombus/erosion on invasive coronary angiography. Five distinct MI subtypes are noted; type 1 MI occurs due to acute plaque disruption, and type 2 MI is due to myocardial oxygen supply–demand mismatch in the absence of atherothrombosis, with type 2 MI requiring symptoms, ECG changes, new wall motion abnormalities, or coronary angiographic findings to be considered an MI. Table 5 organizes the differential by acute myocardial injury (rising and/or falling cardiac troponin) versus chronic myocardial injury (stable elevation in cardiac troponin) across cardiovascular causes and noncardiovascular causes.

### Assessment of oxygen supply-demand imbalance and outcomes among patients with type 2 myocardial infarction: a secondary analysis of the high-STEACS cluster randomized clinical trial [^116RdvHc]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Methods

Study Population and Trial Design

High-STEACS (High-Sensitivity Troponin in the Evaluation of Patients with Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome;)was a stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial that evaluated the implementation of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay (ARCHITECT STAT; Abbott) for consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome across 10 hospitals in Scotland between June 10, 2013, and March 3, 2016 (statistical analysis plan in Supplement 1). All patients were screened prospectively by the usual care clinician using an electronic form integrated into the clinical pathway, which captured the indication for cardiac troponin testing and presenting symptoms. The Scotland Research Ethics Committee approved the trial. In the High-STEACS trial the intervention (implementation of a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay) was implemented at hospital level; as such, individual patient consent was not required. In this secondary analysis, which was not prespecified, we included trial patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarctions for whom the underlying factors associated with oxygen supply-demand imbalance were recorded. The trial was conducted according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials reporting guideline.

Adjudication of Myocardial Infarction

All patients with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations above the sex-specific 99th centile (16 ng/L for women and 34 ng/L for men [to convert troponin I to micrograms per liter, multiply by 0.001])had their diagnosis adjudicated according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction (eMethods in Supplement 2). Myocardial ischemia was defined as objective when there was electrocardiographic evidence of new ischemic changes or subjective when symptoms were present. Patients with symptoms or signs of ischemia and increased myocardial oxygen demand or decreased supply were defined as having type 2 myocardial infarction.

Diagnostic Adjudication

All patients with any high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration above the sex-specific 99th percentile were adjudicated and classified according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Two physicians independently reviewed all clinical information, with discordant diagnoses resolved by a third physician. Type 1 myocardial infarction was defined as myocardial necrosis (any high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration above the sex-specific 99th percentile with a rise or fall in troponin when serial testing was performed) in the context of a presentation with suspected acute coronary syndrome and symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia on the ECG. Patients with myocardial necrosis, symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia, and evidence of myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance secondary to an alternative condition without evidence of acute atherothrombosis were classified as having type 2 myocardial infarction. Patients with elevated troponin concentrations without symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia were classified as having nonischemic myocardial injury. All nonischemic myocardial injury was classified as acute unless troponin concentrations changed ≤ 20% on serial testing in accordance with the universal definition or if the adjudicated diagnosis was chronic heart failure or chronic renal failure, for which the classification was chronic myocardial injury. A detailed summary of the adjudication procedures is provided in the.

Ethics Approval

The study was approved by the Scotland A Research Ethics Committee, by the Public Benefit and Privacy Panel for Health and Social Care, and by each National Health Service Health Board. Individual patient consent was not required, and data from consecutive patients were collected prospectively from the electronic record, deidentified, and linked within secure National Health Service Safe Havens.

Patient and Public Involvement

Patients and lay representatives were members of the steering committee for the trial and all related studies and were involved in the design, conduct, and approval of the High-STEACS trial.

### Long-term outcomes in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury [^112iA1AJ]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The diagnostic criteria for acute myocardial infarction were updated to accommodate the introduction of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays and in recognition of the wide range of conditions associated with myocardial injury. The third universal definition of myocardial infarction recommends a classification that is based on etiology, where type 1 myocardial infarction is because of plaque rupture or erosion with atherothrombotic consequences and type 2 myocardial infarction because of myocardial oxygen supply–demand imbalance in the absence of atherothrombosis. Patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations who do not have overt myocardial ischemia are classified as having myocardial injury. Although these diagnostic categories are considered distinct in guidelines, implementation in clinical practice has been challenging because of similarities between patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury, with the implications of these diagnoses uncertain.

The Global Task Force is reviewing the classification of myocardial infarction and recognizes the need to provide greater clarity for clinicians in practice. Although patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury have higher crude rates of all-cause death compared with those with type 1 myocardial infarction, – differences do not always persist in adjusted analyses, and few studies report cause of death or risk of future cardiovascular events. If patients with type 2 myocardial infarction are at increased risk of cardiovascular events attributable to atherosclerotic disease, then targeted investigation and preventative therapies have the potential to modify outcomes.

In consecutive patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations measured using a sensitive assay, we previously observed that the diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury was as common as type 1 myocardial infarction. Here we report outcomes for these patients and determine the clinical features associated with major adverse cardiovascular events, with the aim of improving risk stratification in patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury.

### Exercise-induced cardiac troponin elevations: from underlying mechanisms to clinical relevance [^1155NWLs]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

The increase in membrane permeability after cardiomyocyte stress suggests that cTn molecules can leak from cardiomyocytes into the circulation, and this may be aided by degradation of cTn complexes. Ischemia is known to degrade cTn complexes. For example, ischemia reduces the size of cTnI and cTnT fragments in isolated rat hearts from 24 to 15 kDa and from 35 to 25 kDa, respectively, making them more readily able to pass through the membrane. Only small, degraded, cTnT fragments (< 18 kDa) were found in postrace serum samples obtained from 10 marathon runners. These findings suggest that smaller fragments may leak into the circulation with the cardiac stress associated with exercise or ischemia, whereas larger fragments might only escape with destruction of the membrane after myocardial infarction.

Taken together, it is possible that exercise-induced cTn elevations are attributable, at least, in part, to reversible membrane damage of viable cardiomyocytes (Table 1). Whether this is the only mechanism responsible for exercise-induced cTn elevations, or occurs next to apoptosis or necrosis, is unknown. The magnitude of cTn release across individuals is extremely variable, even after the same exercise. It is possible that several mechanisms contribute to this variability and that the dominant mechanism differs between individuals with low and high magnitudes of postexercise cTn elevations (Figure 3 B). Furthermore, it is unknown whether the putative changes in membrane permeability are entirely physiological or are an early marker of cardiac vulnerability and subsequent cardiac events.

### The impact of micro troponin leak on long-term outcomes following elective percutaneous coronary intervention [^113B1PZy]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the clinical impact of microleaks of troponin, which are below the reference standard defining troponin elevation, on cardiovascular outcomes in stable coronary patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Background

Troponin elevation, either pre- or post-PCI, has been shown to predict poor cardiovascular outcomes. However, troponin measurements that are above the limit of detection but below the 99th percentile limit defining elevation ("microleak") have uncertain clinical significance.

Methods

We assessed subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) and death over a mean follow-up of 4.2 years in 2,272 patients undergoing elective PCI, where baseline troponins were normal and follow-up troponins were obtained 12–24 hr post-PCI. Patients were divided into three groups based on post-PCI troponin levels: Group 1 (n = 1,313) nondetectable; group 2 (n = 587) microleak, and group 3 (n = 372) elevated suggesting myocardial necrosis.

Results

The combined endpoint of MI and death was similar in groups 2 and 3 (50.3 vs. 51.9%, respectively, P = NS), which was significantly more than group 1 patients (35.6%, P < 0.01) over the follow-up period. Multivariate analysis of patients in groups 1 and 2 demonstrated that troponin microleak was an independent predictor of MI and death (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Microleak of troponin following elective PCI suggests myocardial injury and predicts an increased risk of subsequent MI and death. Troponins should be routinely assessed following PCI, and preventive therapies are needed to reduce micro and macro troponin elevation in the PCI setting.

### Outcomes in vascular surgical patients with isolated postoperative troponin leak: a meta-analysis [^113muWbg]. Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Although peri-operative myocardial infarction remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following vascular surgery, the significance of an isolated troponin leak is uncertain. This is an elevation of troponin below the diagnostic threshold for a peri-operative myocardial infarction, without symptoms or ischaemic electrocardiography changes or echocardiography signs such as new regional wall motion abnormalities. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the early (< 30 days) and intermediate (< 180 days) outcomes of vascular surgical patients with an isolated troponin leak. A full literature search up to December 2010 identified 593 studies, of which nine (consisting of eight distinct patient cohorts) underwent analysis. An isolated troponin leak was strongly predictive of all-cause mortality at 30 days (OR 5.03, 95% CI 2.88–8.79, p < 0.00001). The associated 30-day mortality in patients with no troponin elevation, an isolated troponin leak or peri-operative myocardial infarction was 2.3%, 11.6% and 21.6%, respectively (p = 0.000001). Insufficient data were available to analyse intermediate-term outcomes. An isolated troponin leak following vascular surgery is strongly associated with short-term mortality.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction: challenges in diagnosis and treatment [^114WzuCE]. European Heart Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

A novel assay to quantify intact 'long-form' cTnT has been developed, which is thought to be released exclusively following cardiomyocyte necrosis. This contrasts to the current commercially available high-sensitivity cTnT assay that may detect small heavily cleaved fragments of cTnT. It is thought that fragments may explain the high prevalence of chronic myocardial injury detected with this assay. In a small study, the ratio of long-form to total cTnT (including fragments) had excellent discrimination for patients with Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction compared to chronic myocardial injury (AUC.96, 95% CI.89–1.00). A novel highly sensitive immunoassay with a 28-fold lower limit of detection has now been developed, with improved precision and excellent discrimination between NSTEMI and chronic myocardial injury (AUC.99, 95% CI.97–100). Whether these observations could be used to discriminate patients with acute non-ischaemic myocardial injury or type 2 MI in the context of supply or demand imbalance from those with type 1 MI is unknown and requires prospective evaluation, but such assays remain pre-clinical and are yet to be translated to the clinical laboratory. In contrast to cardiac troponin T, there do not appear to be significant differences in the presence of free, intact, and complex cardiac troponin I concentrations between patients with type 1 MI and those with alternative causes of troponin elevation including type 2 MI. Notably, all studies of troponin fragments may be affected by time course degradation. The optimal study design would require serial coronary sinus sampling early after symptom onset in patients with type 1 and type 2 MI. Whilst this might be achievable in type 1 MI where there is usually a clear symptom onset time, in type 2 MI, this would be highly challenging and models of supply or demand ischaemia may be required.

Panels of blood biomarkers that reflect different pathophysiological processes may also aid in the discrimination of type 1 from type 2 MI, with markers of endothelial or microvascular dysfunction demonstrating moderate discrimination, albeit they did not exceed the performance of cardiac troponin alone. A further study including a panel of 29 candidate biomarkers including apolipoprotein A-II, NT-proBNP, copeptin, and cTnI had good discrimination between type 1 and type 2 MI (AUC.82), but this requires prospective external validation and the clinical utility is uncertain.

### The intersection of type 2 myocardial infarction and heart failure [^1165kMCb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that troponin concentrations may be elevated in patients with HF from type 1 MI, T2MI, acute myocardial injury, or chronic myocardial injury. In order to receive a diagnosis of T2MI, there must be evidence of ischemia with evidence of ischemia on ECG, new regional wall motion abnormalities in an ischemic territory on ECG, or symptoms suggestive of ischemia. In our study, the Universal Definition of MI criteria was uniformly applied to diagnose T2MI. Hence, although we identified 633 patients initially coded as T2MI, only 57% met criteria for the diagnosis when strictly adjudicated; the remainder had mostly myocardial injury as previously described. Indeed, the diagnosis of T2MI can be challenging. Contributing to this is a lack of understanding among clinicians regarding the difference between non‐ischemic myocardial injury and T2MI. However, beyond this, there is also subjectivity regarding the diagnosis, particularly when relying on symptoms alone. In our study, the majority of patients were diagnosed with T2MI based on objective evidence of ischemia with < 1 in 5 patients receiving a diagnosis based on symptoms alone. The DEMAND‐MI (Determining the Mechanism of Myocardial Injury and Role of Coronary Disease in Type 2 Myocardial Infarction) study (NCT03338504) will provide further insights into the accuracy of T2MI diagnosis in clinical practice.

Notably, we found that the rate of HF hospitalization was similar among patients with T2MI and patients with myocardial injury who were miscoded as T2MI. This suggests that the risk of HF hospitalization may not necessarily be due to T2MI per se but rather myocardial injury. Indeed, elevations in cardiac troponin have been associated with increased risk of future development of HF in ambulatory populations, and an increased risk of HF events among patients with established HF. The rate of HF hospitalization with or without cardiovascular death among patients with T2MI or myocardial injury is similar to that demonstrated by Myhre and colleagues when examining patients with HF and myocardial injury and significantly higher than patients with HF with low troponin concentrations. Prior studies have also demonstrated a similar risk of major adverse cardiovascular events among patients with T2MI compared with myocardial injury. Nevertheless, we still believe that the differentiation of T2MI from myocardial injury is important in clinical practice as the mechanism of myocardial injury differs; the former due to ischemia while the latter is often multifactorial. Accordingly, strategies targeting cardiovascular risk reduction in these groups may differ. This hypothesis warrants investigation in clinical trials.

### Comparison between invasive and noninvasive methods to estimate subendocardial oxygen supply and demand imbalance [^1111QcGs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Implications for Use of SEVR in Clinical Practice

There are conditions in which the assessment of SEVR can be particularly useful in clinical practice. This is exemplified by conditions of myocardial ischemia unrelated to acute atherothrombotic coronary artery lesions, in which an imbalance between oxygen supply and demand is supposed. The Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarctionfocused the attention on particular clinical situations in which myocardial injury can be caused by oxygen supply and demand imbalance. These conditions are reported to be associated with elevations of cardiac troponin values in patients in the intensive care unit and also to be associated with adverse prognosis, regardless of the underlying disease state. Another exemplary condition is represented the occurrence of myocardial injury and myocardial infarction in patients undergoing extra‐thoracic surgery. Indeed, perioperative myocardial injury has been identified as a common complication in major noncardiac surgery and is associated with substantial mortality. In contrast with acute myocardial infarction, perioperative myocardial injury does not involve the presence of either angina symptoms or ischemic electrocardiographic findings, but it is defined by an increase in cardiac troponin values only. On the other hand, perioperative myocardial injury without ancillary ischemic evidence indicative of myocardial infarction is associated with substantial short‐ and long‐term mortality, comparable with the mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction. It is estimated that, worldwide, more than 100 million adults over 45 years undergo major noncardiac surgery each yearand recent studies suggest that 5% to 25% of these patients have postoperative troponin elevations, its prevalence depending on the patient population considered. Several studies strongly support the idea that many of the myocardial ischemic events diagnosed in patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery are caused by a prolonged myocardial oxygen supply‐demand imbalance (responsible for a significant reduction in SEVR), without coronary arteries plaque rupture. Indeed, the perioperative period represents a timeframe of important stress threatening cardiovascular homeostasis, increasing myocardial oxygen demand and compromising myocardial oxygen supply. Subendocardial tissue is the most vulnerable and early targeted area hit by this mechanism. SEVR may represent a useful index for assessing the subendocardial oxygen supply‐demand ratio in these critical conditions.

Biomarkers and differential diagnosis

Q1. You are on rounds in the emergency department and your intern asks you: what is the main difference between non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina?

NSTEMI is characterized by ischaemic symptoms associated with acute cardiomyocyte injury (= rise and/or fall in cardiac troponin T/I), while ischaemic symptoms at rest (or minimal effort) in the absence of acute cardiomyocyte injury define unstable angina. This translates into an increased risk of death in NSTEMI patients, while unstable angina patients are at relatively low short-term risk of death.

Q2. A 72-year-old patient with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia as cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) presents to the emergency department with typical chest pain of 3 h duration, palpitations, atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of about 120 beats per minute, ST depression on electrocardiogram (ECG), and a mild elevation in cardiac troponin (cTn) (twice the upper limit of normal [ULN]). Is it correct to state that the underlying process is a rupture, ulceration, fissuring, or erosion of a coronary atherosclerotic plaque?

No. According to the universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI), two main subtypes of NSTEMI have to be differentiated: type 1 MI, characterized by any of the processes just previously described, and type 2 MI, in which an extra-coronary condition is the main cause of imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand (e.g. tachycardia, anaemia, hypertension, or hypotension). The patient described may have had both.

Q3. Which are the three mandatory diagnostic cornerstones of the early diagnosis of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI) among the following: past clinical history including a detailed description of the chest pain characteristics, 12-lead ECG, chest X-ray, elevated and dynamic rise in cTn, treadmill test, computed tomography (CT) angiography, and myocardial perfusion scan?

### Neonatal myocardial perfusion in right ventricle dependent coronary circulation: clinical surrogates and role of troponin-I in postoperative management following systemic-to-pulmonary shunt physiology [^1157bTBP]. Pediatric Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Right ventricle dependent coronary circulation (RVDCC) in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS) is associated with significant mortality risk in the immediate post-operative period following the initial stage of surgical palliation. Prognosis remains guarded during the interstage period towards conversion to the superior cavopulmonary shunt physiology. Current literature is scarce regarding this specific patient population. Cardiac troponin-I is widely used as a marker of coronary ischemia in adults, but its use for routine monitoring of neonatal myocardial tissue injury due to supply/demand perfusion mismatch is, yet to be determined. We sought to evaluate the clinical correlation of cTnl perioperative use in a PA/IVS RVDCC case and assess its interplay with established clinical, echocardiographic, and laboratory variables in guiding a real-time (dynamic) management strategy following systemic-to-pulmonary shunt palliation.

### Recommendations for the use of cardiac troponin measurement in acute cardiac care [^113MGDSh]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The release of cardiomyocyte components, i.e. biomarkers, into the bloodstream in higher than usual quantities indicates an ongoing pathological process. Thus, detection of elevated concentrations of cardiac biomarkers in blood is a sign of cardiac injury which could be due to supply-demand imbalance, toxic effects, or haemodynamic stress. It is up to the clinician to determine the most probable aetiology, the proper therapeutic measures, and the subsequent risk implied by the process. For this reason, the measurement of biomarkers always must be applied in relation to the clinical context and never in isolation. There are a large number of cardiac biomarkers, but they can be subdivided into four broad categories, those related to necrosis, inflammation, haemodynamic stress, and/or thrombosis. Their usefulness is dependent on the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurements, the discriminatory limits separating pathology from physiology, and their sensitivity and specificity for specific organ damage and/or disease processes. In recent years, cardiac biomarkers have become important adjuncts to the delivery of acute cardiac care. Therefore, the Working Group on Acute Cardiac Care of the European Society of Cardiology established a committee to deal with ongoing and newly developing issues related to cardiac biomarkers. The intention of the group is to outline the principles for the application of various biomarkers by clinicians in the setting of acute cardiac care in a series of expert consensus documents. The first of these will focus on cardiac troponin, a pivotal marker of cardiac injury/necrosis.

### Adding insult to injury: are there treatments for myocardial injury and type 2 myocardial infarction? [^113wa3of]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

The Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction was notable for highlighting the importance of myocardial injury. 1 It described a plethora of pathophysiologic processes associated with myocardial injury, which was defined by elevation of cardiac troponin (cTn) levels > 99th percentile of the normal reference range. 1 If the cTn elevations were associated with clinical ischemia (symptoms, ECG changes, or imaging evidence), either type 1 (plaque rupture and thrombus) or type 2 (supply/demand imbalance) myocardial infarction (MI) should be diagnosed. Myocardial injury may be acute, with a rise and/or fall of cTn levels, or chronic, defined as < 20% change in cTn levels beyond 48 hours previously. Chronic cTn elevation may occur in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and additionally reflect the burden of noncardiovascular disease, such as diabetes mellitus or renal disease, which may be causes of adverse outcomes and mortality long‐term.

Type 2 MI (T2MI) is common among hospital populations, accounting for at least 25% of all MI. 1 Patients with myocardial injury and T2MI have distinct cardiovascular phenotypes compared with patients with type 1 MI (T1MI), being older, more likely to be women, having lower cTn levels, and more likely to have diabetes mellitus, sepsis, pulmonary embolism, respiratory failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, heart failure (HF), or renal failure.

Mechanisms by which cTn can be released from cardiomyocytes include necrosis, apoptosis, normal cell turnover, release of protein degradation products, increased cell membrane permeability, and release of membranous "blebs". 2

In myocardial injury, cTn elevations may be mediated by direct toxicity from circulating cytokines, catecholamines, or vasopressors. Some of these factors are instrumental in Takotsubo syndrome, with microvascular spasm also possibly playing a part. Takotsubo syndrome is not considered an MI because of the absence of clinical ischemia, reversibility of left ventricular dysfunction, and the myocardial injury occurring beyond the distribution of a single coronary artery. 1

Despite being strongly linked to spontaneous (Type I) acute myocardial infarction (MI) — a common cause of acute HF syndromes — it is well recognized that concentrations of circulating troponins above the 99 th percentile of a normal population in the context of both acute and chronic HF are highly prevalent, and frequently unrelated to Type I MI. Other mechanism(s) leading to troponin elevation in HF syndromes remain elusive in many cases but prominently includes supply-demand inequity (Type II MI), which may be associated with coronary artery obstruction and endothelial dysfunction, or may occur in the absence of coronary obstruction due to increased oxygen demand related to increased wall tension, anaemia, or other factors provoking subendocardial injury. Non-coronary triggers, such as cellular necrosis, apoptosis, or autophagy in the context of wall stress may explain the troponin release in HF, as can toxic effects of circulating neurohormones, toxins, inflammation, and infiltrative processes, among others. Nonetheless, across a wide spectrum of HF syndromes, when troponin elevation occurs, independent of mechanism, it is strongly predictive of an adverse outcome. Clinicians should be aware of the high frequency of troponin elevation when measuring the marker in patients with HF, should keep in mind the possible causes of this phenomenon, and, independent of a diagnosis of 'acute MI', should recognize the considerable ramifications of troponin elevation in this setting.

### Associations between cardiac troponin, mechanism of myocardial injury, and long-term mortality after noncardiac vascular surgery [^115uRnNt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we demonstrate that there is an independent, graded relationship between perioperative cTnT level and long‐term mortality after intermediate‐ or high‐risk noncardiac vascular surgery. This emerges immediately, is mostly an early hazard, but persists over time with any detectable cTnT value above the 99th percentile (≥ 0.01 ng/mL), even at levels typically considered below elevated (0.01–0.029 ng/mL). We further demonstrate that patients with Type 1 MI attributable to intraluminal thrombosis have a greater early mortality hazard than patients with Type 2 MI attributable to demand ischemia/MINS, but that the risk is roughly equivalent over time (Figures 4 and 5). Together, these results suggest that the degree of postoperative myocardial injury appears to be more important than the underlying pathogenic mechanism. Our results support the premise that patients with perioperative Type 2 MI are at high risk for mortality, and confirm that this risk persists well beyond the immediate postoperative time period of 30 days or 1 year.

### Brief myocardial ischemia produces cardiac troponin I release and focal myocyte apoptosis in the absence of pathological infarction in swine [^112Wxg1K]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Brief ischemia elicits delayed cTnI release that is compatible with irreversible myocyte injury as opposed to release from an exchangeable cTnI pool. Nevertheless, rather than necrosis from sarcolemmal disruption, the delayed cTnI release appears to reflect focal myocyte cell death from apoptosis and may explain cTnI elevations in the absence of an acute coronary syndrome.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Serum troponin I (cTnI) can become elevated after brief episodes of ischemia that have previously been considered to be completely reversible because pathological evidence of myocyte necrosis is absent. The findings of this study demonstrate that cTnI elevations in this circumstance do not reflect the early release of an exchangeable pool of cTnI from viable myocytes but instead arise from delayed programmed myocyte death from apoptosis.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 1: There is a delayed release of cTnI above the 99th percentile for normal animals after brief regional ischemia. The time course differs from the early release expected for an exchangeable cTnI pool in viable myocytes. Rather, delayed cardiac cTnI release follows transiently increased regional myocyte apoptosis without pathological evidence of necrosis or infarction.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK 2: It is likely that focal myocyte apoptosis develops after many, if not all, episodes of brief ischemia, with the extent and severity of apoptosis determining the magnitude of troponin I elevation in the serum. These episodes would be considered to be angina clinically, yet some would meet our current definition of myocardial infarction despite the absence of myocyte necrosis. Many transient cTnI elevations probably occur without demonstrable electrocardiographic changes or chest pain because these are insensitive indices of brief ischemia. Still others may reflect nonischemic causes of myocyte apoptosis. Thus, in the absence of clinical suspicion of an acute coronary syndrome or prolonged demand-induced ischemia, it may be more appropriate to ascribe these cTnI elevations as due to "myocardial injury" rather than infarction.

### Type 2 myocardial infarction due to supply-demand mismatch [^115sF1TL]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The best-accepted definition of myocardial infarction (MI) is provided by statements from the Universal Definition of MI Global Task force. This article, now in its third iteration, defines MI as myocardial cell death due to prolonged myocardial ischemia. It further delineates an increasingly incident subclassification of MI known as type 2 MI (T2MI). T2MI identifies instances of myocardial necrosis in which an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and/or demand occurs for reasons other than atherosclerotic plaque disruption. While associated with considerable risk (comparable to that of type 1 MI, which has well-defined management strategies), the spectrum of potential etiologies for T2MI makes development of precise diagnostic criteria and therapeutic implications of the diagnosis challenging.

### An emergency medicine approach to troponin elevation due to causes other than occlusion myocardial infarction [^111zidQy]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Troponin is an integral component of the evaluation for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and occlusion myocardial infarction (OMI). However, troponin may be elevated in conditions other than OMI.

Objective

This narrative review provides emergency clinicians with a focused evaluation of troponin elevation in patients with myocardial injury due to conditions other than OMI.

Discussion

ACS includes the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI), which incorporates assessment for elevated troponin. Troponin I and T are the most common biomarkers used in assessment of myocardial injury and may be released with myocyte injury and necrosis, myocyte apoptosis and cell turnover, and oxygen supply demand mismatch. Troponin elevation is a reflection of myocardial injury, and many conditions associated with critical illness may result in troponin elevation. These include cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. Cardiac conditions include heart failure, dysrhythmia, and dissection, while non-cardiac causes include pulmonary embolism, sepsis, stroke, and many others. Clinicians should consider the clinical context, patient symptoms, electrocardiogram, and ultrasound in their assessment of the patient with troponin elevation. In most cases, elevated troponin is a marker for poor outcomes including increased rates of mortality.

Conclusions

Troponin can be elevated in many critical settings. The causes of troponin elevation include cardiac and non-cardiac conditions. Clinicians must consider the clinical context and other factors, as an inappropriate diagnosis of OMI may result in patient harm and misdiagnosis of another condition.

### Machine learning for ECG diagnosis and risk stratification of occlusion myocardial infarction [^111bfACN]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Clinical outcomes

Adjudications were made by independent reviewers at each local site after reviewing all available medical records within 30 d of the indexed encounter. Reviewers were blinded from all ECG analyses and models' predictions. OMI was defined as coronary angiographic evidence of an acute culprit lesion in at least one of the three main coronary arteries (left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX) and right coronary artery (RCA)) or their primary branches with TIMI flow grade of 0–1. TIMI flow grade of 2 with severe coronary narrowing > 70% and peak troponin of 5–10.0 ng mL −1 was also considered indicative of OMI. These adjudications were made by two independent reviewers. The kappa coefficient statistic between the two reviewers was 0.771 (that is, substantial agreement). All disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer.

ACS was defined per the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction as the presence of symptoms of ischemia (that is, diffuse discomfort in the chest, upper extremity, jaw or epigastric area for more than 20 min) and at least one of the following criteria: (1) subsequent development of labile, ischemic ECG changes (for example, ST changes and T inversion) during hospitalization; (2) elevation of cardiac troponin (that is, > 99th percentile) during the hospital stay with rise and/or drop on serial testing; (3) coronary angiography demonstrating greater than 70% stenosis, with or without treatment; and/or (4) functional cardiac evaluation (stress testing) that demonstrates ECG, echocardiographic or radionuclide evidence of focal cardiac ischemia. Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction and pre-existing subacute coronary occlusion were labeled as negative for ACS and OMI. This included around 10% of patients with positive troponin but with no rise and/or drop in concentration on serial testing (that is, chronic leak) or with troponin leak attributed to non-coronary occlusive conditions, such as pericarditis. On a randomly selected small subset of patients (n = 1,209), the kappa coefficient statistic for ACS adjudication ranged from 0.846 to 0.916 (that is, substantial to perfect agreement).

### Stunned and hibernating myocardium: where are we nearly 4 decades later? [^112Lt3e3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Biomarker Release Associated With Stunned Myocardium

There is ongoing controversy regarding the meaning of biomarker release of creatine kinase–myocardial band and cardiac troponin I and T associated with stunned myocardium. Release of these markers, typically associated with MI, into the blood stream have been well documented in experimental models of brief ischemia and reperfusion, not usually associated with MI. 39, 40 Cardiac troponin has also been detected in the circulation after exercise or pacing‐induced ischemia, 41 as well as after vigorous bouts of exercise not necessarily associated with known ischemia. It is unknown whether this biomarker is leaking from many cardiac cells that are reversibly injured or a few cells that are irreversibly injured. A recent investigation by Weil et al 42 used a pig model of myocardial stunning, induced by a 10‐minute coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. They observed a pathologic elevation of cardiac troponin I by 60 minutes after reperfusion and continued elevation at 24 hours. Although tissue staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride and histologic analysis did not demonstrate classic ischemic necrosis, sections obtained 1 hour after reperfusion showed a 6‐fold increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling–positive cardiomyocytes in the region of ischemia/reperfusion. Therefore, their study suggests that the elevation of troponin I after a period of stunning is not associated with classic ischemic necrosis but with some cells that undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death). The clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined. 42

### Early detection of myocardial infarction with reference to baseline levels during health: impact on biological variation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin [^114Jx6Tz]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A 78-year-old male was seen in the emergency department (ED) with chest pain. Fifteen months earlier, he had presented to the ED with shoulder and elbow pain. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) testing was conducted at that time, which produced normal results of 10 and 13 ng/L (cutoff < 48 ng/L). During the current admission, his electrocardiogram was unremarkable, with a borderline prolonged PR interval noted. The patient's hs-cTnI results were 25, 47, and 254 ng/L at 0, 1, and 7 hours, respectively. He was diagnosed with demand ischemia and admitted to the hospital. The detection of acute myocardial infarction in this case was made during the first sample collection (t = 0), despite the fact that this result was well within the normal range.

### Associations between cardiac troponin, mechanism of myocardial injury, and long-term mortality after noncardiac vascular surgery [^1126xopv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Perioperative myocardial injury detectable by cardiac troponin elevation is estimated to occur in 5% to 25% of the over 200 million patients who undergo noncardiac surgery annually. 1, 2, 3, 4 The association between postoperative troponin elevation and short‐term mortality is established. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 However, how this hazard changes over time, and whether it persists long term are not well defined. Further, whether outcomes differ by the underlying mechanism leading to perioperative troponin elevation is unknown. 9, 10

Many patients have detectable troponin following noncardiac surgery, but only ≈40% meet the universal definition of Type 1 myocardial infarction (MI) because of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 2, 3, 6, 7, 11 It is presumed that most of these events are Type 2 MI, commonly referred to as "demand ischemia", caused by an imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply in the setting of a fixed coronary artery stenosis and increased demand from perioperative stressors. 11 The term "myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery" (MINS) has been used by some to describe events in which patients may be asymptomatic, without ECG changes, but still experience low‐grade troponin elevation. 3 There exists an unmet need to examine associations between Type 2 MI or baseline troponin elevation and mortality, as there remains a lack of evidence on how to manage patients with perioperative myocardial injury not attributable to ACS. 9

To address this, we performed a large observational study to define the association between postoperative cTnT level and mortality after noncardiac vascular surgery, and how this hazard changes over time. Robust multivariable adjustment and propensity score matching were both used to adjust for patient characteristics. We further sought to compare the long‐term mortality risk of various mechanisms of myocardial injury including Type 1 MI attributable to ST‐segment myocardial infarction (STEMI) or non‐STEMI (NSTEMI) from intraluminal thrombus, Type 2 MI attributable to demand ischemia or MINS, or baseline troponin elevation.

### Polygenic risk scores in myocardial injury After noncardiac surgery: a VISION substudy [^116XdkB3]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The definition of MINS includes patients exhibiting asymptomatic troponin elevation attributed to underlying ischemia, as well as those meeting the universal definition of MI. Approximately one-fifth of MINS cases align with the criteria for perioperative MI. Type 1 MI is caused by atherothrombotic CAD, often triggered by erosion of atherosclerotic plaque, while type 2 MI arises from an oxygen supply-demand mismatch due to pathophysiological mechanisms other than coronary atherothrombosis. The weak association between MINS and CAD PRS suggests that this PRS primarily captures pathways related to atherothrombotic CAD, and hence type 1 MI, rather than the mechanisms underlying type 2 MI. Furthermore, type 2 MI in MINS involves multifactorial physiological insults, making it unlikely for an isolated genetic predictor like the CAD PRS to stand out in statistical models. HbA1c, as a marker of glycemic control, is more closely related to the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to type 2 MI, such as endothelial dysfunction, rather than the atherothrombotic events associated with type 1 MI. Although most MINS patients have underlying CAD, only a minority experience underlying ischemia due to plaque rupture during the perioperative period. In surgical contexts, type 2 MI can develop due to factors such as hypoxemia, anemia, hypotension, bradyarrhythmia, or increased myocardial oxygen demand induced by tachyarrhythmia or severe hypertension. Hence, in the perioperative scenario, MINS typically reflects a positive stress test, wherein patients with underlying CAD suffer insults inherent to anesthetic and surgical procedures. These include bleeding, hypotension, and pain triggering stress response, which can lead to type 2 demand ischemia. Therefore, the observation that MINS exhibited a weak association with the CAD PRS implies a multifaceted underlying physiology for MINS.

### Associations between cardiac troponin, mechanism of myocardial injury, and long-term mortality after noncardiac vascular surgery [^113NAyjt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Any degree of perioperative myocardial injury detected by serum cTnT is independently associated with long‐term mortality after noncardiac vascular surgery. This risk emerges with any detection of cTnT above the 99th percentile (≥ 0.01 ng/mL), and rises in a stepwise manner as cTnT level increases. While the short‐term hazard of mortality is greater in patients with Type 1 MI (NSTEMI or STEMI attributable to intraluminal thrombus), the long‐term risk of mortality appears to be independent of mechanism of myocardial injury, as patients with Type 2 MI (demand ischemia) have long‐term mortality equivalent to that of patients with Type 1 MI. Although typically neglected in clinical practice, low‐grade perioperative cTnT elevation is a major risk factor for long‐term adverse outcomes. Future prospective studies and clinical trials are needed to determine whether this risk is modifiable.

### Understanding cardiac troponin part 1: avoiding troponinitis [^111FF5x6]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin (cTn) is a highly specific biomarker of myocardial injury and is central to the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). By itself, however, cTn cannot identify the cause of myocardial injury. 'Troponinitis' is the condition that leads clinicians to falsely assign a diagnosis of AMI based only on the fact that a patient has an elevated cTn concentration. There are many causes of myocardial injury other than AMI. Clinicians are required to differentiate myocardial injury caused by AMI from other causes. In part 1 of this series on cTn, we provide a structured overview to help practising clinicians to interpret 'positive' cTn results appropriately. There are three core principles. First, when reviewing a cTn result, clinicians must carefully consider the clinical context. Only this can distinguish primary (termed type 1) AMI caused by coronary artery disease from secondary (termed type 2) AMI caused by another condition with an imbalance in the supply and demand of oxygen to the myocardium. Second, clinicians must consider the patient's baseline condition in order to determine the presence or absence of factors that may predict a chronic cTn elevation. Third, clinicians should routinely use serial sampling to detect a change of cTn that is expected in patients with acute (rather than chronic) myocardial injury. Using these simple principles, clinicians can avoid underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of AMI.

### Neurological update: use of cardiac troponin in patients with stroke [^112zUVvN]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Causes of troponin elevation in stroke

A first crucial step to determine the most likely cause of cTn elevation is to apply serial measurements. Acute myocardial injury displays a rise and/or fall pattern of hs-cTn levels (changes > 20%, per definition). Previous studies indicate that in 85–95% of all stroke patients, and in approximately two thirds of stroke patients with elevated cTn upon hospital admission, serial measurements show no relevant temporal change in cTn levels. This suggests that the majority of stroke patients have chronic rather than acute myocardial injury. In these cases, chronic structural and coronary heart disease are the most likely underlying causes. Chronic myocardial injury is also common in chronic kidney disease which is probably not mainly driven by impaired renal clearance but rather reflects severity of cardiac comorbidities. Importantly, the definitions of temporal change and timing of serial measurements differed in these studies which lead to uncertainty about the true incidence of acute and chronic myocardial injury after stroke. If there is evidence of acute myocardial injury, then myocardial ischemia due to atherothrombotic myocardial infarction (i.e. type 1 MI) needs to be considered. In the small prospective TRoponin ELevation in Acute ischemic Stroke (TRELAS) study, coronary angiography revealed acute coronary "culprit" lesions indicative of type 1 MI in approximately 25% of stroke patients with cTn elevation above of at least 4 times the URL. However, the cause of acute myocardial injury beyond type 1 MI can be diverse and range from myocardial ischemia due to type 2 MI (e.g. demand ischemia) or microcirculatory dysfunction, to non-ischemic conditions, such as takotsubo syndrome, myocarditis, as well as systemic conditions like sepsis or pulmonary embolism (Fig. 1).

### Troponin's twist: a sepsis story beyond the heart [^114TxmAE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions: The Jury Is Still Out

The study by Choi et al challenges the assumption that troponin elevation in sepsis predicts poor outcomes. While elevated troponin may indicate systemic dysfunction, its role as an independent mortality predictor remains unclear. The question persists: Is troponin a sentinel of sepsis‐induced myocardial injury or merely a bystander in multiorgan dysfunction?

Until further clarity emerges, clinicians should be judicious in ordering and interpreting troponin levels, ensuring that their measurement leads to actionable decisions rather than misguided concern. The contrasting findings of various studies highlight the complexity of troponin as a biomarker and the need for better‐defined clinical applications. In the chaos of sepsis, it is imperative to separate the signal of clinically significant myocardial injury, which portends increased death, from the noise of low‐grade myocardial inflammation and troponin leak. Yet a paradigm other than physician heuristics is not currently available. In the ever‐evolving battle against sepsis, perhaps it is time to rethink our biomarkers, assumptions, and clinical approach to troponin in noncardiac disease where the heart is not the star of the show. Much ado about elevation? The jury is still out.

### Large animal models of heart Failure: a translational bridge to clinical success [^117SW5Lk]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2020). Medium credibility.

HF Induced by Myocardial Infarction

Cardiac cell death associated with aberrant heart dysfunction is the main characteristic of a myocardial infarction (MI), which can ultimately lead to HF. This catastrophic event occurs due to interruption of blood flow to a discrete area of the myocardium that results from partial or complete occlusion of 1 or multiple coronary arteries. Unbalanced myocardial blood supply and demand can be spontaneously precipitated by coronary artery disease (e.g. atherosclerosis or thrombosis) or can occur during periprocedural revascularization surgery performed to revert spontaneous ischemia (e.g. percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass grafting). The correct identification of different types of MI in response to ischemia is critical for optimizing patient treatment and is an important consideration for translational studies attempting to model acute MI and the subsequent development of HF. In this regard, the Universal Definition of MI was recently updated based on critical clinical projections driven by MI, including biomarkers (e.g. cardiac troponin levels), pathological features (e.g. edema, reduced glycogen content, and mitochondrial abnormalities), electrocardiography (e.g. new ST-segment elevations), and imaging by echocardiography, radionuclide imaging, or resonance magnetic imaging (e.g. myocardial free wall rupture and mitral regurgitation).

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) after noncardiac surgery — epidemiology and diagnostic/management considerations: The incidence of perioperative MI ranges widely from 0.90% to 15% depending on the definitions, patient risk factors, and surgical type. Patients with perioperative STEMI and NSTEMI have a substantial mortality risk, with nearly one-third of patients either dying or being readmitted at 30 days, and they are more likely to present with type 2 MI due to supply–demand mismatch than type 1 MI. Recognition can be difficult because sedation and analgesia can limit symptom reporting; in suspected type 2 MI, management should address the underlying supply–demand mismatch, and nonischemic causes of troponin elevation should be considered. ICA may be indicated when acute coronary occlusion is suspected after individualized risk stratification that accounts for residual bleeding risk, type of surgery, and time since surgery.

### The ischaemic constellation: an alternative to the ischaemic cascade-implications for the validation of new ischaemic tests [^1112iBWg]. Open Heart (2015). Low credibility.

The ischaemic cascade is the concept that progressive myocardial oxygen supply–demand mismatch causes a consistent sequence of events, starting with metabolic alterations and followed sequentially by myocardial perfusion abnormalities, wall motion abnormalities, ECG changes, and angina. This concept would suggest that investigations that detect expressions of ischaemia earlier in the cascade should be more sensitive tests of ischaemia than those that detect expressions appearing later in the cascade. However, careful review of the studies on which the ischaemic cascade is based suggests that the ischaemic cascade concept may be less well supported by the literature than assumed. In this review we explore this, discuss an alternative method for conceptualising ischaemia, and discuss the potential implications of this new approach to clinical studies and clinical practice.

### Impact of clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with elevated cardiac troponin [^1164oNyN]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Measurement of cardiac troponin (cTn) levels in blood is recommended in patients presenting with a suspected acute coronary syndrome and levels above the 99th percentile with a significant rising and/or falling pattern is an obligatory criterion for a diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). However, elevated levels of cTn are a common finding also in the absence of the coronary atherothrombotic event that currently defines type 1 MI. Among patients with elevated cTn at emergency departments, 19%–35% have been reported to have type 2 MI and 35%–56% to have non-ischaemic myocardial injury (later referred to as myocardial injury). These are two different conditions according to the current classification of MI, where type 2 MI is caused by ischaemia due to myocardial oxygen supply/demand mismatch, while myocardial injury is thought to be caused by non-ischaemic mechanisms and therefore not classified as MI. However, type 2 MI and myocardial injury are resembling each other in many aspects. They are both provoked by or associated with other underlying disease, often occur in older, multi-morbid individuals and are both associated with a poor short-term and long-term prognosis. Due to the difficulty to distinguish type 2 MI from myocardial injury, misclassification is common and there is a large variation in the use of an MI diagnosis in both these conditions in clinical practice. However, the effects on therapeutic strategies and prognosis of receiving a clinical diagnosis of MI in these conditions are unknown. In the light of this, the aims of this study were (1) to describe patients with elevated cTn that were not clinically diagnosed as having MI, and (2) to compare treatment strategies and prognosis among patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of type 2 MI and myocardial injury with and without a clinical diagnosis of MI at discharge.

Myocardial infarction versus nonspecific troponin elevations — implications for ICD candidacy: An elevated troponin is not necessarily indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (MI). Low‑level troponin elevations detected on routine or protocol testing that lack a typical rise and fall pattern, or have alternative explanations such as cardiac arrest or external defibrillation, should not be misconstrued as type 1 MI based on the laboratory test alone. In cardiac arrest, a nonspecific transient low‑level troponin rise with subsequent fall without coronary artery disease or thrombosis may occur and should not be considered a type 1 MI; such low‑level biomarker rises should not preclude ICD implantation if other criteria are met. These criteria are based on the presence of type 1 MI, not type 2 MI due to supply‑demand mismatch.

### Patient selection for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and diagnosis of myocardial infarction: prospective cohort study [^113hRxwf]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac troponin is integral to the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, but troponin concentrations are often elevated in patients who do not have acute coronary syndrome. The universal definition now classifies myocardial infarction as spontaneous or type 1, due to plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis, and secondary or type 2 due to myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance. Patients with elevated cardiac troponin concentrations in the absence of myocardial ischaemia are classified as having myocardial injury. Although patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury are increasingly recognised in clinical practice, they represent a heterogeneous group with overt or covert major illness for whom no evidence base exists to guide optimal cardiac investigation or treatment.

We have shown that lowering the diagnostic threshold by using a more sensitive cardiac troponin assay reduced recurrent myocardial infarction or death in patients redefined as having type 1 myocardial infarction. However, use of these lower diagnostic thresholds more than doubled the number of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury with no improvement in their outcome despite undergoing additional cardiac investigation. The introduction of high sensitivity cardiac troponin assays may further increase the frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury, potentially leading to diagnostic uncertainty and unnecessary investigation of patients without acute coronary syndrome.

Patients attending the emergency department often have simultaneous testing for both cardiac and non-cardiac conditions, to facilitate early diagnosis or discharge. In this context, a non-selective approach to high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing may contribute to diagnostic uncertainty. Our aim was to evaluate how selection of patients for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing affects the diagnosis of myocardial infarction across different healthcare settings.

### Myocardial ischemia: lack of coronary blood flow or myocardial oxygen supply / demand imbalance? [^115tE598]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Regional myocardial blood flow and contractile function in ischemic myocardium are well matched, and there is no evidence for an oxygen supply/demand imbalance. Thus, myocardial ischemia is lack of coronary blood flow with electric, functional, metabolic, and structural consequences for the myocardium. All therapeutic interventions must aim to improve blood flow to ischemic myocardium as much and as quickly as possible.

### Reduction in subtypes and sizes of myocardial infarction with ticagrelor in PEGASUS-TIMI 54 [^112Np7Rx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The benefit of ticagrelor in reducing STEMI and large MI translated into a reduction in MI‐related mortality either as fatal MI or sudden death. These data support the position that potent antithrombotic strategies in high‐risk populations have the potential to reduce the mortality related to MI even beyond the benefits of currently utilized preventive strategies.

There are several limitations to this analysis. Systemic serial sampling of biomarkers was not performed after coronary interventions, which may have led to underascertainment of periprocedural (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting surgery) MI. This, however, would lead to an underestimate of overall risk and might underestimate the absolute benefit of ticagrelor in this population. During the course of the trial, the Third Universal Definition of MI was published and modified the definition of Type 4a MI and added Type 4c MI (because of restenosis). Type 4a was made more stringent, increasing the threshold of troponin to 5× upper limit of normal and requiring additional evidence of ischemia (eg, syndrome, angiographic evidence, ECG changes); however, because there were only 6 Type 4a MIs, this change would not impact the findings of this analysis and therefore events were not re‐adjudicated with the updated definition. In addition, Type 4c MI was not captured. Similarly, there are limitations with the definition and the ability to discriminate Type 2 MI from other subtypes. As outlined in the Methods section, events classified as Type 2 MI had to meet criteria as an MI and had to occur in a setting consistent with supply–demand mismatch. Nonetheless, it is possible that some of these events were primarily thrombotic in cause or had a thrombotic component, an observation that would be supported by the trend towards benefit with ticagrelor in this analysis. Overall, only 13% of MI events were classified as Type 2 and inclusion of some Type 1 events would only reduce frequency in this population, underscoring the observation that Type 1 events are the predominant cause of MI in this population. An additional limitation is the use of different troponin assays of differing sensitivity across sites. Utilization of high thresholds (eg, 100‐fold elevations) in peak troponin was intended to select for large events regardless of assay, and differing assays would not impact the consistent findings shown with STEMI.

### The diagnostic challenge of myocardial infarction in critically ill patients: do high-sensitivity troponin measurements add more clarity or more confusion? [^111qdWyP]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the diagnosis of AMI remains challenging in the ICU, and the use of high-sensitivity troponin T as a diagnostic tool should be prudent because it may lead to an overestimation of evidence of ischemia. To increase the accuracy for diagnosing MI, one should reserve invasive or non-invasive procedures, such as bedside echocardiography or coronary angiography, to a targeted population. The work of Ostermann and colleagues provides further information to best identify this at-risk population. Yet the equivalence in outcomes between clinically recognized and unrecognized MI may reflect the challenge of appropriate and timely medical intervention for MIs. Larger trials will be necessary to further evaluate the utility of troponin-based clinical algorithms to an improvement in outcomes.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Evaluation of an Abnormal Troponin Obtained for Postoperative Surveillance — this algorithm starts with "Troponin > 99th percentile URL" and then distinguishes myocardial infarction (MI) from injury using the Universal Definition of MI. The decision node asks "Has at least 1 criterion for Universal Definition of MI been met?" with criteria including "Symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia", "New ischemic ECG changes", "Development of pathologic Q waves", "Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality", and "Identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography including intracoronary imaging". If MI criteria are not met, it asks "Is the myocardial injury likely due to a nonischemic process?" and specifies that "Nonsischemic myocardial injury encompasses pulmonary embolism, sepsis, acute decompensated heart failure, or acute stroke"; if not nonischemic, classify as myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS), for which "Discussion and recognition of MINS diagnosis, including outpatient referral, is reasonable (2a)". If MI criteria are met, manage as NSTEMI or STEMI. For NSTEMI, "Patients who develop NSTEMI after NCS should receive GDMT as recommended for patients with spontaneous MI, with limitations imposed by bleeding risk and postoperative hemodynamic status (1)" and "Patients who develop NSTEMI after NCS can benefit from invasive coronary angiography after weighing bleeding and thrombotic risks based on the severity of clinical presentation (2a)"; when plaque rupture is not suspected (Type 2 NSTEMI), "Treat underlying cause of supply-demand mismatch and optimize GDMT with limitations imposed by bleeding risk and postoperative hemodynamic status". For STEMI, "Patients who develop STEMI after NCS should receive GDMT including consideration of invasive coronary angiography, balancing bleeding and thrombotic risks with severity of the clinical presentation (1)". The figure notes that evaluation "Presumes a rise and fall of troponin consistent with acute myocardial injury. Troponin may be measured using a conventional fourth-generation or a high-sensitivity assay".

Use of High‐Sensitivity Assays and Potential Challenges

Based on their analytic capabilities, the high‐sensitivity assays offer several advantages over their conventional assay counterparts. As previously mentioned, they are extremely sensitive, perhaps allowing for earlier and faster recognition of MI patientsand giving clinicians an avenue to more quickly diagnose and treat patients appropriately. The new assays are also precise, having small CV levels even at the 99% in reference populations. – They are specific for myocardial necrosis, although this topic is controversial. There are conflicting opinions on the specificity of troponin for myocyte infarction versus ischemia. In brief, there are limited data in the setting of stress tests, during which standard‐sensitivity troponin assays are static, while high‐sensitivity assays detect a small rise in troponin. In addition, experimental models of ischemia, achieved by pacing patients from the coronary sinus, have shown a low‐level elevation in troponin appreciated only with high‐sensitivity troponin assays. Some authors have interpreted similar findings as consistent with ischemia –; however, it has also been argued that the high‐sensitivity assays are detecting minute levels of myocyte necrosis (thus, miniscule MIs). In addition, there are several proposed mechanisms of troponin release that are not related to necrosis, namely apoptosis, cellular release of proteolytic products, increased cell wall permeability with stress or stretch, and the production of membranous blebs that contain troponin. Despite the controversy, conventional‐sensitivity assays are specific for myocyte necrosis, and we believe high‐sensitivity troponin assays will also have high specificity once appropriate threshold values have been determined. Finally, there is a considerable amount of data that indicate that increasing values (and perhaps changes in values over time) correlate with risk of adverse cardiac events. – However, most of these advantages also bring disadvantages. With higher sensitivity comes the responsibility of understanding and interpreting very low levels of high‐sensitivity troponin elevation. Despite the high specificity of these assays, no troponin assay alone allows a clinician to determine the etiology of myocyte necrosis. While high precision is quite valuable in these tests, especially at low levels, biological variability again makes interpretation of high‐sensitivity troponin elevations difficult, and new thresholds will have to be defined for clinical use. Finally, as with current troponin I assays, there is no industry standard to the high‐sensitivity troponin assays, and they have varying assay characteristics that will make comparisons between hospitals and medical systems difficult at present (Table 2).

### Associations between cardiac troponin, mechanism of myocardial injury, and long-term mortality after noncardiac vascular surgery [^111WHVTt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

This is the largest study to evaluate the mechanisms of cTnT elevation in a surgical population to date. Importantly, we show that while the short‐term hazard of mortality is higher with Type 1 than Type 2 MI, over the long term the risk of Type 2 MI is significant and approximates true ACS. Illustrating this, on Kaplan–Meier analysis, patients with Type 1 MI do appear to have worse survival immediately following surgery; however, the survival curve for patients with Type 2 MI gradually converges with the Type 1 curve over time. This similar mortality hazard lends credence to the premise that although presentations may somewhat differ between Type 1 and Type 2 MI, cTnT is specific for myocardial injury, and thus there may be a similar pathophysiology driving both types of MI. While sequelae of acute plaque rupture likely drive the early mortality hazard associated with Type 1 MI, it is likely that underlying coronary artery disease and perhaps other comorbidities (congestive heart failure, valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, etc) influence long‐term mortality regardless of whether classified as Type 1 or Type 2 MI.

In support of this concept, there is emerging evidence that patients with demand ischemia may have mortality rates equivalent to or perhaps exceeding patients with true ACS across a variety of clinical circumstances. 12, 13, 14, 15 This may be driven by underlying medical comorbidities, 16 or perhaps misclassification of a subset of these patients as type 2 MI, when in fact they had type 1 MI. 17 To this point, in a recent study of 217 patients with presumed type 2 MI who underwent angiography, 29% had evidence of acute plaque rupture. 18 The prevalence of misclassified type 2 MI may be even higher in surgical patients, as 2 angiographic studies have demonstrated thrombotic occlusion to be the cause of perioperative MI in between 26% and 60% of patients. 19, 20

Despite this, few patients with Type 2 MI were offered left heart catheterization or stress testing before hospital discharge in our study. Further, fewer patients with Type 2 MI had aspirin, clopidogrel, statin, and/or a β‐blocker introduced than patients with Type 1 MI. This may represent an opportunity to improve patient outcomes; however, prospective studies and randomized trials are indicated to evaluate whether these interventions may reduce mortality.

### Machine learning for diagnosis of myocardial infarction using cardiac troponin concentrations [^115p3ENa]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Adjudication and follow-up

Telephone follow-up occurred 30 days after presentation by research nurses. All information was verified through medical record databases and cardiac investigation results. Outcomes were adjudicated independently by local cardiologists using predefined standardized reporting definitions, with access to the clinical record, electrocardiogram, cardiac troponin measurements and all subsequent investigations from standard care. A second cardiologist conducted a blind review of all acute coronary syndromes and 10% of nonacute coronary syndrome cases. In cases of disagreement between the two adjudicators, end points were agreed on by consensus. Myocardial infarction was defined according to international guidelines and based on evidence of myocardial necrosis and ischemia. Patients with acute myocardial infarction were further subdivided into acute myocardial infarction type 1 (primary coronary events) and acute myocardial infarction type 2 (ischemia due to increased demand or decreased supply: for example, tachyarrhythmias or hypertensive crisis). Myocardial necrosis was defined as a 20% increase or decrease in cardiac troponin concentration with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the normal reference range. Evidence of myocardial ischemia included the electrocardiogram or cardiac imaging.

### Prevalence, determinants, and clinical associations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin in patients attending emergency departments [^11784Zsd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Classification of Myocardial Injury and Myocardial Infarction

Elevated cardiac troponin concentration was defined using sex-specific thresholds at the 99th percentile URL. Two cardiologists reviewed all clinical information independently, including noninvasive and invasive investigations and outcomes from admission to 30 days as described previously. Patients with elevated cardiac troponin were classified according to the universal definition of myocardial infarction. Type 1 myocardial infarction was defined in which myocardial necrosis occurred in the context of a presentation with symptoms suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome or evidence of myocardial ischemia on the electrocardiogram. Patients with myocardial necrosis and symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia as a result of increased oxygen demand or decreased supply (eg tachyarrhythmia, hypotension, or anemia) due to an alternative diagnosis were classified as type 2 myocardial infarction. Myocardial injury was defined as elevated cardiac troponin concentration without signs or symptoms of myocardial ischemia. A third adjudicator resolved any discrepancies in adjudication through in-depth review of source documents.

Clinical Outcomes

Death from any cause was identified from regional and national registries including the General Register of Scotland, allowing capture of all deaths in the hospital and in the community, ensuring complete follow-up in all patients. Patients who were not residents of Scotland were censored at the time of discharge.

### In a canine model of septic shock, cardiomyopathy occurs independent of catecholamine surges and cardiac microvascular ischemia [^113oQ7yL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Epinephrine was associated with nonocclusive cardiac microvascular abnormalities; however, the myocardial injury attributable to epinephrine infusion was distinct from the myocardial depression observed in sepsis. For 2 days after discontinuation of epinephrine infusions, there was evidence of mild ischemia with significant reduction of microcirculatory reserve and minimal but significant troponin I level elevations compared with baseline. These findings were not seen in septic animals that did not receive epinephrine and represent a sustained late‐occurring specific effect on microcirculatory perfusion particular to high‐dose epinephrine. In addition to increased lactate levels associated with epinephrine infusions, liver enzymes were elevated, and renal function was reduced. In these other organs, unlike the heart, the abnormalities completely reversed after termination of the infusion. Furthermore, in contrast to other organs and despite decreased microvascular perfusion, during the epinephrine infusion the heart showed no overt signs of injury (ie, cardiac edema was decreased, and no troponin leak was detected). This observation suggests epinephrine did have directly measurable acute effects on the coronary microcirculation and reduced coronary capillary perfusion. Once epinephrine was stopped, perfusion returned toward normal, and troponin was liberated into the systemic circulation.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^114o1awW]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial injury and/or infarction in critically ill patients — Elevations of cardiac troponin (cTn) values are common in intensive care unit patients and are associated with adverse prognosis regardless of the underlying disease state. Some elevations may reflect type 2 MI due to underlying CAD and increased myocardial oxygen demand, whereas in other patients type 1 MI may occur because of plaque disruption leading to thrombosis in a coronary artery. Other patients may have elevated cTn values with marked decreases in ejection fraction (EF) due to sepsis caused by endotoxin, with myocardial function recovering completely with normal EF once the sepsis is treated. It is frequently challenging for the clinician caring for a critically ill patient with a severe single organ or multiorgan pathological condition to decide on a plan of action when the patient has elevated cTn values, and if and when the patient recovers from the critical illness, clinical judgment should be employed to decide whether, and to what extent, further evaluation for CAD or structural heart disease is indicated.

### Interphysician agreement on subclassification of myocardial infarction [^114K3fdx]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The universal definition of myocardial infarction (MI) differentiates MI due to oxygen supply/demand mismatch (type 2) from MI due to plaque rupture (type 1) as well as from myocardial injuries of non-ischaemic or multifactorial nature. The purpose of this study was to investigate how often physicians agree in this classification and what factors lead to agreement or disagreement.

Methods

A total of 1328 patients diagnosed with MI at eight different Swedish hospitals 2011 were included. All patients were retrospectively reclassified into different MI or myocardial injury subtypes by two independent specially trained physicians, strictly adhering to the third universal definition of MI.

Results

Overall, there was a moderate interobserver agreement with a kappa coefficient (κ) of 0.55 in this classification. There was substantial agreement when distinguishing type 1 MI (κ: 0.61), compared with moderate agreement when distinguishing type 2 MI (κ: 0.54). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, ST elevation MI (P < 0.001), performed coronary angiography (P < 0.001) and larger changes in troponin levels (P = 0.023) independently made the physicians agree significantly more often, while they disagreed more often with symptoms of dyspnoea (P < 0.001), higher systolic blood pressure (P = 0.001) and higher C reactive protein levels on admission (P = 0.016).

Conclusion

Distinguishing MI types is challenging also for trained adjudicators. Although strictly adhering to the third universal definition of MI, differentiation between type 1 MI, type 2 MI and myocardial injury only gave a moderate rate of interobserver agreement. More precise and clinically applicable criteria for the current classification, particularly for type 2 MI diagnosis, are urgently needed.

### High sensitivity troponin level and benefits of chronic total occlusion revascularization [^115AEkKW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Novel findings of our study include the following: patients with CTO have an elevated hsTn‐I level compared with those without a CTO. Moreover, a higher hsTn‐I level was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with CTO, similar to findings in other individuals with or without CAD. Finally, although CTO revascularization was associated with a reduced event rate in the entire cohort, there was a dramatic improvement in outcomes in those with high hsTn‐I level, while there was no improvement in those with low hsTn‐I level. Our findings suggest that patients with a greater burden of ischemia, as demonstrated by elevated hsTn‐I levels, are most likely to benefit from CTO revascularization.

It is also important to note that the median level of hsTn‐I in our CTO cohort was lower than the 99th percentile of both men and women. In addition to myocardial cell death, reversible ischemia and increased metabolic demand leads to cleavage and release of troponin and its degradation products into in the circulation, resulting in higher circulating hsTn levels. Inducible myocardial ischemia has been reported to be greater in the presence of CTO compared with those with obstructed CAD without CTO. One novel finding from our study includes the presence of higher hsTn‐I levels in patients with CTO compared with patients without CTO, likely due to greater ischemia in these patients. Additionally, there are extensive data showing that women have lower troponin levels compared with men. However, in our cohort of patients with CTO, men and women had similar levels of hsTn‐I, and there was no interaction between sex and troponin levels and outcomes.

### Impact of type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) on hospital-level MI outcomes: implications for quality and public reporting [^117QaCQn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Type 1 MI

Detection of fall or rise of troponin with at least 1 value > 99th percentile marked by the manufacturer. A 20% increase or decrease in the value of cTnI was marked as the threshold to meet the biomarker criteria (when initial cTnI was ≥ 0.5 ng/mL). In case the initial cTnI was close to 99th percentile (0.045–0.5 ng/mL), at least ≥ 3‐SD change (≥ 30% change) was required. 7 If the biomarker criteria were met, one of the following additional criteria had to be satisfied: (1) symptoms suggestive of ischemia, (2) new or presumed ST‐T wave changes or left bundle‐branch block, (3) development of pathological Q waves in the ECG, (4) intracoronary thrombus noted on coronary angiography or autopsy, (5) new wall motion abnormality noted on echocardiography.

Type 2 MI

Fulfillment of criteria for type 1 MI as described, along with identification of an alternative (noncoronary) explanation known to cause a supply/demand mismatch either by decreasing myocardial oxygen supply or by increasing myocardial oxygen demand. The "condition other than coronary artery disease contributing to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and/or demand" was defined as an alternate factor. The presence of an underlying alternate factor known to induce a supply/demand mismatch was required for a diagnosis of type 2 MI to be considered along with fulfillment of criteria of MI, as per the Third Universal Definition of MI.

Biomarker Criteria

The 99th percentile of the reference range for cTnI (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) used at our institution was determined to be 0.045 ng/mL, and a coefficient of variance < 10% was estimated to be < 0.04 ng/mL. A value > 0.045 ng/mL was an initial requisite, along with a rise or fall pattern, as defined by the universal definition. Samples of cTnI were drawn during clinical care. Peak troponin levels were defined as the highest troponin level obtained during the hospitalization course, regardless of the number of values obtained.

Statistical Analyses

Patient characteristics, comorbidities, and ACS core measure medications (aspirin, statins, and beta blockers) prescribed at discharge were compared using χ 2 and Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests, as appropriate. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test was also used to assess differences in peak troponin levels between type 1 and type 2 MI.

### Angiographic and clinical characteristics of type 1 versus type 2 perioperative myocardial infarction [^112f8X7T]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to analyze clinical and angiographic differences between the two etiologic subtypes of perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI).

Background

PMI is believed to occur by either reduced coronary blood flow attributable to acute plaque rupture and thrombosis (type 1) or primary increase in oxygen demand in the setting of stable but stenotic lesions (type 2). Incidence and mortality rates of PMI are substantial, but angiographic and clinical features are not well characterized.

Methods

Consecutive patients with PMI were classified as "type 1" or "type 2" based on angiographic characteristics of culprit lesions. Clinical and angiographic characteristics of each subtype were compared using statistical analyses.

Results

Of the 54 patients analyzed, 32 (59%) cases had type 1 PMI, whereas 22 others (41%) had type 2 PMI. Compared with type 2 patients, those with type 1 PMI more often had ECG (electrocardiogram) ST elevation (53% versus 23%, P = 0.026), greater peak troponin (15.3 ng/dl versus 5.3 ng/dl, P = 0.035), higher preoperative mean blood pressure (103 mm Hg versus 93 mm Hg, P = 0.009), greater decrease in mean intraoperative blood pressure (-36 mm Hg versus -26 mm Hg, P = 0.015). Type I patients trended toward greater in-hospital mortality (16% versus 5%, P = 0.38) and length of hospitalization (13.5 days versus 9.0 days, P = 0.13).

Conclusions

These results demonstrate that PMI not only results from "demand ischemia" but also that in nearly 60% of cases the cause is acute plaque rupture. Patients with PMI attributable to plaque rupture suffer more intraoperative hypotension, greater transmural ischemia, larger infarct size, and trended toward worse outcome.

2.2 MI subtypes

In the past 20 years, the accuracy of detecting MI has improved, and more detailed examination of underlying pathophysiology has been possible due to advances in cardiovascular (CV) imaging, redefined ECG criteria, and availability of high‐sensitivity Cardiac troponin assays. 5, 10 On the basis of this improved diagnosis of MI, the joint European Society of Cardiology/American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association/World Heart Foundation (ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF) Task Force for the Redefinition of MI subdivided MI into five main categories according to etiology, with their most recent criteria for each MI type published in 2018 (Figure 1). 5 Types 1 and 2 are spontaneous etiologies of MI, while type 3 is by definition fatal and type 4 and type 5 are procedure‐related. 5 This review will focus on type 1 and type 2 MI.

Figure 1
Classification of myocardial infarction based on the fourth universal definition. 5 CABG, coronary artery bypass grafting; CAD, coronary artery disease; ECG, electrocardiogram; MI, myocardial infarction; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention

Criteria for both type 1 and type 2 MI are a rise and/or fall in Cardiac troponin with ≥ 1 value higher than the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit and at least one of the following: symptoms of acute myocardial ischemia, new ischemic ECG changes, development of pathological Q waves, and imaging evidence consistent with ischemic etiology. 5 Type 1 MI is characterized by atherothrombotic coronary artery disease (CAD) with an occlusive or non‐occlusive coronary thrombus, identified by angiography or autopsy. 5 Type 2 MI differs from type 1 MI in that acute atherothrombotic plaque disruption is absent and there is evidence of an oxygen supply‐demand imbalance unrelated to acute coronary atherothrombosis, either alone or in combination with atherosclerosis, vasospasm or coronary microvascular dysfunction, or nonatherosclerotic coronary dissection. 5

### Cardiac troponin release following coronary artery bypass grafting: mechanisms and clinical implications [^116amhT5]. European Heart Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Possible mechanisms of cardiac troponin release

In the early days following the introduction of cTn, it was perceived that cTn release was exclusively caused by cardiomyocyte necrosis, and the amount of cTn release was therefore an accurate reflection of the degree of necrosis. However, many contemporary studies observed significant increases in cTn concentrations in the absence of overt myocardial cell death, which warranted reconsideration of this conception. Indeed, accumulating evidence suggests that cTn is released through different pathways, with varying extents of myocardial cell damage. As postulated by White in 2011, who proposed a pathophysiological classification for these various pathways, these mechanisms comprise necrosis, apoptosis, physiological myocyte turnover, proteolytic degradation, increased cell membrane permeability, and the formation and release of membranous blebs (Table 2, Figure 1).

Figure 1
An overview of possible mechanisms of cardiac troponin release (Barry van Varik, Pulse Medical Art).

Table 2
Possible mechanisms of cardiac troponin release described in literature a

Indeed, the most obvious cause of cTn release is necrosis, which, in most instances, is caused by a prolonged period of ischaemia. Necrosis is characterized by sarcolemmal disruption and subsequent release of intracellular proteins (such as cTn) into the extracellular space, systemically detectable upon reperfusion. This unrestrained release of intracellular content then causes the typical necrosis-associated local inflammation. Although this type of cell death was considered to be exclusively accidental, chaotic, and unregulated, this limited concept was refuted by Degterev and colleaguesin the early 2000s. They proposed an additional necrosis-like cell death mechanism. In their elegant study, the authors observed a tumour necrosis factor-α-regulated, but non-apoptotic, cell death pathway with necrotic cell death morphology, and coined the term necroptosis. Although incompletely understood, these mechanisms seem to be induced by either the death receptor pathway or the mitochondrial necrosis pathway. In these cases of excessive myocardial cell injury, the presence of sufficient adenosine triphosphate (ATP) seems to be the deciding factor in whether the cell proceeds to an unregulated death (in the absence of ATP), or a programmed death (in the presence of sufficient ATP).

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^117QJPzj]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Universal definitions of acute myocardial infarction (types 1, 2, and 3) — The term acute myocardial infarction should be used when there is acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia and with detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values with at least 1 value above the 99th percentile URL and at least 1 of the following: symptoms of myocardial ischemia; new ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes; development of pathological Q waves; imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology; or identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy (not for types 2 or 3 MIs). Postmortem demonstration of acute atherothrombosis in the artery supplying the infarcted myocardium meets criteria for type 1 MI, evidence of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand unrelated to acute atherothrombosis meets criteria for type 2 MI, and cardiac death in patients with symptoms suggestive of myocardial ischemia and presumed new ischemic ECG changes before cTn values become available or abnormal meets criteria for type 3 MI.

### Surgical APGAR score is associated with myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery [^1141ZeLc]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To assess the impact of intraoperative hemodynamics in the development of perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) and myocardial ischemia after noncardiac surgery.

Design

Single-center retrospective cohort study of surgical patients from 2007 to 2012.

Setting

Postanesthesia care unit, intensive care unit, and medical-surgical ward at an academic tertiary medical center.

Patients

A total of 46,799 adult noncardiac, nonthoracic surgery patients, for which 2290 peak cardiac troponin (cTn) levels were available.

Measurements

The 10-point Surgical Apgar Score (SAS) was calculated from intraoperative heart rate, blood pressure, and blood loss. Peak troponin (cTn) levels, hospital length of stay, 7- and 30-day postoperative mortality, patient demographics, and prior medical conditions were gathered. Troponin leak was defined as cTn-I 0.6 to 1.5 ng/mL or cTn-T 0.1 to 0.3 ng/mL; perioperative MI criteria were cTn-I greater than 1.5 ng/mL or cTn-T greater than 0.30 ng/mL.

Main Results

Of 46,799 noncardiac surgical cases, 209 (0.4%) and 192 (0.4%) suffered cTn leak and MI, respectively. Low SAS (0–4) was associated with increased risk of cTn leak and perioperative MI (univariate odds ratio, 2.76 and 2.06; 95% confidence interval, 2.20–3.45 and 1.57–2.70, respectively). In multivariable analysis, Surgical Apgar Score, age 65 years or older, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status greater than or equal to III, emergency surgery, history of MI or hypertension, prolonged intraoperative tachycardia (heart rate > 100 beats/min for > 59 minutes), and prolonged hypotension (mean arterial pressure < 40 mm Hg for > 2 minutes) were independently associated with cTn leak and perioperative MI.

Conclusions

Low SAS scores (0–4) may be associated with cTn elevation after noncardiac surgery. SAS-based risk stratification may guide perioperative cTn surveillance in lieu of routine postoperative screening.

### Myocardial injury in patients with acute ischemic stroke: prevalence and types of triggers of myocardial demand ischemia [^1138uXzn]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute myocardial injury occurs in about every fourth patient in the early phase after ischemic stroke. It may be caused by an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, potentially leading to type 2 myocardial infarction (MI). However, little is known about the prevalence of potential triggers of such demand ischemia in acute stroke.

Patients and Methods

Consecutive patients with and without post-stroke acute myocardial injury (elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T [hs-cTnT] levels with a rise/fall > 20%) were matched for age and sex and retrospectively screened for presence of predefined triggering conditions of myocardial demand ischemia and fulfillment of diagnostic criteria for acute MI.

Results

Among 508 stroke patients analyzed (median age 81 [73–86] years, 52% female), predefined potential triggers of demand ischemia were present in 107/254 (42%) patients with acute myocardial injury and in 61/254 (24%) matched controls (adjusted OR 2.30, 95%CI 1.51–3.52, p < 0.001). Patients with a trigger were older, more often female, had more severe strokes, and more often insular cortex involvement. The most prevalent triggers were respiratory failure, sustained hypertension, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, and hemodynamic shock. MI criteria were fulfilled in 44/254 (17%) patients with acute myocardial injury including 27/44 (61.4%) with a trigger of demand ischemia (i.e. suspected type 2 MI).

Conclusions

Conditions triggering a myocardial oxygen demand/supply mismatch are highly prevalent in patients with acute myocardial injury detected after stroke, notably in those fulfilling the criteria of acute MI. Stroke-specific aspects such as stroke severity or lesion location may play a role in the development of such triggers.

### Type 1, type 2 myocardial infarction and non-ischemic myocardial injury-opinion from the front lines [^117Geyr9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Differentiating patients with type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) and acute non-ischemic myocardial injury continues to be a problem for many clinicians. Type 1 MI is the most easily defined. It involves the rise and fall of blood troponin measurements (only falling values if the patient arrives late) with an appropriate clinical observation consistent with myocardial ischemia. Diagnosis and therapy of type 1 MI are well understood and usually present no problem to the physician. The clinical scenarios leading to type 2 MI and non-ischemic myocardial injury are, however, often fraught with greater degrees of uncertainty. In addition, therapy for these latter 2 entities is poorly defined. This review will present 3 patient scenarios that should help clinicians understand the difference between these 3 entities as well as possible therapeutic interventions.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^111FgAcf]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Although we observed important differences in the kinetics, cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation are insufficient to distinguish type 1 myocardial infarction from other causes of myocardial injury or infarction in practice. Clinical context may be more helpful than any rule-in threshold for guiding initial triage and management decisions.

### The diagnostic challenge of myocardial infarction in critically ill patients: do high-sensitivity troponin measurements add more clarity or more confusion? [^113YEi9W]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

These findings confirm previous reports underlining that MI, routinely screened by combined ECG changes and plasma hs-cTnT, is quite common and underdiagnosed in ICUs. It is, however, unclear whether knowledge of cTn values when interpreting ECGs leads to an appropriate diagnosis or over-diagnosis of AMI. Indeed, clinical significance of MI remains questionable since Ostermann and colleagues did observe a similar mortality whether it was clinically recognized or not.

ICU patients are at high risk for myocardial ischemia because of older age, increased intrinsic and extrinsic sympathetic stimulation, hypoxia, vasopressor use, and coagulation disorders. However, myocardial necrosis may be induced by coronary atherothrombosis or by other triggers that cause an imbalance between coronary oxygen supply and myocardial oxygen demand. The presence of elevated cTn, in addition to ECG changes, may help to make a decision to rule in or out MI or to ascertain it as did Ostermann and colleagues. The recent analytical methods using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) assays are far more sensitive and improve the diagnosis of MI but at the price of a reduction in specificity.

Thus, several issues regarding the use of hs-cTn in the ICU should be addressed. First, determination of the 99th percentile of hs-cTn could be either variable in this specific population mostly characterized by older age and comorbidities. While this value increases in older (more than 65 years old) patients admitted to the emergency room, it dramatically decreases when, in order to screen volunteers, questionnaires for comorbidity, glomerular filtration rate level, ECG, or cardiac imaging were added. Therefore, the universal upper reference limit lacks specificity in the critically ill. Second, the appreciation of rise or fall of cTn levels during a 3- or 6-hour kinetic, though still debated, seems to be determinant to rule in AMI. In the ICU, the search for the optimal delta change should take into account the patient's specific conditions such as vasopressor-induced troponin rise. Finally, an increase in cTn is due not only to myocardial cell necrosis but also to the release of cytosolic troponin pool from damaged myocytes that could be detected in plasma with high-sensitivity assay in both reversible and irreversible myocardial injury. Situations leading to high-sensitivity troponin level rise (recently reviewed in) are particularly frequent in the ICU and include kidney disease, heart or respiratory failure (or both), sepsis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, Tako-tsubo, myocarditis, trauma, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and tachycardia.

1 INTRODUCTION

Myocardial necrosis due to myocardial ischemia is designated as myocardial infarction (MI). Recognizing the heterogeneity inherent to this entity, in 2007 and 2012, the ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF Task Force for the Universal Definition of MI released expert consensus documents redefining MI into five types. 1 This classification system was recently further refined with the Fourth Universal Definition of MI. 2 Type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI) refers to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissure, or erosion leading to intraluminal thrombus formation and obstructed coronary blood flow. Type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI) was defined as myocardial ischemia, not due to plaque rupture but secondary to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and/or supply due to an underlying cause. 2 In defining presence of MI, a critical characteristic is presence of myocardial ischemia; this may be manifested by symptoms, changes on electrocardiography, or evidence for loss of myocardial function. Patients with evidence of elevated troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) and 10% coefficient of variation without overt myocardial ischemia are classified as having myocardial injury. 2 This injury may be acute or chronic, depending on the pattern of cTn elevation and in appropriate clinical contexts.

### Modulation of thin filament activation by breakdown or isoform switching of thin filament proteins: physiological and pathological implications [^1176zNZW]. Circulation Research (2003). Low credibility.

In the heart, the contractile apparatus is adapted to the specific demands of the organ for continuous rhythmic contraction. The specialized contractile properties of heart muscle are attributable to the expression of cardiac-specific isoforms of contractile proteins. This review describes the isoforms of the thin filament proteins actin and tropomyosin and the three troponin subunits found in human heart muscle, how the isoform profiles of these proteins change during development and disease, and the possible functional consequences of these changes. During development of the heart, there is a distinctive switch of isoform expression at or shortly after birth; however, during adult life, thin filament protein isoform composition seems to be stable despite protein turnover rates of 3 to 10 days. The pattern of isoforms of actin, tropomyosin, troponin I, troponin C, and troponin T is not affected by aging or heart disease (ischemia and dilated cardiomyopathy). The evidence for proteolysis of thin filament proteins in situ during ischemia and stunning is evaluated, and it is concluded that C-terminal cleavage of troponin I is a feature of irreversibly injured myocardium but may not play a role in reversible stunning.

Diagnostic Adjudication

All patients with a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration > 99th centile were adjudicated and classified according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Two physicians independently reviewed all clinical information, with discordant diagnoses resolved by an independent third physician. Type 1 myocardial infarction was defined as myocardial necrosis (any high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentration above the sex-specific 99th percentile with a rise or fall in troponin where serial testing was performed) in the context of a presentation with suspected acute coronary syndrome and symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia. Patients with myocardial necrosis, symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia, and evidence of increased myocardial oxygen demand or decreased supply secondary to an alternative condition without evidence of acute atherothrombosis were defined as type 2 myocardial infarction. Type 4a myocardial infarction was defined in patients with symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia after percutaneous coronary intervention where high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations were 5-fold greater than the 99th centile or increased further if elevated before the procedure. Type 4b myocardial infarction was defined where myocardial ischemia and myocardial necrosis were associated with stent thrombosis documented at angiography. Patients with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations above the 99th centile without symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia were classified as having myocardial injury. All nonischemic myocardial injury was classified as acute, unless a change of ≤ 20% was observed on serial testing, or the final adjudicated diagnosis was chronic heart failure or chronic renal failure, where the classification was chronic myocardial injury. The term "myocardial infarction" is used to denote patients with an adjudicated diagnosis of type 1, type 2, or type 4b myocardial infarction. A detailed summary of the adjudication process is provided in the.

### Clinical features and outcomes of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction: insights from the thrombin receptor antagonist for clinical event reduction in acute coronary syndrome (TRACER) trial [^111MiWTg]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) is characterized by an imbalance between myocardial blood supply and demand, leading to myocardial ischemia without coronary plaque rupture, but its diagnosis is challenging.

Methods

In the TRACER trial, patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes were included. We aimed to describe provoking factors, cardiac biomarker profiles, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of patients with type 2 MIs. MI events during trial follow-up were adjudicated by an independent clinical events classification committee (CEC) and were classified according to the Third Universal Definition of MI. Using available source documents retrieved as part of the CEC process, we performed a retrospective chart abstraction to collect details on the type 2 MIs. Cox regression models were used to explore the association between MI type (type 1 or type 2) and cardiovascular death.

Results

Overall, 10.3% (n = 1327) of TRACER participants had a total of 1579 adjudicated MIs during a median follow-up of 502 days (25th and 75th percentiles [IQR] 349–667). Of all MIs, 5.2% (n = 82) were CEC-adjudicated type 2 MIs, occurring in 76 patients. The incidence of type 2 MI was higher in the first month following randomization, after which the distribution became more scattered. The most frequent potential provoking factors for type 2 MIs were tachyarrhythmias (38.2%), anemia/bleeding (21.1%), hypotension/shock (14.5%), and hypertensive emergencies (11.8%). Overall, 36.3% had a troponin increase > 10× the upper limit of normal. Coronary angiography was performed in 22.4% (n = 17) of patients during hospitalizations due to type 2 MIs. The hazard of cardiovascular death was numerically higher following type 2 MI (vs. no MI, adj. HR 11.82, 95% CI 5.71–24.46; P < .0001) than that of type 1 MI (vs. no MI, adj. HR 8.90, 95% CI 6.93–11.43; P < .0001).

Conclusions

Type 2 MIs were more prevalent in the first month after ACS, were characterized by the presence of triggers and infrequent use of an invasive strategy, and were associated with a high risk of death. Further efforts are needed to better define the role and implications of type 2 MI in both clinical practice and research.

Ventricular tachycardia with low-level biomarker elevation — Class I: Patients presenting with sustained VT in whom low-level elevations in cardiac biomarkers of myocyte injury/necrosis are documented should be treated similarly to patients who have sustained VT and in whom no biomarker rise is documented (Level of Evidence: C). Prolonged episodes of sustained monomorphic VT may be associated with rise in cardiac biomarkers due to myocardial metabolic demands exceeding supply, It is reasonable to evaluate for myocardial ischemia in patients exhibiting these findings, it should not be assumed that a new MI occurred with a modest enzyme elevation, and patients should be treated for this arrhythmia in the same manner as are patients without biomarker release accompanying VT.

### Cardiac ischemia in patients with septic shock randomized to vasopressin or norepinephrine [^1174HAzQ]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac ischemia occurs frequently in critically ill patients and is associated with increased mortality. Given that most critically ill patients cannot communicate symptoms, the diagnosis of cardiac ischemia can be challenging and necessitates that clinicians rely on cardiac biomarkers and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Patients receiving vasopressors may be at even higher risk of cardiac ischemia than other patients because of coronary artery vasoconstriction, increased systemic vasoconstriction-induced afterload, or catecholamine-driven increases in myocardial oxygen demand.

The Vasopressin in Severe Sepsis Trial (VASST) randomized patients with septic shock to vasopressin or norepinephrine. Overall, no significant difference occurred in the primary outcome (28-day mortality) between the vasopressin and the norepinephrine groups (35.4% versus 39.3%, respectively; P = 0.26). Further, no differences were found in the clinical diagnosis of myocardial infarction/ischemia in the two groups (2.0% versus 1.8%; P = 1.0), or in the incidence of cardiac arrest, tachyarrhythmias, or bradyarrhythmias. Vasopressin and norepinephrine are both potent vasoconstrictors, and animal studies suggest that vasopressin is associated with coronary vasoconstriction and myocardial depression. Therefore, we conducted a prospective study to examine, in more detail, ischemic ECG changes, troponin and creatine kinase (CK) levels, and clinical outcomes in a subset of patients enrolled in the VASST Trial. Our specific objectives were to describe troponin and CK levels and ECG abnormalities in patients with severe septic shock and to compare the effect of vasopressin versus that of norepinephrine on troponin and CK levels, ECGs, and the clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria were based on the diagnostic criteria for type 2 MI proposed in the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. These included: 1) symptoms of myocardial ischemia or signs of myocardial ischemia on 12-lead electrocardiogram (≥ 0.5 mm ST-segment depression in any 2 contiguous leads or new regional T-wave inversion); 2) acute myocardial injury defined as a clinically significant change in high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentration with at least one value above the 99th centile upper reference limit or a single measurement if considered significantly elevated; and 3) documented evidence of myocardial oxygen supply (anemia, hypoxia, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia) or demand (hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, valvular heart disease) imbalance. We did not mandate specific criteria for myocardial oxygen supply or demand imbalance in recognition that the threshold for ischemia may differ at an individual patient level. Cardiac troponin concentrations were measured using the Roche Elecsys high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assay (Roche Diagnostics). This assay has a limit of detection of 3 ng/L and an interassay coefficient of variation of 10% at 13 ng/L. The 99th centile is 9 ng/L for females and 16 ng/L for males. We excluded patients under 30 years who are less likely to benefit from cardiac imaging, patients who were unable to give informed consent, those on renal replacement therapy or with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min, those with advanced frailty (based on Clinical Frailty Score ≥ 7), those who were pregnant or breast feeding, those with ST-segment elevation on 12-lead electrocardiogram, those with a presumed or confirmed diagnosis of type 1 MI due to atherothrombosis, those with a confirmed coronary mechanism of type 2 MI (vasospasm, embolism, or spontaneous coronary artery dissection), and those previously randomized into the TARGET-Type 2 pilot study.

Randomization

Patients were randomized 1:1 to the complex intervention or standard care using a web-based computer-generated randomization process developed by the Edinburgh Clinical Trials Unit using SQL and incorporated into our REDCap database. Randomization was stratified by the presence of: 1) known coronary artery disease; and 2) known left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

### Contemporary point of care cardiac troponin testing in suspected acute coronary syndrome [^112pPb7p]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Around one million patients present to hospital with chest pain every year, accounting for approximately 5% of all emergency department attendances in the UK. However, only one in five patients are found to have had a myocardial infarction. Therefore, for several years, there has been a drive to develop diagnostic strategies which allow accurate identification of patients without myocardial infarction at an earlier stage, who may not require admission to hospital for serial cardiac biomarker testing. Such strategies have the potential to improve patient experience and optimise resource allocation both in the emergency department and in hospital, at a time of ever-increasing demands.

Cardiac troponin is the biomarker of choice for the detection of myocardial injury, and international guidelines recommend concentrations are measured using a high-sensitivity assay. While high-sensitivity assays were first introduced in Europe in 2010, they have only recently become available for use in clinical practice in the United States. The higher precision and lower limits of detection afforded by these tests has facilitated the development of pathways which can rule out myocardial infarction at an earlier stage, the majority of which have demonstrated a magnitude of benefits in diagnostic accuracy compared with using the recommended diagnostic threshold (99th centile) alone. In practical terms, implementation of these approaches requires investment in infrastructure to deliver accurate and timely cardiac troponin results on a high-sensitivity platform which is not always available.

### Subclinical myocardial necrosis and cardiovascular risk in stable patients undergoing elective cardiac evaluation [^111yrbWm]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The presence of subclinical myocardial necrosis as a prodrome to longer-term adverse cardiac event risk has been debated. The debate has focused predominantly within patients with acute coronary syndrome, and on issues of troponin assay variability and accuracy of detection, rather than on the clinical significance of the presence of subclinical myocardial necrosis (ie, "troponin leak") within stable cardiac patients. Herein, we examine the relationship between different degrees of subclinical myocardial necrosis and long-term adverse clinical outcomes within a stable cardiac patient population with essentially normal renal function.

Methods and Results

Sequential consenting patients (N = 3828; median creatinine clearance, 100 mL/min/1.73m(2)) undergoing elective diagnostic coronary angiography with cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels below the diagnostic cut-off for defining myocardial infarction (< 0.03 ng/mL) were evaluated. The relationship of subclinical myocardial necrosis with incident major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as any death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) over 3-year follow-up was examined. "Probable" (cTnI 0.001–0.008 ng/mL) and "definite" (cTnI 0.009–0.029 ng/mL) subclinical myocardial necrosis were observed frequently within the cohort (34% and 18%, respectively). A linear relationship was observed between the magnitude of subclinical myocardial necrosis and risk of 3-year incident major adverse cardiovascular events, particularly in those with cTnI 0.009 ng/mL or higher (hazard ratio, 3.00; 95% confidence interval, 2.4–3.8), even after adjustment for traditional risk factors, C-reactive protein, and creatinine clearance. The presence of subclinical myocardial necrosis was associated with elevations in acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein, ceruloplasmin; P < 0.01 each) and reduction in systemic antioxidant enzyme activities (arylesterase; P < 0.01) but showed no significant associations with multiple specific measures of oxidant stress, and showed borderline associations with myeloperoxidase, a marker of leukocyte activation.

Conclusions

In stable cardiology patients, prodromal subclinical myocardial necrosis is associated with substantially higher long-term risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. The underlying mechanisms contributing to this minimal troponin leak phenomenon warrants further investigation.

### Outcomes with type 2 myocardial infarction compared with non-ischaemic myocardial injury [^114Aquq6]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify patients with type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) and patients with non-ischaemic myocardial injury (NIMI) and to compare their prognosis with those of patients with type 1 MI.

Methods

A retrospective observational study was performed in 1010 patients admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital with at least one troponin I test between 2012 and 2013. Participants were identified using laboratory records and divided into three groups: type 1 MI (rupture of atheromatous plaque), type 2 MI (imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and/or demand) and NIMI (patients who did not meet diagnostic criteria for type 1 or type 2 MI). Clinical characteristics and 2-year outcomes were analysed.

Results

Patients with type 2 MI and NIMI were older, with higher proportion of women and more comorbidities than patients with type 1 MI. Absolute mortality and the adjusted risk for all-cause mortality in both groups were significantly higher than that of patients with type 1 MI (39.7%, HR: 1.41 95% CI 1.02 to 1.94, p = 0.038 and 40.0%, HR: 1.54 95% CI 1.16 to 2.04, p = 0.002, respectively). Patients with type 2 MI and NIMI tended to present more readmissions due to heart failure (16.5%, HR: 1.55 95% CI 0.87 to 2.76, p = 0.133 and 12.3%, HR: 1.15 95% CI 0.70 to 1.90, p = 0.580) and less readmission rates due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) than patients with type 1 MI (2.1%, HR: 0.11 95% CI 0.04 to 0.31, p < 0.001 and 4.3%, HR: 0.22 95% CI 0.12 to 0.41, p < 0.001), CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with type 2 MI and NIMI have higher rates of mortality and lower readmission rates for ACS compared with patients with type 1 MI.

### Application of the universal definition of myocardial infarction in clinical practice in scotland and Sweden [^116xBozu]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our findings raise another more fundamental question about the value of a diagnosis of type 2 MI in practice. The classification of any disease should inform the patient of their prognosis and guide the approach to treatment. Currently we lack evidence-based recommendations for management and treatment of patients with type 2 MI. While there is little doubt that patients with type 2 MI are at risk of major cardiovascular events, until there are well-defined management and treatment implications for patients with this condition, it is likely that clinicians will prioritize management of the primary presenting condition and be less likely to recognize type 2 MI in practice.

In Scotland, patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for type 1 MI but not classified as having MI in practice were more likely to be women or to be older. However, these observed differences were not independent of differences in other clinical features, suggesting that the presence of comorbidity or magnitude of troponin increase is more likely to influence clinical diagnosis than age and sex per se. Our observations are consistent with previous work demonstrating sex- and age-associated differences in diagnosis of MI, and underline the need to increase awareness to prevent inequalities in care.

Misclassified patients with type 1 and type 2 MI underwent fewer investigations and were less likely to receive preventative therapies. The risk of future MI or cardiovascular death was higher or as high in patients with type 1 MI who did not receive a diagnosis of MI in practice. While we observed that patients with type 1 MI who were not diagnosed with MI in practice in Scotland remained at higher risk after adjustment for risk factors, we did not observe this in Sweden. This may be a consequence of the reliability of the primary outcome measure between 2 cohorts. All subsequent events where patients reattended with evidence of myocardial injury were adjudicated in Scotland, while we relied on ICD-10 coding to identify events in Sweden. Variation could also be due to differences in the troponin assay, diagnostic pathway, application of sex-specific criteria or the use of cardiac investigations. In contrast, we observed that patients with type 2 MI who did not receive a clinical diagnosis of MI were at lower risk of future events than those recognized in practice in both countries. It appears that clinicians are more likely to use the term MI in the setting of myocardial oxygen supply demand mismatch if they recognize the patient to be at particularly high risk of future cardiovascular events.

### Cardiovascular biomarkers in the early discrimination of type 2 myocardial infarction [^1112ozjV]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Rapid and accurate noninvasive discrimination of type 2 myocardial infarction (T2MI), which is because of a supply-demand mismatch, from type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI), which arises via plaque rupture, is essential, because treatment differs substantially. Unfortunately, this is a major unmet clinical need, because even high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) measurement provides only modest accuracy.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that novel cardiovascular biomarkers quantifying different pathophysiological pathways involved in T2MI and/or T1MI may aid physicians in the rapid discrimination of T2MI vs T1MI.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This international, multicenter prospective diagnostic study was conducted in 12 emergency departments in 5 countries (Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Poland, and the Czech Republic) with patients presenting with acute chest discomfort to the emergency departments. The study quantified the discrimination of hs-cTn T, hs-cTn I, and 17 novel cardiovascular biomarkers measured in subsets of consecutively enrolled patients against a reference standard (final diagnosis), centrally adjudicated by 2 independent cardiologists according to the fourth universal definition of MI, using all information, including cardiac imaging and serial measurements of hs-cTnT or hs-cTnI.

Results

Among 5887 patients, 1106 (18.8%) had an adjudicated final diagnosis of MI; of these, 860 patients (77.8%) had T1MI, and 246 patients (22.2%) had T2MI. Patients with T2MI vs those with T1MI had lower concentrations of biomarkers quantifying cardiomyocyte injury hs-cTnT (median [interquartile range (IQR)], 30 (17–55) ng/L vs 58 (28–150) ng/L), hs-cTnI (median [IQR], 23 [10–83] ng/L vs 115 [28–576] ng/L; P < .001), and cardiac myosin-binding protein C (at presentation: median [IQR], 76 [38–189] ng/L vs 257 [75–876] ng/L; P < .001) but higher concentrations of biomarkers quantifying endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, and/or hemodynamic stress (median [IQR] values: C-terminal proendothelin 1, 97 [75–134] pmol/L vs 68 [55–91] pmol/L; midregional proadrenomedullin, 0.97 [0.67–1.51] pmol/L vs 0.72 [0.53–0.99] pmol/L; midregional pro-A-type natriuretic peptide, 378 [207–491] pmol/L vs 152 [90–247] pmol/L; and growth differentiation factor 15, 2.26 [1.44–4.35] vs 1.56 [1.02–2.19] ng/L; all P < .001). Discrimination for these biomarkers, as quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve, was modest (hs-cTnT, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.64–0.71]; hs-cTn I, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.67–0.74]; cardiac myosin-binding protein C, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.61–0.73]; C-terminal proendothelin 1, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.63–0.83]; midregional proadrenomedullin, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.60–0.73]; midregional pro-A-type natriuretic peptide, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.68–0.87]; and growth differentiation factor 15, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.58–0.79]).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, biomarkers quantifying myocardial injury, endothelial dysfunction, microvascular dysfunction, and/or hemodynamic stress provided modest discrimination in early, noninvasive diagnosis of T2MI.

Study Population

We identified patients coded as T2MI (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision [ICD‐10] code I21. A1) between October 2017 and May 2018 at Massachusetts General Hospital. Strict adjudication with physician chart reviewers using the fourth Universal Definition of MI was then applied to confirm or refute the diagnosis. To ensure consistency with the diagnoses, uncertain cases were reviewed by C.M.C. A cardiac troponin T concentration ≥ 0.03 ng/mL (10% coefficient of variation) or a fifth generation high sensitivity cardiac troponin T concentration of ≥ 10 ng/L for women or ≥ 15 ng/L for men were diagnostic of myocardial injury. An MI was defined as a rising and/or falling elevation in cardiac troponin (conventional or high sensitivity) > 99th percentile and at least one of the following: (1) symptoms of ischemia, (2) new electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia, (3) new pathological Q waves, (4) new regional wall motions on imaging in an ischemic territory, or (5) coronary thrombus on angiography. Symptoms suggestive of ischemia included chest pain consistent with angina or shortness of breath not otherwise attributed to a respiratory condition (Table S1). Electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia included new dynamic ST segment depressions or ST segment elevations or new T wave flattening or inversions (excluding leads III, aVR and V1 which may represent a normal variant). T2MI was defined as an MI with an identifiable preceding imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. Acute HF was considered a precipitant of T2MI when physiologic changes that could lead to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand were present, including hypoxia, tachycardia, hypotension, or hypertension.

### Prevalence, determinants, and clinical associations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin in patients attending emergency departments [^114CjiD3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the determinants of elevated cardiac troponin in consecutive patients Emergency Department patients without suspected acute coronary syndrome with several important strengths in the study design. We used a consecutive patient population attending the Emergency Department who underwent blood sampling to minimize selection bias. In comparison, previous studies have evaluated the frequency of type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury only in patients who had troponin testing clinically requested. We also used a clinically available high-sensitivity troponin I assay with excellent precision to measure cardiac troponin. This assay has superior analytical performance compared to previous generations of cardiac troponin assays with a limit of detection 10-fold lower than contemporary sensitive assays. Finally, to ensure robust follow-up of patients, we used comprehensive local and national death registries.

In our study, elevated cardiac troponin concentration was common in patients without suspected acute coronary syndrome in whom troponin testing was not requested by the attending clinician. Age and admission physiology were the strongest independent factors associated with elevated troponin concentrations. Although elevated cardiac troponins are specific for indicating damage to the myocardium, they are not specific for the etiology of injury. As such, many acute and chronic pathological conditions are associated with elevated cardiac troponins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, elevated cardiac troponin concentrations are common in a critical-care setting, and likely to be secondary to multiple mechanisms. Potential mechanisms of injury include direct toxicity, hemodynamic compromise, and, in some cases, increased thrombogenicity precipitating a type 1 myocardial infarction. Myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance is a major factor in the critically ill, and both hypotension and increased metabolic demand are correlated with troponin concentrations. In addition, elevated cardiac troponin are also associated with inflammatory cytokines that may cause direct myocardial toxicity.

### Use and misuse of cardiac troponins in clinical practice [^111oq5Sx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins are very sensitive and specific markers of myocardial injury. Elevated troponin levels in the setting of acute coronary syndrome are diagnostic of acute myocardial infarction and provide guidance to clinicians with regard to appropriate use of intensive medical and revascularization therapies. However, elevated troponin levels are commonly seen in several noncoronary ischemia presentations and create considerable confusion among clinicians in these settings. In this review article, we discuss the utility of troponins in various clinical settings and present a "common sense" approach to interpreting troponin elevation outside the setting of acute coronary syndrome.

Key Points for Practice
- The term myocardial injury should be used to describe at least one increased cardiac troponin level greater than the 99th percentile upper reference limit.
- The term acute MI should be used to describe an acute myocardial injury in the presence of suspected acute myocardial ischemia. The term acute MI should be used to describe an acute myocardial injury in the presence of suspected acute myocardial ischemia; fluctuation in cardiac troponin levels, at least one of which should be greater than the 99th percentile; and at least one of the following: myocardial ischemia symptoms, new ischemic changes or pathologic Q waves identified on ECG, imaging results suggesting loss of myocardium or wall motion abnormalities that are ischemic in nature, or coronary thrombus identified on angiography.

Temporary myocardial injury that occurs as a result of revascularization procedures is called procedural myocardial injury. In patients with a healthy baseline cardiac troponin level, procedural myocardial injury can be diagnosed when there is an increased cardiac troponin level. In patients with a baseline troponin level greater than the 99th percentile, procedural myocardial injury can be diagnosed when there is an increase in cardiac troponin levels of more than 20% of the patient's baseline, but levels subsequently remain stable or decrease. Isolated Q waves can meet the criteria if the troponin level is less than 10 times the 99th percentile, as long as the levels are elevated and rising. The term MI with nonobstructive coronary arteries should be used to describe patients with MI but no angiographic findings of obstructive coronary artery disease.

Similar to MI, diagnosis of this condition, which has a prevalence of up to 8%, suggests an ischemic cause of the injury. Increased cardiac troponin levels are a common occurrence in patients in the intensive care unit. Increased cardiac troponin levels in the presence of decreased ejection fraction can occur because of sepsis caused by endotoxin; once appropriately treated, myocardial function will return to normal. After recovery, physicians should use their best judgment regarding further assessment for coronary artery disease or structural heart disease.

### Troponin concentrations, systolic and diastolic functions, and incident heart failure association… [^113J4CWj]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the association between high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T concentrations, left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions, and risk of heart failure. Findings In this analysis of a cohort of 4111 participants without cardiovascular disease, a greater concentration of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T was associated with worse diastolic function but not with systolic function, independent of left ventricular mass. Left ventricular diastolic function accounted for a substantial proportion of the heart failure risk, and preserved ejection fraction was associated with greater high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T concentrations. Meaning This study suggests that elevated troponin concentrations may serve as an early marker of subclinical alterations in cardiac structure and diastolic function that predispose a person to developing heart failure. Importance Cardiac troponin is associated with incident heart failure and greater left ventricular mass.

Its association with LV systolic and diastolic functions is unclear. Incident heart failure occurred in 114 participants during the mean 4. 5 years of follow-up after visit
5. These findings were consistent for incident HFmrEF or HFrEF. However, elevated troponin only appeared associated with incident HFpEF among those with concomitant diastolic dysfunction. These results were consistent when also adjusting for LV mass index and when using guideline-recommended cutoffs for diastolic dysfunction. Associations were attenuated when also adjusting for NT-proBNP, particularly for incident HFrEF, but remained consistent and statistically significant for incident heart failure overall and incident HFpEF. elevated LV filling pressures and subendocardial ischemia from impaired myocardial oxygen supply-demand balance are 2 factors in troponin elevation in HFpEF.

30 The lack of serial echocardiography in the present study precludes the identification of the temporal association between troponin elevation and diastolic dysfunction, but our findings suggest that these observations extend to older adults without, but are at risk of, HFpEF. Alterations in diastolic function accounted for a sizeable proportion of the association between hs-cTnT level and incident HFpEF in this analysis. The mechanisms linking diastolic dysfunction to elevated troponin and driving oxygen supply-demand mismatch are likely multifold.
