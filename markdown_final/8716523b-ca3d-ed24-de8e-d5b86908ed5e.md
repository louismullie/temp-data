## Question

Is it bad to take baby aspirin prophylacticly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is "bad" to take baby aspirin prophylactically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "baby aspirin" means and the clinical contexts where prophylaxis is relevant. Then, I should verify the distinction between primary cardiovascular prevention, preeclampsia prevention in pregnancy, and secondary cardiovascular prevention. Next, I will review benefits and harms by context, align with guideline positions, and finally synthesize a practical, risk-stratified answer with dosing and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and scope. "Baby aspirin" refers to low-dose aspirin, typically 75–100 mg daily, most commonly 81 mg in the U.S., and "prophylactically" here implies primary prevention rather than treatment of established disease; I need to ensure I'm not conflating this with secondary prevention, where aspirin is broadly indicated after events like MI or stroke [^c3952759] [^3683529d].

> Now, I should distinguish the main scenarios. Primary cardiovascular disease prevention in adults without established CVD is the most debated, preeclampsia prevention in pregnancy is a distinct, evidence-supported indication, and secondary CVD prevention is a separate question where aspirin is generally beneficial; I need to keep these buckets separate to avoid overgeneralization [^42288971] [^473466e2] [^3683529d].

> For primary CVD prevention, let me verify the balance of benefits and harms. The USPSTF concludes that for adults 40–59 years with a 10-year CVD risk ≥ 10%, the net benefit is small and decisions should be individualized, whereas for adults 60 years or older, initiating aspirin has no net benefit and is discouraged; ACC/AHA similarly advises considering low-dose aspirin only in select higher-risk adults 40–70 years who are not at increased bleeding risk, and to avoid routine use in those over 70 or with bleeding risk factors [^42288971] [^fc023f96] [^2ad05700] [^593397cc].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit and harm so I don't understate the tradeoff. Pooled RCTs show a modest reduction in nonfatal MI and ischemic stroke with low-dose aspirin, but a 58% relative increase in major GI bleeding and a 31% relative increase in intracranial bleeding; importantly, the absolute benefit is small and the absolute harm rises with age, which is why guidelines tilt against routine use in older adults or those with bleeding risks [^2a1d43eb] [^60dcaf8d] [^7d94646d].

> Hold on, I should verify whether cancer prevention changes the calculus. Earlier USPSTF guidance suggested potential colorectal cancer benefit with long-term aspirin in specific 50–59-year-olds, but the 2022 update found inadequate evidence that aspirin reduces CRC incidence or mortality in primary CVD prevention populations, so CRC considerations should not override bleeding risk in routine primary prevention decisions [^fa93a606] [^0a4c1e0d].

> Next, I will examine pregnancy-specific prophylaxis. For preeclampsia prevention, multiple high-quality guidelines recommend low-dose aspirin (commonly 81 mg/day, with some guidance allowing 100–150 mg/day) initiated after 12 weeks' gestation in those at high or moderate risk; benefits include reduced preeclampsia, preterm birth, growth restriction, and perinatal mortality without clear increase in postpartum hemorrhage, so in this context prophylactic aspirin is not "bad" but beneficial when appropriately indicated [^473466e2] [^ff2e1a0d] [^9c262fcd] [^8ee71f8f] [^9b5c36f3].

> I should double-check dosing nuances in pregnancy. While 81 mg is standard in the U.S., some international guidelines prefer 100–150 mg, and a recent large cohort suggests no difference in preeclampsia or bleeding between 150–160 mg and 75 mg, indicating either dose may be reasonable; nonetheless, most U.S. guidance still anchors to 81 mg pending definitive dose-comparison trials [^ff6d3010] [^473466e2] [^9c262fcd].

> But wait, what if someone is already on aspirin for secondary prevention? I need to ensure I don't advise stopping it. In established CVD, aspirin reduces recurrent events and mortality, and the balance favors continuation unless bleeding risk is prohibitive; stopping aspirin after an event increases risk, so in secondary prevention, prophylactic aspirin is appropriate and often essential [^3683529d] [^9e88b05c].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases. In diabetes, contemporary trials like ASCEND show fewer serious vascular events but more major bleeding, reinforcing individualized decisions rather than routine aspirin; in antiphospholipid antibody carriers with high-risk profiles, EULAR suggests prophylactic aspirin, but this is outside standard primary CVD prevention and requires rheumatology input; in adults under 40, evidence is insufficient for routine primary prevention with aspirin [^da4688ce] [^5d66e253] [^a84b21db].

> I should confirm practical safety steps if aspirin is used. Use the lowest effective dose (usually 81 mg), assess bleeding risk factors (age, GI history, anticoagulants, NSAIDs, steroids, CKD, thrombocytopenia), and consider H. pylori testing and eradication in those with ulcer risk; if aspirin is indicated but GI risk is present, co-prescribe a PPI to mitigate bleeding risk [^c3952759] [^7d94646d] [^7612f077] [^51ca37ff].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the answer is context-specific. For primary CVD prevention in adults without CVD, prophylactic "baby aspirin" is not inherently "bad", but for most people the small cardiovascular benefit is outweighed by bleeding risk, especially after age 60; therefore, routine use is not recommended and decisions should be individualized for carefully selected 40–59-year-olds at ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk with low bleeding risk. In contrast, for preeclampsia prevention in appropriately selected pregnant patients, prophylactic low-dose aspirin is beneficial and should be recommended, so in that context it is not "bad" at all [^42288971] [^fc023f96] [^473466e2] [^ff2e1a0d].

---

Routine prophylactic baby aspirin (75–100 mg/day) is **not recommended for most people** because the small reduction in cardiovascular events is offset by increased risks of major gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding [^42288971] [^60dcaf8d]. It may be considered only for **select adults aged 40–70 years** at high cardiovascular risk and low bleeding risk, after shared decision-making [^2ad05700] [^4c5b8280]. It is **not advised for primary prevention in adults ≥ 60 years**, those with increased bleeding risk, or for cancer prevention [^42288971] [^fa93a606]. For pregnancy, low-dose aspirin is recommended for preeclampsia prevention in high-risk patients, but not for routine use in all pregnant women [^473466e2] [^99a2cb6e].

---

## Benefits of prophylactic baby aspirin

Prophylactic baby aspirin offers **modest cardiovascular benefits** in specific populations:

- **Reduction in cardiovascular events**: Low-dose aspirin reduces nonfatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke in adults aged 40–59 years with a ≥ 10% 10-year cardiovascular risk [^2a1d43eb] [^42288971].

- **Preeclampsia prevention**: Low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) initiated after 12 weeks of gestation significantly reduces the risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth, and perinatal mortality in high-risk pregnant individuals [^473466e2] [^ff2e1a0d].

- **Colorectal cancer**: Long-term use may reduce colorectal cancer incidence, but benefits are not seen until after 10 years and are offset by bleeding risks [^0a4c1e0d] [^95c29328].

---

## Risks associated with prophylactic baby aspirin

Prophylactic baby aspirin carries **significant risks**, particularly of bleeding:

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: Low-dose aspirin increases the risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding by 58% (Peto OR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.38–1.80]) [^60dcaf8d].

- **Intracranial hemorrhage**: Aspirin use is associated with a 31% increase in intracranial hemorrhage (Peto OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.11–1.54]) [^60dcaf8d].

- **Hemorrhagic stroke**: Increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke, particularly in older adults [^7d94646d].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Population** | **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Adults aged 40–59 years with ≥ 10% 10-year CVD risk | Individualized decision; small net benefit | Grade C [^42288971] |
| Adults aged ≥ 60 years | Do not initiate aspirin for primary prevention | Grade D [^42288971] |
| High-risk pregnant individuals (preeclampsia prevention) | Recommended (81 mg/day after 12 weeks) | Grade B [^473466e2] |
| General population for cancer prevention | Not recommended due to bleeding risk | Grade D [^fa93a606] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Age**: Bleeding risk increases significantly with age, particularly in adults ≥ 60 years [^7d94646d].

- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, hypertension, gastrointestinal ulcers, and chronic kidney disease increase bleeding risk [^7d94646d].

- **Drug interactions**: Concurrent use of NSAIDs, anticoagulants, or corticosteroids increases bleeding risk [^7d94646d].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Prophylactic baby aspirin is **not recommended for routine use** in the general population due to the balance of modest benefits and significant bleeding risks [^42288971]. It may be considered for select adults aged 40–70 years at high cardiovascular risk and low bleeding risk, after shared decision-making [^2ad05700]. It is **not recommended for primary prevention in adults ≥ 60 years**, those with increased bleeding risk, or for cancer prevention [^42288971] [^fa93a606]. For pregnancy, low-dose aspirin is recommended for preeclampsia prevention in high-risk patients, but not for routine use in all pregnant women [^473466e2] [^99a2cb6e].

### USPSTF report on aspirin for primary prevention… [^ef4b9906]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

As with many therapies in modern medicine, aspirin for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is neither all good nor all bad. Specifically, aspirin may benefit selected patients, but that comes at the price of a narrower therapeutic window than desirable because of the risks of major bleeding, particularly intracranial and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Bolstered by favorable results in tertiary and secondary ASCVD prevention trials in the 1980s, the early trials of aspirin in primary prevention also appeared favorable. For example, in the Physicians' Health Study of men, treatment with 325 mg of aspirin every other day reduced myocardial infarction incidence by 44%. More importantly, this represented differential rates of MI of 0. 25% per year in the aspirin group vs
0. 44% in the placebo group, for a 5-year difference of 0. 93% and a number needed to treat for 5 years of approximately 100 to prevent 1 MI.

1 A subsequent trial in women health care professionals2 demonstrated no significant benefit for major cardiovascular disease events but demonstrated a significant reduction in ischemic stroke. In both trials and others, there were signals of small absolute increases in risk for major bleeding. Countless meta-analyses of the many early trials saw the pendulum swing back and forth on aspirin benefits and harms, with most guidelines favoring use of aspirin in higher-risk primary prevention patients who had no elevated risk of bleeding.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^99a2cb6e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 743 — low-dose aspirin prophylaxis during pregnancy recommendations state that low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) prophylaxis is recommended in women at high risk of preeclampsia and should be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for women with more than one of several moderate risk factors for preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis is not recommended solely for the indication of prior unexplained stillbirth, in the absence of risk factors for preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis is not recommended for prevention of fetal growth restriction, in the absence of risk factors for preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis is not recommended for the prevention of spontaneous preterm birth, in the absence of risk factors for preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis is not recommended for the prevention of early pregnancy loss.

### Low-dose aspirin in primary prevention: cardioprotection, chemoprevention, both, or neither? [^b2ea0e2a]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been shown to be effective in preventing about one-fifth of atherothrombotic vascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death) in a meta-analysis of 16 secondary prevention trials in patients with previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient cerebral ischaemia. This corresponds to an absolute reduction of about 10–20 per 1000 patients in the yearly incidence of non-fatal events, and to a smaller, but still definite, reduction in vascular death. Against this benefit, the absolute increase in major extracranial bleeding complications [mostly, gastrointestinal (GI)] is 20- to 50-fold smaller, depending on age and sex. Hence, for secondary prevention, the benefits of antiplatelet therapy substantially exceed the risks. For primary prevention, the balance between vascular events avoided and major bleeds caused by aspirin is substantially uncertain because the risks without aspirin, and hence the absolute benefits of antiplatelet prophylaxis, are at least an order of magnitude lower than in secondary prevention. The aim of this article is to review the updated evidence for the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention and to discuss additional health benefits resulting from prolonged antiplatelet therapy in apparently healthy people at low average risk of vascular events.

### 2019 ACC / AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^4c5b8280]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — aspirin prophylaxis recommendations and dosing — In recent trials, the estimated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk has exceeded observed risk during follow-up, supporting a lower class of recommendation with removal of a specific PCE threshold; accordingly, a Class IIb recommendation remains more suitable than a Class III recommendation for adults 40 to 70 years of age. Given the narrow balance of benefits and harms, there is limited justification to use aspirin at doses > 100 mg daily for primary prevention; meta-analyses suggest the ASCVD risk benefit for low-dose aspirin is equivalent to that for high-dose aspirin, but the bleeding risk is higher with high-dose aspirin, and low-dose prophylactic aspirin may be best justified among persons at high ASCVD risk who cannot achieve optimal control of other ASCVD risk factors.

### Low-dose aspirin use for the prevention of preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality [^ed63d2f1]. ACOG (2021). High credibility.

Implementation considerations for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis — risk-based offering and potential universal use are outlined as follows: "Evidence supports the use of a risk-based approach to determine whether low-dose aspirin should be offered to a pregnant individual," and "It is therefore imperative that obstetrician–gynecologists and other obstetric clinicians implement adequate screening processes to determine the appropriate risk category for a pregnant individual." The document notes that "for some institutions and practices, the majority of patients may be at high or moderate risk for preeclampsia and would therefore be candidates for low-dose aspirin prophylaxis," and "In these instances, universal implementation (eg, offering low-dose aspirin to all patients within such practices or institutions) may be medically reasonable." It further states, "This Practice Advisory serves as an interim update to all of ACOG's and SMFM's guidance and materials regarding low-dose aspirin prophylaxis for the prevention of preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality."

### ACOG committee opinion no. 743: low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy [^3032c019]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Low-dose aspirin use during pregnancy — indications, timing, safety, and risk definition are summarized as follows: Low-dose aspirin has been used during pregnancy, most commonly to prevent or delay the onset of preeclampsia, and daily low-dose aspirin use in pregnancy is considered safe and is associated with a low likelihood of serious maternal, or fetal complications, or both, related to use. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) prophylaxis is recommended in women at high risk of preeclampsia and should be initiated between 12 weeks and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery. Women at risk of preeclampsia are defined based on the presence of one or more high-risk factors or more than one of several moderate-risk factors, including first pregnancy, maternal age of 35 years or older, and a body mass index greater than 30. In the absence of high risk factors for preeclampsia, current evidence does not support the use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin for the prevention of early pregnancy loss, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, or preterm birth. Prior guidance recommended daily low-dose aspirin beginning in the late first trimester for women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and preterm delivery at less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, or for women with more than one prior pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia.

Regarding preventative measures for preeclampsia, more specifically with respect to low-dose aspirin, general principles, SOGC 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate low-dose aspirin of 81–162 mg/day,
preferably before 16 weeks of gestation,
taken at bedtime,
and discontinued by 36 weeks of gestation, in patients at increased risk of preeclampsia.
Do not use low-dose aspirin in all other females.

### Aspirin and cancer [^f41e1d1e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The place of aspirin in primary prevention remains controversial, with North American and European organizations issuing contradictory treatment guidelines. More recently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended "initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years". This recommendation reflects increasing evidence for a chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin against colorectal (and other) cancer. The intent of this paper is to review the evidence supporting a chemopreventive effect of aspirin, discuss its potential mechanism(s) of action, and provide a conceptual framework for assessing current guidelines in the light of ongoing studies.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^b5ba2181]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The lowest effective daily dose of aspirin for long-term antiplatelet prophylaxis ranges between 50 and 100 mg, with no evidence that higher doses are more effective, consistent with saturability of platelet COX-1 inactivation at low doses. This evidence is based on indirect comparisons of RCTs employing different aspirin dosing regimens, as well as on a limited number of head-to-head randomized comparisons of a lower vs. a higher dose, both in acute coronary syndromesand stable patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

There is also no convincing evidence that the dose requirement for the antithrombotic effect of aspirin varies in different clinical settings or as a function of body weight. Similarly, there is no evidence that the effect of aspirin on major vascular events is influenced by gender, age, concomitant treatments, or primary vs. secondary prevention. In the ASPREE trial involving 19 114 healthy elderly persons (median age, 74 years) who did not have known cardiovascular disease (CVD), the use of low-dose aspirin did not result in a significantly lower risk of CVD than placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83–1.08]. However, the widely cited message from ASPREE that low-dose aspirin is ineffective in old age is potentially misleading, for the following reasons: (i) CVD was not the primary endpoint of ASPREE; (ii) CVD, a pre-specified secondary endpoint, was a composite of platelet-dependent as well as platelet-independent events, i.e. fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, fatal or non-fatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure; and (iii) when the analysis was restricted to a traditional composite of fatal coronary heart disease, non-fatal MI, or fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke, the rate of this endpoint was 7.8 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 8.8 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (HR 0.89; 95% CI 0.77–1.03). Such a moderate treatment effect is identical to that reported for younger subjects (< 65 years) in a setting of primary prevention, an effect that ASPREE failed to detect as statistically significant in a population at low cardiovascular risk (< 1.0% per year) because it was largely underpowered. Despite serious limitations, these results were published as a separate, stand-alone paper in the New England Journal of Medicine and named as one of the 12 'game changers' of 2018.

Guideline background — indications and timing across organizations — states that the Hypertension in Pregnancy Task Force Report recommended daily low-dose aspirin beginning in the late first trimester for women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and preterm delivery at less than 34 0/7 weeks of gestation, or for women with more than one prior pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia; the World Health Organization recommended low-dose aspirin (75 mg/day) initiated before 20 weeks of gestation for women at high risk; the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence asked providers to prescribe low-dose aspirin (75 mg/day) to be taken daily from 12 weeks of gestation until birth for pregnant women at increased risk; and the USPSTF guideline suggested that low-dose aspirin be considered in women with "several" moderate risk factors for preeclampsia.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^bbc7c0ce]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality.1 For example, in 2000, it accounted directly for around 2 million deaths in the European Union. Worldwide, many people take aspirin daily in the belief that doing so helps to prevent CVD. This approach is established for the secondary prevention of recurrent vascular events. However, there has been some uncertainty about the place of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events.6 In particular, there have been doubts about whether any benefits of aspirin in people with no history of CVD outweigh the risks (e.g. the fact that long-term low-dose aspirin therapy almost doubles the likelihood of gastrointestinal haemorrhage). Here we consider the place of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention of CVD.

### Low-dose aspirin use for the prevention of morbidity and mortality from preeclampsia: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^a1ed0488]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 1996 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on aspirin prophylaxis in pregnancy.

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in preventing preeclampsia in women at increased risk and in decreasing adverse maternal and perinatal health outcomes, and assessed the maternal and fetal harms of low-dose aspirin during pregnancy.

Population

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic pregnant women who are at increased risk for preeclampsia and who have no prior adverse effects with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication after 12 weeks of gestation in women who are at high risk for preeclampsia. (B recommendation).

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^3ff23623]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — The ACC/AHA recommends that low-dose aspirin use (75 to 100 mg/d) might be considered for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years at higher CVD risk but not at increased risk of bleeding. Low-dose aspirin use is not recommended on a routine basis for primary prevention of CVD in adults older than 70 years or among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding. The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^42288971]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: For adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use should be an individual one; evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small, and persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit (C recommendation). For adults 60 years or older, the USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD (D recommendation). The target population is adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD who are not at increased risk for bleeding. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit, and concludes with moderate certainty that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit.

Recommendations of others — low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) prophylaxis for persons at high risk of preeclampsia. Low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be initiated between 12 and 28 weeks of gestation (optimally before 16 weeks) and continued daily until delivery. Additionally, low-dose aspirin prophylaxis should be considered for individuals with more than 1 of several moderate-risk factors for preeclampsia.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in women [^87cfa871]. Menopause (2023). Medium credibility.

Aspirin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is controversial. Low-dose aspirin may be considered for primary prevention in women on an individualized basis for those aged 40 to 59 years with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 10% or more and without increased bleeding risk. Low-dose aspirin for primary prevention is not advised for low-risk women or women aged 60 years or older.

### Aspirin dosage for preeclampsia prophylaxis: an argument for 81-mg dosing [^04f6e90e]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Research conducted over the past few decades has shown that low-dose aspirin can effectively reduce the risk of developing preeclampsia. Consequently, numerous prominent organizations have adopted the recommendation to use low-dose aspirin during pregnancy to prevent preeclampsia. However, the optimal dosage of low-dose aspirin (81mg versus 162mg) remains a subject of debate. Currently, there is insufficient high-quality data to justify the use of a higher dosage of low-dose aspirin. In this review, we review the existing evidence that supports the continued use of 81mg of aspirin over a higher dose and emphasize the need for high-quality research to alter current recommendations.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends initiation of 81 mg of aspirin daily for women at risk of preeclampsia between 12 and 28 weeks' gestation, optimally before 16 weeks, with continuation until delivery. The World Health Organization recommends that 75 mg of aspirin should be initiated before 20 weeks of gestation for women at high risk of preeclampsia. Both the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence quality statement on "Antenatal Assessment of Pre-eclampsia Risk" request that healthcare providers prescribe low-dose aspirin to pregnant women at increased risk of preeclampsia daily from 12 weeks of gestation. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends 150 mg of aspirin daily, and the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence guidelines suggest risk stratification with a dosage of 75 mg for those at moderate risk of preeclampsia and 150 mg for those at high risk of preeclampsia. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics initiative on preeclampsia recommends 150 mg of aspirin to be initiated at 11 to 14+6 week's gestation and also proposes that 2 tablets of 81 mg is an acceptable alternative. Review of the available evidence suggests that both the dosage and timing of aspirin initiation is key to its effectiveness at reducing the risk of preeclampsia. Doses of > 100 mg of aspirin daily initiated before 16 weeks' gestation seem to be most effective at reducing the risk of preeclampsia and thus dosages recommended by most major societies and organizations may not be effective. Randomized control trials examining 81 mg vs 162 mg of aspirin daily for the prevention of preeclampsia are required to assess the safety and efficacy of aspirin dosages available in the United States.

### Should we recommend universal aspirin for all pregnant women? [^11f6f6c2]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Low-dose aspirin has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction in at-risk populations. Its role in low-risk populations is as yet unknown. Novel preeclampsia screening tests are emerging that can predict the risk of the development of preeclampsia from as early as 11 weeks of gestation. It may be more efficacious, acceptable, and cost-effective to prescribe low-dose aspirin to all pregnant women from the first trimester as opposed to performing a screening test in the first instance. There is variation in opinion: the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists suggests the use of aspirin only in women who are at risk of preeclampsia, based on patient history; the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, UK, and the US Preventative Services Task Force recommend the use of low-dose aspirin if there is 1 major or 2 moderate risk factors. This point-counterpoint discussion shall address (1) controversies regarding the real impact of low-dose aspirin; (2) controversies in the actual guidelines among the different national societies; (3) controversies regarding emerging preeclampsia screening tests in terms of cost-effectiveness and efficacy, and (4) points in favor of the provision of universal vs screened-positive women.

Harms of preventive medication — low-dose aspirin (≤ 100 mg/d) bleeding risks: Across CVD primary prevention trials, "The USPSTF reviewed 14 RCTs." For low-dose aspirin, a pooled analysis of "10 trials (n = 119 130)" found a "58% increase in major gastrointestinal bleeding (Peto OR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.38–1.80])," and "a pooled analysis of 11 trials (n = 134 470) showed an increase in intracranial bleeds" (Peto OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.11–1.54]). Low-dose aspirin "was not associated with a statistically significant increase in risk of fatal hemorrhagic stroke." Bleeding "occurs relatively quickly after initiating aspirin," with no differential relative bleeding risk by "age, sex, presence of diabetes, level of CVD risk, or race or ethnicity," but "the absolute incidence of bleeding… increases with age, and more so in adults 60 years or older."

### Current approaches to reducing gastrointestinal toxicity of low-dose aspirin [^51ca37ff]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Use of low-dose aspirin is associated with gastroduodenal mucosal damage and increased risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Many patients on low-dose aspirin should receive prophylactic treatment, because they often present several risk factors that may lead to upper GI complications in nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) users. It is reasonable to assume that effective therapy (e.g., omeprazole, misoprostol, and high-dose famotidine) in the prevention of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal ulcers will also be effective in this setting. However, the best therapeutic approach to reducing GI toxicity in low-dose aspirin users is not defined, because only a few studies have focused on this problem. Omeprazole seems very effective in reducing both acute gastroduodenal mucosal damage and upper GI bleeding in the high-risk patient taking low-dose aspirin, but data with other antiulcer agents are lacking (misoprostol) or inconsistent (ranitidine) at present. No data are available on the effect of these drugs on dyspepsia or chronic gastroduodenal ulcers in the long-term use of low-dose aspirin. The role of Helicobacter pylori is controversial, but it may increase mucosal damage and the risk of upper GI bleeding in these patients. More data are needed to define the best therapeutic regimen in patients taking low-dose aspirin.

### USPSTF recommendation: aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease… [^068f2815]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit. The USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. In addition to age and estimated level of CVD risk, decisions about initiating aspirin use should be based on shared decision-making between clinicians and patients about the potential benefits and harms.

Persons who place a higher value on the potential benefits than the potential harms may choose to initiate low-dose aspirin use. Persons who place a higher value on the potential harms or the burden of taking a daily preventive medication than on the potential benefits may choose not to initiate low-dose aspirin use. This recommendation replaces the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use to prevent CVD and CRC. 23 In 2016, the USPSTF recommended initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10. For the current recommendation, the USPSTF has changed the age ranges and grades of its recommendation on aspirin use.

The USPSTF recommends that the decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one and recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. The ACC/AHA recommends that low-dose aspirin use might be considered for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years at higher CVD risk but not at increased risk of bleeding. Low-dose aspirin use is not recommended on a routine basis for primary prevention of CVD in adults older than 70 years or among adults of any age who are at increased risk of bleeding. 35 The American Academy of Family Physicians supports the 2016 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use. 36.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^9b7ca460]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

During the past 30years, several developments have occurred in the antiplatelet field, including the role of aspirin in primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. There have been several attempts to develop antiplatelet drugs more effective and safer than aspirin and a shift in emphasis from efficacy to safety, advocating aspirin-free antiplatelet regimens after percutaneous coronary intervention. Evidence supporting a chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin against colorectal (and other digestive tract) cancer has also strengthened. The aim of this article is to revisit the role of aspirin in the prevention of atherothrombosis across the cardiovascular risk continuum, in view of developments in the antiplatelet field. The review will offer a clinical perspective on aspirin's mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. This will be followed by a detailed discussion of its clinical efficacy and safety.

### Benefit-harm analysis and charts for individualized and preference-sensitive prevention: example of low dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer [^9d8b85b6]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There are reasons for such disagreement among guidelines. Although many guidelines are now based on systematic reviews, few guideline developers use quantitative methods to estimate the benefit-harm balance of interventions. Also, drawing conclusions and issuing population-level recommendations just based on systematic reviews are problematic for some clinical questions, such as aspirin for cardiovascular primary prevention, because population-level recommendations are based on average outcome risks and do not reflect preferences of individuals, which may lead to over- and undertreatment. This may contribute to the generally rather low adherence to guidelines, along with other factors that make the transfer of knowledge into practice challenging.

Compared to guidelines that make recommendations for entire populations, would it not be preferable to have treatment recommendations that are individualized through a patient's own risks and preferences? And would it not be preferable to have more holistic guidelines on preventative measures that have an impact on more than one disease?

Typically, recommendations are organized separately by disease or medical specialty, and the USPSTF is currently developing or updating its three (separate) guidelines on aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular, disease, colorectal cancer, and other cancers. Some have already argued that it may be time to move to guidelines that span across different diseases, which may be prevented by a common preventative measure such as aspirin. To address these two limitations, our aim was to conduct benefit-harm analyses for a wide range of individuals using the example of low dose aspirin for primary prevention of CVD and cancer and to develop Benefit-Harm Charts that show the overall benefit-harm balance for individuals.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Aspirin prophylaxis in pregnancy — preeclampsia and perinatal outcomes — shows that daily low-dose aspirin taken after 12 weeks' gestation significantly reduced preeclampsia risk in moderate- or high-risk individuals versus placebo (pooled relative risk: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75–0.95]). Aspirin use was also associated with significantly reduced risk for preterm birth, small-for-gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at increased risk for preeclampsia without increases in risk of postpartum hemorrhage, and only individuals with no prior adverse events or allergy to aspirin should be advised to take low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention.

Regarding preventative measures for preeclampsia, more specifically with respect to low-dose aspirin, general principles, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate low-dose aspirin (100–150 mg at bedtime for weeks 11–35) in pregnant patients at high or moderate risk of preeclampsia.

### Low-dose aspirin for the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^743fc69c]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

The apparent numerical difference in relative risk reductions observed in primary (typically, 10% to 12% reduction) and secondary (typically, 20% to 25% reduction) prevention trials is most likely explained by the much longer duration of the former (6.9 years) than the latter (2.5 years)and time-dependent loss of compliance with trial medication.

Strengths of the evidence for the antithrombotic efficacy of low-dose aspirin are related to the number, sample size, and duration of placebo-controlled RCTs across the whole spectrum of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Potential limitations are represented by the time frame over which this evidence accumulated, prior to the development of coronary revascularization and other pharmacological preventive strategies (e.g. statins). Such improvements in treatment and prevention would be expected to reduce the baseline risk of serious vascular events and therefore the absolute benefits of aspirin addition. However, revascularization and statin therapy are unlikely to modify the relative risk reduction associated with aspirin use, if its benefits are additive to those of other strategies, as would be expected by their different mechanisms of action.

Although the use of oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists) has been abandoned in primary cardiovascular prevention due to lack of a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio, the indications for aspirin use in this setting continue to be a source of major debate, with major international guidelines providing conflicting recommendations. Here, we review the evidence in favor and against aspirin therapy in primary prevention based on the evidence accumulated so far, including recent data linking aspirin with cancer protection. While awaiting the results of several ongoing studies, we argue for a pragmatic approach to using low-dose aspirin in primary cardiovascular prevention and suggest its use in patients at high cardiovascular risk, defined as ≥ 2 major cardiovascular events (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) projected per 100 person-years, who are not at increased risk of bleeding.

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^f4919421]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Aspirin is an antiplatelet therapy drug and has been shown to protect against atherothrombosis while increasing the risk of major bleeding.
The recent United States Preventive Services Task Force guidelines on aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease reflect this clinical tradeoff as well as the persistent struggle to define a population that would benefit from prophylactic aspirin therapy.
Reliable methods for quantifying platelet activity, including light transmission aggregometry and platelet transcriptomics, could be considered to identify individuals at elevated (platelet mediated) cardiovascular risk.
Clinical studies are needed to investigate whether a platelet-guided precision-based medicine approach will identify individuals who will benefit (eg, benefit > risk) with aspirin for the prevention of a first heart attack or stroke.

In October 2021, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a draft statement updating its guidelines on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The USPSTF recommends the following: (1) low-dose aspirin should not be initiated for primary prevention in individuals ages 60 years or older, and (2) initiation of low-dose aspirin should be considered on an individualized basis in adults aged 40 to 59 years with a 10-year CVD risk of ≥ 10%. With the update, the USPSTF no longer recommends routine aspirin prescription for primary CVD prevention in any population, a position consistent with the most recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology. The shift reflects a longstanding struggle to identify a population in which aspirin's clinical benefit for primary CVD prevention exceeds its bleeding risk.

Supporting evidence — benefits of preventive medication reports 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 161 680 participants; most trials used low-dose aspirin of 100 mg/d or less or aspirin every other day, with mean ages ranging from 53 years to 74 years. In pooled analyses of low-dose aspirin, decreased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction was observed (Peto odds ratio [OR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.80–0.96]) across 11 trials (n = 134 470) and decreased risk of nonfatal ischemic stroke (Peto OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.78–1.00]) across 5 trials (n = 54 947). Low-dose aspirin was not associated with statistically significant effects on fatal myocardial infarction, fatal stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or all-cause mortality at 3.6 to 10.1 years of follow-up, and although evidence does not suggest that the relative effect is modified by baseline CVD risk, the absolute magnitude of the benefit is greater in persons at higher CVD risk.

### Would you recommend aspirin to this patient for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^40b3e751]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States. Reducing ASCVD risk through primary prevention strategies has been shown to be effective; however, the role of aspirin in primary prevention remains unclear. The decision to recommend aspirin has been limited by the difficulty clinicians and patients face when trying to balance benefits and harms. In 2016, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force addressed this issue by determining the risk level at which prophylactic aspirin generally becomes more favorable, recommending aspirin above a risk cut point (> 10% estimated ASCVD risk). In 2019, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued a guideline on the primary prevention of CVD that recommends low-dose aspirin might be considered for the primary prevention of ASCVD among select adults aged 40 to 70 years who are at higher ASCVD risk but not at increased risk for bleeding. Here, 2 experts discuss how to apply this guideline in general and to a patient in particular while answering the following questions: How do you assess ASCVD risk, and what is the role, if any, of the coronary artery calcium score?; At what risk threshold of benefits and harms would you recommend aspirin or not?; and How do you help a patient come to a decision about starting or stopping aspirin therapy?

### Role of aspirin in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^da4688ce]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The benefits of aspirin therapy for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease clearly outweigh the risks of bleeding, and low-dose aspirin is uniformly recommended in this setting. However, no clear consensus exists about whether, and if so in whom, aspirin therapy is appropriate for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Three trials of low-dose aspirin versus placebo in three populations at increased risk of myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke in the absence of established cardiovascular disease were reported in 2018. The ASPREE trial in elderly people was terminated early for futility because aspirin had no effect on disability-free survival but significantly increased the risk of major haemorrhage and, unexpectedly, all-cause mortality. In the ASCEND trial in patients with diabetes mellitus and no evidence of vascular disease, aspirin significantly reduced serious vascular events but increased major bleeding. In the ARRIVE trial in people with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, aspirin had no effect on major cardiovascular events but increased gastrointestinal bleeding. The aim of this Review is to place these new results in the context of previous evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and to appraise whether the new evidence is likely to enable the more targeted use of aspirin in particular individuals for whom the net benefit is both clinically worthwhile and statistically definite.

### Benefit-harm analysis and charts for individualized and preference-sensitive prevention: example of low dose aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer [^37bb97d6]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Consider a 60-year-old woman who comes to her general practitioner's office and asks if she should take a low dose aspirin to prevent myocardial infarction (MI) or cancer. She has never had a cardiovascular event or cancer before, eats vegetables regularly, and is physically active. But she is a smoker, takes antihypertensive medication (current systolic blood pressure of 145 mmHg), has total cholesterol of 170 mg/dL, and HDL cholesterol of 55 mg/dL. The general practitioner determines the 10-year risks for both an MI and stroke to be around 6% and for colorectal cancer to be around 2%. Uncertain about what to recommend to the patient, the general practitioner consults some guidelines on primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer.

Table 1 shows that the World Health Organization advises against low dose aspirin if the 10-year risk of an MI is below 30%, the European Society of Cardiology advises against low dose aspirin for all individuals, while the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends aspirin if the risk is ≥ 8% in women, because the benefit of lowering the risk of stroke outweighs the risk of major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. To date, the USPSTF recommends against aspirin for the prevention of colorectal cancer.

Table 1
Selected recommendations on low dose aspirin for primary prevention of CVD and colorectal cancer

This vignette illustrates the challenge of making (preventive) treatment recommendations for individuals and the disagreement among guidelines. In recent years, advancements were made in the development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. Major guideline developers and groups like the USPSTF or the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group strongly advocate to first systematically review the evidence on the benefits and harms of interventions and, in a second and separate step, to develop recommendations in a transparent way. Nevertheless, even if guidelines are based on high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses and follow GRADE or similar guidance, clinical practice guidelines and regulatory agencies sometimes disagree, as the example of low dose aspirin for cardiovascular primary prevention shows (Table 1).

Can I prescribe aspirin?

Aspirin should not be used to treat acute VTE. In terms of prevention of future VTE, randomised placebo-controlled trials showed only a moderate benefit (reducing the rate of occurrence by 26% in the ASPIRE (Aspirin to Prevent Recurrent Venous Thromboembolism) and 42% in the WARFASA (WARFarin and ASpirin) study of prophylactic aspirin at a dose of 100 mg daily in patients who had completed several months of therapeutic anticoagulation for a VTE with no provoking factors. Furthermore, recent trial findings suggest that low-dose anticoagulation therapy may be a better option for patients requiring extended treatment. The randomised, double-blind phase 3 EINSTEIN CHOICE trial compared the efficacy and safety of up to 12 months' treatment with 100 mg aspirin with that of either the prophylactic (10 mg) or treatment dose (20 mg) of rivaroxaban, in patients with VTE following 6–12 months of therapeutic anticoagulation. It found that both doses of rivaroxaban resulted in a significant reduction (approximately 70%) in the risk of a recurrent VTE event compared with aspirin, without a significant increase in bleeding events.

Aspirin is widely used for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, but, in general, aspirin should be stopped if the patient requires an anticoagulant, due to the increased risk of major bleeding events. In cases where patients with a cardiac coronary artery bypass graft had aspirin treatment stopped for full-dose DOAC treatment, we advise re-starting aspirin if patients switch to a step-down dose of DOAC, although there is currently no empirical evidence to support this.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the US, accounting for more than 1 in 4 deaths. Each year, an estimated 605 000 people in the US have a first myocardial infarction and an estimated 610 000 experience a first stroke.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the effectiveness of aspirin to reduce the risk of CVD events (myocardial infarction and stroke), cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in persons without a history of CVD. The systematic review also investigated the effect of aspirin use on colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality in primary CVD prevention populations, as well as the harms (particularly bleeding) associated with aspirin use. The USPSTF also commissioned a microsimulation modeling study to assess the net balance of benefits and harms from aspirin use for primary prevention of CVD and CRC, stratified by age, sex, and CVD risk level.

Population

Adults 40 years or older without signs or symptoms of CVD or known CVD (including history of myocardial infarction or stroke) who are not at increased risk for bleeding (eg, no history of gastrointestinal ulcers, recent bleeding, other medical conditions, or use of medications that increase bleeding risk).

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit.

Recommendation

The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of aspirin use in this group is small. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily are more likely to benefit. (C recommendation) The USPSTF recommends against initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD in adults 60 years or older. (D recommendation).

### Estimates of benefits and harms of prophylactic use of aspirin in the general population [^bac19bf4]. Annals of Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Accumulating evidence supports an effect of aspirin in reducing overall cancer incidence and mortality in the general population. We reviewed current data and assessed the benefits and harms of prophylactic use of aspirin in the general population.

Methods

The effect of aspirin for site-specific cancer incidence and mortality, cardiovascular events was collated from the most recent systematic reviews. Studies identified through systematic Medline search provided data regarding harmful effects of aspirin and baseline rates of harms like gastrointestinal bleeding and peptic ulcer.

Results

The effects of aspirin on cancer are not apparent until at least 3 years after the start of use, and some benefits are sustained for several years after cessation in long-term users. No differences between low and standard doses of aspirin are observed, but there were no direct comparisons. Higher doses do not appear to confer additional benefit but increase toxicities. Excess bleeding is the most important harm associated with aspirin use, and its risk and fatality rate increases with age. For average-risk individuals aged 50–65 years taking aspirin for 10 years, there would be a relative reduction of between 7% (women) and 9% (men) in the number of cancer, myocardial infarction or stroke events over a 15-year period and an overall 4% relative reduction in all deaths over a 20-year period.

Conclusions

Prophylactic aspirin use for a minimum of 5 years at doses between 75 and 325 mg/day appears to have favourable benefit-harm profile; longer use is likely to have greater benefits. Further research is needed to determine the optimum dose and duration of use, to identify individuals at increased risk of bleeding, and to test effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori screening-eradication before starting aspirin prophylaxis.

Statement 5: H. pylori eradication is highly advisable in NSAID or aspirin users with a history of peptic ulcer disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Recommendation grade: B; Evidence level: 2b; Agreement level: 100%

In a randomized trial, it was shown that H. pylori eradication significantly reduces the rates of ulcer re-bleeding in users of aspirin or, to a lesser degree, NSAIDs who have a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, as opposed to therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) alone. Eradication of H. pylori was equivalent to maintenance treatment with PPIs in preventing recurrent bleeding in those taking low-dose aspirin, while PPIs were superior in those taking other NSAIDs. H. pylori eradication reduced but did not eliminate the risk of recurrent bleeding in high-risk patients taking low-dose aspirin. Therefore, in NSAID or aspirin users, after an episode of complicated or uncomplicated peptic ulcer, prophylactic therapy with PPI is mandatory in addition to H. pylori eradication. This strategy has also been shown to be the most cost-effective, according to a mathematical model.

Aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) — evidence and bleeding risk: In adults < 40 years of age, there is insufficient evidence to judge the risk–benefit ratio of routine aspirin; although "routine use is not recommended in these settings," there is also insufficient evidence to comment on whether physicians might discuss prophylactic aspirin with adults < 40 years of age or > 70 years of age. As inferred from the first recommendation, there is "no justification for the routine administration of low-dose aspirin" among adults at low estimated ASCVD risk; in the ARRIVE trial the observed average 10-year ASCVD risk was < 10%, and "the overall benefits of prophylactic aspirin by intention-to-treat were negligible." Accumulated data "support avoiding prophylactic aspirin" when bleeding risk factors are present, including "a history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease or bleeding at other sites, age > 70 years, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, chronic kidney disease (CKD)," and concurrent use of agents that increase bleeding risk such as "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, direct oral anticoagulants, and warfarin."

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: time for a platelet-guided approach [^8c59332c]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Clinical Dilemma

Aspirin has been widely used as an antipyretic and analgesic for centuries and became a staple of CVD prevention during the second half of the 20th century. By irreversibly inhibiting COX-1 (cyclooxygenase-1), aspirin confers protection against platelet-mediated thrombotic events while increasing bleeding risk, setting up its clinical risk-benefit tradeoff. Low-dose aspirin therapy has net value in secondary CVD prevention, reducing the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events by 21% and all-cause mortality by 13% in individuals with preexisting CVD, although the same individuals have more than double the odds of severe bleeding. However, despite the almost 30 million Americans who take aspirin to prevent a first CV event, it is increasingly recognized that this preventive approach should be reassessed. As for the majority of individuals, the clinical risk-benefit tradeoff skews toward higher bleeding risk, and this is increasingly apparent with improved clinical management of other CV risk factors, including hypertension and hyperlipidemia. In those without preexisting CVD, aspirin yields only modest protection against CV events (0.41% absolute risk reduction) that does not outweigh the associated increased risk of major bleeding (0.47% absolute risk increase). In the absence of broader evidence of aspirin's utility for primary CVD prevention, past trials have attempted to identify specific groups that would benefit from prophylactic aspirin use. Many trials were designed based on the assumption that aspirin's CV benefit increases and bleeding risk remains stable with increasing CV risk of the enrolled population. However, the point on the baseline CV risk spectrum at which aspirin's risk-benefit tradeoff becomes favorable remains unknown and is dependent upon bleeding risk (Figure 1). Meanwhile, atherosclerotic CVD is the leading cause of death in the United States, with an estimated 605 000 first heart attacks and 610 000 first strokes each year.

Figure 1.
The clinical benefit and risk of aspirin therapy by baseline cardiovascular risk. Past primary cardiovascular disease prevention trials of low-dose aspirin have attempted to characterize the clinical benefit (blue line) and risk (red dashed lines) of aspirin therapy by the baseline cardiovascular risks of enrolled populations. However, the clinical risk-benefit threshold, that is, the baseline cardiovascular risk at which the benefit of aspirin therapy exceeds the risk, remains unknown and is dependent upon bleeding risk. CV indicates cardiovascular.

### Aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia and related morbidity and mortality: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^ff2e1a0d]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Preeclampsia is one of the most serious health problems that affect pregnant persons. It is a complication in approximately 4% of pregnancies in the US and contributes to both maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia also accounts for 6% of preterm births and 19% of medically indicated preterm births in the US. There are racial and ethnic disparities in the prevalence of and mortality from preeclampsia. Non-Hispanic Black women are at greater risk for developing preeclampsia than other women and experience higher rates of maternal and infant morbidity and perinatal mortality.

Objective

To update its 2014 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose aspirin use to prevent preeclampsia.

Population

Pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia who have no prior adverse effects with or contraindications to low-dose aspirin.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a substantial net benefit of daily low-dose aspirin use to reduce the risk for preeclampsia, preterm birth, small for gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality in pregnant persons at high risk for preeclampsia.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d) as preventive medication for preeclampsia after 12 weeks of gestation in persons who are at high risk for preeclampsia. (B recommendation).

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^8ebb971d]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF aspirin for primary prevention — net benefit by age and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk: The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults aged 40 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk has a small net benefit, and that initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD events in adults 60 years or older has no net benefit. Adequate evidence indicates low-dose aspirin has a small benefit to reduce risk for cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke) in adults 40 years or older at increased CVD risk, with absolute benefit increasing with higher 10-year CVD risk and greater lifetime benefit when started at a younger age; however, aspirin increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and hemorrhagic stroke, with harms small overall but increasing in older age groups, particularly in adults older than 60 years.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: advances in diagnosis and treatment [^38ac614c]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Clinical decision making regarding the appropriate use of aspirin for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events is complex, and requires an individualized benefit to risk assessment.

Objective

To review advances in the individualized assessment for ASCVD and bleeding risk, and to provide an update of the randomized clinical trial evidence that examined the use of aspirin for primary prevention (primarily for ASCVD, and secondarily for colorectal cancer). The recently released 2016 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations are discussed, as well as the role of ASCVD risk, age, sex, and aspirin dose/formulation in clinical decision making.

Evidence Review

We performed a detailed review of peer-reviewed publications that were identified through searches of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database through 2016 using the literature search terms "aspirin", "primary prevention", "cardiovascular disease", "mortality", "cancer". Bibliographies from these references as well as meta-analyses of these randomized clinical trials were also reviewed.

Findings

Evidence from a total of 11 trials involving more than 118 000 patients is available to guide clinical decision making for aspirin use in the primary prevention of ASCVD. Clinicians should balance the benefit to risk ratio and the individual's preferences, calculating the 10-year ASCVD risk and evaluating risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, to facilitate a safer and more personalized approach to appropriate selection of candidates for low-dose aspirin (75 to 81 mg/d) for the primary prevention of ASCVD, with secondary considerations for reducing colorectal cancer risk when taken for longer periods (> 10 years). Both the net ASCVD benefit and the bleeding risk of aspirin therapy increased as the absolute ASCVD risk increased, but the net benefits generally exceeded the risks at higher baseline ASCVD risk (≥ 10% ASCVD 10-year risk). The Aspirin-Guide is a clinical decision making support tool (app for mobile devices) with internal risk calculators to help clinicians with this dual assessment by calculating the ASCVD risk and the bleeding risk in the individual patient, and incorporating age- and sex-specific guidance based on randomized trial results.

Conclusions and Relevance

Balancing the benefit of ASCVD reduction with the risk of bleeding from low-dose aspirin is difficult but essential for informed decision making and achieving a net clinical benefit from aspirin for primary prevention. This is facilitated by a free and readily available evidence-based clinical decision support tool.

### Aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^7d94646d]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Bleeding risk factors and aspirin dosing: The risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hemorrhagic stroke, with or without aspirin use, increases with older age, and other risk factors include male sex, diabetes, history of gastrointestinal issues (such as peptic ulcer disease), liver disease, smoking, and elevated blood pressure; certain medications, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and anticoagulants, increase the risk of bleeding. The benefits of aspirin for CVD prevention appear similar for low dose (≤ 100 mg/d) and for all doses studied in CVD prevention trials (50 to 500 mg/d), and a pragmatic approach would be to use 81 mg/d, which is the most commonly prescribed dose in the US.

### Aspirin use in children for fever or viral syndromes… [^a10bfd83]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Clinical Question At what age is it safe for children to take aspirin for fever or viral syndromes. Evidence-Based Answer Aspirin should not be used to treat acute febrile viral illness in children. Although no causal link has been proven, data from case-control and historic cohort studies demonstrate an association between aspirin use and Reye syndrome. The risk of Reye syndrome decreases with age, becoming extremely rare by the late teenage years. Evidence Summary The primary concern associated with aspirin use in the treatment of fever in children is Reye syndrome. First described in 1963, Reye syndrome is an acute, noninflammatory encephalopathy and hepatotoxicity that follows an acute viral illness. Although it is associated with salicylate treatment in case-control and historic cohort studies, accurate diagnosis of Reye syndrome is difficult.

2, 6 However, case-control studies and other historic data associate use of salicylates during febrile viral infections to the development of Reye syndrome in children. 7–9 A comprehensive review of studies linking aspirin to Reye syndrome concludes that the methodology of many early studies was flawed, but later cohort studies linking Reye syndrome to aspirin employed methodologies that addressed those criticisms.
4. The absolute risk of aspirin treatment is unknown and difficult to calculate precisely. Peak incidence of Reye syndrome in the United States occurred in 1980, when 555 cases were reported. Since peaking in 1980, the incidence of Reye syndrome has dropped to less than two cases per year. 2 This dramatic decline coincides with increasing reports linking aspirin to Reye syndrome. In 1986 the U. S. Food and Drug Administration required that aspirin labels state that children and teenagers should not use the product. 1 Today, Reye syndrome is rare.

Recent estimates indicate 0. 2 to

1. 1 cases per 1 million children younger than 18 years.
3. Recommendations from Others The National Reye's Syndrome Foundation, the U. S. Surgeon General, the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that aspirin and combination products containing aspirin not be taken by anyone younger than 19 years during fever-causing illnesses. 11 The British Medicines and Health-care products Regulatory Agency recommends that aspirin labels state that aspirin is not for use in children younger than 16 years unless recommended by a physician. 12.

### Management of patients with ulcer bleeding [^9e88b05c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Medium credibility.

Aspirin for primary vs secondary prophylaxis after ulcer bleeding — risk–benefit and outcomes: For primary prophylaxis without overt cardiovascular disease, meta-analysis shows an annual absolute risk reduction of 0.07% (NNT = 1,429). For secondary prophylaxis in established cardiovascular disease, the annual absolute risk reduction is 1.49% (NNT = 68), and failure to resume low-dose aspirin after ulcer bleeding is associated with increased mortality. In a randomized trial of such patients with a bleeding ulcer, resumption of low-dose aspirin versus placebo increased rebleeding (10.3 vs. 5.4%) but decreased overall mortality (1.3% vs. 12.9%). Thus, it is important to resume antiplatelet therapy, along with PPI co-therapy, as early as possible in patients with established cardiovascular disease.

### Aspirin dose for the prevention of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review [^c3952759]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

More than 50 million US adults take aspirin regularly for long-term prevention of cardiovascular disease, typically either 81 mg/d or 325 mg/d. Controversy remains regarding the most appropriate long-term daily dose.

Objective

To review the mechanism of action of aspirin and the clinical literature for relationships among aspirin dosage, efficacy, and safety.

Evidence Acquisition

A systematic review of the English-language literature was undertaken using MEDLINE and EMBASE (searched through February 2007) and the search term aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid and dose. The search was limited to clinical trials and was extended by a review of bibliographies of pertinent reports of original data and review articles. Published prospective studies using different aspirin dosages in the setting of cardiovascular disease were included.

Evidence Synthesis

Although pharmacodynamic data demonstrate that long-term aspirin dosages as low as 30 mg/d are adequate to fully inhibit platelet thromboxane production, dosages as high as 1300 mg/d are approved for use. In the United States, 81 mg/d of aspirin is prescribed most commonly (60%), followed by 325 mg/d (35%). The available evidence, predominantly from secondary-prevention observational studies, supports that dosages greater than 75 to 81 mg/d do not enhance efficacy, whereas larger dosages are associated with an increased incidence of bleeding events, primarily related to gastrointestinal tract toxicity.

Conclusions

Currently available clinical data do not support the routine, long-term use of aspirin dosages greater than 75 to 81 mg/d in the setting of cardiovascular disease prevention. Higher dosages, which may be commonly prescribed, do not better prevent events but are associated with increased risks of gastrointestinal bleeding.

### Aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^a70b570f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Description

Update of the 2009 USPSTF recommendation on aspirin use to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and the 2007 recommendation on aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC).

Methods

The USPSTF reviewed 5 additional studies of aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD and several additional analyses of CRC follow-up data. The USPSTF also relied on commissioned systematic reviews of all-cause mortality and total cancer incidence and mortality and a comprehensive review of harms. The USPSTF then used a microsimulation model to systematically estimate the balance of benefits and harms.

Population

This recommendation applies to adults aged 40 years or older without known CVD and without increased bleeding risk.

Recommendations

The USPSTF recommends initiating low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 50 to 59 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years. (B recommendation) The decision to initiate low-dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 60 to 69 years who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk should be an individual one. Persons who are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years are more likely to benefit. Persons who place a higher value on the potential benefits than the potential harms may choose to initiate low-dose aspirin. (C recommendation) The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults younger than 50 years. (I statement) The current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of CVD and CRC in adults aged 70 years or older.

### Use of low-dose aspirin as secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in US adults (from the national health interview survey, 2012) [^4bbe216c]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend that adults with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease take low-dose aspirin or other antiplatelet medications as secondary prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events. Yet, no national level assessment of low-dose aspirin use for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease has been reported in a community-based population. Using data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey, we assessed low-dose aspirin use in those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We estimated the prevalence ratios of low-dose aspirin use, adjusting for sociodemographic status, health insurance, and cardiovascular risk factors. In those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (n = 3,068), 76% had been instructed to take aspirin and 88% of those were following this advice. Of those not advised, 11% took aspirin on their own. Overall, 70% were taking aspirin (including those who followed their health care provider's advice and those who were not advised but took aspirin on their own). Logistic regression models showed that women, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, those aged 40 to 64 years, with a high school education or with some college, or with fewer cardiovascular disease risk factors were less likely to take aspirin than men, non-Hispanic whites, those aged ≥ 65 years, with a college education or higher, or with all 4 selected cardiovascular disease risk factors, respectively. Additional analyses conducted in those with coronary heart disease only (n = 2,007) showed similar patterns. In conclusion, use of low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention was 70%, with high reported adherence to health care providers' advice to take low-dose aspirin (88%) and significant variability within subgroups.

### Helicobacter pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^6b529851]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The complex interaction between H. pylori and NSAIDs implies that it is over simplistic to conclude that their relationship is independent, synergistic, or antagonistic without considering the influence of other factors. Factors such as previous exposure to NSAIDs, a history of ulcer complication, concurrent use of acid-suppressant therapy, and the difference between NSAIDs and low-dose aspirin all affect the outcome. Several recommendations can be made with regard to the indications of H. pylori eradication for patients requiring NSAIDs. First, patients taking NSAIDs who have ulcers or previous ulcer disease should be tested for the bacterium, and it should be eradicated if present because it is impossible to determine whether the ulcers are caused by H. pylori or NSAIDs or both. Antiulcer drugs should be prescribed to prevent ulcer recurrence for patients who continue to require NSAIDs. Although the efficacy of omeprazole is enhanced by H. pylori infection, it is not justified to leave a pathogen in the stomach in exchange for a modest therapeutic gain. Second, for patients who take low-dose aspirin, eradication of H. pylori substantially reduces the risk of ulcer bleeding. It is advisable that patients taking low-dose aspirin who are at risk of ulcer bleeding should be tested for H. pylori and treated for it if the infection is found. Third, for patients who are about to start NSAIDs, screen-and-treat H. pylori has the potential of reducing the ulcer risk at an affordable incremental cost. It might be argued that any interaction between H. pylori and NSAIDs would become irrelevant in the era of COX-2-selective NSAIDs. Even among patients who are receiving a COX-2-selective NSAID, however, a large-scale study showed that the ulcer risk is significantly higher in H. pylori-positive patients than in uninfected patients. This finding suggests that the relative importance of H. pylori in ulcer development might increase with a reduced toxicity of COX-2-selective NSAIDs. With an increasing use of low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis, the problem of aspirin-related ulcer disease is expected to rise. Given the significant role of H. pylori in the latter condition, screen-and-treat H. pylori might be a useful strategy for the prevention of ulcer complications in high-risk patients receiving low-dose aspirin in the future.

### Primary prevention of cardiovascular events in diabetes: is there a role for aspirin? [^a33f9efd]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

The POPADAD (Prevention Of Progression of Arterial Disease And Diabetes) study did not show a benefit for low-dose aspirin therapy or administration of antioxidants for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events in individuals with diabetes and asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease. Although low-dose aspirin continues to be recommended in international guidelines, no convincing trial-based evidence exists that supports its routine use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. This paradox is unhelpful and the guidelines should be relaxed until definitive evidence becomes available.

### Prophylactic aspirin dose and preeclampsia… [^ff6d3010]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of 13 828 women, no difference was found in preeclampsia incidence or bleeding complications between those using 150 to 160 mg of aspirin vs 75 mg of aspirin during pregnancy for preeclampsia prevention. These findings suggest that either dose may be a reasonable choice when using aspirin to prevent preeclampsia. However, large randomized trials investigating aspirin dose in pregnancy are still needed. Low-dose aspirin is the only drug with high level evidence for preventing preeclampsia. Still, there is no consensus on the optimal dose of aspirin to prevent preeclampsia with limited evidence available to guide this decision. Consequently, international guidelines differ greatly. Some suggest less than 100 mg is sufficient, while others recommend a dose higher than 100 mg. Some make no suggestion of a specific dose beyond recommending low-dose aspirin. 4–6.

In this cohort study of over 13 000 pregnant women using aspirin, 150 to 160 mg compared with 75 mg of aspirin was not associated with an altered risk of preeclampsia or preterm preeclampsia. Nor was the risk of postpartum hemorrhage changed. Our findings suggest that either dose may be a reasonable choice when using aspirin to prevent preeclampsia. An increasing number of international guidelines recommend aspirin at a dosage of 100 mg or above for preeclampsia prevention. Our study does not provide evidence supporting the superiority of higher doses over lower doses. Concerns have been raised that higher aspirin doses could increase the risk of postpartum hemorrhage and other bleeding complications. However, our findings do not show a clinically important difference in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage between 150 to 160 mg and 75 mg of aspirin.

Our statistical method was optimized and provided a doubly robust model, ensuring consistent results even if 1 model was misspecified. This might explain why we found a slightly increased risk of preeclampsia among nulliparous women using 150 to 160 mg of aspirin compared with those using 75 mg. Furthermore, there is always a risk of random error in studies with multiple outcomes and subanalyses. Among women undergoing cesarean delivery, the risk of postpartum hemorrhage was lower with 150 to 160 mg compared with 75 mg of aspirin.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Preeclampsia prevention in chronic hypertension — low-dose aspirin — reports that daily low-dose aspirin taken during pregnancy after 12 weeks' gestation significantly reduced the risk for preeclampsia in individuals at moderate or high risk compared with placebo (pooled relative risk: 0.85 [95% CI: 0.75–0.95]); aspirin use was also associated with significantly reduced risk for preterm birth, small-for-gestational age/intrauterine growth restriction, and maternal mortality without increases in risk of postpartum hemorrhage in pregnant persons at increased risk for preeclampsia; and only individuals without prior adverse events or allergy to aspirin should be advised to take low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prevention.

### Aspirin with or without statin in Individuals without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease across risk Categories [^73e59db8]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The role of aspirin in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains controversial. In 2019, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommended considering prophylactic low-dose aspirin only among asymptomatic individuals at high risk of ASCVD events, low bleeding risk, and age < 70 years (IIb). In 2021, the European Society of Cardiology primary prevention guidelines endorsed a similar recommendation. More recently, the updated United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2022 guidelines recommended individualizing low-dose aspirin only among adults aged 40 to 59 years, if their 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 10% and they have low bleeding risk (Class C). In contrast, the guidelines recommend against the use of aspirin among adults ≥ 60 years (Class D). These recommendations stem from a USPSTF meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials demonstrating a significant reduction in major ASCVD events with aspirin at the cost of higher rates of major bleeding.

Statin is used as first-line therapy for the primary prevention of ASCVD due to cardiovascular benefits. Most randomized evidence favoring aspirin in primary prevention was conducted in the pre-statin era, whereas statin therapy use was more frequent at baseline in recent trials. For instance, the proportion of participants on a statin in ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly), ARRIVE (Aspirin to Reduce Risk of Initial Vascular Events), and ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes)trials were 65%, 43%, and 75%, respectively. Since statin therapy would mitigate baseline ASCVD risk, lower cardiovascular effects of aspirin in post-statin era trials might be attributable to the higher use of statin therapy. Furthermore, given a much more favorable risk-benefit profile, most patients considered for ASCVD risk reduction in current clinical practice would be expected to be on baseline statin therapy before entertaining a decision on possible aspirin initiation.

Prior studies, did not explore the potential impact of statin therapy on the net risk/benefit ratio of aspirin therapy. Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated the relative and absolute effects of aspirin in adults without ASCVD, stratified by statin use across different ASCVD risks.
