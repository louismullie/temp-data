## Question

Treatment and dose for uti prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment and dose for UTI prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions of recurrent UTI. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence and guideline positions for antibiotic prophylaxis. Next, I will examine dosing regimens for continuous daily, postcoital, and intermittent strategies. After that, I need to check special populations such as pregnancy, children, and patients with catheters. I will then review non-antibiotic alternatives and their comparative effectiveness. Finally, I should confirm safety, resistance risks, and a practical decision framework with monitoring and discontinuation criteria.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions so I don't anchor on the wrong population. Recurrent UTI in nonpregnant adult women is typically defined as at least three symptomatic UTIs in 12 months or two in 6 months, and this is the core group for whom prophylaxis is usually considered after non-antibiotic measures fail or alongside them in shared decision-making [^6839a447] [^9402591c].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence for antibiotic prophylaxis. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit. High-quality evidence syntheses show continuous low-dose antibiotics reduce recurrence by about 70–80% versus placebo, with an absolute risk reduction near 46% and a number needed to treat around 2–3, though many trials are older and resistance patterns have evolved, so I need to be cautious in extrapolation [^29cb5ad6] [^51669b0f]. I should also confirm guideline positions: the AUA/CUA/SUFU guideline issues a conditional recommendation for prophylaxis after discussing risks, benefits, and alternatives, and the EAU recommends initiating continuous or postcoital prophylaxis when non-antibiotic strategies fail, which aligns with a stewardship-first approach [^9402591c] [^22c68e7a].

> Now, I will examine continuous daily prophylaxis dosing, but hold on, I should verify the exact regimens and ranges. Commonly used agents and doses include nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 50–100 mg once daily, trimethoprim 100 mg once daily, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 40/200 mg once daily or three times weekly, cephalexin 125–250 mg once daily, and fosfomycin 3 g every 10 days; these are supported by guideline tables and trials, and durations typically range from 6 to 12 months with reassessment at 3 months and periodic review thereafter [^7287edb3] [^1b72fc34] [^51669b0f]. I should double-check nitrofurantoin specifics: the FDA labeling supports 50–100 mg at bedtime for long-term suppressive therapy, and taking it with food improves absorption and tolerability, which is important for adherence [^c925d4f7] [^ea5b11c8].

> For postcoital prophylaxis, let me consider the evidence base and dosing. Postcoital dosing is appropriate for women with clearly sexual activity–related recurrences; randomized data show postcoital therapy is as effective as daily prophylaxis in selected women, with options including TMP-SMX 40/200 mg or 80/400 mg as a single dose immediately before or after intercourse, nitrofurantoin 50–100 mg, or cephalexin 250 mg, which reduces exposure and adverse effects compared with daily therapy [^7eab93de] [^51669b0f]. I should confirm that guidelines endorse this strategy in the right phenotype, which they do, emphasizing shared decision-making and periodic reassessment [^9402591c] [^22c68e7a].

> But wait, what if we want to minimize antibiotic exposure further with intermittent strategies. I need to check whether intermittent regimens are comparable to daily prophylaxis. Evidence suggests no significant difference in recurrence risk between intermittent and daily prophylaxis in some contexts, and patient-initiated self-start therapy can be a reasonable alternative for select patients, though counseling and access to timely treatment are essential to avoid delays in appropriate therapy [^012bfd7f] [^6839a447]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines still position self-start as conditional rather than first-line; yes, it is a conditional option after shared decision-making [^012bfd7f].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with pregnancy. I need to ensure safety and teratogenicity considerations are front and center. After treating a recurrent UTI in pregnancy, suppressive therapy may be considered for the remainder of gestation, with nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally daily or cephalexin 250–500 mg daily as common choices, guided by prior culture results and renal function, and postcoital strategies can be used if symptoms are intercourse-related [^384a91d4]. I should confirm that routine prophylaxis is not universally recommended and that decisions should be individualized, which is consistent with obstetric guidance [^384a91d4].

> For children, I should confirm the evidence signal and resistance trade-offs. A large, high-quality RCT showed that daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole reduced recurrence modestly in predisposed children, but resistance to the prophylactic agent increased, and Cochrane analyses suggest the absolute benefit may be small when balanced against resistance risks, so prophylaxis should be reserved for carefully selected children after discussing uncertainties and monitoring for adverse effects [^181ca32d] [^81acdbfa]. Let me reconsider whether nitrofurantoin is favored in pediatrics; some pediatric guidance notes nitrofurantoin may be effective but also more often causes gastrointestinal adverse effects, so agent selection should be individualized and reassessed frequently [^e1623c22].

> For patients using clean intermittent self-catheterization, I should verify the AnTIC trial results. Continuous low-dose prophylaxis reduced symptomatic UTIs by about 48% over 12 months but increased antimicrobial resistance in urinary isolates, so the decision to prophylax must weigh symptom burden and functional impact against resistance concerns and consider surveillance if prophylaxis is initiated [^c1d45013] [^a5b4c76c]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines align with this nuance; contemporary guidance emphasizes individualized decisions and stewardship in this group, which matches the trial's cautionary findings [^notfound].

> I will now examine non-antibiotic alternatives because stewardship and patient preference often push us toward these first. Methenamine hippurate 1 g twice daily was noninferior to daily antibiotics in the ALTAR randomized trial, with only a small absolute difference in UTI incidence and substantially less antibiotic exposure, supporting its use as a first-line alternative after shared decision-making and in alignment with EAU guidance to prioritize non-antibiotic options when feasible [^01959980] [^e6c64aa2] [^9ddfbf03]. Let me verify D-mannose; earlier meta-analyses suggested benefit, but a high-quality RCT found no reduction in recurrence versus placebo, and the 2025 AUA/CUA/SUFU update concludes D-mannose shows no clinical benefit and is not recommended, so I should not overstate its role despite older positive signals [^15bdb3d9] [^0e3903d3]. Cranberry products have inconsistent evidence and are not a substitute for proven prophylaxis, though they may be considered low-risk adjuncts in some patients after counseling about uncertain benefit [^101e3416] [^74328b45].

> I need to ensure I address safety, adherence, and resistance risks explicitly. Continuous prophylaxis is generally well tolerated, but adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset, rash, and candidiasis occur and can limit adherence; importantly, resistance to the prophylactic agent and to other common uropathogen antibiotics increases with continuous exposure, which is why reassessment at 3 months and limiting total duration are prudent, and why non-antibiotic strategies should be prioritized when acceptable to patients [^51669b0f] [^a5b4c76c] [^9ddfbf03]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize periodic review and de-escalation; yes, both AUA/CUA/SUFU and EAU recommend reassessment and discontinuation when feasible, with many women experiencing reinfection after stopping, underscoring the need for ongoing prevention planning beyond pills [^51669b0f] [^22c68e7a].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and double-check it aligns with guidelines. First, confirm the diagnosis of recurrent UTI and exclude complicated features or correctable anomalies; obtain a urine culture before starting prophylaxis when possible to guide agent selection and document baseline susceptibilities [^482c7721] [^9402591c]. Second, implement non-antibiotic measures such as behavioral modifications, adequate hydration, and vaginal estrogen in postmenopausal women when appropriate, and consider methenamine as a first-line prophylactic alternative if acceptable to the patient [^d0f82e05] [^01959980]. Third, if antibiotic prophylaxis is chosen, tailor to phenotype: continuous daily therapy for frequent, non–sexually related recurrences; postcoital therapy for clearly intercourse-associated recurrences; and consider intermittent or self-start strategies in select, reliable patients after counseling [^7eab93de] [^012bfd7f]. Fourth, select low-resistance-risk agents when possible, start at the lowest effective dose, reassess at 3 months, and limit total duration to 6–12 months with periodic breaks to re-evaluate need and resistance patterns [^51669b0f] [^22c68e7a].

> Finally, I should confirm key dosing specifics and safety pearls so the plan is actionable. Nitrofurantoin 50–100 mg at bedtime with food, trimethoprim 100 mg daily, TMP-SMX 40/200 mg daily or three times weekly, cephalexin 125–250 mg daily, and fosfomycin 3 g every 10 days are all reasonable prophylactic choices depending on prior cultures, allergies, and local resistance; for postcoital prophylaxis, single doses of TMP-SMX 40/200 mg or 80/400 mg, nitrofurantoin 50–100 mg, or cephalexin 250 mg taken before or after intercourse are supported by guidelines and trials [^7287edb3] [^7eab93de]. I need to ensure I remind myself to monitor for adverse effects, candidiasis, and breakthrough infections, and to adjust or discontinue if resistance emerges or side effects accumulate, consistent with stewardship principles and guideline reassessment intervals [^51669b0f] [^22c68e7a].

UTI prophylaxis is indicated for patients with **recurrent UTIs** (≥ 2 in 6 months or ≥ 3 in 12 months) [^9687f424] or for **high-risk procedures** (e.g. transrectal prostate biopsy, urodynamics, or catheter removal) [^e2796c33] [^0b8740f5] [^5e79df27]. The most effective regimens are **low-dose daily antibiotics** (nitrofurantoin 50–100 mg, trimethoprim 100 mg, TMP-SMX 40/200 mg, or cephalexin 125–250 mg) [^7287edb3] for 6–12 months, with reassessment at 3 months [^51669b0f]; postcoital dosing is an alternative for sex-associated recurrences [^7eab93de]. Non-antibiotic options (methenamine 1 g twice daily [^01959980], D-mannose 2 g/day [^d24bcc96]) are reasonable alternatives, though evidence varies [^15bdb3d9]. Prophylaxis is not recommended for routine catheter use or asymptomatic bacteriuria [^750d9617] [^d85d978a]. Monitor for adverse effects and resistance; stop if ineffective or if adverse effects occur [^51669b0f].

---

## Indications for UTI prophylaxis

UTI prophylaxis is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Recurrent UTIs**: Defined as ≥ 2 UTIs in 6 months or ≥ 3 UTIs in 12 months [^9687f424] [^6839a447].
- **High-risk procedures**: Such as transrectal prostate biopsy, urodynamic studies, or catheter removal, where the risk of infection is significant [^e2796c33] [^0b8740f5] [^5e79df27].
- **Special populations**: Including pregnant women with recurrent UTIs [^384a91d4], patients with neurogenic bladder [^9741bfcc], and immunocompromised individuals [^notfound].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens and dosing

Several antibiotic regimens are recommended for UTI prophylaxis, with dosing tailored to patient-specific factors such as age, renal function, and allergy profile:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dose** | **Frequency** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nitrofurantoin | 50–100 mg | Once daily | 6–12 months [^7287edb3] [^51669b0f] |
| Trimethoprim | 100 mg | Once daily | 6–12 months [^7287edb3] [^51669b0f] |
| Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole | 40/200 mg | Once daily or three times weekly | 6–12 months [^7287edb3] [^51669b0f] |
| Cephalexin | 125–250 mg | Once daily | 6–12 months [^7287edb3] [^51669b0f] |
| Fosfomycin | 3 g | Every 10 days | 6–12 months [^7287edb3] [^51669b0f] |

---

Postcoital prophylaxis is recommended for women with **sex-associated UTIs**, with options including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 40/200 mg or 80/400 mg, nitrofurantoin 50–100 mg, or cephalexin 250 mg taken immediately before or after sexual intercourse [^7eab93de] [^51669b0f].

---

## Non-antibiotic alternatives

Non-antibiotic alternatives are increasingly considered to minimize antibiotic resistance and adverse effects:

- **Methenamine hippurate**: 1 g twice daily, shown to be non-inferior to antibiotic prophylaxis in women with recurrent UTIs [^01959980] [^e6c64aa2].
- **D-mannose**: 2 g daily, though evidence is mixed and recent guidelines suggest limited benefit [^15bdb3d9] [^d24bcc96].
- **Cranberry products**: Evidence is inconsistent, with some studies showing modest benefit and others showing no significant effect [^101e3416] [^74328b45].

---

## Duration of prophylaxis

The **typical duration** of antibiotic prophylaxis is 6–12 months, with reassessment at 3 months to evaluate efficacy and tolerability [^51669b0f] [^7287edb3]. Long-term prophylaxis beyond 12 months is generally not recommended unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks [^51669b0f].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

UTI prophylaxis carries potential risks and adverse effects, including:

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Increased resistance among urinary pathogens is a significant concern, particularly with long-term antibiotic use [^a5b4c76c] [^8e4e3ea8].
- **Adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal disturbances, rash, candidiasis, and rare serious adverse effects such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome [^430aec09] [^e1623c22].
- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Particularly in elderly patients receiving long-term antibiotic prophylaxis [^2363b269].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to ensure the effectiveness and safety of prophylaxis:

- **Clinical assessment**: Regular evaluation of UTI recurrence, adverse effects, and adherence [^notfound].
- **Laboratory monitoring**: Periodic urinalysis and urine cultures to detect breakthrough infections and resistance [^notfound].
- **Re-evaluation**: At 3 months, 6 months, and annually to determine the ongoing need for prophylaxis [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Nitrofurantoin and cephalexin are preferred agents due to their safety profile [^384a91d4].
- **Pediatric patients**: Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis may be considered in children with recurrent UTIs, particularly those with vesicoureteral reflux or structural abnormalities [^181ca32d] [^81acdbfa].
- **Catheter-associated UTIs**: Routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for patients with indwelling catheters due to limited benefit and increased resistance risk [^750d9617] [^d85d978a].

---

UTI prophylaxis is indicated for patients with recurrent UTIs or high-risk procedures, with **low-dose daily antibiotics** as the mainstay [^9402591c]. Non-antibiotic alternatives such as methenamine and D-mannose are reasonable options, though evidence varies [^01959980] [^15bdb3d9]. Regular monitoring and reassessment are essential to ensure effectiveness and minimize adverse effects [^51669b0f].

### Antibiotics for recurrent urinary tract infections… [^50f1e4d7]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Prophylactic antibiotics can reduce the number of recurrent UTIs in nonpregnant women while they are taking the medication. No antibiotic was significantly better than others at decreasing the number of UTIs, and all antibiotics caused side effects such as candidiasis, rash, and nausea in some patients. Postcoital prophylaxis was as effective as daily prophylaxis in young women. Limited evidence suggests that weekly prophylaxis is better than monthly prophylaxis, but the former has not been compared with daily or postcoital prophylaxis. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model, and the results were expressed as RR with a 95 percent confidence interval. Data Collection and Analysis.

Compared with placebo, continuous antibiotic prophylaxis for six to 12 months reduced the rate of UTI during prophylaxis. After prophylaxis, two studies showed no difference between groups. The treated group had more adverse events. One RCT compared postcoital and continuous daily ciprofloxacin and found no significant difference in rates of UTI, suggesting that postcoital treatment could be offered to woman who have UTI associated with sexual intercourse. Reviewers' Conclusions. There are many options for treating recurrent UTI. This review showed that prophylactic antibiotics are better than placebo in reducing the number of recurrences. The NNT to prevent one symptomatic recurrent UTI in one year was 2.
2. However, after prophylactic therapy was stopped, rates of recurrence were equal to those in women who did not receive prophylactic therapy.

The reviewed studies showed that side effects with the antibiotics were common and included nausea, rash, and oral and vaginal candidiasis. The number needed to harm for any side effect was 13.
5. 1 Thus, if 14 women are treated with antibiotic prophylaxis for one year, seven will have one fewer recurrent UTI, and one will experience a side effect. Schedules for management of recurrent UTI include daily, weekly, or monthly prophylaxis, postcoital prophylaxis, and acute self-treatment. 6 One study showed that sexually active young women who took postcoital ciprofloxacin had similar outcomes to women who took ciprofloxacin daily. Another study showed that weekly prophylaxis was better than monthly prophylaxis. No studies compared daily and weekly prophylaxis. 1.

### Fluconazole dose recommendation in urinary tract infection [^b36de55b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the most appropriate dose of fluconazole for the treatment of symptomatic fungal urinary tract infection (UTI).

Data Sources

Primary literature identified through MEDLINE (1990-June 2000). Key search terms included fluconazole and urinary tract infection.

Data Synthesis

Fluconazole is approved for the treatment of candidal UTIs, but dosage recommendations are not consistent. An evaluation of clinical studies of fluconazole for the treatment of candidal UTI was performed.

Conclusions

Questions remain about the optimal dosing of fluconazole, including the most appropriate dose in non-albicans species of candida as well as the optimal duration of therapy. Until further studies are performed, a fluconazole 200-mg loading dose followed by 100 mg/d for at least four days appears to be the most appropriate dose for the treatment of symptomatic candidal UTI in patients without systemic fungal infection or severe renal failure.

### A review for clinical practice in the treatment and prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women over age 65 [^646aa282]. Journal of Women's Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a pervasive, costly, and dangerous cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, which can lead to further complications if they become recurrent or progress to urosepsis. Recurrent UTI is a particular concern among postmenopausal females because of increased risk factors and decreased estrogen levels, leading to changes in the urogenital epithelium and subsequently causing alterations in the urogenital microbiome. Prevention strategies for recurrent UTIs are often incorporated into patient-centered care plans, but finding the right management can be difficult for older women since many of the common treatment options have contraindications and adverse side effects. This review aims to describe the diagnosis, treatment, and special considerations for the treatment and prevention of recurrent UTIs in women over 65. Current prevention strategies include both antibiotic and nonantibiotic options. The antibiotic choice for older women presents a few unique challenges, including frequent allergy or intolerance of side effects, renal or liver dysfunction, and polypharmacy or drug interactions. Nonantibiotic options range from readily accessible drugstore remedies to experimental vaccines, which all are accompanied by certain advantages and disadvantages. Appropriate management plans can help to reduce symptoms and poor outcomes among older females. In addition, we hope future studies continue to investigate the proper dosing and routes for optimal management in this aging female population.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^f1ed452b]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In our meta-analysis of pooled data from seven studies (six of which were randomized), there were significantly fewer symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients receiving prophylaxis during removal of a urinary catheter than in those not receiving prophylaxis. Our finding in favor of antibiotic prophylaxis, however, must be tempered by possible publication bias toward positive studies, the limitations of the included studies, and practical considerations about encouraging more widespread antibiotic use.

Indwelling urinary catheters pose several risks to patients, including urethral trauma, discomfort, and urinary tract infection. In an era of increasingly constrained fiscal resources and evolving antibiotic resistance, evidence based antimicrobial prescribing is essential to promote antimicrobial stewardship. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on whether clinicians should prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis to patients when an indwelling urinary catheter is removed.

Current practice and variation in study designs

Administration of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of removal of a catheter might already be common practice, particularly among urologists. In a survey by Wazait and colleagues, conducted in 2004, antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of catheter removal was practiced by 60% of respondents from various medical specialties, and 40% of urologists indicated that they used antibiotic prophylaxis in all patients. At the time of that survey, however, little objective evidence was available to guide management of bacteriuria after catheterization. Variation in clinical practice is therefore not surprising given the inconclusive evidence at that time. In addition, the survey by Wazait and colleagues showed that there was heterogeneity in the selection and duration of prophylactic antimicrobial agents. This variation in practice was also evident in the trials included in our meta-analysis and precludes any formal recommendations about choice of antibiotics or duration of treatment. Ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were the most common drugs used, followed by nitrofurantoin (one study) and cefotaxime (in the oldest study). Dose varied from single dose to multiple day administration. Of note, current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in uropathogens clearly argue against the promotion of the use of both trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. Nitrofurantoin, although its activity is limited to the lower urinary tract, has broad activity against Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens and an acceptable toxicity profile and is not associated with important resistance issues.

### Best practice statement on urologic procedures and antimicrobial prophylaxis [^e2baa0e3]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The primary rationale for antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) is to decrease the incidence of surgical site infection (SSI) and other preventable periprocedural infections, with the secondary goal of reducing antibiotic overuse. This Best Practice Statement (BPS) updates the prior American Urological Association (AUA) BPS and creates a comprehensive and user-friendly reference for clinicians caring for adult patients who are undergoing urologic procedures.

Materials and Methods

Recommendations are based on a review of English language peer-reviewed literature from 2006 through October 2018 and were made by consensus by a multidisciplinary panel. The search parameters included timing, re-dosing, and duration of AP across urologic procedures where there was the possibility of SSI. Excluded from the search were the management of infections outside the genitourinary (GU) tract and pediatric procedures.

Results

Single-dose AP is recommended for most urologic cases and antimicrobials should only be used when medically necessary, for the shortest duration possible, and not beyond case completion. Surgeons are the most accurate discerners of an SSI, and should use standard definitions to make better calculations of patient risk. The risk classification developed is dependent on the likelihood of developing SSI, and not the associated consequences of SSI.

Conclusions

The AUA developed a multi-disciplinary BPS to guide clinicians on the proper usage of AP across urologic procedures and wound classifications. It is recommended that the lowest dose of antimicrobials be administered to decrease the risk of infection and to minimize the risk of drug-resistant organisms.

### Meta-analyses in prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections [^60373424]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common, and complications result in significant morbidity and mortality and also consume resources. This overview summarizes the current evidence for the prevention and treatment of UTI in adults and children from meta-analyses. The quality and applicability of this evidence in clinical practice for different patient groups is discussed. Suggestions are made for future research, because it is apparent that there are evidence gaps for particular subgroups of people.

### American Urogynecologic Society best-practice statement: recurrent urinary tract infection in adult women [^51669b0f]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — pre-initiation step, postcoital and continuous strategies, efficacy, and duration: both the European Association of Urology and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommend ensuring a negative urine culture before starting prophylactic antibiotics; postcoital prophylaxis should be offered to women who have UTIs temporarily related to sexual intercourse, and these women will take a single dose of an antimicrobial agent immediately after intercourse; postcoital therapy decreased recurrence rates compared with placebo (0.3 vs 3.6 patient-years, P = 0.001) and was equally as efficacious as continuous daily therapy; with continuous prophylaxis, a patient takes a single, daily antibiotic dose, and compared with placebo, continuous prophylaxis decreases recurrences by up to 95%; the duration of these regimens ranges from 6 months to at least 2 years, with regimens extended to 5 years in some reports; a Cochrane review in nonpregnant women found that antibiotics given continuously for 6 to 12 months were considerably more effective than placebo in preventing rUTI (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.08–0.28); several studies have found that 50% to 60% of women become reinfected within 3 months of discontinuing prophylaxis; this document supports reevaluation of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis at 3 months, and antibiotic prophylaxis is rarely continued beyond 6 months, although it may have to be restarted if UTIs recur.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^9b1d3c33]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Striking a balance between clear benefit to the individual by use of antibiotic prophylaxis and the potential for long-term individual and societal harm from higher frequency of antimicrobial resistance is difficult for patients and clinicians alike. In many countries, prescribers and health-care organisations are encouraged to follow the principles of antibiotic stewardship, which include avoidance of long-term use of antibiotics particularly at sub-bactericidal dosage. For CISC users of both sexes who have repeated UTIs, there do not appear to be any effective alternatives and the situation is further complicated by the high incidence of urinary bacterial colonisation (asymptomatic bacteriuria), which was unaffected by use of antibiotic prophylaxis; these findings are similar to those seen in children using CISC. It could be argued that our data show that the effect of repeated UTIs on patient wellbeing is low, showing few severe infections and little detriment to health status. However, a qualitative study nested within the trial revealed substantial distress that resulted from repeated UTI episodes among a relevant sample of participants, which is in agreement with a previous studyof women seeking treatment for UTIs. Laboratory and clinical studies are required to understand better how continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis works to find ways of preserving benefit but minimising the effect on antimicrobial resistance. This balance is likely to involve careful study of genotypic and phenotypic switching of urinary bacteria from non-invasive colonisers to symptom-causing pathogens and the effects of host response in these changes.

Our data will help clinicians worldwide to provide more accurate information on the benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis in this patient group. These data will aid more balanced decision making for CISC users who have repeated UTIs, considering the degree of individual patient distress and emerging threats from antimicrobial resistance.

### Treatment and prevention of recurrent lower urinary tract infections in women: a rapid review with practice recommendations [^d0f82e05]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recurrent lower urinary tract infections in women are a highly prevalent and burdensome condition for which best practice guidelines for treatment and prevention that minimize harm and optimize well-being are greatly needed. To inform development of practice recommendations, a rapid literature review of original research, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and practice guidelines was conducted.

Materials and Methods

PubMed®, Embase®, Opus, Scopus®, Google Scholar, The Cochrane Library and the U.S. National Guideline Clearinghouse electronic databases were searched from inception to September 22, 2017. Articles and practice guidelines were included if they were in English, were peer reviewed, included women, involved treatment or prevention strategies for recurrent urinary tract infection and reported an outcome related to recurrence rates of urinary tract infection. Critical appraisal of original studies was conducted using the Cochrane risk of bias tool, and of systematic reviews using the AMSTAR 2 tool.

Results

Of 1,582 citations identified 74 met our study inclusion criteria. These comprised 49 randomized controlled trials, 23 systematic reviews (16 with meta-analyses) and 2 practice guidelines. No study reported a multi-targeted treatment approach. There was a lack of high quality studies and systematic reviews evaluating prevention strategies for recurrent urinary tract infection.

Conclusions

We recommend an algorithmic approach to care that includes education on lifestyle and behavioral modifications, and addresses specific populations of women with antimicrobial based and nonantibiotic alternatives. This approach includes the use of vaginal estrogen with or without lactobacillus containing probiotics in postmenopausal women, low dose post-coital antibiotics for recurrent urinary tract infection associated with sexual activity in premenopausal women, low dose daily antibiotic prophylaxis in premenopausal women with infections unrelated to sexual activity, and methenamine hippurate and/or lactobacillus containing probiotics as nonantibiotic alternatives. Future research should involve consistent use of terminology, validated instruments to assess response to interventions and patient perspectives on care. Our treatment algorithm is based on the best available evidence, and fills a gap in the literature and practice regarding effective strategies to prevent recurrent urinary tract infection in women.

### Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline [^9402591c]. The Journal of Urology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for recurrent urinary tract infection in women, more specifically with respect to antibiotic prophylaxis, AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antibiotic prophylaxis, after discussing risks, benefits, and alternatives, to decrease the risk of future UTIs in patients of all ages previously diagnosed with UTIs.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on urological infections: summary of the 2024 guidelines [^5165eba0]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Urological infections significantly impact the wellbeing and quality of life of individuals owing to their widespread occurrence and diverse clinical manifestations. The objective of the guidelines panel was to provide evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and male accessory-gland infections, while addressing crucial public health aspects related to infection control and antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

For the 2024 guidelines on urological infections, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of a thorough medical history and physical examination for patients with urological infections. The guidelines stress the role of antimicrobial stewardship to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance, providing recommendations for antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration on the basis of the latest evidence.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

This overview of the 2024 EAU guidelines offers valuable insights into managing urological infections and are designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology has issued an updated guideline on urological infections. The guidelines provide recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, with a particular focus on minimising antibiotic use because of the increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance.

Discussion

This trial provides clear, robust evidence of the effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis as a preventive strategy against repeated UTIs for adults using CISC who have recurrent UTIs, which we showed over 12 months with three drugs that are licensed in the UK. The lower 95% confidence limit for the risk reduction (39%) in the primary outcome surpassed our prespecified minimal clinically important difference (20%). This confidence limit was also greater than that seen in a previous studyof children. The benefits of prophylaxis were valued by participants in the prophylaxis group, who were satisfied with treatment and most of whom elected to continue prophylaxis long-term. However, the measured health status of participants was not improved from the impaired values at baseline in either group.

Increased development of antimicrobial resistance over the 12-month trial duration in the prophylaxis group is a major concern that limits the appeal of the prophylaxis strategy. This finding was particularly evident for drugs that were used for prophylaxis in the trial but was also seen for other antibiotics that are commonly prescribed for treatment of UTI. This finding was broadly consistent with a trialdone in children.

Summary

Background

Repeated symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) affect 25% of people who use clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC) to empty their bladder. We aimed to determine the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of recurrent UTIs in adult users of CISC.

Methods

In this randomised, open-label, superiority trial, we enrolled participants from 51 UK National Health Service organisations. These participants were community-dwelling (as opposed to hospital inpatient) users of CISC with recurrent UTIs. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) to receive either antibiotic prophylaxis once daily (prophylaxis group) or no prophylaxis (control group) for 12 months by use of an internet-based system with permuted blocks of variable length. Trial and laboratory staff who assessed outcomes were masked to allocation but participants were aware of their treatment group. The primary outcome was the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTIs over 12 months. Participants who completed at least 6 months of follow-up were assumed to provide a reliable estimate of UTI incidence and were included in the analysis of the primary outcome. Change in antimicrobial resistance of urinary and faecal bacteria was monitored as a secondary outcome. The AnTIC trial is registered at ISRCTN, number 67145101; and EudraCT, number 2013-002556-32.

Findings

Between Nov 25, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, we screened 1743 adult users of CISC for eligibility, of whom 404 (23%) participants were enrolled between Nov 26, 2013, and Jan 31, 2016. Of these 404 participants, 203 (50%) were allocated to receive prophylaxis and 201 (50%) to receive no prophylaxis. 1339 participants were excluded before randomisation. The primary analysis included 181 (89%) adults allocated to the prophylaxis group and 180 (90%) adults in the no prophylaxis (control) group. 22 participants in the prophylaxis group and 21 participants in the control group were not included in the primary analysis because they were missing follow-up data before 6 months. The incidence of symptomatic antibiotic-treated UTIs over 12 months was 1·3 cases per person-year (95% CI 1·1–1·6) in the prophylaxis group and 2·6 (2·3–2·9) in the control group, giving an incidence rate ratio of 0·52 (0·44–0·61; p < 0·0001), indicating a 48% reduction in UTI frequency after treatment with prophylaxis. Use of prophylaxis was well tolerated: we recorded 22 minor adverse events in the prophylaxis group related to antibiotic prophylaxis during the study, predominantly gastrointestinal disturbance (six participants), skin rash (six participants), and candidal infection (four participants). However, resistance against the antibiotics used for UTI treatment was more frequent in urinary isolates from the prophylaxis group than in those from the control group at 9–12 months of trial participation (nitrofurantoin 12 [24%] of 51 participants from the prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants from the control group with at least one isolate; p = 0·038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 vs 21 [33%] of 64; p = 0·0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] of 49 vs 15 [24%] of 62; p = 0·002).

Interpretation

Continuous antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing UTI frequency in CISC users with recurrent UTIs, and it is well tolerated in these individuals. However, increased resistance of urinary bacteria is a concern that requires surveillance if prophylaxis is started.

Trial profile

Table 1
Baseline characteristics

During the 12-month study, the incidence of symptomatic antibiotic-treated UTIs in the prophylaxis group was 1·3 cases per person-year (95% CI 1·1–1·6) and 2·6 cases per person-year (2·3–2·9) for no prophylaxis (table 2). The IRR, which accounted for differing durations of follow-up, was 0·52 (95% CI 0·44–0·61; p < 0·0001) in favour of prophylaxis, which indicated a 48% reduction in the incidence of UTIs associated with prophylaxis treatment. The median number of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTIs observed over 12 months was 1 (IQR 0–2) in the prophylaxis group and 2 (1–4) in the control group. In the prophylaxis group, 13 (10%) of 129 UTI reports stated that previously prescribed antibiotics (self-start therapy) were used for treatment compared with 57 (19%) of 299 reports in the no prophylaxis group.

Table 2
Incidence rates and incidence rate ratios of the primary and secondary outcomes, compared between the prophylaxis and control (no prophylaxis) groups

The microbiologically confirmed incidence of UTIs was 0·74 cases per person-year (95% CI 0·58–0·94) in the prophylaxis group and 1·5 cases per person-year (1·3–1·8) in the no prophylaxis group, giving an IRR of 0·49 (0·39–0·60) in favour of prophylaxis (table 2). 110 (61%) of 181 participants in the prophylaxis group and 113 (63%) of 180 participants in the control group had at least one positive 3-monthly surveillance urine culture that indicated a period of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria did not differ between groups.

### Extended treatment-dose antibiotic therapy vs low-dose prophylaxis for the management of recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in peri-and post-menopausal women [^2de3f4cb]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess treatment efficacy over 1year in women with recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) receiving extended treatment-strength antibiotics compared to standard low-dose prophylactic antibiotic regimens.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of adult women presenting with acute uncomplicated UTI between January 1, 2018 and October 1, 2020 meeting recurrent UTI criteria (≥ 2 in 6months or ≥ 3 in 1year). Women were offered either: (1) treatment-strength antibiotic therapy for 1month; or (2) up to 7days of treatment-strength antibiotics followed by ≥ 3-month of low-dose prophylactic antibiotics. We excluded those with complicated UTI. The primary outcome was one or more symptomatic, culture-proven UTIs within 12months. Multivariable logistic regression assessed differences in the primary outcome while controlling for potential confounders.

Results

Among the 246 patients, women receiving extended treatment dose antibiotics (n = 43) had a significantly lower risk of experiencing subsequent UTI within 1year when compared to those receiving standard prophylactic dosing for ≥ 3-month (n = 203) (rate 34.9% vs 59.6%; P < .01). This significant risk reduction was maintained in logistic regression analyses while controlling for potentially confounding variables (aOR 0.42; 95% CI 0.20, 0.89).

Conclusion

Women treated with a 1-month course of treatment-strength antibiotics had a significantly lower risk of subsequent UTI within 12months compared to women receiving ≥ 3-month of prophylactic antibiotics. These retrospective data preliminarily suggest that extended treatment-strength antibiotic dosing may provide therapeutic benefit while reducing overall cumulative antibiotic dose and duration. This innovative approach warrants further evaluation in randomized trials.

Results

Between Nov 25, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, we screened 1743 patients for inclusion in the trial. Between Nov 26, 2013, and Jan 29, 2016, 404 participants were randomly allocated to groups: 203 (50%) participants were allocated to the prophylaxis group and 201 (50%) to the no prophylaxis (control) group (figure 1). 1339 participants were excluded before randomisation. We included 361 (89%) participants in the primary analysis, comprising 181 (89%) participants from the prophylaxis group and 180 (90%) participants from the control group. 22 participants in the prophylaxis group and 21 participants in the control group were not included in the primary analysis because they were missing follow-up data before 6 months. 34 (17%) participants in the prophylaxis group stopped taking antibiotic prophylaxis during the 12-month observation period and 26 (13%) participants allocated to receive no prophylaxis started antibiotic prophylaxis during the 12-month observation period. Of the 34 who stopped prophylaxis, 23 (68%) were in the first 6 months. Of the 26 who started prophylaxis in the no prophylaxis group, 17 (65%) were in the first 6 months. Participants who were given the treatment of the other group were included in the primary analysis, if otherwise eligible, and they were evaluated by their original allocation. The most common reasons for patient withdrawal during the first 12 months were unwillingness to continue with the study, unwillingness to continue as a result of comorbidities, and study burden being too great. Participant characteristics were similar between the groups at baseline (table 1). At 12 months, 77 (78%) of 99 participants allocated to prophylaxis who expressed a preference stated that they wished to continue to receive prophylaxis; in the control group, 83 (80%) of 104 participants stated that they wished to continue without prophylaxis.

Introduction

Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) is defined as repeated UTI with a frequency of at least two episodes in the preceding six months or three episodes in the past year. Acute UTI is most often uncomplicated cystitis and occurs in 50–80% of women in the general population. About one in four women with one UTI episode will go on to develop frequent recurrences, representing a substantial global healthcare problem. An economic analysis from the US described UTI as accounting for more than 6.8 million consultations, 1.3 million emergency department visits, and 245 000 hospital admissions with an annual cost of more than US$2.4bn (£1.8bn; €2.1bn). National and international guidelines acknowledge the need for preventive strategies, and those from the UK, Europe, and US strongly recommend the use of daily, low dose antibiotics as the standard prophylactic treatment for recurrent UTI.

The urgent need for demonstration of effective non-antibiotic treatments is underlined by the UK antimicrobial resistance strategy, which comments that "we are heading rapidly towards a world in which our antibiotics no longer work" and recommends a "strong focus on infection prevention". One aim of this strategy is to reduce antimicrobial use in people by 15% before 2024; to achieve that, exploration of non-antibiotic preventive treatments in common conditions such as UTI is essential. Methenamine hippurate is one such non-antibiotic treatment, which is hydrolysed to formaldehyde in acidic environments such as the distal tubules of the kidney. Formaldehyde is bacteriocidal and works by denaturing bacterial proteins and nucleic acids.

Methenamine hippurate has been evaluated in previous Cochrane systematic reviews, which concluded that "methenamine hippurate may be effective for preventing UTI" but recognised the "need for further large well-conducted RCTs [randomised controlled trials] to clarify". This study aimed to determine whether methenamine hippurate was an effective alternative to the standard treatment of low dose antibiotics for prophylaxis in women with recurrent UTI in a routine clinical setting. We tested the null hypotheses that methenamine hippurate was inferior to daily antibiotics for the prevention of recurrent UTI in women.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common source of morbidity and require significant health care resources for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Antimicrobials represent the mainstay for the treatment of UTIs. Established guidelines exist for the antimicrobial treatment and prevention of uncomplicated UTIs; however, antimicrobial dependence and overuse have led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Nonantimicrobial alternatives are an ongoing area of research and should be considered when clinically appropriate based on available evidence.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in women who experience post-coital UTIs — prophylaxis taken before or after sexual intercourse has been shown to be effective and safe, with a significant reduction in recurrence rates, and intermittent dosing is associated with decreased risk of adverse events including gastrointestinal symptoms and vaginitis. Evidence includes a 1990 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 27 sexually active women with a median age of 23 showing post-coital antibiotics were more effective than placebo in reducing UTI recurrences, and a study of 135 women where post-coital dosing was as effective as daily dosing. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be offered to women with sexual activity-related rUTIs, with recommended instructions to take a single dose of an antibiotic immediately before or after sexual intercourse. Dosing options for prophylaxis include: TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg; TMP-SMX 80 mg/400 mg; Nitrofurantoin 50 to 100 mg; Cephalexin 250 mg.

Antimicrobials reach high urinary concentrations, yet barriers include adherence to a daily regimen, adverse effects, and emergence of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence of effectiveness with a well-tolerated, safe product and parent education are needed; a urinary antiseptic that could be taken indefinitely without resistance is particularly desirable, and probiotics are another possible strategy.

Dosing and duration of prophylactic antibiotics — women with recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) most commonly receive daily dosing; fosfomycin used prophylactically is dosed every 10 days. Intermittent versus daily prophylaxis showed no difference in risk of ≥ 1 UTI (2 studies; RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.50, I2 = 0%); in individual trials, single-dose exposures versus daily antibiotics had RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.51, and single-dose ciprofloxacin after sexual intercourse versus daily dosing had RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.29 to 5.32. Reported prophylaxis duration ranged from 6 to 12 months, while in practice it can be from three to six months to one year with periodic assessment, and continuing prophylaxis for years is not evidence-based. Continuous prophylaxis dosing options include: TMP 100 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg once daily; TMP-SMX 40 mg/200 mg thrice weekly; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 50 mg daily; Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals 100 mg daily; Cephalexin 125 mg once daily; Cephalexin 250 mg once daily; Fosfomycin 3 g every 10 days.

Discussion

This trial has demonstrated that the non-antibiotic preventive treatment for UTI (methenamine hippurate) is not inferior to the current guideline recommended standard (daily, low dose prophylactic antibiotics). This trial adds to the evidence base for the use of methenamine hippurate for prophylactic treatment in adult women with recurrent UTI. Although the methenamine hippurate group had a 55% higher rate of UTI episodes than the antibiotics group, the absolute difference was just 0.49 UTI episodes per year, which has limited clinical consequence.

The risks of long term prophylactic antibiotic treatment have been well recognised in a recent study, which identified the increased risk of antibiotic resistance development in elderly patients receiving this treatment. The authors also described an increased risk of antibiotic associated complications, including Clostridium difficile infection, and concluded that the risks of long term antibiotic prophylaxis might outweigh the benefits in older patients with UTI. Our results could support a change in practice in terms of preventive treatments for recurrent UTI and provide patients and clinicians with a credible alternative to daily antibiotics, giving them the confidence to pursue strategies that avoid long term antibiotic use. The observed numerical difference in clinically diagnosed UTI between the two trial arms, which favoured antibiotic prophylaxis, was small and did not exceed the predefined non-inferiority margin of one episode per person year. This finding was consistent across the modified intention-to-treat, strict intention-to-treat, per protocol, and modified per protocol (post hoc) analyses. The information provided by this trial will allow clinicians and patients to undertake a shared decision making process relating to UTI preventive treatments. The study showed a small numerical difference in UTI incidence between the daily antibiotics and methenamine hippurate groups, but the potential trade-off includes the avoidance of antibiotic consumption, which is closely associated with antimicrobial resistance development.

Prophylactic agents for UTIs

269 residents (18%) used at least one agent for UTI prophylaxis, Table 1. The proportion of residents with UTI prophylaxis varied between 0–50% among the nursing homes. Fifteen percent of the residents in homes for demented patients used prophylaxis for UTI, while 19% were prescribed UTI prophylaxis in long-term somatic and mixed institutions. However the pattern of prophylactic agents did not differ between the different types of institutions. Among residents using prophylactic agents, 74% had one agent prescribed, while 26% were prescribed two, three or four concomitant prophylactic agents, Table 1.

Table 1
Prophylaxis regimes for urinary tract infections in 1473 nursing home residents, number and proportions (%) of all residents and of residents with prophylaxis.

Methenamine was used by 48% of the residents prescribed prophylaxis, vitamin C by 32%, estrogens by 30% and cranberry products by 10%. In women receiving estrogens as prophylactic treatment, 25 (31%) had vaginal administered drugs and the others oral. Trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin were used as prophylaxis for UTIs in 9% of the residents, Table 1.

Dosages of prophylactic agents are shown in Table 2 and were within the recommended dosage range for prevention of UTIs as stated in the summary of product characteristics (SPC) for methenamine, estrogens, trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin. The prescribing of cranberry products appeared to follow suggested dosage by manufacturers in general, though recommendation sheets were not available for every commercial product used. The dosage of vitamin C varied between 60–2000 mg per day.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^00311a5e]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

There was significant variation in the duration of monitoring after catheter removal, ranging from about four days in the study of Pfefferkorn and colleaguesto six weeks in the study by Pinochet and colleagues. Also, various antimicrobial agents were used (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, nitrofurantoin, and a cephalosporin). The duration of prophylaxis ranged from single dose administrationto three day courses. The study by Harding and colleagues also had an arm in which patients were given a 10 day course of antibiotics; this arm was not considered in our meta-analysis because 10 days was thought to represent pre-emptive treatment rather than prophylaxis.

The funnel plot (fig 3) suggests some publication bias, but funnel plots can be difficult to interpret if the number of included studies is small. In addition, asymmetrical funnel plots are not sufficient proof of publication bias. Alternative explanations for asymmetry include heterogeneity between studies with the intervention fidelity or outcome assessment, as well as improved standard of care in the control groups as routine management evolves over time, which reduces the observed effect size. It is also possible that an asymmetric funnel plot is the result of chance alone.

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^384a91d4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in pregnancy — definition, prevalence, and prophylaxis are described, with recurrent UTI defined as "two or more UTIs diagnosed during pregnancy" and occurring in "4–5% of pregnancies". There is "insufficient evidence to guide management after recurrent UTI in pregnancy", but after treatment of a recurrent acute infection, clinicians "may consider initiating antimicrobial urinary suppression for the remainder of the pregnancy, preferably using a lower single daily dose of an antibacterial drug to which the bacterium isolated was susceptible". If prophylaxis is chosen, "two common strategies" are noted: "postcoital or continuous prophylaxis", with postcoital dosing "before or after vaginal intercourse" and continuous prophylaxis taken "once daily". "Common suppressive regimens include nitrofurantoin 100 mg orally daily or cephalexin 250–500 mg orally daily", and "using a lower single daily dose of an antibiotic to which the bacterium isolated was susceptible should be considered".

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to systemic antibiotic prophylaxis, IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend to do not administer systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis routinely to reduce CA-ASB or CA-UTI in patients with short-term

### Probiotics for preventing urinary tract infections in adults and children [^672857be]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common bacterial infection that can lead to significant morbidity including stricture, abscess formation, fistula, bacteraemia, sepsis, pyelonephritis and kidney dysfunction. Mortality rates are reported to be as high as 1% in men and 3% in women due to development of pyelonephritis. Because probiotic therapy is readily available without a prescription, a review of their efficacy in the prevention of UTI may aid consumers in making informed decisions about potential prophylactic therapy. Institutions and caregivers also need evidence-based synopses of current evidence to make informed patient care decisions.

Objectives

Compared to placebo or no therapy, did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality, when used to prevent UTI in susceptible patient populations?Compared to other prophylactic interventions, including drug and non-drug measures (e.g. continuous antibiotic prophylaxis, topical oestrogen, cranberry juice), did probiotics (any formulation) provide a therapeutic advantage in terms of morbidity and mortality when used to prevent UTIs in susceptible patient populations?

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register to 21 September 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of susceptible patients (e.g. past history of UTI) or healthy people in which any strain, formulation, dose or frequency of probiotic was compared to placebo or active comparators were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

All RCTs and quasi-RCTs (RCTs in which allocation to treatment was obtained by alternation, use of alternate medical records, date of birth or other predictable methods) looking at comparing probiotics to no therapy, placebo, or other prophylactic interventions were included. Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

We included nine studies that involved 735 people in this review. Four studies compared probiotic with placebo, two compared probiotic with no treatment, two compared probiotics with antibiotics in patients with UTI, and one study compared probiotic with placebo in healthy women. All studies aimed to measure differences in rates of recurrent UTI. Our risk of bias assessment found that most studies had small sample sizes and reported insufficient methodological detail to enable robust assessment. Overall, there was a high risk of bias in the included studies which lead to inability to draw firm conclusions and suggesting that any reported treatment effects may be misleading or represent overestimates. We found no significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI between patients treated with probiotics and placebo (6 studies, 352 participants: RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.12; I(2) = 23%) with wide confidence intervals, and statistical heterogeneity was low. No significant reduction in the risk of recurrent symptomatic bacterial UTI was found between probiotic and antibiotic treated patients (1 study, 223 participants: RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.33). The most commonly reported adverse effects were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, constipation and vaginal symptoms. None of the included studies reported numbers of participants with at least one asymptomatic bacterial UTI, all-cause mortality or those with at least one confirmed case of bacteraemia or fungaemia. Two studies reported study withdrawal due to adverse events and the number of participants who experienced at least one adverse event. One study reported withdrawal occurred in six probiotic participants (5.2%), 15 antibiotic participants (12.2%), while the second study noted one placebo group participant discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

Authors' Conclusions

No significant benefit was demonstrated for probiotics compared with placebo or no treatment, but a benefit cannot be ruled out as the data were few, and derived from small studies with poor methodological reporting. There was limited information on harm and mortality with probiotics and no evidence on the impact of probiotics on serious adverse events. Current evidence cannot rule out a reduction or increase in recurrent UTI in women with recurrent UTI who use prophylactic probiotics. There was insufficient evidence from one RCT to comment on the effect of probiotics versus antibiotics.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for UTIs in patients with neurogenic bladder… [^9741bfcc]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer Daily antibiotic prophylaxis should not be used in patients with acute and nonacute spinal cord injuries. It does not reduce the incidence of symptomatic UTIs and moderately increases the percentage of resistant cultures. However, in patients with frequent recurrent UTIs that significantly affect daily functioning, prophylaxis using a weekly oral cyclic antibiotic regimen may be beneficial. 1 All patients required intermittent catheterization. Several antibiotic regimens with various dosing schedules were compared with placebo. Antibiotics included oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, oral nitrofurantoin, oral methenamine, oral ciprofloxacin, and bladder instillation of neomycin plus polymyxin B.

2 The average age of participants was 46 years, and 58% were male. Antibiotics were given once per week for at least two years. Patients alternated between two antibiotics taken for a week at a time. Each patient served as his or her own historical control, using at least two years of infection history before the initiation of weekly cyclic antibiotics. To guide the choice of antibiotic, urine culture results were obtained weekly for six weeks before initiating prophylaxis. After two years, the weekly cyclic regimen reduced the number of symptomatic UTIs per patient-year compared with the historical control. Antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the number of febrile UTIs per patient-year from 0. 74 to 0.
31.

The total days requiring antibiotics for curative treatment decreased from 111 days per patient-year before weekly cyclic antibiotics to 14 days per patient-year during the two years of the study. There was no significant difference in drug-resistant colonization of the urine. Copyright © Family Physicians Inquiries Network. Used with permission.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^0ceb91a9]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

This study was designed, conducted, analysed, and reported in accordance with best practice. We recruited participants from a diverse population of CISC users across a range of settings; however, our subsequent analyses found the effectiveness of prophylaxis to be consistent across clinical subgroups, which suggests generalisability across populations of adult users of CISC with similar characteristics in other countries, such as France and the Netherlands. Regarding study design, use of a remote computerised randomisation system ensured concealment of allocation sequence; all likely confounders were balanced across the two groups and their inclusion in the statistical model did not affect the primary result; participants, treating clinicians, and local research staff could not be masked to allocation, but outcome assessors were masked; and we chose participant-reported UTIs as the primary outcome, with a definition that reflected participant experience in terms of UTI symptoms and actions by clinicians to provide a treatment course of an appropriate antibiotic. We also included different opportunities for participant reporting of UTIs and for research staff to confirm episodes at scheduled visits. An absence of participant blinding and reliance on patient report could have risked differential outcome reporting between groups. However, we believe that this possibility was unlikely because UTI reports were cross-checked against data from 3-monthly participant contact and validated against prespecified criteria. Similar findings between microbiologically confirmed UTIs and patient reports gave further reassurance that there was low detection bias. We did not assess the primary outcome in a small number of participants with less than 6 months' follow-up. The number of participants who were excluded from the primary analysis were balanced across groups, and a sensitivity analysis showed that inclusion of all randomised participants did not significantly affect these conclusions.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^012bfd7f]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) — clinicians may offer patient-initiated treatment (self-start treatment) to select rUTI patients with acute episodes while awaiting urine cultures (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C), using shared decision-making; two trials comparing intermittent versus daily self-start dosing found no difference in risk of ≥ 1 UTI over 12 months (2 studies; RR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.50, I2 = 0%), and one trial showed a single antibiotic dose was no different than a short daily course (RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.87 to 1.51).

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^cc40136e]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Limitations inherent to this meta-analysis include the potential for publication bias, although we also included unpublished abstracts in our search. Their quality grading was based on the subjective assessment of two authors. Furthermore, the included studies were distinctly different in design — with diverse populations of patients, choices of antibiotics, durations of prophylaxis, and a heterogeneous observation period after removal of the catheter — so that standardized recommendations are difficult to make. The largest included study was not randomized but instead compared patients of surgeon A (who gave prophylactic antibiotics) with patients of surgeon B (who did not give prophylactic antibiotics); these surgeons' practices and techniques could have differed in many other ways. Also, some of the studies did not use a placebo in the control arm, and patients' assessment and reporting of urinary symptoms could have been affected by their knowledge of treatment status. Lastly, only two of the included studies recorded information on adverse events associated with the antibiotics, such as drug toxicities, allergic reactions, or infections with Clostridium difficile. None of the studies looked at the costs of antibiotic prophylaxis or at emerging antimicrobial resistance. Clinicians must assimilate these uncertainties when weighing advantages and disadvantages of implementing antibiotic prophylaxis after urethral catheterization.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis of available data indicates an overall benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of removal of a urinary catheter to prevent subsequent urinary tract infections. The number needed to treat indicates that 17 patients would need to receive prophylaxis to prevent one symptomatic urinary tract infection. We know little, however, about the potential negative consequences of implementing antibiotic prophylaxis in this setting in a wider frame or indeed which types of patients would be most likely to benefit. Increasing antimicrobial resistance, healthcare costs for antibiotics, and the potential for side effects of antibiotic administration are disadvantages that merit careful review. From a public health standpoint, we should be careful not to encourage antibiotic use when it might not be necessary. The healthcare provider of a catheterized patient, however, might consider antibiotic prophylaxis before catheter removal, after taking individual risk factors into account. Future studies should better characterize who is at risk of developing symptomatic urinary tract infection after catheter removal (whether bacteriuric or not) and then examine antibiotic prophylaxis in those at greatest risk.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^cd59f5b4]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

We provide clear evidence from a robustly planned and conducted randomised controlled trial that antibiotic prophylaxis is effective and potentially efficient for treatment of a wider population of adults who use CISC and have repeated UTIs, regardless of the cause of incomplete bladder emptying. The results give a precise estimate of the degree of benefit that this patient group can expect when they use this intervention. Additionally, we quantify the main drawback of this treatment: increased antimicrobial resistance of the bacteria that colonise urine, urinary pathogens, and the faecal microbiome.

Implications of all the available evidence

The results of our trial reflect similar findings in children to show that adult users of CISC with repeated UTIs, irrespective of the underlying cause of their bladder dysfunction and the presence of other risk factors for UTIs, are likely to benefit from use of antibiotic prophylaxis through reduced frequency of UTIs during 12 months of use. The disadvantage of this approach is that antimicrobial resistance of potential and active pathogens is likely to increase. The long-term implications of this intervention are uncertain, but increased pathogen resistance might make it more difficult to treat established infections in individuals, and increased resistance of bacteria that colonise urine and contribute to the faecal microbiome are a public health concern. The severity of individual patient distress from repeated UTIs and local threats from antimicrobial resistance should simultaneously be considered when appraising and implementing this evidence of benefit of treatment.

The main potential harm of prophylaxis is the development of antimicrobial resistance by urinary pathogens, which would make it more difficult to treat infections and would be a public health concern. Resistance to antibiotics was examined in two of the trials of the Cochrane review, but this review found no difference in antimicrobial resistance between prophylaxis and placebo groups in adults who were admitted to hospital with spinal injury. Increased antimicrobial resistance was found in urinary isolates from children with neural tube defects who were receiving prophylaxis compared with those who had stopped routine prophylaxis.

Datafrom National Health Service (NHS) England showed that 71 million CISC catheters were prescribed for adult use in 2016. Assuming a use of four catheters per person per day, these data imply a prevalence of 74 people who use catheters per 100 000 people, which is similar to the prevalence observed in France (62 users per 100 000 people). Although precise data are unavailable, the prevalence of repeated UTIs that is associated with CISC use is likely to be similar in other countries with sufficient health-care resources.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^8cf5a0b0]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

The meta-analysis indicated an overall reduction in symptomatic urinary tract infection when antibiotic prophylaxis was given, with a risk ratio of 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.72) compared with controls(fig 2). The absolute reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infection was 5.8% (31/665 (4.7%) in the antibiotic prophylaxis group v 90/855 (10.5%) in the control group). The number needed to treat to prevent one symptomatic urinary tract infection was 17 (95% confidence interval 12–30), with low heterogeneity (I 2 = 16%).

Fig 2: Forest plot of seven included studies with 1520 participants on effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter

We repeated the meta-analysis without the single non-randomized study; the risk ratio in the remaining six studies was 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.86) and not different from the main analysis. The meta-analysis was also repeated without the single unpublished trial; the pooled risk ratio was only slightly changed with 0.36 (0.22 to 0.59), again pointing to a benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis. Finally, we limited the analysis to studies conducted with surgical patients, and the risk ratio remained unchanged (0.45; 0.29 to 0.70). In contrast, when we pooled results from the two studies in mixed hospital populationswe found no significant advantage of the intervention (0.44; 0.02 to 9.40).

Recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infection (rUTI) antimicrobial therapy and stewardship — use of new agents and prescribing strategies: "Promising new antimicrobials such as the first oral carbapenem, sulopenem, may also provide outpatient therapies for patients with high multidrug resistance or antibiotic-intolerant individuals at high risk of infection progression", yet "these agents should still be reserved for those with high multidrug resistance". For prescribing practices, "It may be reasonable to consider collaboration with infectious disease specialists before prescribing to reduce unnecessary prescribing". Regarding prevention, "Preliminary data suggests that continuous prophylaxis with low-dose antibiotics leads to lower rates of antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse events than intermittent treatment of symptomatic episodes", while "little is understood about the short- and long-term consequences of antibiotic use, particularly intermittent, high-dose use".

### Common questions about recurrent urinary tract infections in women [^6839a447]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women, including healthy women with normal genitourinary anatomy. Recurrent UTI is typically defined as three or more UTIs within 12 months, or two or more occurrences within six months. The same species that caused previous infections is typically responsible for recurrences. In premenopausal women, sexual intercourse three or more times per week, spermicide use, new or multiple sex partners, and having a UTI before 15 years of age are established risk factors. In postmenopausal women, risk is primarily increased by sequelae of lower estrogen levels. Episodes of recurrent UTI are typically characterized by dysuria and urinary frequency or hesitancy. Findings from the history or physical examination that suggest complicated infection or another disease process warrant additional evaluation. At least one symptomatic episode should be verified by urine culture to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Imaging is rarely warranted. Short courses of antibiotics are as effective as longer courses. Patient-initiated treatment lowers the cost of diagnosis, number of physician visits, and number of symptomatic days compared with physician-initiated treatment. It also reduces antibiotic exposure compared with antibiotic prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis effectively limits UTI recurrence but increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Cranberry products may reduce recurrent UTIs in premenopausal women, but are less effective than antibiotic prophylaxis, and data are conflicting. Optimal dosing is unknown. Postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis may benefit from topical estrogen therapy.

### Management of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections in the older adult [^32876f90]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most frequent bacterial infections diagnosed in older adults and the most common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in nursing homes. Distinguishing between asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI in older adults can be challenging and implementing a systematic approach to diagnosis using standard toolkits or algorithms is recommended for patients residing in post-acute and long-term care settings. This article reviews the pathophysiology, microbiology, diagnostic approach, treatment, and approaches to prophylaxis in the older adult.

### Single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary catheter removal does not reduce the risk of urinary tract infection in surgical patients: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial [^fbfb8bf4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial to assess the effect of single-dose prophylaxis using co-trimoxazole (960 mg) (n = 46) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg) (n = 43) vs. placebo (n = 51) before urinary catheter removal on significant bacteriuria (SBU) (primary outcome) and urinary tract infection (UTI) in surgical patients with scheduled bladder drainage for 3–14 days. SBU was determined directly after catheter removal, and UTI 12–14 days after catheter removal. After 12–14 days, incidences of SBU were 19%, 19% and 33% for patients receiving ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole and placebo, respectively (p ns), and incidences of UTI were 3%, 0% and 3% for patients receiving ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole and placebo, respectively (p ns).

### Compliance to international guidelines and rational use of antibiotics in urinary tract infections in a country without national guidance: a cross-sectional study [^5311e3c1]. BMJ Open Quality (2024). High credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Women are significantly more affected than men: one in three women will have at least one episode of UTI by the age of 24, and roughly 50% of women will experience a UTI in their lifetime.

UTIs are classified according to the site of infection (pyelonephritis, cystitis, urethritis and prostatitis) and the presence of risk factors for complications. While asymptomatic UTIs are left untreated in most cases according to guidelines, the high incidence of symptomatic UTIs that require antibiotics (ATBs) emphasises the need to ensure appropriate therapy with agents that maximise success and minimise the risk of resistance.

According to the WHO, rational drug use requires that patients receive drugs appropriate to their clinical condition, in doses that suit their needs, for an adequate period of time and at the lowest cost for themselves and their community.

### Antibiotics for the prevention of urinary tract infection in children: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^21a07948]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose, long-term antibiotics for the prevention of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in children.

Design

This was a systematic review of randomized controlled trials with a random effects model meta-analysis.

Participants

Five trials involving 463 children were performed.

Results

Three trials (n = 392) evaluated the effectiveness of long treatment courses of antibiotics (2 to 6 months) for children with acute UTI to prevent subsequent, off-treatment infection. Only 2 trials (n = 71) evaluated the effectiveness of long-term, low-dose antibiotics to prevent on-treatment UTI. Very few of the children enrolled in the trials were boys, had abnormal renal tracts, or were infants. The trial quality was poor, with a lack of blinding, and unstated UTI definitions were almost universal. Long-term antibiotic administration reduced the risk of UTI with treatment (relative risk 0.31, 95% confidence limits 0.10 to 1.00), but there was significant heterogeneity (Q = 13.45, P < .01), and there was no sustained benefit once antibiotics had ceased (relative risk 0.79, 0.61 to 1.02).

Conclusions

Methodologic and applicability problems with published trials mean that there is considerable uncertainty about whether long-term, low-dose antibiotic administration prevents UTI in children. Well-designed, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are still required to evaluate this commonly used intervention.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^3891d814]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Procedures

For participants assigned to antibiotic prophylaxis, the drug used was chosen from nitrofurantoin (50 or 100 mg), trimethoprim (100 mg), or cefalexin (250 mg) given orally once daily, depending on previous urine culture results and individuals' history of allergy or intolerance. Methenamine hippurate was prescribed as a twice daily oral dose (1 g). Participants were allowed to switch between antibiotic drugs or between treatment strategies, however, the need to adhere to the allocated intervention was emphasised. Participants experiencing symptomatic UTI episodes were advised to seek discrete treatment courses of antibiotics in their usual way, typically via their general practitioner.

Follow-up assessments took place every three months until month 18. At each visit, participants were asked about the occurrence of any UTIs, treatment adherence, and adverse events. Information on UTI episodes was confirmed where necessary from healthcare records. Blood samples were taken to monitor kidney and liver function in all participants. Urine samples were submitted to the central laboratory at baseline, at scheduled three monthly visits and at the time of UTI episodes. Optional perineal swabs were submitted at baseline and at six monthly routine visits. Participants completed symptom questionnaires every three months and at the time of symptomatic UTI.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^38c236e1]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Implications of promoting antibiotic prophylaxis and ideal target population

Antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of catheter removal could lead to a dramatic increase in consumption of antibiotics in hospital, based on the assumption that at least 20% of patients are catheterized at some point during their hospital stay. Limitation of antibiotic prophylaxis to those patients who are bacteriuric would be logistically challenging because all catheterized patients would need to be screened, and the cost of these screening cultures would be substantial. Certain populations of patients, however, are most likely to benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis on catheter removal, and prophylaxis should be focused on these groups, as acknowledged in the AUA guidelines. Future studies should attempt to identify specific populations at risk for the development of urinary tract infections after catheter removal that would be appropriate targets for antibiotic prophylaxis. Also, the results of our meta-analysis are largely driven by data on surgical patients and short term urinary catheters. Only two studies included non-surgical patients, and their pooled findings indicated no significant difference between intervention and control group. Additional studies should examine medical patients, including those living in long term care facilities, who might be catheterized for longer. Lastly, the benefit of preventing urinary tract infections should be carefully weighed against the additional cost to the hospital of prophylactic antibiotics, the potential for adverse antibiotic effects, and the impact on resistance patterns of uropathogens. Stochastic modeling and cost effectiveness analyses might be ways to guide future decision making.

### D-mannose vs other agents for recurrent urinary tract infection prevention in adult women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0e3903d3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether D-mannose reduces urinary tract infection recurrence (ie, cumulative incidence) in adult women with recurrent urinary tract infection compared with other prevention agents. Secondary outcomes included side effects and compliance with D-mannose use.

Data Sources

Ovid Medline 1946-, Embase 1947-, Scopus 1823-, Cochrane Library, Web of Science 1900-, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through 4/15/2020.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Systematic review inclusion: randomized controlled trials, prospective cohorts, and retrospective cohorts written in English of women ≥ 18 years old with recurrent urinary tract infection in which D-mannose was utilized as an outpatient prevention regimen. Systematic review exclusion: lab or animal-based research, study protocols only, and conference abstracts. Meta-analysis inclusion: stated D-mannose dose, follow-up time ≥ 6 months, a comparison arm to D-mannose, and data available from women ≥ 18 years of age.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods

Two independent reviewers made abstract, full text, and data extraction decisions. Study methodologic quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Relative risks, confidence intervals, and heterogeneity were computed.

Results

Searches identified 776 unique citations. Eight publications met eligibility: 2 using D-mannose only; 6 using D-mannose combined with another treatment. Seven studies were prospective: 2 randomized controlled trials, 1 randomized cross-over trial, and 4 prospective cohort studies. One retrospective cohort study was included. Three studies met meta-analysis eligibility (1 randomized controlled trial, 1 randomized cross-over trial, and 1 prospective cohort). Pooled relative risk of urinary tract infection recurrence comparing D-mannose to placebo was 0.23 (95% confidence interval, 0.14–0.37; heterogeneity = 0%; D-mannose n = 125, placebo n = 123). Pooled relative risk of urinary tract infection recurrence comparing D-mannose to preventative antibiotics was 0.39 (95% confidence interval, 0.12–1.25; heterogeneity = 88%; D-mannose n = 163, antibiotics n = 163). Adverse side effects were reported in 2 studies assessing D-mannose only (1 study (n = 10) reported none; the other reported a low incidence (8/103 participants) of diarrhea). Two studies reported compliance, which was high.

Conclusion

D-mannose appears protective for recurrent urinary tract infection (vs placebo) with possibly similar effectiveness as antibiotics. Overall, D-mannose appears well tolerated with minimal side effects-only a small percentage experiencing diarrhea. Meta-analysis interpretation must consider the small number of studies with varied study design and quality and the overall small sample size.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^29cb5ad6]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — antibiotic prophylaxis evidence synthesis: the systematic review identified 28 trials evaluating antibiotics for prevention of rUTI, most were rated as medium to high risk of bias, and sample sizes ranged from 26 to 308 (total N = 2,758). These trials demonstrated that antibiotics perform better than placebo with consistent results across antibiotics, and the duration of preventive treatment ranged from 6 to 12 months. When comparing prophylactic antibiotic use to placebo or no antibiotics, antibiotics were associated with a decreased likelihood of experiencing ≥ 1 UTI recurrence (11 studies; RR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.37; I2 = 14%; absolute risk difference [ARD]: -46%, 95% CI: -56% to -37%). Because most relevant randomized controlled trials were published prior to 1995, results should be interpreted in light of current resistance patterns.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^5e79df27]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of removal of a urinary catheter reduces the risk of subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published before November 2012 identified through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library; conference abstracts for 2006–12 were also reviewed.

Inclusion criteria Studies were included if they examined antibiotic prophylaxis administered to prevent symptomatic urinary tract infection after removal of a short term (≤ 14 days) urinary catheter.

Results Seven controlled studies had symptomatic urinary tract infection after catheter removal as an endpoint; six were randomized controlled trials (five published; one in abstract form) and one was a non-randomized controlled intervention study. Five of these seven studies were in surgical patients. Studies were heterogeneous in the type and duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis and the period of observation. Overall, antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with benefit to the patient, with an absolute reduction in risk of urinary tract infection of 5.8% between intervention and control groups. The risk ratio was 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.72). The number needed to treat to prevent one urinary tract infection was 17 (12 to 30).

Conclusions Patients admitted to hospital who undergo short term urinary catheterization might benefit from antimicrobial prophylaxis when the catheter is removed as they experience fewer subsequent urinary tract infections. Potential disadvantages of more widespread antimicrobial prophylaxis (side effects and cost of antibiotics, development of antimicrobial resistance) might be mitigated by the identification of which patients are most likely to benefit from this approach.

### Evaluation of a therapeutic vaccine for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections versus prophylactic treatment with antibiotics [^58e303ba]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Continuous prophylaxis with antibiotics is the recommended initial therapy for RUTIs. Sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) for a period of 6 months is the most commonly recommended option. However, the continuous use of antibiotics is not free of risk. Multiresistance of the bacteria to antibiotics is widely increasing, which creates the dramatic situation that more than 40% of the bacterial strains are resistant to available antibiotics in some regions of the world. An added problem is the high incidence of adverse reactions associated with the use of antibiotics and other chemotherapeutics.

Therefore, it is reasonable to consider other preventive strategies such as those that reinforce the natural mechanisms of pathogen defense.

The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical benefit obtained with the prophylactic use of a bacterial-based sublingual vaccine (Uromune®) compared with prophylactic treatment with SMX/TMP to prevent recurrences of UTIs.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^e6c64aa2]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

In the ALTAR trial, we have demonstrated high levels of efficacy from methenamine hippurate in terms of UTI prevention, and have shown that this efficacy is comparable to the current guideline recommended prophylaxis (that is, long course, low dose antibiotic treatment). The increased rates of antimicrobial resistance development associated with the antibiotic arm as shown in the primary uropathogen E coli might encourage patients and clinicians to consider methenamine hippurate as a first line treatment for UTI prevention in women.

### Lomefloxacin hydrochloride (Maxaquin) [^e2796c33]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Prevention / prophylaxis

Maxaquin is indicated preoperatively for the prevention of infection in the following situations:

Transrectal prostate biopsy: to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infection, in the early and late postoperative periods (3–5 days and 3–4 weeks postsurgery).
Transurethral surgical procedures: to reduce the incidence of urinary tract infection in the early postoperative period (3–5 days postsurgery).

Efficacy in decreasing the incidence of infections other than urinary tract infection has not been established. Maxaquin, like all drugs for prophylaxis of transurethral surgical procedures, usually should not be used in minor urologic procedures for which prophylaxis is not indicated (eg, simple cystoscopy or retrograde pyelography). (See Dosage and Administration.)

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Maxaquin and other antibacterial drugs, Maxaquin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for transperineal prostate biopsy [^cab41192]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We will follow the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) standards when conducting this review, and the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 when reporting the review conduct and findings.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include all prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluate any prophylactic antibiotic regimen compared to placebo or no treatment in men undergoing transperineal prostate biopsy. We will include studies regardless of their publication status, year of dissemination, or language of publication. We will exclude quasi‐RCTs and cluster‐RCTs.

Another Cochrane review protocol investigating povidone‐iodine rectal cleansing for transrectal prostate biopsy is currently under development by a separate team with some authors in common. These reviews address similar topics and are being conducted in parallel.

Types of participants

Men undergoing transperineal needle biopsy of the prostate for evaluation for prostate cancer or tissue diagnosis of a known lesion (e.g. for active surveillance).

Exclusion criteria

Presence of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) prior to antibiotic prophylaxis or history of hypersensitivity to antibiotics used in the study
Significant gastrointestinal (GI) disease or inability to tolerate or absorb oral medication
Presence of indwelling bladder catheters
History of endoscopic manipulation of the urinary tract within seven days of trial enrolment
Antibiotics given during the preceding 10 days (for other indications)
People taking antibiotic prophylaxis or treatment for other health conditions (e.g. prosthetic cardiac valves, endovascular stents, hip replacement)

If we identify studies in which only a subset of participants are relevant to this review, we will include it if data are available separately for the relevant subset.

Types of interventions

We plan to investigate the following comparisons of experimental intervention versus comparator intervention. Any concomitant interventions must be the same in the experimental and comparator groups in order to establish fair comparisons.

Experimental interventions

Prophylactic antibiotics of any dosage, on any schedule, and administered by any route

Comparator interventions

Placebo/no antibiotic prophylaxis

Comparisons

Antibiotics prophylaxis versus placebo/no antibiotic prophylaxis
Head‐to‐head comparisons of different antibiotic prophylaxis regimens Different classes of antibiotics Oral versus systemic administration Single dose versus multiple dose

### Long-term antibiotics for preventing recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^81acdbfa]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in children. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. UTI is caused by Escherichia coli in over 80% of cases and treatment is a course of antibiotics. Due to acute illness caused by UTI and the risk of pyelonephritis-induced permanent kidney damage, many children are given long-term (several months to 2 years) antibiotics aimed at preventing recurrence. This is the third update of a review first published in 2001 and updated in 2006, and 2011.

Objectives

To assess whether long-term antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective than placebo/no treatment in preventing recurrence of UTI in children, and if so which antibiotic in clinical use was the most effective. We also assessed the harms of long-term antibiotic treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 30 July 2018 through contact with the Cochrane Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Selection Criteria

Randomised comparisons of antibiotics with other antibiotics, placebo or no treatment to prevent recurrent UTI in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed and extracted information for the initial and previous updates. A random-effects model was used to estimate risk ratio (RR) and risk difference (RD) for recurrent UTI with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

In this update sixteen studies (2036 children randomised, 1977 analysed) were included. Seven studies (612 children) compared two or more types of antibiotics, six (1088 children) compared antibiotics with placebo or no treatment, one four-armed study compared circumcision with and without antibiotic treatment, one study compared dose of antibiotic, and one three-armed study compared two different antibiotics as well as no treatment. Of the sixteen included studies only one study was judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains, with the majority judged to be at unclear risk of bias due to very poorly reported methodology. The number of studies judged to be a low risk of bias was: selection bias (7); performance bias (4); detection bias (1); attrition bias (6); reporting bias (7); and other bias (2). The number of studies judged to be at high risk of bias was: selection bias (0); performance bias (5); detection bias (1); attrition bias (4); reporting bias (6); and other bias (1). Compared to placebo/no treatment, antibiotics lead to a modest decrease in the number of repeat symptomatic UTI in children; however the estimate from combining all studies was not certain and the confidence interval indicates low precision indicating that antibiotics may make little or no difference to risk of repeat infection (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98). When we combined only the data from studies with concealed treatment allocation, there was a similar reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children taking antibiotics (RR 0.68) and we have greater certainty in this estimate because of the more robust study designs, the confidence interval is smaller and it does not include the point of no effect (95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). The estimated reduction in risk of repeat symptomatic UTI for children taking antibiotics was similar in children with vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.07) compared to those without VUR (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.12) however there was considerable uncertainty due to imprecision from fewer events in the smaller group of children with VUR. There was no consistency in occurrence of adverse events, with one study having more events in the placebo group and a second study having more events in the antibiotics group. Three studies reported data for antibiotic resistance with the analysis estimating the risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic being almost 2.5 times greater in children on antibiotics than for children on placebo or no treatment (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.62 to 9.26). However the confidence interval is wide, showing imprecision and there may be little or no difference between the two groups. Eight studies involving 659 children compared one antibiotic with another but few studies compared the same combination for the same outcome so little data could be pooled. Two studies reported microbial resistance data and analysis showed that treatment with nitrofurantoin may lead to a lower risk of a UTI caused by a bacteria resistant to the treatment drug compared to children given trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole as their prophylactic treatment (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.92).

Authors' Conclusions

Long-term antibiotics may reduce the risk of repeat symptomatic UTI in children who have had one or more previous UTIs but the benefit may be small and must be considered together with the increased risk of microbial resistance.

Table 4
Number of adverse events associated with prophylactic and treatment antibiotics

The conclusion of the primary analysis was unchanged when removing duration of antibiotic course for UTI treatment from the evaluation (IRR 0·50; 95% CI 0·43–0·58). This result was also unaffected by inclusion of the stratification factors (sex, previous frequency of UTIs, neurological bladder dysfunction) and other possible confounders (age, functional cause of poor bladder emptying, use of non-hydrophilic catheter, frequency of CISC, use of prophylaxis in previous 12 months, kidney function, and baseline bacteriuria) in the model. Sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome that used negative binomial regression with a strict intention-to-treat definition gave very similar results (negative binomial regression: IRR 0·52, 95% CI 0·42–0·65; p < 0·0001; strict-intention-to-treat analysis: 0·53, 0·45–0·62; p < 0·0001).

### Cranberry for prevention of urinary tract infections [^74328b45]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Traditionally, cranberry has been used for the treatment and prophylaxis of urinary tract infections. Research suggests that its mechanism of action is preventing bacterial adherence to host cell surface membranes. Systematic reviews have concluded that no reliable evidence supports the use of cranberry in the treatment or prophylaxis of urinary tract infections; however, more recent, randomized controlled trials demonstrate evidence of cranberry's utility in urinary tract infection prophylaxis. Supporting studies in humans are lacking for other clinical uses of cranberry. Cranberry is a safe, well-tolerated herbal supplement that does not have significant drug interactions.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^08c4671e]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

This pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, open label, non-inferiority trial compared clinical effectiveness of low dose antibiotic prophylaxis, the current standard treatment for recurrent UTI prevention, with the urinary antiseptic methenamine hippurate. The ALTAR trial (alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women) recruited women from secondary care urology and urogynaecology centres in the UK from June 2016 and incorporated a 12 month treatment period followed by a six month follow-up period. Recruitment was completed in June 2018 and the final follow-up visit took place in January 2020. The study protocol has been published elsewhere.

Participants

Adult women aged 18 years and over with recurrent UTI who had decided, in conjunction with their responsible clinician, that prophylaxis was appropriate, were eligible for inclusion. Recurrent UTI was defined as at least three episodes of symptomatic UTI in the previous 12 months or at least two episodes in the past six months. We excluded women with correctable urinary tract abnormalities contributory to recurrent UTI (eg, urinary tract calculi) and those with neurogenic dysfunction of the lower urinary tract. Women already taking antibiotic prophylaxis or methenamine hippurate were allowed to take part, but a washout period of three months without preventive treatment was required before randomisation. All participants provided written informed consent.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive antibiotic prophylaxis or methenamine hippurate. Permuted blocks of variable length (2/4/6/8) were used, stratified by menopausal status (pre-menopausal v peri-menopausal/post-menopausal) and UTI frequency in the preceding year (< 4 v ≥ 4). Randomisation lists were generated by an individual not otherwise involved in the trial and administered centrally via a web based service. This pragmatic trial was designed to reflect contemporary practice, and there was no masking of participants, clinicians, or local research staff.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and recurrent urinary tract infection in children [^181ca32d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2009). Excellent credibility.

Background

Antibiotics are widely administered to children with the intention of preventing urinary tract infection, but adequately powered, placebo-controlled trials regarding efficacy are lacking. This study from four Australian centers examined whether low-dose, continuous oral antibiotic therapy prevents urinary tract infection in predisposed children.

Methods

We randomly assigned children under the age of 18 years who had had one or more microbiologically proven urinary tract infections to receive either daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole suspension (as 2 mg of trimethoprim plus 10 mg of sulfamethoxazole per kilogram of body weight) or placebo for 12 months. The primary outcome was microbiologically confirmed symptomatic urinary tract infection. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed with the use of time-to-event data.

Results

From December 1998 to March 2007, a total of 576 children (of 780 planned) underwent randomization. The median age at entry was 14 months; 64% of the patients were girls, 42% had known vesicoureteral reflux (at least grade III in 53% of these patients), and 71% were enrolled after the first diagnosis of urinary tract infection. During the study, urinary tract infection developed in 36 of 288 patients (13%) in the group receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (antibiotic group) and in 55 of 288 patients (19%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the antibiotic group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.93; P = 0.02 by the log-rank test). In the antibiotic group, the reduction in the absolute risk of urinary tract infection (6 percentage points) appeared to be consistent across all subgroups of patients (P ≥ 0.20 for all interactions).

Conclusions

Long-term, low-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a decreased number of urinary tract infections in predisposed children. The treatment effect appeared to be consistent but modest across subgroups. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number, ACTRN12608000470392.)

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^15bdb3d9]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — D‑mannose prophylaxis shows no clinical benefit and is not recommended. A high‑quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) (N = 598) of D‑mannose 2 g/day versus placebo found no difference in UTI recurrence and no differences in microbiological recurrence, prescribed antibiotics, UTI‑related symptoms, or hospital admissions; a small RCT (N = 44) adding D‑mannose to topical estrogen also showed no difference. Adverse events were mild and mostly gastrointestinal, and while administration is unlikely to do harm, the guideline states it "cannot be recommended".

### Antimicrobial agents for preventing urinary tract infections in adults undergoing cystoscopy [^1aed7d31]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cystoscopy is commonly performed for diagnostic purposes to inspect the interior lining of the bladder. One disadvantage of cystoscopy is the risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) due to pre-existing colonization or by introduction of bacteria at the time of the procedure. However, the incidence of symptomatic UTI following cystoscopy is low. Currently, there is no consensus on whether antimicrobial agents should be used to prevent symptomatic UTI for cystoscopy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antimicrobial agents compared with placebo or no treatment for prevention of UTI in adults undergoing cystoscopy.

Search Methods

We comprehensively searched electronic databases of the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and CINAHL. We searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials. We used no language or date restrictions in the electronic searches. We searched the reference lists of identified articles and contacted authors for related information. The last search of the electronic databases was 4 February 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared any prophylactic antibiotic versus placebo, no treatment, or other non-antibiotic prophylaxis in adults undergoing cystoscopy. There was no restriction on the dose, frequency, formulation, duration, or mode of administration of the antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were systemic UTI, symptomatic UTI (composite of systemic and/or localized UTI), and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were minor adverse events, localized UTI, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and bacterial resistance. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs and two quasi-RCTs with 7711 participants, all of which compared antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no treatment control. We found no studies comparing antibiotic prophylaxis with non-antibiotic prophylaxis. Primary outcomesSystemic UTI: antibiotic prophylaxis may have little or no effect on the risk of systemic UTI compared with placebo or no treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 3.32; 5 RCTs; 504 participants; low-quality evidence); this corresponds to two more people (95% CI 12 fewer to 46 more) per 1000 people developing a systemic UTI. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Symptomatic UTI: antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.86; 11 RCTs; 5441 participants; low-quality evidence); this corresponds to 30 fewer people (95% CI 42 fewer to 8 fewer) per 1000 people developing a symptomatic UTI when provided with antibiotic prophylaxis. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and potential publication bias. Serious adverse events: the studies reported no serious adverse events in either the intervention group or control group and no effect size could be calculated. Antibiotic prophylaxis may have little or no effect on serious adverse events (4 RCTs, 630 participants; very low-quality evidence), but we are very uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and very serious imprecision. Secondary outcomesMinor adverse events: prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on minor adverse events when compared with placebo or no treatment (RR 2.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 14.80; 4 RCTs; 630 participants; low-quality evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Localized UTI: prophylactic antibiotics may have little or no effect on the risk of localized UTI (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.77; 1 RCT; 200 participants; very low-quality evidence), but we were very uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations and very serious imprecision. Bacterial resistance: prophylactic antibiotics may increase bacterial resistance (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.87; 38 participants; 2 RCTs; very low-quality evidence), but we were uncertain of this finding. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for study limitations, indirectness, and imprecision. We were able to perform few secondary analyses; these did not suggest any subgroup effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis may reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI but not systemic UTIs. Serious and minor adverse events may not be increased with the use of antibiotic prophylaxis. The findings are informed by low- and very low-quality evidence ratings for all outcomes.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^a5b4c76c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

At baseline, the groups did not differ in frequency of antimicrobial resistance of urinary isolates to eight oral antibiotics that are commonly used for UTI treatment. During the 12-month trial, resistance appeared more common in isolates that were cultured from urine submitted during symptomatic UTIs by participants in the prophylaxis group than those in the control group (figure 2). In urine samples submitted during asymptomatic periods between months 9 and 12 of the trial, resistance to nitrofurantoin (12 [24%] of 51 participants with at least one isolate from the prophylaxis group vs six [9%] of 64 participants with at least one isolate from the control group; p = 0·038), trimethoprim (34 [67%] of 51 participants vs 21 [33%] of 64 participants; p = 0·0003), and co-trimoxazole (26 [53%] of 49 participants vs 15 [24%] of 62 participants; p = 0·002) was significantly more frequent in the prophylaxis group than the control group. Over baseline and subsequent 3-monthly intervals during the 12-month trial period, resistance to amoxicillin (38 [52%] of 73 participants, 25 [74%] of 34 participants, 31 [82%] of 38 participants, 32 [74%] of 43 participants, and 37 [76%] of 49 participants; p = 0·004), cephalexin (11 [14%] of 78 participants, ten [25%] of 40 participants, 13 [32%] of 41 participants, 17 [38%] of 45 participants, and 16 [31%] of 51 participants; p = 0·005), co-trimoxazole (18 [25%] of 73 participants, 23 [59%] of 39 participants, 14 [37%] of 38 participants, 21 [48%] of 44 participants, 26 [53%] of 49 participants; p = 0·006), and trimethoprim (32 [42%] of 77 participants, 31 [79%] of 39 participants, 25 [63%] of 40 participants, 27 [63%] of 43 participants, 34 [67%] of 51 participants; p = 0·016) also significantly increased in isolates from urine specimens that were submitted during asymptomatic periods by participants in the prophylaxis group. There was no evidence of increasing resistance over time in the control group. Resistance of urinary isolates that were submitted during asymptomatic periods appeared to decrease at 18 months. There was no evidence that E coli isolated from perianal swabs of participants in the prophylaxis group had significantly more frequent resistance against any of the eight antibiotics tested than did participants in the control group at 6–12 months of the trial.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^d43ebe27]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Economic evaluation suggested that, on average, a strategy of antibiotic prophylaxis was more effective and more costly than no prophylaxis. The incremental cost was £99 per UTI avoided (table 3). There was a 60% chance that prophylaxis would be cost-effective should society be willing to pay £200 to avoid a UTI. The incremental cost per QALY over 12 months was £5059 (as determined by the cost-utility analysis). In the probabilistic analysis, the likelihood that use of prophylaxis would be considered cost-effective at a threshold value of £20 000 per QALY was 64%. Adjustment for utility values that were recorded at the time of UTI gave similar results. A probabilistic sensitivity evaluation from the willingness to pay analysis suggested that use of prophylaxis has a 66% chance of being considered more efficient and would give a higher net benefit than a no prophylaxis strategy if society was prepared to pay £200 or more to avoid a UTI.

Table 3
Results of deterministic and probabilistic cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, and cost-benefit analyses

19 (9%) participants in the prophylaxis group reported 22 non-serious adverse events due to antibiotic prophylaxis (table 4) and 13 (6%) of these 19 participants changed their originally selected agent or stopped prophylaxis during the 12-month trial. The incidence of adverse events with all three drugs used for prophylaxis was similar. At each of the 3-monthly reviews, less than 10% of participants in the prophylaxis group perceived adverse effects to be due to the use of prophylactic antibiotics. At the time of UTI, 28 (14%) of 203 participants in the prophylaxis group reported ever having adverse events due to treatment antibiotics versus 60 (30%) of 201 participants in the no prophylaxis group — predominately nausea (20 [10%] of 203 vs 38 [19%] of 201), diarrhoea (13 [6%] of 203 vs 31 [15%] of 201), and candida infection (ten [5%] of 203 vs 19 [10%] of 201). The low numbers of adverse events in each category precluded statistical analysis.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis at urinary catheter removal prevents urinary tract infections: a prospective randomized trial [^8ddb6108]. Annals of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess whether antibiotic prophylaxis at urinary catheter removal reduces the rate of urinary tract infections.

Summary Of Background Data

Urinary tract infections are among the most common nosocomial infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis at urinary catheter removal is used as a measure to prevent them, albeit without supporting evidence.

Methods

A prospective randomized study enrolled 239 patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery, who were randomized either for receiving 3 doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at urinary catheter removal, or not. Urinary tract infections were diagnosed according to Center of Disease Control definitions. Urinary cultures were obtained before and 3 days after catheter removal. Subjective symptoms were assessed by an independent study-blind urologist.

Results

Patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis showed significantly fewer urinary tract infections (5/103, 4.9%) than those without prophylaxis (22/102, 21.6%), P < 0.001. The absolute risk reduction for the occurrence of a urinary tract infection was 16.7%; the relative risk reduction was 77.5%, and the number needed to treat was 6. Patients with antibiotic prophylaxis also had less significant bacteriuria 3 days after catheter removal (17/103, 16.5%) than those without (42/102, 41.2%), P < 0.001.

Conclusions

Antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole on urinary catheter removal significantly reduces the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infections and bacteriuria in patients undergoing abdominal surgery with perioperative transurethral urinary catheters.

### Prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies [^0b8740f5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

There is a risk that people who have invasive urodynamic studies (cystometry) will develop urinary tract infections or bacteria in the urine or blood. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics before or immediately after invasive cystometry or urodynamic studies is not without risks of adverse effects and emergence of resistant microbes.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of administering prophylactic antibiotics in reducing the risk of urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies. The hypothesis was that administering prophylactic antibiotics reduces urinary tract infections after urodynamic studies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trial Register, MEDLINE (January 1966 to January 2009), CINAHL (January 1982 to January 2009), EMBASE (January 1966 to January 2009), PubMed (1 January 1980 to January 2009), LILACS (up to January 2009), TRIP database (up to January 2009), and the UK NHS Evidence Health Information Resources (searched 10 December 2009). We searched the reference lists of relevant articles, the primary trials and the proceedings of the International Urogynaecological Association International Continence Society and the American Urological Association for the years 1999 to 2009 to identify articles not captured by electronic searches. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials comparing the use of prophylactic antibiotics versus a placebo or no treatment in patients having urodynamic studies were selected. Two authors (PL and RF) independently performed the selection of trials for inclusion and any disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Data Collection and Analysis

All assessments of the quality of trials and data extraction were performed independently by two authors of the review (PL and RF) using forms designed according to Cochrane guidelines. We attempted to contact authors of the included trials for any missing data. Data were extracted on characteristics of the study participants including details of previously administered treatments, interventions used, the methods used to measure infection and adverse events. Statistical analyses were performed according to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. Data from intention-to-treat analyses were used where available. For the dichotomous data, results for each study were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and combined for meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The primary outcome was urinary tract infection. Heterogeneity was assessed by the P value and I(2) statistic.

Main Results

Nine randomized controlled trials involving the prophylactic use of antibiotics in patients having urodynamic studies were identified and these included 973 patients in total; one study was an abstract. Two further trials were excluded from the review. The methods of the included trials were poorly described. The primary outcome in all trials was the rate of developing significant bacteriuria, defined as the presence of more than 100,000 bacteria per millilitre of a mid-stream urine sample on culture and sensitivity testing. The other outcomes included pyrexia, haematuria, dysuria and adverse reactions to antibiotics. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics when compared to a placebo reduced the risk of significant bacteriuria (4% with antibiotics versus 12% without, risk ratio (RR) 0.35, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.56) in both men and women. The administration of prophylactic antibiotics also reduced the risk of haematuria (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.91). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome, risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (40/201, 20% versus 59/214, 28%; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.03); or in the risk of fever (RR 5.16, 95% CI 0.94 to 28.16) or dysuria (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.36). Only two of 135 people had an adverse reaction to the antibiotics. The number of patients needed to treat with antibiotics to prevent bacteriuria was 12.3. Amongst women, the number needed to treat to prevent bacteriuria was 13.4; while amongst men it was 9.1 (number needed to treat = 1/ absolute risk reduction).

Authors' Conclusions

Prophylactic antibiotics did reduce the risk of bacteriuria after urodynamic studies but there was not enough evidence to suggest that this effect reduced symptomatic urinary tract infections. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of fever, dysuria or adverse reactions. Potential benefits have to be weighed against clinical and financial implications, and the risk of adverse effects.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^1d3884da]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

We considered a 20% reduction in average UTI frequency from three to 2·4 episodes per year to represent the minimal clinically important difference. Use of the Poisson rate test (for the primary analysis) required 158 participants in each group (316 in total) to complete the study, giving 90% power at the 5% significance level for detection of superiority of prophylaxis over no prophylaxis, which we increased to 372 to allow 15% attrition.

The primary measure of effect was the relative difference in the incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic-treated UTIs between the two groups during the 12-month observation period. All participants who completed at least 6 months of follow-up were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, to report the comparative UTI incidence between groups, which we calculated as the incidence rate ratio (IRR) to allow for differing durations of follow-up.

The incidence of resistance over time to oral antibiotics that are commonly used against UTIs — amoxicillin, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, co-amoxiclav, mecillinam, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim — were summarised graphically by group. A χ 2 test was used to compare bacterial resistance rates between prophylaxis and control groups by examination of all isolates from surveillance urine specimens collected between 9 and 12 months and in strains of E coli isolated from perianal swabs between 6 and 12 months. Tests for trend of change in antimicrobial resistance were done separately for each group for isolates from surveillance urine.

Univariate analysis of change in kidney and liver function was done with a two-sample t test with additional analysis of covariance that used the covariates identified during the primary outcome modelling.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^9cd4c681]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

The effectiveness of continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis against UTIs in users of CISC who had repeated episodes increases the number of patient groups with repeated or chronic infections who have been shown to benefit from this strategy. The increased frequency of antimicrobial resistance in potential urinary pathogens to antibiotics that are used for treatment of UTIs is a concern for individuals and for public health. Increased resistance occurred in the prophylaxis group despite reduced use of antibiotics to treat symptomatic UTIs. The mechanism by which low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis provides a benefit is uncertain. Our results show that episodes of symptomatic UTIs (indicating infection with urinary pathogens) are suppressed while the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (indicating urinary colonisation) was unchanged. It is possible that pathogenic bacterial strains with particular virulence factors are preferentially targeted by low-dose continuous therapy, or changes in the host response might be induced, allowing tolerance of colonisers but eradication of pathogens. Alternatively, bacteria colonising the bladder could be protected in specific niches that cannot be accessed by low urinary concentrations of antibiotic.

Evidence-based alternative ways of reducing the risk of UTIs and the severity of symptoms in women include non-antibiotic prophylaxis with methenamine hippurateand vaginal oestrogen supplementation; however, neither has been tested for CISC users. Frequency of use of non-antibiotic preventative strategies was similar in both groups of this trial: increased fluid intake, increased frequency of catheterisation, and ingestion of cranberry products and probiotics were the most popular interventions (data not shown). Cranberry extracts, although often taken, do not appear effective in reducing the risk of UTIs in CISC users.

An alternative antibiotic-based strategy is so-called self-start therapy, whereby patients have a supply of antibiotics at home and can start a treatment course when their typical symptoms occur. In the present trial, participants in the control group reported self-start therapy to be the source of their treatment antibiotics more often than the prophylaxis group, but we cannot speculate further from these data as to whether this treatment option is a viable alternative to continuous prophylaxis in our trial population.

### Treatment of bacterial urinary tract infections: presence and future [^2aca5aa2]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs) are frequent infections in the outpatient as well as in the nosocomial setting. The stratification into uncomplicated and complicated UTIs has proven to be clinically useful. Bacterial virulence factors on the one side and the integrity of the host defense mechanisms on the other side determine the course of the infection. In uncomplicated UTIs Escherichia coli is the leading organism, whereas in complicated UTIs the bacterial spectrum is much broader including Gram-negative and Gram-positive and often multiresistant organisms. The therapy of uncomplicated UTIs is almost exclusively antibacterial, whereas in complicated UTIs the complicating factors have to be treated as well. There are two predominant aims in the antimicrobial treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated UTIs: (i) rapid and effective response to therapy and prevention of recurrence of the individual patient treated; (ii) prevention of emergence of resistance to antimicrobial chemotherapy in the microbial environment. The main drawback of current antibiotic therapies is the emergence and rapid increase of antibiotic resistance. To combat this development several strategies can be followed. Decrease the amount of antibiotics administered, optimal dosing, prevention of infection and development of new antibiotic substances. The aim of this review is to highlight the current and to describe future treatment options for UTIs.

### Continuous low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for adults with repeated urinary tract infections (AnTIC): a randomised, open-label trial [^e21c18f5]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Randomisation and masking

Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either antibiotic prophylaxis (experimental) or no prophylaxis (control). Randomisation was done centrally by an internet-based system that used permuted random blocks of variable length (two, four, and six). A statistician that was not otherwise involved with the study produced the final allocation schedule, including stratification by three variables: previous frequency of UTIs (less than four episodes per year vs at least four episodes per year), a diagnosis of neurological dysfunction of the lower urinary tract, and sex. Clinical trial unit staff and central laboratory staff who were assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. By necessity, participants, treating clinicians, and local research staff were masked to block size but not to allocation. For those allocated to prophylaxis, the clinician started the patient on a study drug for UTI prophylaxis that was suitable to the individual. The drugs given were 50 mg nitrofurantoin, 100 mg trimethoprim, or 250 mg cefalexin. These drugs were prescribed to be taken once daily and were supplied by the standard NHS mechanisms and manufacturers licensed by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^101e3416]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection prophylaxis — additional 2022 studies of cranberry often showed no difference, with very low strength of evidence. Four additional studies addressed cranberry prophylaxis, including combinations with other non-antibiotic agents and a dose comparison that did not show differences in UTI recurrences or adverse events; a cranberry + D‑mannose + Lactobacillus trial also did not show differences versus no treatment. A fourth study of high-dose cranberry combined with Lactobacillus and vitamin A reported fewer recurrences with treatment (9.1% versus 33.3%; p = 0.0053), but this did not impact the Guideline statement because it combined cranberry with two other substances.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of urinary tract infections in pediatrics and adults: a WikiGuidelines group consensus statement [^283966fa]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Traditional approaches to practice guidelines frequently result in dissociation between strength of recommendation and quality of evidence.

Objective

To create a clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections that addresses the gap between the evidence and recommendation strength.

Evidence Review

This consensus statement and systematic review applied an approach previously established by the WikiGuidelines Group to construct collaborative clinical guidelines. In May 2023, new and existing members were solicited for questions on urinary tract infection prevention, diagnosis, and management. For each topic, literature searches were conducted up until early 2024 in any language. Evidence was reported according to the WikiGuidelines charter: clear recommendations were established only when reproducible, prospective, controlled studies provided hypothesis-confirming evidence. In the absence of such data, clinical reviews were developed discussing the available literature and associated risks and benefits of various approaches.

Findings

A total of 54 members representing 12 countries reviewed 914 articles and submitted information relevant to 5 sections: prophylaxis and prevention (7 questions), diagnosis and diagnostic stewardship (7 questions), empirical treatment (3 questions), definitive treatment and antimicrobial stewardship (10 questions), and special populations and genitourinary syndromes (10 questions). Of 37 unique questions, a clear recommendation could be provided for 6 questions. In 3 of the remaining questions, a clear recommendation could only be provided for certain aspects of the question. Clinical reviews were generated for the remaining questions and aspects of questions not meeting criteria for a clear recommendation.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this consensus statement that applied the WikiGuidelines method for clinical guideline development, the majority of topics relating to prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections lack high-quality prospective data and clear recommendations could not be made. Randomized clinical trials are underway to address some of these gaps; however further research is of utmost importance to inform true evidence-based, rather than eminence-based practice.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^e1623c22]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic Prophylaxis Choice, Duration and Resistance

The most common agents used for CAP are amoxicillin in neonates and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and nitrofurantoin in older children. Amoxicillin-clavulanate and cephalosporins lack data regarding efficacy and the development of antimicrobial resistance. Two RCTs showed that 6 months of nitrofurantoin was more effective at reducing recurrence than TMP-SMX, although nitrofurantoin resulted in more gastrointestinal side effects. Although both nitrofurantoin and TMP-SMX are generally considered safe for long-term prophylaxis, nitrofurantoin can also cause cutaneous reactions, while TMP-SMX can cause nausea and loss of appetite, and more rarely bone marrow suppression, nephrotoxicity and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It is therefore recommended not to use TMP-SMX in some hematologic disorders, to dose adjust in renal failure and to monitor full blood count and electrolytes while taking it. The benefits of nitrofurantoin, in terms of efficacy, are counterbalanced by the side effects of the drug, so overall there is little to choose between recommending nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX for prophylaxis. A recent meta-analysis confirmed that nitrofurantoin had the greatest likelihood of antibiotic choices in reducing UTI in children but also showed daily cranberry products reduce symptomatic UTI by 59%, more than either TMP-SMX or trimethoprim. This finding included children with recurrent UTI and VUR. Given that all antibiotic use is associated to some degree with the development of antibiotic resistance, cranberry products offer a promising alternative.

There is a lack of evidence for prophylaxis duration or criteria for discontinuation. Pooled results from 3 observational studies showed that continuation of CAP did not prevent recurrent UTI after pyeloplasty, so this should be a reason to stop. There is insufficient evidence regarding the duration of CAP after ureteral reimplantation or endoscopic treatment of VUR. Most commonly, 3–6 months are recommended, followed by reassessment.

Multiple RCTs clearly show that while UTI is less common with prophylaxis, resistance to the prophylactic antibiotic is significantly higher. With resistance to either TMP-SMX or nitrofurantoin, switching to the other can be considered, although there is a lack of evidence to recommend a switch after a breakthrough UTI. In case of resistance to both agents, one might consider a CAP disruption, as broader-spectrum agents may lead to UTI with increasingly resistant organisms to remaining oral alternatives.

### Nitrofurantoin vs other prophylactic agents in reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in adult women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^430aec09]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical and financial burden from bladder infections is significant. Daily antibiotic use is the recommended strategy for recurrent urinary tract infection prevention. Increasing antibiotic resistance rates, however, require immediate identification of innovative alternative prophylactic therapies. This systematic review aims to provide guidance on gaps in evidence to guide future research.

Objective

The objective of this review was to provide current pooled estimates of randomized control trials comparing the effects of nitrofurantoin vs other agents in reducing recurrent urinary tract infections in adult, nonpregnant women and assess relative adverse side effects.

Data Sources

Data sources included the following: MEDLINE, Jan. 1, 1946, to Jan. 31, 2015; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and web sites of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse from 2000 to 2015. Randomized control trials of women with recurrent urinary tract infections comparing nitrofurantoin with any other treatment were included.

Study Design

A protocol for the study was developed a priori. Published guidance was followed for assessment of study quality. All meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models with Stats Direct Software. Dual review was used for all decisions and data abstraction.

Results

Twelve randomized control trials involving 1063 patients were included. One study that had a serious flaw was rated poor in quality, one study rated good, and the remainder fair. No significant differences in prophylactic antibiotic treatment with nitrofurantoin and norfloxacin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, methamine hippurate, estriol, or cefaclor were found in clinical or microbiological cure in adult nonpregnant women with recurrent urinary tract infections (9 randomized control trials, 673 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–1.27; I 2, 65%; and 12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.26; I 2, 76%, respectively). Duration of prophylaxis also did not have a significant impact on outcomes. There was a statistically significant difference in overall adverse effects, with nitrofurantoin resulting in greater risk than other prophylactic treatments (10 randomized control trials, 948 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.34–3.50; I 2, 61%). Overall, the majority of nitrofurantoin adverse effects were gastrointestinal, with a significant difference for withdrawals (12 randomized control trials, 1063 patients, relative risk ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–3.56; I 2, 8%).

Conclusion

Nitrofurantoin had similar efficacy but a greater risk of adverse events than other prophylactic treatments. Balancing the risks of adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, with potential benefits of decreasing collateral ecological damage should be considered if selecting nitrofurantoin.

### Nitrofurantoin [^c925d4f7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Nitrofurantoin capsules (macrocrystals) should be given with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.

Adults: 50 to 100 mg four times a day - the lower dosage level is recommended for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Pediatric Patients: 5 to 7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses (contraindicated under one month of age).

Therapy should be continued for one week or for at least 3 days after sterility of the urine is obtained. Continued infection indicates the need for reevaluation.

For long-term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50 to 100 mg at bedtime may be adequate. For long-term suppressive therapy in pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg/kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate.

### Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for stone therapy [^cfb90640]. Current Opinion in Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To give an overview about state-of-the-art antibiotic prophylaxis in urolithasis therapy and focus on recent publications in this field.

Recent Findings

The number of high-quality publications within the recent time is limited. Preoperative inflammatory blood parameters like C-reactive protein and erythrocyte-sedimentation rate might help in prediction of postoperative systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) after percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). White blood cell count is nonpredictive for urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients with acute renal colic. In patients with low risk for infectious complications, antibiotic prophylaxis during shock-wave lithotripsy (SWL) is unnecessary and single-dose antibiotics are comparably effective as prolonged antibiotic usage during PCNL and ureterorenoscopy (URS).

Summary

Current findings support the American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline recommendations for a risk-adapted minimal antibiotic usage. Single-dose antibiotic prophylaxis is sufficient for low-risk PCNL and URS. For SWL no antibiotic prophylaxis is needed.

### Prevention of urinary tract infections in nursing homes: lack of evidence-based prescription? [^6c3642e7]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This study showed a high prevalence and large variation in the use of UTI prophylactic agents in Norwegian nursing homes. The prescribing of agents to prevent UTIs was in most cases not in accordance with evidence in the literature or current national guidelines. The wide prescribing of agents that lack documentation of effectiveness is troublesome, and could represent an international problem as treatment of recurrent UTIs is a common challenge in the elderly. Thus, further studies are needed to clarify this prescribing behaviour and to evaluate possible benefits and disadvantages of prophylactic treatments in nursing home residents.

### Alternative to prophylactic antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial [^01959980]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To test and compare the efficacy of methenamine hippurate for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections with the current standard prophylaxis of daily low dose antibiotics.

Design

Multicentre, open label, randomised, non-inferiority trial.

Setting

Eight centres in the UK, recruiting from June 2016 to June 2018.

Participants

Women aged ≥ 18 years with recurrent urinary tract infections, requiring prophylactic treatment.

Interventions

Random assignment (1:1, using permuted blocks of variable length via a web based system) to receive antibiotic prophylaxis or methenamine hippurate for 12 months. Treatment allocation was not masked and crossover between arms was allowed.

Main Outcome Measure

Absolute difference in incidence of symptomatic, antibiotic treated, urinary tract infections during treatment. A patient and public involvement group predefined the non-inferiority margin as one episode of urinary tract infection per person year. Analyses performed in a modified intention-to-treat population comprised all participants observed for at least six months.

Results

Participants were randomly assigned to antibiotic prophylaxis (n = 120) or methenamine hippurate (n = 120). The modified intention-to-treat analysis comprised 205 (85%) participants (antibiotics, n = 102 (85%); methenamine hippurate, n = 103 (86%)). Incidence of antibiotic treated urinary tract infections during the 12 month treatment period was 0.89 episodes per person year (95% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.12) in the antibiotics group and 1.38 (1.05 to 1.72) in the methenamine hippurate group, with an absolute difference of 0.49 (90% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.84) confirming non-inferiority. Adverse reactions were reported by 34/142 (24%) in the antibiotic group and 35/127 (28%) in the methenamine group and most reactions were mild.

Conclusion

Non-antibiotic prophylactic treatment with methenamine hippurate might be appropriate for women with a history of recurrent episodes of urinary tract infections, informed by patient preferences and antibiotic stewardship initiatives, given the demonstration of non-inferiority to daily antibiotic prophylaxis seen in this trial.

### Evaluation of systemic estrogen for preventing urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women [^15e83c24]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines for postmenopausal recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) prevention recommend the use of vaginal topical estrogen products but not systemic estrogens. Studies show that vaginal estrogen decreases the risk of rUTI, but evidence against use of systemic estrogen is less convincing.

Objective

We performed a comprehensive literature review to evaluate the effect of systemic estrogen on UTI occurrence among postmenopausal women.

Evidence Review

MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched for manuscripts published in English between January 1990 and July 2020. The search terms were "urinary tract infection" and "estrogen". Inclusion criteria were studies of postmenopausal women who received systemic estrogen therapy (any regimen) that reported UTI frequency during any follow-up period. Case studies, commentaries, and reviews were excluded. A priori specifications of seven study criteria were set representing the ideal study for assessing efficacy of systemic estrogen for rUTI prevention and were used to evaluate each included study.

Findings

Searches identified 281 results, and after deduplication and review, 8 studies met inclusion criteria: 4 randomized controlled trials, 1 secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, 1 prospective cohort study, 1 case-control study, and 1 cross-sectional study. Of the eight included studies, only two enrolled postmenopausal women with a rUTI diagnosis, four had sufficient sample size to detect a clinically meaningful difference between systemic estrogen versus placebo, two used dosage regimens anticipated to achieve a therapeutic effect, and three assessed UTI rates for an adequate duration of 6months or more (the standard minimum duration of time needed to make a diagnosis of rUTI). Overall, none of the studies met all predefined criteria for the ideal study to assess the efficacy of systemic estrogen for rUTI prevention.

Conclusions and Relevance

UTIs will continue to be a significant cause of morbidity and hospitalizations in postmenopausal women unless more research is done to better understand the role of estrogen on UTI rates. The evidence arguing use (or abandonment) of systemic estrogen for the prevention of rUTI is based on few studies with substantial methodologic limitations; there is significant room for improvement.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^6f800b58]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

We followed the PRISMA guidelines for conducting and reporting meta-analyses. We did two separate queries. First, we performed a systematic review of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials that compared antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or a control group at the time of removal of a transurethral urinary catheter and tracked the occurrence of symptomatic urinary tract infections in the subsequent period (JM). For this purpose, we screened the medical literature in PubMed from 1947 up to November 2012 with the search terms urinary catheter, removal, prophylaxis, antibiotic prophylaxis randomized, and trial, and evaluated conference abstracts from 2006–2012 (from Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) annual meeting, Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC), Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) annual meeting, and the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID)). In addition, we used Google to search for the same terms. Next, a medical librarian (SF) created a systematic search strategy that included a combination of standardized index terms and straight keywords. She ran that search in Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Library (including CENTRAL), and clinicaltrials.gov, in addition to PubMed. We reviewed the reference lists of all potentially relevant studies to identify additional research data. We included non-English language and unpublished studies (fig 1).

Fig 1 Selection of studies for meta-analysis of trials investigating antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter

Eligible studies were randomized and non-randomized controlled trials of short term catheterization in adults with symptomatic urinary tract infection as an endpoint. We defined short term catheterization as a maximum duration of 14 days. The endpoint of symptomatic urinary tract infection required the detection of measureable bacteriuria plus the presence of at least one symptom or sign compatible with urinary tract infection. Not all studies, however, specified which clinical criteria were fulfilled for this endpoint. We did not include the endpoint bacteriuria because antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is not indicated. Because antibiotic prophylaxis was directed specifically at the prevention of symptomatic urinary tract infections, we did not assess additional outcomes such as survival. Subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infections caused by antibiotic resistant organisms would have been a meaningful secondary endpoint but none of the included studies assessed it.

### Prevention of urinary tract infections in nursing homes: lack of evidence-based prescription? [^a54180b6]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Prophylactic agents and antibiotics for therapy

All possible agents used for prevention of UTIs noted in the residents medical records were included, i.e. medicinal agents, vitamins and herbals, and they were recorded by name, daily dose and route of administration. Agents were classified according to The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) system. Cranberry products represents a heterogeneous group of agents (including different doses of extracts, juices and capsules) but were coded together. The indication for UTI prophylaxis by the nursing home physician was accepted without further details of treatment criteria. Furthermore, length of treatment (according to the physician) was recorded in days. Prophylactic treatments are expected to be long-term and if no date of evaluation or withdrawal was assigned by the physician in the medical record, the treatments were recorded as continuous in the study.

Statistical analysis

The data was analysed using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc. Chicago IL). Descriptive statistics are shown as means with standard deviations (SD).

### Urinary tract infections in pregnant individuals [^366707c4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) treatment in pregnant individuals — clinicians should prescribe a 5–7-day course of targeted antibiotics for colony counts of 100,000 CFU/mL or higher, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against repeat screening after appropriate treatment; ASB is clinically significant at 100,000 CFU/mL (10⁵ CFU/mL) or higher, treatment should start once bacteriuria is confirmed and be adjusted per sensitivities, and normal vulvovaginal flora should not be treated. Group B strep should be treated if present in counts greater than 100,000 CFU/mL, whereas lower colony counts do not require treatment but should be noted for group B streptococcus prophylaxis at delivery; several randomized studies show that a 5–7-day duration is superior to single-dose treatment, with no difference in ASB recurrence, pyelonephritis, or preterm birth. Fosfomycin is an exception with single-dose efficacy making it a reasonable choice for 1-day treatment of ASB, and there are no studies assessing a 3-day treatment duration for ASB; there are also no studies to recommend for or against whether a test of cure or repeat screening is indicated after treatment.

### Nitrofurantion [^ea5b11c8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

Nitrofurantoin Capsules, USP (macrocrystals) should be given with food to improve drug absorption and, in some patients, tolerance.

Adults: 50–100 mg four times a day — the lower dosage level is recommended for uncomplicated urinary tract infections.

Pediatric Patients: 5–7 mg/kg of body weight per 24 hours, given in four divided doses (contraindicated under one month of age).

Therapy should be continued for one week or for at least 3 days after sterility of the urine is obtained. Continued infection indicates the need for re-evaluation.

For long-term suppressive therapy in adults, a reduction of dosage to 50–100 mg at bedtime may be adequate. For long-term suppressive therapy in pediatric patients, doses as low as 1 mg/kg per 24 hours, given in a single dose or in two divided doses, may be adequate.
