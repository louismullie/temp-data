## Question

what nsaids can be taken with fatty liver disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which NSAIDs can be taken with fatty liver disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the spectrum of fatty liver disease and how stage alters NSAID risk. Then, I should review comparative hepatotoxicity across NSAIDs from high-quality evidence. Next, I will stratify recommendations by disease severity, confirm absolute contraindications, and consider safer alternatives. Finally, I should define practical monitoring and synthesize stage-based guidance with caveats about aspirin and cardiometabolic context.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the answer hinges on disease stage. Fatty liver spans simple steatosis to steatohepatitis with fibrosis and cirrhosis, and once cirrhosis is present, NSAID pharmacokinetics and organ risks change substantially, so stage-specific recommendations are essential [^116cLGK5] [^1175Lgav].

> Next, I should review baseline comparative hepatotoxicity across NSAIDs so I'm not overgeneralizing a class effect. Wait, let me verify the best evidence here: a large systematic review of randomized trials found diclofenac had markedly higher rates of ALT/AST elevations > 3× ULN, rofecoxib was higher than placebo, whereas naproxen, ibuprofen, celecoxib, and meloxicam had rates similar to placebo, indicating meaningful within-class differences [^111Z3FaU].

> Now, I need to address the highest-risk group first. In cirrhosis, oral NSAIDs are contraindicated due to altered protein binding raising drug exposure, prostaglandin inhibition precipitating renal hypoperfusion and hepatorenal syndrome, and increased bleeding risk; topical NSAIDs are generally acceptable given low systemic absorption, and acetaminophen up to 2 g/day is preferred for analgesia in this setting [^1175Lgav]. Hold on, I almost considered celecoxib as a "safer" exception in cirrhosis, but I should correct myself: all oral NSAIDs are avoided in cirrhosis regardless of COX selectivity [^1175Lgav].

> For patients with significant fibrosis short of cirrhosis, I should be cautious. I need to ensure I consider labeling language that flags advanced liver disease as a bleeding and hepatic risk factor, nudging practice toward avoidance or very selective, brief use at the lowest dose with monitoring if there is no reasonable alternative [^1172u8nS] [^112oJK6b] [^112ATVKS].

> For simple steatosis or non-cirrhotic MASLD, NSAIDs can be considered, but I should confirm that DILI susceptibility may be modestly higher in fatty liver and that steatosis can alter oxidative stress and glutathione handling, which underscores the need for prudence and monitoring rather than blanket prohibition [^111rzfSK] [^113t9DJS]. Given the hepatotoxicity gradient across NSAIDs, choosing lower-risk agents and limiting exposure is sensible here [^111Z3FaU].

> Let me rank specific NSAIDs by hepatic risk to guide choices, and I will double-check agent-specific data as I go. Agents to avoid when alternatives exist include diclofenac, which carries the highest signal for aminotransferase elevations and has FDA labeling that mandates early LFT monitoring due to rare severe hepatotoxicity; sulindac and ketoprofen also show up to 15% low-grade LFT elevations and rare severe hepatic reactions, with ketoprofen pharmacokinetics altered in chronic liver disease, so I should steer away from these in fatty liver patients if possible [^111Z3FaU] [^113VFzZQ] [^1172u8nS] [^115WbF9T] [^115np5jb]. By contrast, relatively lower-hepatotoxicity options include ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib, and meloxicam, which in aggregate show aminotransferase elevation rates similar to placebo in trials, though rare severe events remain possible and labeling still advises caution and monitoring in liver disease [^111Z3FaU] [^1152c9tr] [^114dFd7i].

> I should also consider the special case of aspirin. Daily low-dose aspirin has been associated with lower odds of NASH and fibrosis and reduced risk of fibrosis progression in NAFLD cohorts, and some data suggest lower cancer incidence in NAFLD with antiplatelet therapy, but I must not overstate this and should emphasize bleeding risk and that major liver society guidance does not currently recommend aspirin solely for HCC chemoprevention; use it when there is a cardiovascular indication, not for liver disease alone [^1131pJAV] [^115QuToy] [^113UTdmS].

> Before I recommend any NSAID, I need to ensure risk-mitigation steps are in place. I should confirm baseline LFTs in patients with known fatty liver, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time, and recheck LFTs within 4–8 weeks if treatment continues, a schedule explicitly required for diclofenac and reasonable to extrapolate to higher-risk scenarios; I will also counsel on warning symptoms and avoid concurrent hepatotoxins or high-dose acetaminophen, and if GI risk is present, co-prescribe a PPI to reduce ulcer complications [^113VFzZQ] [^114dFd7i] [^1172u8nS] [^115LpMTQ] [^114VXTG7]. If ALT or AST exceed 3× ULN persistently or 5× ULN at any time, I should discontinue and evaluate for DILI promptly [^113VFzZQ] [^115LpMTQ].

> I need to think about alternatives when NSAIDs are inadvisable. Acetaminophen at or below 2 g/day is preferred in cirrhosis and is reasonable up to about 3 g/day in non-cirrhotic fatty liver if there is no heavy alcohol use, with careful attention to total daily intake from combination products; topical NSAIDs can be considered for focal musculoskeletal pain given low systemic exposure; and nonpharmacologic strategies and weight loss remain cornerstones for symptom improvement and disease modification in MASLD [^1175Lgav] [^116cLGK5].

> Let me synthesize stage-based guidance and double-check I'm not missing important caveats. If there is cirrhosis, I will avoid all oral NSAIDs and use acetaminophen ≤ 2 g/day or topical agents; if there is advanced fibrosis without cirrhosis and an NSAID is absolutely necessary, I will prefer lower-hepatic-risk agents like ibuprofen or naproxen for the shortest possible course with baseline and early follow-up LFTs; if there is simple steatosis, I can consider ibuprofen or naproxen first line, or celecoxib or meloxicam when COX-2 selectivity is desirable, still at minimal dose and duration; and if a patient also has a cardiovascular indication, low-dose aspirin may be appropriate, but not solely to prevent HCC in MASLD [^1175Lgav] [^111Z3FaU] [^1152c9tr] [^114dFd7i] [^113UTdmS].

> Bottom line, and I should sanity-check this against the evidence one more time: in non-cirrhotic fatty liver, ibuprofen or naproxen are generally the preferred NSAIDs when needed, celecoxib or meloxicam are alternatives, diclofenac and similar higher-signal agents should be avoided if possible, and in any cirrhosis, oral NSAIDs are contraindicated with acetaminophen ≤ 2 g/day as the safer systemic analgesic; throughout, minimize dose and duration and monitor if treatment extends beyond the very short term [^111Z3FaU] [^1175Lgav] [^113VFzZQ] [^1152c9tr].

---

For patients with fatty liver disease, **NSAIDs should be used cautiously** due to hepatotoxicity risk [^115LpMTQ], with **ibuprofen and naproxen preferred** [^111Z3FaU] for short-term use at the lowest effective dose [^114UWJDX] with close monitoring of liver enzymes [^115LpMTQ], while **diclofenac and indomethacin** should be avoided because of higher hepatotoxicity risk; celecoxib may be considered for short courses in compensated disease with monitoring, and **acetaminophen up to 2 g/day** is generally safer for analgesia; avoid NSAIDs in advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, and monitor liver function during use.

## Hepatotoxicity risk of NSAIDs in fatty liver disease

Patients with fatty liver disease have **altered hepatic metabolism** and increased susceptibility to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^111rzfSK]. NSAIDs can cause hepatotoxicity ranging from mild, transient enzyme elevations [^114dFd7i] to severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis and liver failure [^1152c9tr]. Risk varies by agent; **careful selection is essential** [^112ATVKS].

---

## NSAIDs with lower hepatotoxicity risk

Among NSAIDs, ibuprofen and naproxen have a **lower risk of hepatotoxicity** [^111Z3FaU] and may be used for short-term pain and inflammation management in patients with fatty liver disease when liver function is closely monitored [^115LpMTQ]. Ibuprofen and naproxen should be given at the **lowest effective dose** [^112GeLwC] with regular monitoring of **liver enzymes** [^115LpMTQ].

---

## NSAIDs with higher hepatotoxicity risk

Certain NSAIDs carry a **higher risk of hepatotoxicity** and should be avoided or used with extreme caution in patients with fatty liver disease [^112ATVKS]. Diclofenac is associated with a significantly **higher risk of hepatotoxicity** [^111Z3FaU] [^114dFd7i], including severe hepatic reactions such as fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure [^113VFzZQ] [^1172u8nS], and should generally be avoided; Indomethacin has also been linked to severe hepatic reactions and should be avoided or used with extreme caution.

---

## COX-2 selective inhibitors

Although COX-2 selective inhibitors such as celecoxib were developed to reduce gastrointestinal side effects compared with traditional NSAIDs, they **still carry a risk of hepatotoxicity and cardiovascular events** [^111Z3FaU] [^113mCNxr]. Celecoxib may be considered for short-term use in patients with compensated fatty liver disease, but regular liver-function monitoring is essential.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized risk assessment** and **careful monitoring** when prescribing NSAIDs to patients with fatty liver disease [^115LpMTQ]. Generally accepted recommendations include:

- Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible [^1157tnpV].
- Regularly monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST) during NSAID therapy [^115LpMTQ].
- Avoid NSAIDs in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis [^1175Lgav].
- Consider alternative analgesics, such as acetaminophen (paracetamol), which is generally considered safer at doses up to 2 grams per day [^1175Lgav].

---

## Alternative analgesic options

Given the **potential risks** associated with NSAID use, consider alternative analgesic options in fatty liver disease:

- **Acetaminophen (paracetamol)**: Generally considered safe at doses up to 2 grams per day [^1175Lgav]. Regular monitoring of liver function is recommended, especially in patients with advanced liver disease [^113t9DJS].
- **Topical NSAIDs**: Topical formulations of NSAIDs, such as diclofenac gel, may be considered for localized pain relief, as systemic absorption is minimal and hepatic risk is reduced [^1175Lgav].
- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Physical therapy, weight loss, and lifestyle modifications are essential components of managing pain and inflammation in patients with fatty liver disease [^116cLGK5].

---

## Monitoring and precautions

When prescribing NSAIDs in fatty liver disease, the following **precautions** should be taken:

- Baseline liver function tests (ALT, AST) should be obtained before initiating NSAID therapy [^115LpMTQ].
- Regular monitoring of liver enzymes should be conducted during treatment [^1172u8nS].
- Patients should be educated about the signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, such as jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and abdominal pain [^1152c9tr].
- NSAIDs should be discontinued immediately if significant liver enzyme elevations or clinical signs of hepatotoxicity occur [^113VFzZQ].

## Summary table: NSAID use in fatty liver disease

| **NSAID** | **Hepatotoxicity risk** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| Ibuprofen | Low | Safe for short-term use with monitoring [^111Z3FaU] |
| Naproxen | Low | Safe for short-term use with monitoring [^111Z3FaU] |
| Diclofenac | High | Avoid [^1172u8nS] |
| Indomethacin | High | Avoid |
| Celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor) | Moderate | Short-term use with monitoring |
| Acetaminophen (alternative) | Low | Safe up to 2 g/day with monitoring [^1175Lgav] |

---

NSAIDs can be used **cautiously** [^115LpMTQ] in patients with fatty liver disease, with ibuprofen and naproxen preferred for short-term use at the lowest effective dose [^111Z3FaU]. Diclofenac and indomethacin should be avoided due to higher hepatotoxicity risk. Celecoxib may be considered for short-term use with monitoring, and acetaminophen is generally safer at doses up to 2 grams per day. Regular monitoring of liver function tests and patient education are essential [^115LpMTQ].

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hepatic toxicity: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials in arthritis patients [^111Z3FaU]. Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology (2005). High credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) might cause hepatic side effects, but the frequency of these laboratory and clinical side effects is uncertain.
- **Methods**: Searches of bibliographic databases MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as public archives of the Food and Drug Administration, were conducted. The goal was to identify randomized controlled trials of diclofenac, naproxen, ibuprofen, celecoxib, rofecoxib, valdecoxib, or meloxicam in adults with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis that provided information on aminotransferase elevations > 3 x upper limit of normal, liver-related discontinuations, hepatic serious adverse events, liver-related hospitalizations, or liver-related deaths. The proportion of patients with each hepatic toxicity outcome was calculated separately using sample size-weighted pooling for each NSAID.
- **Results**: Sixty-seven articles from the bibliographic database and 65 studies from the Food and Drug Administration archives met inclusion criteria. Diclofenac (3.55%; 95% confidence interval, 3.12%–4.03%) and rofecoxib (1.80%; 95% CI, 1.52%–2.13%) had higher rates of aminotransferase > 3 x upper limit of normal than placebo (0.29%; 95% CI, 0.17%–0.51%) and the other NSAIDs (all ≤ 0.43%). The 95% CIs for liver-related discontinuations of all NSAIDs, except diclofenac (2.17%; 95% CI, 1.78%–2.64%), overlapped with placebo. Only one liver-related hospitalization (among 37,671 patients) and one liver-related death (among 51,942 patients) occurred, both with naproxen.
- **Conclusions**: Diclofenac and rofecoxib exhibited higher rates of aminotransferase elevation.

### Diclofenac sodium [^113VFzZQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, or if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, such as systemic manifestations (e.g. eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark urine), diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets should be discontinued immediately.

Inform patients about the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, including nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash), discontinue diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets immediately and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.

To minimize the potential risk for an adverse liver-related event in patients treated with diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. Exercise caution when prescribing diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets with concomitant drugs that are known to be potentially hepatotoxic (e.g. acetaminophen, antibiotics, anti-epileptics).
- **Hypertension**: NSAIDs, including diclofenac sodium extended-release tablets, can lead to new onset hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular events. Patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have an impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs.

### Meloxicam [^114dFd7i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. In addition, rare, sometimes fatal, cases of severe hepatic injury, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure have been reported. Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs, including meloxicam. Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g. nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash), discontinue meloxicam oral suspension immediately and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
- **Hypertension**: NSAIDs, including meloxicam oral suspension, can lead to new onset or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of CV events. Patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Monitor blood pressure (BP) during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.

Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Medication Guide

The most important information to know about Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) is that they can cause serious side effects, including:

- **Increased risk of heart attack or stroke**: This risk, which can lead to death, may occur early in treatment and may increase:
	- With increasing doses of NSAIDs
	- With longer use of NSAIDs
	- Following a heart surgery called a "coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)"

Avoid taking NSAIDs following a recent heart attack unless instructed by your healthcare provider, as it may increase the risk of another heart attack.
- **Increased risk of bleeding, ulcers, and tears (perforation) of the esophagus, stomach, and intestines**:
	- This risk can occur:
	- At any time during use
	- Without warning symptoms
	- And may cause death

Factors that increase the risk of ulcers or bleeding include:

- Past history of stomach ulcers, or stomach or intestinal bleeding with NSAID use
- The use of medicines called "corticosteroids", "anticoagulants", "SSRIs", or "SNRIs"
- Increasing doses or longer use of NSAIDs
- Smoking
- Drinking alcohol
- Older age
- Poor health
- Advanced liver disease
- Bleeding problems

### Epidemiologic assessment of the safety of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^112L1Gz2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Use of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation (UGIB), acute liver injury, acute renal injury, heart failure, and adverse reproductive outcomes. This article summarizes the effects of various factors, such as NSAID dose, duration of treatment, patient age, and ulcer history, on the incidences of these adverse side effects. We used the UK General Practice Research Database to study further the principal safety concern related to NSAIDs, namely, UGIB.

In summary, our study highlights the novel potential of anti-platelet therapy, notably aspirin, in reducing the incidence of several hepatic and extra-hepatic obesity-related cancers in individuals with NAFLD, a high-risk population. Randomized controlled studies should explore their potential primary cancer prevention role.

### Ketoprofen [^115np5jb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, including ketoprofen capsules. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, remain unchanged, or be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in about 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. Furthermore, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice, fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, some with fatal outcomes, have been reported.

A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or one who has an abnormal liver test, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with ketoprofen capsules. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash), ketoprofen capsules should be discontinued.

In patients with chronic liver disease with reduced serum albumin levels, ketoprofen's pharmacokinetics are altered. Such patients should be closely monitored, and a reduction of dosage should be anticipated to avoid high blood levels of ketoprofen and/or its metabolites.

- **Hematological effects**: Anemia is sometimes seen in patients receiving NSAIDs, including ketoprofen capsules. This may be due to fluid retention, occult or gross GI blood loss, or an incompletely described effect.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines: Drug-induced liver injury [^115LpMTQ]. Journal of Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug-induced liver injury, more specifically with respect to liver function tests (LFTs), EASL 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining intensified monitoring and surveillance of LFTs for drugs with a boxed warning of hepatotoxicity.

### The regulatory state of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and metabolism [^111Z4F1B]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The FDA draft guidance regarding drug development in NASH with compensated cirrhosis was published in 2019. Drug development for NASH with cirrhosis faces challenges in appropriately defining this inherently higher risk population for clinical trials and recognizing endpoints that have an observable impact on the advanced disease physiology. Noninvasive evidence of cirrhosis may be acceptable in early-phase trials, while trials intended to support a marketing application should provide evidence of histologic confirmation of the treatment effect. Emphasis is placed on trials in a compensated cirrhosis population with endpoints of reduction of decompensation events; however, composite endpoints using markers of liver synthetic and functional capacity could be explored in future trials to counter the potential for heterogeneity in the target population secondary to the substages of cirrhosis.

In general, the FDA has not recommended combining precirrhotic and cirrhotic patients in the same trial due to differences in monitoring and management, which will likely complicate trial design. If both patient populations are included in the same trial, separate inclusion/exclusion criteria, independent powering of the two subpopulations, and a differential schedule of clinic monitoring are recommended. Significant efficacy results in the overall trial population will need to be supported by positive results from each of the subpopulations.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: A network meta-analysis [^115M53NA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: This systematic review and network meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) extension statement for network meta-analysis. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of RCTs evaluating pharmacological interventions for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), followed by a network meta-analysis to compare the relative efficacy and safety of different treatment options.
- **Search strategy**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in the following electronic databases from inception to December 2024: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science. The search strategy was developed using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and free-text keywords related to MASLD and pharmacological interventions.

### Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver successfully treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: A challenge diagnosis for one not so rare entity [^115ZHGeS]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is a rare, benign lesion characterized by a well-circumscribed mass of chronic inflammatory cell infiltration and proliferating fibrous tissue. Its etiology remains unclear, although inflammatory processes have been proposed. It is often misdiagnosed as a malignant tumor, and the management has been traditionally surgical.

We report the case of a 16-year-old boy who was referred from another hospital with a fever of > 38 degrees C, accompanied by rigor and right upper quadrant pain, which he had suffered from for 5 days. The ultrasonographic computed tomography and MRI findings were not diagnostic. We performed a needle biopsy from the lesion that was consistent with an inflammatory pseudotumor (of liver, mixed fibrous tissue and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration). The patient was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and had an uneventful clinical course. During follow-up, the lesion subsequently shrank to completely vanish 1 year later.

### Treatment options for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^113VeRtg]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become increasingly recognized as the most common cause of abnormal liver enzymes in the last few decades and is among the most common forms of chronic liver disease in the Western world and across the globe. With the growing epidemic of obesity and diabetes, NAFLD is estimated to affect about one-quarter of the U.S. population. Although most patients with NAFLD have nonprogressive bland steatosis, a minority develop the histological subtype of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related death. This progression is especially true when NASH patients have type 2 diabetes.

Treatment of NAFLD should therefore be directed towards patients with established NASH. Sustained weight loss seems to improve insulin resistance and the associated NASH. Notably, weight loss with bariatric surgery leads to biochemical and histological improvement in morbidly obese patients with NASH. Several pharmacologic agents have been studied to improve insulin resistance and pro-inflammatory mediators potentially responsible for the development and progression of NASH. While some studies have shown initial promise, none have established long-term efficacy using randomized clinical trials.

This paper briefly reviews the epidemiology, natural history, and pathophysiology of NAFLD and NASH and then focuses on the clinical trials of various therapeutic modalities for NAFLD. These include weight loss agents, bariatric surgery, insulin-sensitizing agents, lipid-lowering agents, and antioxidants.

### Inhibition of fatty acid synthase with FT-4101 safely reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis and steatosis in obese subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Results from two early-phase randomized trials [^115deRZp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

In the present paper, we describe data from two clinical trials of FT-4101. The first phase 1 study established the dose-response of single oral doses of FT-4101 on hepatic DNL inhibition in a healthy population, and the second phase 1/2 study evaluated safety, tolerability, and efficacy on hepatic steatosis with 12 weeks of intermittent FT-4101 dosing in an NAFLD population. An intermittent dose regime of alternating 2 weeks on-treatment and 1 week off-treatment was selected for this study to reduce the risk of adverse effects due to chronic non-hepatic DNL inhibition such as dry eye, dry skin, and alopecia.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: A network meta-analysis [^112f82Te]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

To build on these findings, future research should address several key areas. Longer-term randomized controlled trials are essential to evaluate the durability of therapeutic effects and safety profiles over extended periods, providing a clearer understanding of the benefits and risks associated with these treatments. Exploration of combination therapies targeting multiple pathways, such as metabolic dysfunction and fibrosis, may offer synergistic benefits and should be a priority in future investigations. Further safety assessments are particularly warranted for agents with higher adverse event rates, such as efruxifermin, to better characterize their risk profiles and guide clinical use. Additionally, studies focusing on diverse populations, including patients with advanced liver disease, metabolic comorbidities, or varying genetic backgrounds, are necessary to ensure that treatment recommendations are applicable to the broader MASLD population.

### Contemporary management of pain in cirrhosis: Toward precision therapy for pain [^1175Lgav]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

- **Considerations in cirrhosis**: NSAIDs are metabolized by the liver and are largely protein-bound, leading to elevated serum levels in patients with cirrhosis. Furthermore, NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandins, leading to decreased renal perfusion and increased risk of hepatorenal syndrome. NSAIDs also inhibit thromboxane A2 production, increasing bleeding risk. Given these risks, oral NSAIDs are contraindicated in cirrhosis. Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac gel, have not been researched in patients with cirrhosis; however, their use is generally accepted because the level of systemic absorption is low.

Acetaminophen, although associated with hepatotoxicity when taken in excessive doses, can be used in patients with cirrhosis up to 2 g per day (500 mg every 6 h). Muscle relaxants (e.g. cyclobenzaprine, methocarbamol) are associated with sedation and should be avoided in older individuals; however, their use in cirrhosis has not been studied. Opioids are primarily metabolized by the liver and are associated with unique risks in cirrhosis, including altered pharmacokinetics (i.e. prolonged half-lives), hepatic encephalopathy (HE), and risk of addiction in a population with a higher rate of alcoholism. However, opioids can be started if needed, for instance, hydromorphone (1 mg every 6 h as needed) or oxycodone (2.5 mg by mouth every 6–8 h as needed). A fentanyl patch (12 mcg starting dose) can be used in patients without sarcopenia/cachexia or fever.

### Clinical trial landscape in NASH [^113FcnG6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease consists of a spectrum starting from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or even liver failure. The prevalence of NASH has increased in parallel with the rising rate of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Given the high prevalence and deadly complications of NASH, there have been significant efforts to develop effective treatments.

Phase 2A studies have assessed various mechanisms of action across the spectrum of the disease, while phase 3 studies have focused mainly on NASH and fibrosis stage 2 and higher, as these patients have a higher risk of disease morbidity and mortality. The primary efficacy endpoints also vary, using noninvasive tests in early-phase trials while relying on liver histological endpoints in phase 3 studies as required by regulatory agencies.

Despite initial disappointment due to the failure of several drugs, recent phase 2 and 3 studies have shown promising results, with the first Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for NASH expected to be approved in 2023. In this review, we discuss the various drugs under development for NASH, their mechanisms of action, and the results of their clinical trials. We also highlight the potential challenges in developing pharmacological therapies for NASH.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: A network meta-analysis [^115SJugS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Figure S2 illustrates funnel plots for the three main outcomes: steatosis reduction (Figure S2A), fibrosis improvement (Figure S2B), and safety (Figure S2C). For steatosis and fibrosis, the plots demonstrate relatively symmetrical distributions, indicating minimal publication bias. Most studies are clustered within the funnel, though some outliers suggest minor heterogeneity, likely due to differences in study designs or patient populations. In contrast, the safety outcomes show greater variability, with more asymmetry observed, reflecting differences in adverse event reporting and treatment tolerability across studies. Overall, the funnel plots suggest reliable findings for efficacy outcomes, while safety data require careful interpretation due to variability. The rankogram plots illustrate the ranking probabilities of interventions for steatosis reduction, fibrosis improvement, and adverse events (Figure S3).

To assess the robustness of our findings, a sensitivity analysis was performed by restricting the network meta-analysis to studies classified as low risk of bias according to the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Sensitivity analysis including only studies with a low risk of bias confirmed the consistency of the main findings. The ranking of treatments for both steatosis and fibrosis remained stable, and the effect estimates showed minimal deviation from the full dataset analysis (supplemental content, Figure S4). These results indicate that the primary conclusions are robust and not significantly influenced by potential bias in some included studies.

### Ketoprofen [^112GeLwC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

NSAIDs should be prescribed with extreme caution in individuals with a history of ulcer disease or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding using NSAIDs have a greater than tenfold risk of developing a GI bleed compared to those without these risk factors. Additional factors that increase the risk for GI bleeding in patients on NSAIDs include concurrent use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, prolonged NSAID therapy, smoking, alcohol use, older age, and poor general health status. The majority of spontaneous reports of fatal GI events occur in elderly or debilitated patients; thus, special care should be taken when treating this population.

To minimize the risk of adverse GI events in patients using NSAIDs, the lowest effective dose should be administered for the shortest possible duration. Both patients and physicians should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of GI ulceration and bleeding during NSAID therapy. If a serious GI adverse event is suspected, immediate evaluation and treatment should be initiated, including discontinuing the NSAID until a serious GI event is ruled out. For high-risk patients, alternate therapies that do not involve NSAIDs should be considered.
- **Renal effects**: Long-term administration of NSAIDs has led to renal papillary necrosis and other renal injuries. Renal toxicity has also been observed in patients where renal prostaglandins play a compensatory role in maintaining renal perfusion.

### Drug discovery and treatment paradigms in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^113oRprE]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in Western populations and is closely associated with features of the metabolic syndrome. The burden of this disease is set to rise exponentially, further compounded by the lack of effective medications. Additionally, these patients tend to have multiple comorbidities that may not be adequately managed.

In this article, we review the biological basis of potential therapies in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the drugs being tested in clinical trials, as well as some practical considerations in managing patients in the clinic.

### How common is diclofenac-associated liver injury? Analysis of 17,289 arthritis patients in a long-term prospective clinical trial [^112ZYBEX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Few data are available from prospective trials to define the hepatotoxicity of diclofenac, the most widely prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in the world. We determined the rate of laboratory and clinical adverse hepatic effects in a large double-blind trial of diclofenac.
- **Methods**: Patients aged 50 years or older with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis were randomly assigned to diclofenac (150 mg daily) or etoricoxib (60 or 90 mg daily). Patients with hepatic disease or who reported 14 or more alcoholic drinks weekly were excluded. Patients had visits with liver tests every 4 months and were contacted by phone between visits and every 6 months after discontinuation until the end of the study. Causality assessment was performed for liver-related hospitalizations, Hy's cases (serious adverse events with AST or ALT > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and bilirubin > 2 times ULN), and liver failure/transplant/death.
- **Results**: A total of 17,289 patients received diclofenac for a mean of 18 months. Liver endpoints with diclofenac were ALT/AST > 3 times ULN: 527 cases (3.1%); ALT/AST > 10 times ULN: 86 cases (0.5%); liver-related hospitalizations: 4 cases (0.023%); Hy's cases: 2 cases (0.012%); and liver failure/death/transplant: 0 cases. Aminotransferase elevations occurred primarily within the first 4–6 months of therapy, whereas liver-related hospitalizations occurred between 9 days and 21 months.
- **Conclusions**: Diclofenac is commonly associated with aminotransferase elevations, generally in the first 4–6 months of therapy. Clinical liver events requiring hospitalization are relatively rare (23/100,000 patients).

### Drug discovery and treatment paradigms in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^114h6zG9]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects almost a third of the Western population, and the burden of the disease is set to rise exponentially. Drug therapies for the resulting nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are limited in their efficacy, and there are no FDA-approved drugs for NASH. In this article, we review the potential therapeutic targets for NASH and their biological rationale, the current state of drugs in clinical trials, as well as some practical considerations for managing NASH in the clinic.

### Acetaminophen-induced liver damage in hepatic steatosis [^113t9DJS]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Low credibility.

One of the most used painkillers is acetaminophen (APAP), which is safe at the right dose. However, several studies have described populations susceptible to APAP-induced liver damage, mainly in livers with steatosis. Thus, clinicians should consider the presence of obesity and other chronic liver diseases, like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), when indicating treatment with APAP. Liver damage from this drug is generated through its metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, which is detoxified with glutathione (GSH). Prior depletion of GSH in steatotic hepatocytes plays a key role in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in people with obesity and NAFLD. Knowledge about the damage to the liver from APAP in susceptible populations, such as the obese and those with NAFLD, is of great relevance for the sanitary sector because it would imply strategies of different therapeutic approaches in such patients. This paper reviews the role of APAP in liver damage in the presence of obesity, NAFLD, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

### Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and cardiovascular risk: A comprehensive review [^117RUcar]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Low credibility.

In the realm of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the pharmacological management of inflammation represents a pivotal therapeutic strategy. Agents that target inflammatory pathways have demonstrated potential to attenuate hepatic inflammation, a key component of MASLD pathogenesis. Pharmacological strategies to curb inflammation in MASLD include the utilization of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and potentially novel agents such as statins and pentoxifylline, which have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties. These interventions aim to reduce the hepatic inflammatory response, a key driver of disease progression.

Acetylsalicylic acid remains the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). One study suggests that daily aspirin use may reduce the risk of fibrosis progression in patients with MASLD. Additionally, previous evidence has established that MASLD is an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF). Consequently, it is anticipated that an increasing cohort of patients with advanced fatty liver disease, including those progressed to metabolic steatohepatitis (MASH), will be considered for antithrombotic therapy in the forthcoming years. Moreover, given the association between inflammation, coagulation system activation, and hepatic fibrosis progression, antithrombotic treatment may exert salutary effects on liver fibrosis as well.

### A proposal from the Liver Forum for the management of comorbidities in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis therapeutic trials [^112WQjR5]. Journal of Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

The document has been developed by the Liver Forum, which mandated the NAFLD-Associated Comorbidities Working Group — a multistakeholder group comprised of experts from academic medicine, industry, and patient associations — to identify aspects of diverse comorbidities frequently associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that can interfere with the conduct of therapeutic trials and, in particular, impact efficacy and safety results. The objective of this paper is to propose guidance for the management of relevant comorbidities in both candidates and actual participants in NASH therapeutic trials.

We relied on specific guidelines from scientific societies, when available, but adapted them to the particulars of NASH trials with the aim of addressing multiple interacting requirements such as maintaining patient safety, reaching holistic therapeutic objectives, minimizing confounding effects on the efficacy and safety of investigational agents, and allowing for trial completion.

- **Analysis and stabilization**: We divided the field of action into analysis and stabilization of the patient's condition before inclusion in the trial, discussing the concept of acceptable vs. optimal control of comorbidities, defining metabolic and ponderal stability prior to randomization, and weighing the pros and cons of a run-in period.

- **Management of comorbidities**: During trial conduct, we analyzed non-hepatological comorbid conditions for changes or acute events possibly occurring, including changes in alcohol consumption, to detail when specific adjustments or interventions might be necessary.

### Inhibition of fatty acid synthase with FT-4101 safely reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis and steatosis in obese subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Results from two early-phase randomized trials [^112U5cpf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

In the present study, we describe the results of two clinical trials investigating FT-4101, a potent, selective, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of FASN, intended for the treatment of NASH. A phase 1 study in healthy participants was first carried out to establish the degree of hepatic DNL inhibition with single oral doses of FT-4101. A subsequent phase 1/2 study was performed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy on hepatic steatosis after 12 weeks of intermittent treatment with 3 mg FT-4101 in an NAFLD population.

Oral administration of FT-4101 was safe and well tolerated. PK profiles were similar in healthy participants and those with NAFLD, and plasma FT-4101 concentrations increased rapidly and proportionally following single doses, with a half-life of approximately 15 hours, and an AUC accumulation ratio of 2 supported once-daily dosing in the phase 1/2 study.

### The regulatory state of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and metabolism [^114YSJsP]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The guidance was posted for public comments in December 2018. FDA considers these comments prior to finalizing the guidance to make revisions where appropriate.

Presently, there are 734 global NASH studies in various stages of completion, of which 298 are being conducted in the United States. Submitted protocol sample sizes have ranged from 300 to 500 subjects in phase 2 trials, 1000–2000 subjects in pivotal phase 3 trials, and 1000–2500 subjects in phase 4 trials.

Histology remains an imperfect reference standard for NASH diagnosis and monitoring because its use is accompanied by drawbacks, including the invasiveness of liver biopsies (particularly in pediatric patients), sampling error due to at most 1/50,000th of the entire liver being sampled, intra- and interobserver variability, costs, and a low but observable risk of serious complications. While it is not yet known whether the effect of any particular drug will be precisely and comprehensively characterized by the inflammatory and fibrotic components of NASH injury as assessed by the histological method, or whether the current 12–18 months duration of clinical trials will be sufficiently long to allow detection of treatment effects, what is known is that the fibrosis component of the NASH pattern of injury is the strongest predictor for adverse outcomes in patients.

The early failed trials in NASH, while instructive in identifying certain trial issues such as the placebo effect and the natural course of disease, provided limited information in elucidating the causes of trial failure.

### Management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^116cLGK5]. BMJ (2021). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is a very common medical condition driven by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors, ultimately producing severe chronic liver disease and increased cardiovascular risk. Most people are asymptomatic for a long time, and their daily life is unaffected, leading to difficulty in identifying and managing individuals who slowly progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), NASH-cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma.

Despite advances in understanding pathogenic mechanisms and identifying liver fibrosis as the strongest factor in predicting disease progression, no specific treatments have been approved by regulatory agencies. Outside controlled trials, treatment is generally limited to lifestyle intervention aimed at weight loss.

Pioglitazone remains the drug of choice to reduce the progression of fibrosis in people with diabetes, although it is often used off-label in the absence of diabetes. Vitamin E is mainly used in children and may be considered in adults without diabetes. Several drugs are under investigation according to the agreed targets of reducing NASH activity without worsening fibrosis or improving fibrosis without worsening NASH.

- **Anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic agents, and metabolism modulators**: These have been tested in either phase III or phase IIb randomized controlled trials. A few failed, and others have produced marginally positive results, but only a few are being tested in extension studies.

The development of non-invasive, easily repeatable surrogate biomarkers and/or imaging tools is crucial.

### Quality standards for the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): Consensus recommendations from the British Association for the Study of the Liver and British Society of Gastroenterology NAFLD Special Interest Group [^114NpD4s]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Individuals with NAFLD frequently have co-morbidities, and as a result, polypharmacy is common. Therefore, a review of prescribed medications, use of over-the-counter medications, and alternative/complementary medicines should be undertaken. Commonly prescribed agents used to treat other conditions may contribute to hepatic fat accumulation (e.g. amiodarone, tamoxifen) or accelerate progression (e.g. methotrexate). Whilst the published literature is at times conflicting, capturing the use of methotrexate, including duration of exposure and cumulative dose, is particularly relevant as it is a potential cofactor promoting the presence of persistent transaminitis and/or an increased risk of advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients who are overweight or diabetic. Consider recommending the discontinuation of relevant hepatotoxic medications after risk assessment, involving other relevant specialists as necessary.

Moreover, it is important to conduct a medicines use review because discrepancies between patient-reported and medical record-documented medications exist in more than 50% of patients with liver disease, particularly those taking more than five medications. Practitioners should document a treatment history and medicines use review. The rationalization of medicines that may accelerate disease progression should be considered.
- **Assessment of dietary habits and physical activity**: Poor diet and limited physical activity are common in people diagnosed with NAFLD.

### Consensus about managing gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^113mCNxr]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Scarpignato et al. have produced a valuable summary of the state of knowledge about the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks of both non-selective NSAIDs (nsNSAIDs) and COX-2 selective drugs, which will be helpful for clinicians managing patients with osteoarthritis. As they emphasize, there are still uncertainties regarding cardiovascular risk profiles of commonly used NSAIDs, and results of some ongoing research directed at this are anticipated.

### Sulindac [^115WbF9T]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In addition to hypersensitivity reactions involving the liver, some patients exhibit findings consistent with cholestatic hepatitis, which should be referenced in warnings regarding hypersensitivity. Borderline elevations of one or more liver tests, without additional signs and symptoms, may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs, including sulindac. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, remain unchanged, or be transient with continued therapy. The SGPT (ALT) test is likely the most sensitive indicator of liver dysfunction. In controlled clinical trials, meaningful elevations of SGPT or SGOT (AST), three times the upper limit of normal, occurred in fewer than 1% of patients. Notable elevations of ALT or AST, approximately three or more times the upper limit of normal, have been reported in about 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. Additionally, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice, fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure — some with fatal outcomes — have been reported.

A patient exhibiting symptoms or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or who has abnormal liver test results, should be evaluated for evidence of more severe hepatic reactions while undergoing therapy with sulindac. Although reactions such as those described are rare, persistent or worsening abnormal liver tests, clinical signs, and symptoms consistent with liver disease, or systemic manifestations (e.g. eosinophilia, rash) warrant further assessment.

### Nash drug treatment development: challenges and lessons [^1176zWS7]. The Lancet. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Although NAFLD is tightly linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes, this liver disease also affects individuals who do not have obesity. NAFLD increases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and certain extrahepatic cancers.

There is currently no licensed pharmacotherapy for NAFLD, despite numerous clinical trials in the past two decades. The reason so few drugs have been successful in the treatment of NAFLD in a trial setting is not fully understood. As cardiovascular disease is the predominant cause of mortality in people with NAFLD, future pharmacotherapies must consider associated cardiometabolic risk factors. The successful use of glucose-lowering drugs in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in patients with NAFLD indicates that this strategy is important and worth developing further.

Greater public awareness of NAFLD is needed because collaboration between all stakeholders is vital to enable a holistic approach to successful treatment.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis — an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^1118vnnM]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Although osteoarthritis (OA) has long been considered a "wear and tear" disease leading to loss of cartilage, progress in molecular biology in the 1990s has profoundly modified this paradigm. The discovery that many soluble mediators, such as cytokines or prostaglandins, can increase the production of matrix metalloproteinases by chondrocytes led to the first steps of an "inflammatory" theory. Recent experimental data have shown that subchondral bone may have a substantial role in the OA process, both as a mechanical dampener and as a source of inflammatory mediators implicated in the OA pain process and in the degradation of the cartilage deep layer. Thus, initially considered cartilage-driven, OA, the prototypic age-related disease, is much more complex than previously thought, and low-grade (local and systemic) inflammation is the hallmark of this chronic and progressing condition. Consequently, COX-2 selective or non-selective NSAIDs (ns-NSAIDs), which display both analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, represent a pathophysiologically sound approach.

NSAIDs are very effective drugs; however, their use is associated with a broad spectrum of adverse reactions involving the liver, kidney, cardiovascular system, skin, and gut. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects are the most common and cover a wide clinical spectrum ranging from dyspepsia, heartburn, and abdominal discomfort to more serious events such as peptic ulcer with life-threatening complications of bleeding and perforation. The dilemma for the physician prescribing NSAIDs is, therefore, to maintain the anti-inflammatory and analgesic benefits while reducing organ damage and other risks.

### Safe prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with osteoarthritis — an expert consensus addressing benefits as well as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risks [^114yBG4s]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Each statement leader addressed a specific topic and made their own selection of primary references and systematic reviews by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases from 1990 to October 2011, as well as the proceedings of major digestive and rheumatology meetings. The writing and references provided by each statement leader were circulated among all the members of the expert group, who sent their written comments prior to the meeting.

In reviewing the statements and evidence, experts were encouraged to suggest amendments to the wording of the statements, as well as additions or deletions to the list of references, as they felt appropriate. In either case, they were asked to also state the rationale for their suggested amendments. Once all the feedback was collated, for each statement, a restricted number of experts (designated as statement group members, n = 1 to 3) provided, during a teleconference, their feedback and suggestions for improvement and/or change of both the wording of each statement and the supporting evidence, taking into account the views of the wider expert group. This revised list of nine statements was brought for discussion at the Consensus meeting.

### Current treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^112MgP2T]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The cornerstone of every treatment in all patients with NAFLD should contain the following three components:

- **Mediterranean diet**: Aiming to reduce the average daily calorie intake by at least 500–1000 kcal.

- **Weight loss**: Induced by diet and physical activity aiming at losing at least 3–5% of body weight.
- **Moderate physical activity**: Aiming at 150–200 minutes per week, also in patients with NAFLD-associated advanced chronic liver disease.
- **Pharmacological treatment options**: Guideline-recommended pharmacological treatment options for NAFLD patients are scarce. Currently, only Vitamin E and the proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-y) ligand Pioglitazone are recommended for selected patients by the European and American Association for the Study of the Liver.

### Liver steatosis is a risk factor for hepatotoxicity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease under immunosuppressive treatment [^111rhiXG]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hepatic disorders are frequently due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Immunosuppressive treatment is known to exert hepatotoxic side effects by a still unknown mode. The relevance of liver steatosis for the development of drug-related hepatotoxicity in IBD is still unknown.
- **Methods**: The charts of 259 patients with IBD under immunosuppression with either azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate were reviewed. The prevalence of liver steatosis was assessed by ultrasound reports. Aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels above the normal range were used to indicate liver abnormalities.
- **Results**: Liver steatosis based on ultrasound criteria was observed in 73 patients (28.2%). In patients with liver steatosis, the presence of elevated liver enzymes (ELE) was significantly more prevalent (28.8% vs. 14.5%, P = 0.0095). The finding of liver steatosis was associated with higher age (44.1 vs. 34.5 years, P < 0.0001) and body weight (BMI 26.7 vs. 23.4 kg/m, P < 0.0001). Development of ELE under immunosuppression was seen in 50 patients (19.3%). Of the patients who developed ELE, 44.0% (vs. 24.4%, P = 0.0095) showed liver steatosis. Logistic regression analysis revealed that male individuals had an increased likelihood of developing ELE associated with steatosis (P = 0.0118, odds ratio = 3.93), and patients who received steroids less often developed ELE in association with liver steatosis (P = 0.0414, odds ratio = 0.31).
- **Conclusion**: This study suggests that fatty liver represents a significant risk factor for hepatotoxicity in patients with IBD undergoing immunosuppressive treatment.

### Inhibition of fatty acid synthase with FT-4101 safely reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis and steatosis in obese subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Results from two early-phase randomized trials [^114UXFMZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

**Dose selection**: Nonclinical studies with FT‐4101 identified skin and eye effects as potential on‐target risks. Dose selection for Study 2 was identified based on safety results obtained from two previously completed multiple‐ascending‐dose trials (unpublished) in healthy volunteers receiving once daily oral doses of FT‐4101. In summary, administration of 9 mg FT‐4101 once daily for 14 days was tolerated, while 27 mg FT‐4101 once daily for 14 days was not, based on observed skin effects (dry skin and alopecia). Lower doses were then evaluated to reduce the risk of adverse skin effects with prolonged dosing. Administration of 3 mg FT‐4101 once daily for 28 days was safe, while 4.5 and 6 mg FT‐4101 once daily treatment for 28 days resulted in mild skin effects (dry skin and alopecia). All adverse events (AEs) resolved after FT‐4101 discontinuation. No adverse effects on platelet counts were observed in any of the dosing cohorts. For Study 2, the 3 mg FT‐4101 dose was identified based on its previously observed safety profile and an empiric treatment interruption schedule was applied to reduce the potential risk of ≥ grade 2 adverse on‐target effects (dry skin, dry eye, and alopecia) with chronic treatment.

### Mitigating GI risks associated with the use of NSAIDs [^114VXTG7]. Pain Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have multiple established adverse effects on various organ systems. Among those associated with high mortality are gastrointestinal complications. We address the scope of the problem and the scientific basis for risk mitigation.
- **Design**: This review covers the most successful of such strategies published at the time of writing.
- **Results**: Mitigation strategies to enable ongoing anti-inflammatory benefit are well studied, albeit imperfect.
- **Conclusions**: Such strategies may involve the choice of NSAID or the combined use of gastroprotective measures in association with NSAIDs.

### Pharmacological agents for NASH [^1158nWkT]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

NASH is a common liver disease that increases liver-related mortality and reduces survival. The need for optimal management of NASH is therefore a priority for today's practicing hepatologist. The rationale for specific pharmacological therapy for NASH stems from the potential for disease progression and the difficulties many patients face in successfully implementing long-term diet and lifestyle changes. Even among those who succeed, limited evidence exists that severe liver injury in patients with NASH can be reversed by diet and lifestyle measures alone. This review provides a personal and critical assessment of the histological efficacy and safety of agents tested in randomized trials in patients with NASH.

### Licart [^1144hdBp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In post-marketing reports, cases of drug-induced hepatotoxicity have been reported in the first month, and in some cases, the first two months of therapy, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Post-marketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.

In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac-associated drug-induced liver injury with use compared with non-use were associated with a statistically significant four-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days.

Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac, because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and post-marketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within four to eight weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac.

If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, or if clinical symptoms develop, patients should discontinue diclofenac.

### The regulatory state of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and metabolism [^112FPFEY]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

At present, the FDA recommends that clinical trial protocols in populations with NASH and compensated cirrhosis should not exceed 25%-30% cryptogenic cirrhosis patients. This is a proportion similar to that expected for the upper range of real-world biopsies unless otherwise adequately justified. Trials agnostic to cirrhosis etiology may avoid the challenge of attributing NASH causality in the diagnostic dilemma of cryptogenic cirrhosis. The Agency has encouraged obtaining historical biopsies to confirm the prior presence of steatohepatitis to support a diagnosis of NASH as the underlying etiology when enrolling patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis.

Trials examining symptomatic improvement of cirrhosis complications such as ascites, variceal bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy currently represent only a small proportion of the NASH trial landscape but are greatly needed in improving morbidity and symptomatic burden of patients while awaiting the development and approval of disease-modifying therapeutic options. The perceived challenges of such trials may be related to the disease severity of the target population, lack of available validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments, associated regulatory requirements, and few examples of approved labeling based on PROs within the FDA in general. Use of fit-for-purpose instruments with appropriate conceptual frameworks and evidence of content validity, along with early engagement with the FDA, are necessary to promote drug development that incorporates the patient voice.

### Inhibition of 11β-HSD1 with RO5093151 for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^1126h8g8]. The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is increasing worldwide, and an effective and safe pharmacological treatment is needed. We investigated whether inhibition of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1, also known as HSD11B1) by RO5093151 could safely and effectively decrease liver fat content in patients with this disorder.

- **Methods**: We conducted this phase 1b trial at four centers in Germany and Austria. Participants with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (defined as (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy liver-fat content > 5.56%), insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR] of at least 2.0 mmol/L·mU/L), BMI greater than 27 kg/m², and aged 35–65 years were randomly assigned by interactive voice response system in a 1:1 ratio, stratified for triglyceride concentration (< 1.7 mmol/L or ≥ 1.7 mmol/L), to oral RO5093151 (200 mg twice daily) or matching placebo for 12 weeks.

The main exclusion criteria were other liver diseases, aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase concentrations of more than two and a half times the upper limit of normal, history of diabetes or bariatric surgery, and use of weight-lowering drugs. Participants and investigators were masked to assignment throughout the study. The primary endpoint was the change in liver fat content from baseline to week 12. Efficacy analysis was conducted by modified intention to treat, including all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug and had a baseline and follow-up measurement of liver fat content. Safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug.

### Norursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 dose-finding trial [^117SCyvY]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Norursodeoxycholic acid is an orally administered side chain-shortened homologue of ursodeoxycholic acid that undergoes hepatic enrichment with hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic activity. We assessed the efficacy of two doses of norursodeoxycholic acid versus placebo for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
- **Methods**: We conducted a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, phase 2 dose-finding clinical trial in tertiary referral hospitals and medical centres in Austria (n = 6) and Germany (n = 23) for patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with or without diabetes. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations of more than 0.8 times the upper limit of normal were randomly assigned (1:1:1) using a computer-generated central randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either norursodeoxycholic acid capsules at 500 mg per day or 1500 mg per day, or placebo, for 12 weeks, followed by a subsequent 4-week follow-up period. All individuals involved in the trial were masked to treatment allocation. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean relative percentage change in ALT concentrations between baseline and end of treatment, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2013–004605–38.
- **Findings**: Between March 30, 2015, and September 20, 2016, of 198 individuals included in the analysis, 67 patients were randomly assigned to receive 500 mg norursodeoxycholic acid, 67 to 1500 mg norursodeoxycholic acid, and the remaining to placebo.

### Mefenamic acid [^113qkt8o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including mefenamic acid, can cause serious gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events, such as inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal. These adverse events may occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with NSAIDs. Approximately one in five patients who develop a serious upper GI adverse event while on NSAID therapy is symptomatic. NSAID-induced upper GI ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation occur in roughly 1% of patients treated for 3 to 6 months, and in about 2% to 4% of those treated for one year. Even short-term NSAID therapy carries risk.
- **Risk factors for GI bleeding, ulceration, and perforation**: Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or GI bleeding who use NSAIDs have a more than 10-fold increased risk of developing a GI bleed compared to those without these risk factors. Additional factors increasing the risk of GI bleeding in NSAID-treated patients include longer duration of NSAID therapy, concomitant use of oral corticosteroids, aspirin, anticoagulants, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); smoking, alcohol use, older age, and poor general health. Most postmarketing reports of fatal GI events occurred in elderly or debilitated patients. Furthermore, patients with advanced liver disease and/or coagulopathy are at heightened risk for GI bleeding.

### Treximet [^112SJ1ww]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Hepatotoxicity affects patients taking NSAIDs, such as naproxen, a component of Treximet. Borderline elevations in one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients. Hepatic abnormalities associated with NSAID consumption may result from hypersensitivity rather than direct toxicity. These abnormalities may progress, remain essentially unchanged, or be transient with continued therapy. Noteworthy elevations — three times the upper limit of normal — of SGPT (ALT) or SGOT (AST) have been reported in about 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. Additionally, rare but severe hepatic injuries — including jaundice, fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure — have been reported.

Treximet is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A patient showing symptoms or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or those with abnormal liver tests, should be evaluated for potential severe hepatic reactions while on Treximet therapy. Treximet should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash), or if abnormal liver tests persist or worsen.

Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity, including nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur.

### Patients with chronic liver disease suggestive of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease may be at higher risk for drug-induced liver injury [^111rzfSK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, there have been no studies that systematically examined if individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have an increased risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). We conducted a study to test if the frequency of suspected DILI from prescription agents is higher in individuals with chronic liver disease (CLD) suggestive of NAFLD.

### Daily aspirin use associated with reduced risk for fibrosis progression in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^1131pJAV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

There are few data from prospective studies on the effects of aspirin on fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
- **Methods**: We performed a prospective cohort study of 361 adults with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD from 2006 through 2015, examining them every 3–12 months for incident advanced fibrosis defined using serial measurements of validated indices (the Fibrosis-4, NAFLD fibrosis score, and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio indices). Histologic analyses of liver biopsies collected at baseline were performed by a blinded pathologist. Information collected at baseline and at each examination included the frequency and duration of aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, we estimated the association of aspirin use with prevalent steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. Using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling, we estimated the association between aspirin use and risk for fibrosis progression.
- **Results**: At enrollment, 151 subjects used aspirin daily. Compared with non-regular use, daily aspirin use was associated with significantly lower odds of NASH (adjusted odds ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.37–0.89) and fibrosis (adjusted odds ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31–0.82). Among individuals with baseline F0-F2 fibrosis (n = 317), 86 developed advanced fibrosis over 3692 person-years. Daily aspirin users had significantly lower risk for developing incident advanced fibrosis compared to non-regular users (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43–0.85).

### Diclofenac sodium delayed release [^1172u8nS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Any time during treatment with diclofenac, postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, fulminant hepatitis with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.

In a European retrospective population-based, case-controlled study, 10 cases of diclofenac-associated drug-induced liver injury were compared with non-use of diclofenac and associated with a statistically significant 4-fold adjusted odds ratio of liver injury. In this particular study, based on an overall number of 10 cases of liver injury associated with diclofenac, the adjusted odds ratio increased further with female gender, doses of 150 mg or more, and duration of use for more than 90 days.

Physicians should measure transaminases at baseline and periodically in patients receiving long-term therapy with diclofenac because severe hepatotoxicity may develop without a prodrome of distinguishing symptoms. The optimum times for making the first and subsequent transaminase measurements are not known. Based on clinical trial data and postmarketing experiences, transaminases should be monitored within 4 to 8 weeks after initiating treatment with diclofenac. However, severe hepatic reactions can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. If abnormal liver tests persist or worsen, if clinical signs and/or symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dark stools), further evaluation is necessary.

### Inhibition of fatty acid synthase with FT-4101 safely reduces hepatic de novo lipogenesis and steatosis in obese subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Results from two early-phase randomized trials [^112B9YdU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The basis for intermittent FT-4101 dosing was to minimize anticipated safety issues with systemic (dry skin, dry eye, and alopecia) and liver (plasma TG increases) DNL inhibition. This was selected based on data from a previously completed multiple-ascending-dose study demonstrating a safe profile of 3 mg FT-4101 administered daily for 28 days in healthy obese adult volunteers. Recent studies in rodents and humans describe an increase in circulating TG with ACC inhibition, despite reductions in hepatic DNL and hepatic steatosis. FASN and DNL inhibition with FT-4101 did not result in plasma TG increases.

- **Differential effects**: The differential effects of ACC and FASN inhibition on circulating TGs, even though they both inhibit DNL, may be explained by opposing effects on hepatic malonyl concentrations, an intermediate which is essential for the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. ACC inhibition decreases malonyl CoA levels, which may affect the synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to increased expression of LXR/SREBP1c target genes and subsequent stimulation of VLDL secretion and plasma TG concentrations. This is not expected to occur with FASN inhibition as malonyl CoA levels rapidly increase under these conditions.

- **Unknown effects**: It is unknown, however, whether higher doses and/or longer treatment with FT-4101 will ultimately affect VLDL secretion or other pathways, such as adipose TG clearance, that may potentially lead to hypertriglyceridemia. It is also unknown how pharmacological inhibition of FASN and its subsequent increases in malonyl-CoA will impact lipo…

### Pharmacological interventions for non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (NAFLD): an attempted network meta-analysis [^1131aoXu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Non-alcohol related fatty liver disease (commonly called non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD) is liver steatosis in the absence of significant alcohol consumption, use of hepatotoxic medication, or other disorders affecting the liver, such as hepatitis C virus infection, Wilson's disease, and starvation. NAFLD embraces the full spectrum of disease from pure steatosis (i.e. uncomplicated fatty liver) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), via NASH-cirrhosis to cirrhosis. The optimal pharmacological treatment for people with NAFLD remains uncertain.
- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative benefits and harms of different pharmacological interventions in the treatment of NAFLD through a network meta-analysis and to generate rankings of the available pharmacological treatments according to their safety and efficacy. However, it was not possible to assess whether the potential effect modifiers were similar across different comparisons; therefore, we did not perform the network meta-analysis and instead assessed the comparative benefits and harms of different interventions using standard Cochrane methodology.
- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.com up to August 2016.
- **Selection criteria**: We included only randomized clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in participants with NAFLD. We excluded trials which included participants with other liver conditions or interventions.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: A network meta-analysis [^115L3UgU]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

This study provides valuable insights into the comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), identifying resmetirom and pegozafermin as leading options for reducing steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. While most treatments demonstrated favorable safety profiles, careful monitoring is warranted for agents with higher adverse event rates. These findings underscore the importance of personalized treatment approaches that balance efficacy and safety, tailored to individual patient characteristics. Further long-term studies are needed to confirm the durability of these effects and to expand therapeutic options for diverse patient populations.

### Pharmacotherapy for NASH: Current and emerging [^1157W4bo]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most prominent forms of chronic liver disease worldwide, reflecting the epidemic of global obesity. Those with the progressive variant of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), are at significantly increased risk of multisystem morbidity and mortality. However, there are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies for NASH. Given the disease burden, there is an important unmet need for pharmacologic treatment options for this patient population.

The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of NAFLD and NASH are complex and reflected by the myriad of therapies, with different targets, currently under investigation. In broad strokes, drug development has focused on the modulation of metabolic pathways, inflammatory cascades, and/or mechanisms impacting fibrosis. Although much progress has been made in enhancing our understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis, the development of pharmacologic treatments has been hindered by challenges in clinical trial enrollment and complexities in clinical trial design.

The compounds in phase IIa have provided promising results in terms of potential benefits on various aspects of histopathology. Agents in later stages of development have shown fairly modest results in terms of reduction of hepatic steatosis, necroinflammation, and fibrosis. If longer-term safety and efficacy are established among heterogeneous cohorts, these medications may help mitigate potential morbidity and mortality for this burgeoning patient population.

### NGM282 for treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial [^114gb2H5]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease characterized by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular injury, for which no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment exists. FGF19 is a hormone that regulates bile acid synthesis and glucose homeostasis. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of NGM282, an engineered FGF19 analogue, for the treatment of NASH.
- **Methods**: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study, we recruited patients aged 18–75 years with biopsy-confirmed NASH, as defined by the NASH clinical research network histological scoring system, from hospitals and gastroenterology and liver clinics in Australia and the United States. Key eligibility criteria included a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score of 4 or higher, stage 1–3 fibrosis, and at least 8% liver fat content. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) via a web-based system and stratified by diabetic status to receive either 3 mg or 6 mg subcutaneous NGM282 or placebo. The primary endpoint was the absolute change from baseline to week 12 in liver fat content. Responders were patients who achieved a 5% or larger reduction in absolute liver fat content as measured by MRI-proton density fat fraction. Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02443116.

### Ec-naproxen [^1152c9tr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Elevations of ALT or AST (three or more times the upper limit of normal [ULN]) have been reported in approximately 1% of NSAID-treated patients in clinical trials. Rarely, severe hepatic injuries, sometimes fatal, including fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis, and hepatic failure, have been documented. Elevations of ALT or AST (less than three times ULN) may occur in up to 15% of patients treated with NSAIDs, including naproxen.

	Inform patients of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g. nausea, fatigue, lethargy, diarrhea, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and "flu-like" symptoms). If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g. eosinophilia, rash), discontinue naproxen tablets, EC-naproxen, or naproxen sodium immediately, and perform a clinical evaluation of the patient.
- **Hypertension**: NSAIDs, including naproxen tablets, EC-naproxen, and naproxen sodium, can lead to new onset of hypertension or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cardiovascular (CV) events. Patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics may have impaired response to these therapies when taking NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7)].

	Monitor blood pressure during the initiation of NSAID treatment and throughout the course of therapy.
