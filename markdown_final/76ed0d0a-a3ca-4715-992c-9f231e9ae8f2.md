## Question

Which hepatitis C lab do you order to ensure eradication after medication treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which hepatitis C laboratory test should be ordered to confirm eradication after completing direct-acting antiviral therapy, and how to time and interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical endpoint that defines cure in the DAA era. Then, I should verify the optimal timing for that test. Next, I will review which assay type is required and whether point-of-care options are acceptable. After that, I need to check assay sensitivity requirements and why lower limits of detection matter. Finally, I should consider adjunct labs, special populations, and what to do if the result is detectable or if the patient has ongoing risk for reinfection.

> Let me first confirm the endpoint. Cure after DAA therapy is defined as sustained virologic response, historically SVR24 in the interferon era but now SVR12 in the DAA era, meaning undetectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks after completing therapy. I should double-check that both AASLD/IDSA and WHO align on SVR12 as the standard test-of-cure timepoint, and yes, they do [^117Tx6ik] [^114UCUfw] [^111FkYXg].

> Wait, let me verify the timing before I jump ahead. The recommended timepoint to document cure is 12 weeks after the last DAA dose. Some clinicians may repeat testing at 24 weeks for added reassurance given the very small risk of late virologic failure, but SVR12 alone is sufficient to define cure in current guidance, so ordering the test at 12 weeks is the priority [^117Tx6ik] [^114UCUfw] [^114A63fE].

> I need to ensure I am ordering the right test modality. The definitive test is a nucleic acid amplification test for HCV RNA, either qualitative or quantitative; antibody testing is not appropriate here because antibodies persist indefinitely after clearance or cure and cannot distinguish past from current infection, so I should not order an anti-HCV test for cure confirmation [^117Tx6ik] [^114UCUfw] [^112fLM8J].

> Hold on, I should verify whether point-of-care HCV RNA assays are acceptable for test-of-cure. WHO supports validated POC HCV RNA assays as alternatives where access is limited, provided their analytical performance is comparable to laboratory-based NAT. However, I need to check the lower limit of detection because missing low-level viremia would be a problem, and data suggest that an assay with an LLoD around 1000 IU/mL could miss a meaningful fraction of treatment failures, so I should prefer assays with sensitivity at least down to roughly 200–300 IU/mL if available [^116c8JuV] [^113e6Enu] [^1129JxPg] [^114ujBKS].

> Let me consider adjunct testing at the SVR12 visit. A hepatic function panel with ALT and AST helps confirm biochemical response and identify alternative causes of liver disease if enzymes remain elevated after SVR. This is recommended alongside HCV RNA testing at 12 weeks, and I should remember that persistent transaminitis after SVR warrants evaluation for other etiologies rather than attributing it to ongoing HCV [^117Tx6ik] [^114UCUfw] [^116R1auh].

> Next, I should review special populations and follow-up needs. For persons with ongoing risk such as people who inject drugs or men who have sex with men, annual HCV RNA testing is advised to detect reinfection. For those with cirrhosis, ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma every 6 months continues regardless of SVR status. And for persons with HIV coinfection, simplified treatment pathways still require documenting SVR12, with no routine need for additional RNA testing unless clinically indicated [^111P4mah] [^117Tx6ik] [^111F56yg].

> But wait, what if the SVR12 RNA is detectable. I should confirm that any detectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks represents treatment failure or, less commonly, reinfection if new risk exposures occurred. In that scenario, I need to refer for retreatment planning and, if feasible, resistance-guided regimen selection, recognizing that very low-level viremia might be missed by less sensitive assays, which is why assay sensitivity matters for test-of-cure [^117Tx6ik] [^1115urqY] [^1129JxPg].

> Putting this together, I should order a quantitative or qualitative HCV RNA nucleic acid test at 12 weeks after completion of DAA therapy to document SVR12, preferably using a sensitive assay with an LLoD around 200–300 IU/mL if available, and I should add a hepatic function panel at the same visit. I will avoid ordering HCV antibodies because they do not reflect current infection status after cure, and I will tailor post-SVR surveillance to liver disease severity and reinfection risk [^117Tx6ik] [^114UCUfw] [^1129JxPg] [^115FZWKA].

Order a **quantitative HCV RNA PCR** [^117Tx6ik] 12 weeks after completing therapy to confirm sustained virologic response (SVR12) [^117WERaX], which defines cure [^114UCUfw]. Undetectable HCV RNA at this time indicates eradication; if detectable, evaluate for relapse or reinfection and consider retreatment [^114UCUfw]. Do not use HCV antibody testing for cure confirmation, as antibodies persist after clearance [^112fLM8J].

---

## Recommended laboratory test for confirming cure

The recommended laboratory test to confirm cure after hepatitis C treatment is the **quantitative HCV RNA PCR** (polymerase chain reaction) assay [^117WERaX]. This test detects the presence and quantity of HCV RNA in the blood, providing a direct measure of active viral replication [^114jXRQq].

---

## Timing of the test

The test should be performed **12 weeks after completion of antiviral therapy** [^117Tx6ik] to confirm sustained virologic response (SVR12) [^11225Ye9], which is the standard endpoint indicating cure [^114UCUfw].

---

## Interpretation of test results

- **Undetectable HCV RNA**: Indicates successful treatment and cure of hepatitis C infection [^114UCUfw].
- **Detectable HCV RNA**: Suggests treatment failure, relapse, or reinfection [^114UCUfw]. Further evaluation and potential retreatment may be necessary [^1115urqY].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend **obtaining a quantitative HCV RNA PCR test 12 weeks after completion of therapy** [^117Tx6ik] to confirm SVR and virologic cure [^114UCUfw]. The World Health Organization (WHO) also endorses nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HCV RNA as the preferred method to document cure at 12 or 24 weeks after treatment completion [^111FkYXg].

---

## Alternative diagnostic methods

While HCV RNA PCR is the gold standard, **HCV core antigen testing** has been explored as an alternative [^111BCrjF]. However, it is less sensitive than PCR and is not currently recommended as a primary test for confirming cure [^111FkYXg].

---

## Follow-up testing and monitoring

After achieving SVR, **annual HCV RNA testing** is recommended for patients with ongoing risk factors for reinfection, such as people who inject drugs or those with multiple sexual partners [^114UCUfw] [^111P4mah]. Routine liver function tests may also be performed to monitor liver health, particularly in patients with advanced liver disease [^notfound].

## Laboratory test for confirming hepatitis C cure

| **Test** | **Timing** | **Interpretation** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Quantitative HCV RNA PCR | 12 weeks after treatment completion | Undetectable = cure | Confirms SVR12 and cure |
| HCV antibody test | Not recommended for cure confirmation | Positive = past exposure | Not useful for confirming cure |

---

The recommended laboratory test to confirm cure after hepatitis C treatment is the **quantitative HCV RNA PCR assay** [^117Tx6ik] performed 12 weeks after completion of therapy [^111FkYXg]. Undetectable HCV RNA at this timepoint indicates successful treatment and cure of hepatitis C infection [^114UCUfw].

HIV primary care — hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening — HCV screening with HCV antibody should be repeated every 12 months for persons at increased likelihood of exposure or when clinically indicated; HCV RNA testing is indicated for screening when HCV infection within the past 6 months is suspected and in those with previous HCV infection that cleared spontaneously or through treatment; screening with HCV RNA instead of HCV antibody should be considered for persons with severe immunodeficiency (CD4 count < 200 cells/μL); repeating HCV RNA after confirmed curative therapy (undetectable HCV RNA at least 12 weeks post-completion of treatment) is not necessary unless there is a clinical indication.

Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is well-recognized as a common blood-borne infection with global public health impact affecting 3 to 5 million persons in the United States and more than 170 million persons worldwide. Chronic hepatitis C virus infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to complications of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapies with all-oral direct-acting antiviral agents are associated with high rates of sustained virologic response (SVR), generally exceeding 90%. SVR is associated with a reduced risk of liver cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, need for liver transplantation, and both liver-related and all-cause mortality. However, a subset of patients who achieve SVR will remain at long-term risk for progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver-related mortality. Limited evidence is available to guide clinicians on which post-SVR patients should be monitored vs discharged, how to monitor and with which tests, how frequently should monitoring occur, and for how long. In this clinical practice update, available evidence and expert opinion are used to generate best practice recommendations on the care of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus who have achieved SVR.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^117AR2RY]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Achieving global elimination of hepatitis C virus requires a substantial scale-up of testing. Point-of-care HCV viral load assays are available as an alternative to laboratory-based assays to promote access in hard to reach or marginalized populations. The diagnostic performance and lower limit of detection are important attributes of these new assays for both diagnosis and test of cure. Therefore, our objective was to determine an acceptable LLoD for detectable HCV viraemia as a test for cure, 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). We assembled a global data set of patients with detectable viraemia at SVR12 from observational databases from 9 countries (Egypt, the United States, United Kingdom, Georgia, Ukraine, Myanmar, Cambodia, Pakistan, Mozambique) and two pharmaceutical-sponsored clinical trial registries. We examined the distribution of HCV viral load at SVR12 and presented the 90th, 95th, 97th and 99th percentiles. We used logistic regression to assess characteristics associated with low-level virological treatment failure (defined as < 1000 IU/mL). There were 5973 cases of detectable viraemia at SVR12 from the combined data set. Median detectable HCV RNA at SVR12 was 287,986 IU/mL. The level of detection for the 95th percentile was 227 IU/mL (95% CI 170–276). Females and those with minimal fibrosis were more likely to experience low-level viraemia at SVR12 compared to men (adjusted odds ratio AOR = 1.60 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–1.97 and those with cirrhosis (AOR = 1.49 95% CI 1.15–1.93). In conclusion, an assay with a level of detection of 1000 IU/mL or greater may miss a proportion of those with low-level treatment failure.

### A comprehensive hepatitis C viral kinetic model explaining cure [^114ciR95]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2010). Low credibility.

We propose a model that characterizes and links the complexity and diversity of clinically observed hepatitis C viral kinetics to sustained virologic response (SVR)-the primary clinical end point of hepatitis C treatment, defined as an undetectable viral load at 24 weeks after completion of treatment)-in patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) who have received treatment with peginterferon alpha-2a ± ribavirin. The new attributes of our hepatitis C viral kinetic model are (i) the implementation of a cure/viral eradication boundary, (ii) employment of all hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA measurements, including those below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), and (iii) implementation of a population modeling approach. The model demonstrated excellent positive (99.3%) and negative (97.1%) predictive values for SVR as well as high sensitivity (96.6%) and specificity (99.4%). The proposed viral kinetic model provides a framework for mechanistic exploration of treatment outcome and permits evaluation of alternative CHC treatment options with the ultimate aim of developing and testing hypotheses for personalizing treatments in this disease.

### Hepatitis C virus infection care pathway – A report from the American Gastroenterological Association institute HCV care pathway work group [^113D3Xgu]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Initial evaluation of patients with HCV states that the initial assessment of an individual infected with HCV requires clinicians to efficiently gather data to weigh the risk of disease progression against the benefit of viral eradication, and although HCV eradication is considered beneficial in virtually all infected persons a patient must be physically and mentally ready for treatment, with conditions that could compromise treatment success carefully considered; the first visit is an opportunity to assess medical conditions that may contribute to progression, risk of complications or impact the selection of treatment regimen, and physical examination and laboratory testing should be targeted to evaluate for conditions that impact treatment decisions, identify patients at risk for progression of liver fibrosis or advanced liver disease, and screen for HCV extra-hepatic manifestations, noting that some laboratory tests may be necessary to meet the requirements of the patient's health insurance provider and that Figure 5 displays the algorithm to evaluate patients for the degree of liver disease severity, including fibrosis and cirrhosis.

### Antiviral therapy for treatment naïve patients with hepatitis C virus [^115r3u8F]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

This article focuses on the most recent therapies for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who are naive to therapy. The primary end point for the treatment of naive HCV patients is viral eradication or a sustained virological response, which is defined as the absence of HCV in the serum, as detected by a sensitive polymerase chain reaction test, 24 weeks after stopping antiviral therapy. Recent data suggest that an SVR can be equated with a biochemical, virological, and histological response that is sustained for up to 5 years and is conceptually a cure of HCV in 90% of patients.

### Molecular diagnostics of hepatitis C virus infection: a systematic review [^1144bWL8]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a common blood-borne pathogen that relies heavily on nucleic acid testing for confirmation of infection. Nucleic acid tests are invaluable for the diagnosis of HCV infection and provide critical prognostic information for guiding treatment and measuring the response to antiviral therapy.

Objective

To review the currently available molecular diagnostic tests for HCV, their clinical applications, and how these tests shed light on the natural history of HCV.

Evidence Acquisition

Search of MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), article reference lists, and national meeting abstracts for the diagnosis and applications of molecular diagnostic tests for HCV. Studies were selected on the basis of clinical relevance.

Evidence Synthesis

Qualitative nucleic acid tests have low limits of detection (< 50 IU HCV RNA/mL) and are used for confirmation of HCV infection and for screening blood donations. Hepatitis C virus genotype test results provide important prognostic information related to therapeutic response and are routinely used for selecting treatment regimens. Quantitative HCV RNA testing provides prognostic information regarding likelihood of treatment response and plays an important role in monitoring the antiviral response to treatment. Sustained virological response is defined as testing negative for HCV RNA 6 months after cessation of therapy. Recent studies suggest that the rate of response to therapy is also important. For example, conversion to an HCV RNA negative test result after 4 weeks of therapy constitutes a rapid virological response and is a strong predictor of treatment success. Patients who have not had an early virological response, defined as at least a 2-log decline in HCV RNA after 12 weeks of therapy, are unlikely to respond with an additional 36 weeks of therapy, and should stop therapy.

Conclusions

A sensitive nucleic acid test should be used to confirm all cases of acute or chronic HCV infection. A genotype test and quantitative HCV RNA test should be performed on all patients prior to therapy to best assess probability of response and to aid in selection of appropriate therapeutic regimen. Monitoring HCV RNA during treatment provides important information on likelihood of sustained virological response. The same type of quantitative HCV RNA test should be used throughout a patient's treatment course.

Commentary — treatment success definition and outcome expectations: SVR12 (sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the completion of therapy — defined by an undetectable HCV RNA level at that time point) is used to define treatment success, and because there is very small risk for late virologic relapse beyond SVR12, experts recommend confirmation of viral clearance by repeat testing 24 weeks or beyond. Patients with CKD and HCV infection, especially those with cirrhosis, have higher mortality than those without HCV, and among patients with CKD, survival was higher among those treated with DAAs compared with untreated patients.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2023 update: AASLD-IDSA recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^112W63AZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) adherence — Nonadherence during DAA therapy is relatively common, occurring in 11% to 40% of persons on treatment, and most episodes are short with 61% of nonadherent episodes lasting 1 to 2 days; these short periods were not associated with virologic failure. Sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after the completion of treatment (SVR12) was 94% among both adherent and nonadherent participants when nonadherence was defined as taking < 90% of the total prescribed dosage. Longer interruptions may adversely affect response: among F0 to F3 liver disease, SVR12 was 50% with < 4 weeks of DAA treatment versus 99% with ≥ 4 weeks; among participants with compensated cirrhosis, SVR12 rates were 83% and 95% in those who completed < 8 weeks compared with ≥ 8 weeks, respectively. Based on these findings and expert consensus, a management algorithm that considers the timing and duration of nonadherence and specific factors (genotype 3 infection and presence of compensated cirrhosis) is recommended (see Figure 2).

### Introduction to therapy of hepatitis C [^1111hHvB]. Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Since the 1997 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on management of hepatitis C there have been several important advances that significantly impact its therapy; notably the availability of sensitive, specific, and standardized assays for identifying hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA in the serum, the addition of ribavirin to alpha interferon, the pegylation of alpha interferon, and the demonstration that sustained virological response (SVR) is the optimal surrogate endpoint of treatment. Using pegylated interferon and ribavirin, virological response with relapse and nonresponse are less common, but remain poorly understood. Current studies are evaluating nonvirological endpoints of treatment, namely biochemical response and histological response. To date, definitive treatment trials have primarily been conducted in adult patients with elevated aminotransferase levels, clinically compensated chronic liver disease, and no other significant medical disorder. Limited data are available from studies of other patient populations, and the safety of interferon-based treatment has not yet been established in several patient groups. Future research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of viral response and clearance, to develop effective therapies for interferon nonresponse or intolerance, to define the role of complementary and alternative medicine and other nonspecific therapies, and to develop strategies for the optimal management and treatment of special patient populations who probably represent the majority of persons with chronic hepatitis C in the United States.

### Initial success from a public health approach to hepatitis C testing, treatment and cure in seven countries: the road to elimination [^114WpL9T]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

Another challenge has been high LTFU at key points in the care cascade; across countries, the biggest gap appeared to be between treatment completion and SVR12 testing. While SVR12 testing is important for programme monitoring, data suggest that most patients who complete treatment should have achieved cure, and thus, the more concerning gaps in some country contexts were between confirmatory VL testing and treatment initiation and between treatment initiation and completion. Data from some countries point to gaps in the proportion of patients who screen anti-HCV antibody positive but do not then get a confirmatory VL test, such as in Nigeria, where VL testing is paid for out of pocket. LTFU may result from different factors including expensive services, long test processing times, logistical difficulties with referrals, patient stigma or burdens and poor communication/follow-up from health facilities. In addition, HCV services often involve working with marginalised populations at higher risk of attrition. Special focus is needed to ensure that screening programmes are effective and that context-specific reasons for patient LTFU are identified and addressed.

### Updated operational guidance for implementing CDC's recommendations on testing for hepatitis C virus infection [^115DX1Qv]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Current hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing guidance recommends a two-step testing sequence for diagnosis of HCV infection. Performing an HCV RNA test whenever an HCV antibody test is reactive (complete testing) is critical to achieve national HCV elimination goals. When an HCV antibody test is reactive and no HCV RNA test is performed, testing is considered incomplete. Historically, approximately one third of patients have incomplete testing. This update clarifies that all sites performing HCV screening should ensure single-visit sample collection. This approach allows for automatic HCV RNA testing when an HCV antibody test is reactive to avoid incomplete testing. Use of strategies that require multiple visits to collect HCV testing samples should be discontinued. Automatic HCV RNA testing on all HCV antibody reactive samples will increase the percentage of patients with current HCV infection who are linked to care and receive curative antiviral therapy.

Recognizing the importance of timely guidance regarding the rapidly evolving field of hepatitis C management, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) developed a web-based process for the expeditious formulation and dissemination of evidence-based recommendations. Launched in 2014, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) guidance website undergoes periodic updates as necessitated by availability of new therapeutic agents and/or research data. A major update was released electronically in September 2017, prompted primarily by approval of new direct-acting antiviral agents and expansion of the guidance's scope. This update summarizes the latest release of the HCV guidance and focuses on new or amended recommendations since the previous September 2015 print publication. The recommendations herein were developed by volunteer hepatology and infectious disease experts representing AASLD and IDSA and have been peer reviewed and approved by each society's governing board.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^113qm2ZT]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV — Interpretation of blood tests notes that the HCV antibody test may be negative during the first 6 weeks after exposure, seroconversion may be delayed or absent in immunosuppressed individuals, and presence of HCV antibody alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; HCV RNA may be transiently negative during acute HCV infection and presence of HCV RNA alone does not distinguish between acute and chronic infection; and ALT findings include that fluctuating ALT peaks suggest acute infection, ALT may be normal during acute HCV infection, and ALT may be elevated due to other liver insults, such as alcohol consumption. If HCV antibody is positive but HCV RNA is undetectable, repeat HCV-RNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) testing is recommended to identify acute reinfection. Acute infection should be suspected if there is a rise in the ALT level without an alternative cause and also when there are low (especially < 10⁴ IU/mL) or fluctuating (> 1 log₁₀ IU/mL) HCV-RNA levels or spontaneous clearance during follow-up.

### Impact of hepatitis C virus point-of-care RNA viral load testing compared with laboratory-based testing on uptake of RNA testing and treatment, and turnaround times: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113e6Enu]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global public health problem and cause of liver disease, with the highest burden in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In 2019, there were an estimated 290 000 HCV-related deaths. In 2016, WHO launched the Global Health Sector Strategy for Viral Hepatitis 2016–2021, with a goal of eliminating viral hepatitis B and hepatitis C by 2030. Good progress has been made, with an estimated 9.4 million people with chronic HCV infection treated using direct-acting antiviral therapy between 2015 and 2019. However, as of 2019, there were still 58 million people with chronic HCV infection, and only 20% of those infected worldwide had been diagnosed and 13% treated. To address this gap and achieve the WHO targets for elimination will require a substantial scale-up of testing and treatment using simplified service delivery models. A 2021 WHO-led systematic review provided a strong evidence base for the effectiveness of full decentralisation of testing and treatment and integration with other services at harm-reduction sites, supported through task sharing, especially among people who inject drugs.

The recommended diagnostic strategy for chronic HCV infection is initial screening with an HCV antibody serological assay, followed by laboratory-based molecular viral load testing for HCV RNA, to confirm the presence of HCV viraemia and need for treatment. However, access to laboratory-based viral load testing remains limited in many LMICs. As a result, many people with chronic HCV infection are never linked to care. HCV viral load assays performed on point-of-care (POC) devices outside the laboratory are being increasingly used as an alternative testing approach, especially in facilities caring for populations with high rates of loss to care and follow‑up.POC devices can also be used for a test of cure after completing treatment, in addition to same-day diagnosis of HCV viraemic infection.

Although there is now high-quality evidence of the clinical impact of POC assays for HIV viral load monitoring, early infant diagnosis of HIV, and diagnosis of tuberculosis, data on their impact on promoting access to HCV viral load testing and treatment are scarce. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of using POC HCV viral load assays compared with centralised, high-throughput, laboratory-based standard-of-care (SOC) approaches on uptake of HCV viral load testing and treatment, and turnaround times to treatment initiation in HCV-antibody seropositive people.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^114UCUfw]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AASLD–IDSA Hepatitis C guidance — post-treatment assessment, surveillance, and retreatment: After direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, HCV-RNA and aminotransferase testing are recommended 12 or more weeks after completion to assess treatment response, and undetectable HCV RNA represents sustained virologic response (SVR) and virologic cure. For cirrhosis, ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma every 6 months after treatment completion is recommended regardless of achieving SVR. For persons with ongoing HCV risk factors, HCV-RNA testing annually or anytime an increase in hepatic aminotransferase levels occurs is also recommended. Recurrent HCV viremia after attainment of SVR represents either reinfection or a relapse; with reinfection, the treatment approaches are identical to those for initial treatment. If relapse is suspected or cannot be ruled out, such patients should be managed by clinicians with expertise in managing HCV treatment failure, and if retreatment is delayed or not feasible, assessment for liver disease progression every 6–12 months is recommended.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^115cKqnf]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of progressive liver disease and associated morbidity and mortality globally. In 2021, there were an estimated 58 million persons with a chronic infection, with a disproportionately high burden in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Short‐course curative direct‐acting antiviral (DAA) regimens have transformed opportunities for treatment scale‐up and elimination. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Global Health Sector Strategy for elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat, with ambitious targets for elimination of HCV including a 90% reduction in new infections and a 65% reduction in HCV‐related mortality by 2030.

In order to meet the 2030 global targets for HCV elimination, there is a need to substantially scale‐up access to testing and treatment, with simplified service delivery models and diagnostic innovations to expand access. A key step in the care cascade is the use of HCV viral load assays to confirm presence of viraemic infection, and then a test of cure following treatment. The 2017 WHO viral hepatitis testing guidelines recommended a laboratory‐based PCR Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT), or a core HCV antigen assay with comparable clinical sensitivity, as preferred strategies for diagnosis of viraemic HCV infection, and laboratory‐based PCR assays as a test of cure at SVR12. Point‐of‐care HCV viral load assays are now available as an alternative to laboratory‐based NAAT assays to promote access, especially in hard to reach or marginalized populations. A previous multi‐cohort analysis examined the distribution of HCV viral load at diagnosis in 66,640 individuals from 12 countries and established that 97% had a viral load greater than 1318 IU/mL and 95% had a viral load greater than 3,311 IU/mL. The key laboratory‐based assays (Abbott Real time HCV PCR, Alinity m HCV RT‐PCR, Abbott Real time HCV PCR) have an analytical sensitivity or LloD of between 5–15 IU/mL, and key PoC assays: HCV RNA PoC GeneXpert assays are 10 IU/mL for venous blood, or 100 IU/mL using fingerstick capillary blood. All these assays are therefore acceptable for diagnosis of HCV viraemic infection.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^117JGGDg]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease — practice notes include that a simplified approach to HCV treatment can be used in treatment-naive patients with any genotype and without cirrhosis and includes standardized treatment with no on-treatment testing or in-person follow-up and limited follow-up to confirm SVR; characteristics that exclude patients from receiving simplified approach to therapy are outlined in Box 1 of the Hepatitis C Virus section. See the Hepatitis C Virus section to review a summary of drug-drug interactions between HCV therapy and ARV drugs. HCV treatment should not be withheld solely due to perceived lack of adherence to ART or untreated HIV (BIII). Effort should be made to document SVR (HCV RNA less than lower limits of quantification) at least 12 weeks after completion of therapy (AI), and patients without cirrhosis who achieve SVR do not require continued liver disease monitoring. Recommendations for treatment after DAA failure are not provided, with referral to the corresponding section in the AASLD/IDSA HCV treatment guidance.

### Revaccination for hepatitis B in previous nonresponders following hepatitis C eradication [^112doN3V]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) do not respond to hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination as efficiently as the general population. We assessed if revaccination after HCV treatment resulted in improved response.

Methods

Previous HBV vaccine nonresponders were prospectively recruited for revaccination after HCV eradication. Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) testing was performed 1 month after series completion.

Results

Follow-up HBsAb testing was performed in 31 of 34 enrolled patients with 21 (67.7%) reactive results. There were no significant differences in HBsAb reactivity based on age, sex, race, or advanced fibrosis presence.

Conclusions

HBV vaccine nonresponders should be considered for revaccination following HCV cure.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute clinical practice update-expert review: care of patients who have achieved a sustained virologic response after antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection [^116kvUaq]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

AGA Institute Clinical Practice Update — post-SVR virologic testing and relapse evidence states that SVR should be confirmed by undetectable HCV RNA at 12 wk after completion of an all-oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen, with undetectable defined on a polymerase chain reaction assay with lower limit of detection < 12 IU/mL. In a series of 1054 patients who achieved SVR12 after paritaprevir/ritonavir/ombitasvir and dasabuvir, 5 (0.5%) had subsequent virologic failure, comprising relapse in 4 patients (3 by post-treatment week 24 and 1 by post-treatment week 48) and reinfection in 1 patient; in another study of 3004 patients receiving a sofosbuvir-containing therapy, 12 had reappearance of HCV RNA by follow-up week 24 with 5 patients (0.2%) demonstrating late relapse with the same virus. Although late relapse risk appears very low, some clinicians may think it prudent to obtain another HCV RNA assay at follow-up week 24 and/or follow-up week 48, while guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of America has suggested that patients do not require another HCV RNA determination after SVR12 and can be dismissed from ongoing follow-up if they had Metavir F0–F2 fibrosis before treatment.

### Clearance of hepatitis C virus RNA from serum in HIV / hepatitis C virus coinfection indicates eradication from peripheral blood mononuclear cells [^1128iJgP]. AIDS (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study are to determine the frequency of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA persistence in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-positive patients with clearance of the virus from serum and to identify the presence of any ongoing replication.

Design

This is a prospective cross-sectional study.

Methods

HIV antibody-positive individuals with previous exposure to HCV, but not current infection with HCV, were recruited. Blood was taken to allow identification of HCV RNA in both serum and PBMCs. Intracellular HCV was extracted using the QIAamp RNA Blood MiniKit. Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using a modification of the COBAS TaqMan HCV Test for use with the high pure system.

Results

Twenty-six HIV-positive individuals were recruited to the study. All had previously been infected with HCV. Six individuals had spontaneously cleared HCV, 10 had achieved sustained virological response following 24 weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin for acute HCV, and 10 had achieved sustained virological response following standard pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy for chronic HCV. None demonstrated HCV RNA persistence in either serum or PBMCs.

Conclusion

Our findings lend support to the view that clearance of HCV RNA from serum in HIV/HCV coinfection indicates eradication from PBMCs. Thus, absence of serum HCV RNA 6 months after the end of therapy can be used as a marker of treatment success for interferon-based therapies. However, the advent of small molecule HCV inhibitors may require us to rethink our definitions of response and cure.

### Evaluation of the cherokee nation hepatitis C virus elimination program-cherokee nation, Oklahoma, 2015–2020 [^112gfqmq]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Approximately 2.4 million persons in the United States have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and 66,700 acute HCV infection cases were estimated for 2020 (1,2). American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons are disproportionately affected by HCV infection and experienced the highest rates of acute HCV infection (2.1 cases per 100,000 persons) and HCV-associated mortality (10.17 per 100,000 persons) in the United States during 2020 (1). During 2015, Cherokee Nation Health Services (CNHS) in Oklahoma implemented an HCV elimination program, which includes universal HCV screening, primary HCV workforce expansion, and harm reduction services (3). To assess progress 5 years after program initiation, CNHS analyzed deidentified health record data. During November 1, 2015-October 31, 2020, a total of 1,423 persons received a diagnosis of HCV infection. Among these persons, 1,227 (86.2%) were linked to HCV care, and 871 (61.2%) initiated HCV treatment; 702 (49.3%) returned for their 12-week post treatment completion visit, at which time 698 (49.1%) had achieved laboratory-confirmed sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA at ≥ 12 weeks after completion of treatment (SVR12). Although CNHS has linked the majority of persons diagnosed with HCV infection to care, and those who returned for the SVR12 visit had high cure rates (99.4%), treatment initiation was lower than expected. Future activities should prioritize addressing gaps in treatment initiation after linkage to care and confirmation of hepatitis C cure with SVR12 testing.

Simplified HCV treatment algorithm for treatment-naive adults with compensated cirrhosis defines eligibility, exclusions, and pretreatment assessments: The algorithm applies to persons aged ≥ 18 years who have not been previously treated and have evidence of compensated cirrhosis (Child-Turcotte-Pugh [CTP] class A) but not decompensated cirrhosis (CTP class B or C), and a CTP score ≥ 7 or any history of decompensation disqualifies these patients. Recommended pretreatment assessment includes clinical evaluation for ascites and hepatic encephalopathy and ultrasound imaging of the liver within the prior 6 months to evaluate for hepatocellular carcinoma and subclinical ascites, and any of these clinical or imaging findings are contraindications to use of the simplified treatment algorithm. Other disqualifying circumstances mirror the previous section, and medication reconciliation, assessment for potential drug–drug interactions, and pretreatment education and counseling are the same as for treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis. Pretreatment laboratory assessment includes complete blood count (CBC), INR, a hepatic function panel, and eGFR within 3 months of initiating antiviral therapy.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^113pp6de]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4 Statistical analyses

We evaluated the distribution of HCV viral load at 12 weeks post‐treatment assessment among all patients in the combined data set using both standard IU/mL measures and normalized using a log 10 transformation, to allow for better visualization of the viral load distribution. From these measures, we identified the lower 95th, 97th and 99th percentiles of the HCV RNA distribution. To estimate the 95% confidence interval for each viral load threshold, we use the method described by Hahn and Meeker, 1991, which corrects for a non‐normal distribution of values.

We next identified the subgroup of individuals who had HCV RNA that is detectable, but < 1000 IU/mL at the time of SVR assessment. Such individuals were defined as having 'low‐level viremia' (LLV) at the time of treatment failure. We chose the threshold of < 1000 IU/mL because that is the LLoD for HCV core antigen assay and a reasonable proxy for newer platforms being developed that have potential to be near point‐of‐care in use and so promote access to diagnosis and treatment. We described the characteristics of this subgroup and employed logistic regression to assess factors associated with having LLV compared to no LLV among those with detectable viral load at SVR12. Analyses were conducted using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute; Cary, NC). The Boston University Institutional Review Board ruled this study not human subjects research.

2.5 Sensitivity analyses

We conducted two additional subgroup and sensitivity analyses. First, we examined whether results differed between clinical trial and observational cohorts to determine whether conclusions potentially differ in investigational and real‐world settings. Second, we examined the HCV RNA viral load at SVR24 after treatment completion to assess whether checking for cure at 24 weeks rather than 12 weeks would provide similar conclusions. This was undertaken in the cohort from Georgia, the US Department of Veterans Affairs, and one of the clinical trial cohorts that reported patient HCV RNA test results at both 12‐ and 24 weeks post‐treatment.

### Advancing diagnosis of current hepatitis C virus infection: a key to hepatitis C elimination in the United States [^117Muj3A]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

The article by Johnson and colleagues provides a perspective from public health laboratories in the United States in terms of maximizing reflex HCV RNA testing for antibody-positive samples. The authors describe results from a survey conducted by APHL in 2021 of its 99 member laboratories and the outcome of a virtual HCV diagnostic meeting hosted by APHL and CDC in 2021. The need for completion of the current 2-step testing algorithm (testing all anti-HCV reactive samples for HCV RNA) and development of a single-step algorithm for HCV diagnostics in future are further discussed.

The final article by Fricker et al, while examining the tools needed to support same-day diagnosis and treatment of current HCV infection, highlights the challenges with the current multiday diagnosis and treatment, which result in the loss of a number of patients who fail to receive treatment. Current practices, diagnostic tools, and gaps in care in the field of hepatitis C in the United States are also discussed, in addition to the steps that need to be taken for same-day testing and care are discussed. The authors emphasize the need for new tools, such as FDA-approved, CLIA-waived POC antigen tests or NATs for HCV and hepatitis B virus and NATs for human immunodeficiency virus that do not require venous blood; the availability of such tools will bring a paradigm shift in our approach to achieving the goal of same-day testing and treatment.

Eliminating hepatitis C as a public health threat in the United States is achievable but requires unfettered access to early diagnosis and timely treatment. A transformative national hepatitis C elimination program has been proposed by the highest levels of US government. One of the three priorities identified in the proposed national elimination initiative is to accelerate the availability of innovative hepatitis C diagnostic tests, including POC testing supporting same-day testing and treatment. This 8-part supplement characterizes advancements in hepatitis C diagnostics and recent changes in the US regulatory landscape that, together, provide opportunities to expand patient-centered hepatitis C testing and treatment services across the variety of settings where people with hepatitis C receive care. Identifying and seizing these opportunities will be essential to eliminating hepatitis C as a public health threat in the United States.

### Lessons learned from global hepatitis C elimination programs [^114tzN5U]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition to reflex testing in inpatient clinics, blood banks, and antenatal clinics, to improve the accessibility to viremia testing, HCVcAg and GeneXpert HCV viral load testing were introduced in Georgia in 2017. These testing approaches were piloted in collaborative studies conducted by National Center for Disease Control and Public Health and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and were shown to be simpler to perform, quicker, and cheaper than the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for determining the presence of HCV RNA.

After the implementation of HCVcAg testing as an alternative to the PCR HCV RNA testing in Georgia, HCVcAg was recommended by the WHO Euro Compendium as a cost-effective and productive alternative to HCV RNA testing for diagnosis and medical follow-up during hepatitis C treatment with DAAs. The analysis of 976 serum samples, collected at baseline, week 4, end of treatment, and 12 weeks after treatment completion, demonstrated that agreement between HCVcAg and HCV RNA test results was 98% at pretreatment, 96% at week 4, 99% at end of treatment, and 100% at 12 weeks after treatment completion. The findings suggest that the HCVcAg test could be used as an alternative to PCR HCV RNA testing for the diagnosis of HCV infection among people who previously tested reactive for anti-HCV. This was confirmed in similar studies and included in WHO recommendations for simplified service delivery and diagnostics for hepatitis C infection. In addition, in a situation in which large numbers of anti-HCV-positive samples need to be tested for viremic infection every month (500–1000 per month in Georgia), HCVcAg testing has been shown to be quicker, simpler, and cheaper than testing all these samples using standard PCR.

### Antiviral therapy for treatment naïve patients with hepatitis C virus [^116rhyzW]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

This article focuses on the most recent therapies for patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) who are naïve to therapy. The primary end point for the treatment of naïve HCV patients is viral eradication or a sustained virological response, which is defined as the absence of HCV in the serum, as detected by a sensitive polymerase chain reaction test, 24 weeks after stopping antiviral therapy. Recent data suggest that an SVR can be equated with a biochemical, virological, and histological response that is sustained for up to 5 years and is conceptually a cure of HCV in 90% of patients.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing methods and confirmatory approach — The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test are similar to laboratory-based assays, but a positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection, a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result, and a test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection. Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing, which requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing. Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing, and dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this advantageous where phlebotomy is a testing barrier. An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay should be used; immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody–negative, and HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals. If clarification is needed to differentiate resolved infection from biologic false positivity, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken, and a false positive result is more likely when the anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio is low.

Initial HCV testing and follow-up — For initial screening, HCV-antibody testing with reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing is recommended (I, A), and HCV-antibody testing using a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved assay (laboratory-based or point-of-care) is recommended. Among persons with a negative HCV-antibody test who were exposed to HCV within the prior 6 months, HCV-RNA or follow-up HCV-antibody testing 6 months or longer after exposure is recommended; HCV-RNA testing can also be considered for immunocompromised persons (I, C). Among persons at risk for reinfection after previous spontaneous or treatment-related viral clearance, HCV-RNA testing is recommended because a positive HCV-antibody test is expected (I, C). Persons with a positive HCV-antibody test and negative results for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction should be informed that they do not have evidence of current (active) HCV infection but are not protected from reinfection (I, A). Quantitative HCV-RNA testing is recommended prior to initiation of antiviral therapy to document the baseline level of viremia (i.e., baseline viral load) (I, A). HCV genotype testing may be considered for those in whom it may alter treatment recommendations (I, A).

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^114ujBKS]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Achieving global elimination of hepatitis C virus requires a substantial scale‐up of testing. Point‐of‐care HCV viral load assays are available as an alternative to laboratory‐based assays to promote access in hard to reach or marginalized populations. The diagnostic performance and lower limit of detection are important attributes of these new assays for both diagnosis and test of cure. Therefore, our objective was to determine an acceptable LLoD for detectable HCV viraemia as a test for cure, 12 weeks post‐treatment (SVR12). We assembled a global data set of patients with detectable viraemia at SVR12 from observational databases from 9 countries (Egypt, the United States, United Kingdom, Georgia, Ukraine, Myanmar, Cambodia, Pakistan, Mozambique) and two pharmaceutical‐sponsored clinical trial registries. We examined the distribution of HCV viral load at SVR12 and presented the 90th, 95th, 97th and 99th percentiles. We used logistic regression to assess characteristics associated with low‐level virological treatment failure (defined as < 1000 IU/mL). There were 5973 cases of detectable viraemia at SVR12 from the combined data set. Median detectable HCV RNA at SVR12 was 287,986 IU/mL. The level of detection for the 95th percentile was 227 IU/mL (95% CI 170–276). Females and those with minimal fibrosis were more likely to experience low‐level viraemia at SVR12 compared to men (adjusted odds ratio AOR = 1.60 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30–1.97 and those with cirrhosis (AOR = 1.49 95% CI 1.15–1.93). In conclusion, an assay with a level of detection of 1000 IU/mL or greater may miss a proportion of those with low‐level treatment failure.

### Hepatitis C virus clearance cascade-United States, 2013–2022 [^11354TMe]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Approximately 2.4 million adults were estimated to have hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the United States during 2013–2016 (1). Untreated, hepatitis C can lead to advanced liver disease, liver cancer, and death (2). The Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan for the United States calls for ≥ 80% of persons with hepatitis C to achieve viral clearance by 2030 (3). Characterizing the steps that follow a person's progression from testing to viral clearance and subsequent infection (clearance cascade) is critical for monitoring progress toward national elimination goals. Following CDC guidance (4), a simplified national laboratory results-based HCV five-step clearance cascade was developed using longitudinal data from a large national commercial laboratory throughout the decade since highly effective hepatitis C treatments became available. During January 1, 2013-December 31, 2021, a total of 1,719,493 persons were identified as ever having been infected with HCV. During January 1, 2013-December 31, 2022, 88% of those ever infected were classified as having received viral testing; among those who received viral testing, 69% were classified as having initial infection; among those with initial infection, 34% were classified as cured or cleared (treatment-induced or spontaneous); and among those persons, 7% were categorized as having persistent infection or reinfection. Among the 1.0 million persons with evidence of initial infection, approximately one third had evidence of viral clearance (cured or cleared). This simplified national HCV clearance cascade identifies substantial gaps in cure nearly a decade since highly effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents became available and will facilitate the process of monitoring progress toward national elimination goals. It is essential that increased access to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention services for persons with hepatitis C be addressed to prevent progression of disease and ongoing transmission and achieve national hepatitis C elimination goals.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

Diagnosis of HCV infection was defined as receipt of a detectable HCV RNA test result. Linkage to HCV care was defined as undergoing an evaluation by a CNHS HCV-trained provider. HCV treatment initiation was defined as documentation 1) by the provider that treatment commenced, or 2) that the prescription was picked up from the pharmacy. The SVR12 visit was defined as documentation that a visit occurred to obtain an HCV RNA result within the study period and ≥ 12 weeks after the end of treatment. Achieving laboratory-confirmed SVR12 was defined as receipt of an undetectable HCV RNA test result at ≥ 12 weeks after completion of treatment. Although not included in the cascade of care, treatment completion, defined as documentation by the provider that treatment was completed, or that all prescription refills were picked up from the pharmacy, was assessed. Persons who completed treatment and were assessed for an HCV RNA test result after treatment completion but before the SVR12 due date were not included in the last two stages of the cascade of care (i.e. an SVR12 visit and laboratory-confirmed SVR12).

Sex, age, and presence of advanced liver disease (ascertained using noninvasive liver staging methods, as identified by serologic biomarkers [fibrosis-4 index > 3.25 †]) were also assessed. Treatments during this period consisted of interferon-free, all oral, direct-acting antivirals).

Progress along each step of the cascade of care was assessed by calculating 1) the proportion of persons who completed each step among the population of persons with diagnosed HCV infection, and 2) the proportion of persons at each step who moved to the next step. IBM SPSS Statistics (version 19; IBM Corp.) was used to conduct all analyses. Because this activity was considered a surveillance and public services delivery program, and the data were collected in the context of clinical care, § it was deemed exempt from review by the Cherokee Nation Institutional Review Board. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

### Abstract… [^117Vo6GY]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment and Outcome Overview Direct-acting antiviral therapy is more effective, better tolerated, and the treatment course is shorter than older interferon and ribavirin-based regimens. The need for pretreatment genotyping and on-treatment monitoring is decreased with these agents. 15, 40, 46, 47 As a prevention strategy, the test-and-treat option calls for treatment at the time of diagnosis, instead of waiting for spontaneous resolution of the acute infection in all patients except those with a life expectancy of less than one year. 8, 15, 47 Undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after completion of treatment indicates a sustained virologic response and is indicative of a virologic cure as reflected by the high concordance at the five-year mark.

OPTIONS FOR TREATMENT-NAIVE HCV WITHOUT CIRRHOSIS OR WITH COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS In adults with HCV and without cirrhosis who meet criteria for treatment with the simplified regimen, studies have consistently exhibited a greater than 95% sustained viral response at 12 weeks posttreatment with eight weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, regardless of the HCV genotype. 8, 15, 18 Any evidence of hepatic decompensation or HCC is a contraindication for the simplified treatment regimen and requires a referral. 8, 15 Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir have shown similar high curative rates to patients without cirrhosis. 8, 15, 18, 54, 55 Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is effective against all HCV genotypes. 8, 15, 18 If sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is selected, pretreatment genotype testing to identify patients with genotype 3 is required to eliminate possible nonstructural protein 5A resistance-associated substitution at Y93H.

8, 15, 54 If the resistance-associated substitution result is positive, patients should be treated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or referred to a specialist. 8, 15, 18 Because hepatic decompensation occurs rarely during treatment of HCV infection, a complete blood count; measurement of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, bilirubin, and albumin levels; INR; and eGFR should be obtained within three months of initiating treatment to detect early liver injury.

### Updated operational guidance for implementing CDC's recommendations on testing for hepatitis C virus infection [^114jhip3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Complete and accurate testing is the first step in identifying persons with current HCV infection to ensure linkage to care and initiation of curative antiviral therapy. Operational strategy 1 should no longer be used because it can lead to incomplete HCV testing and gaps in the HCV care cascade. Health care facilities and laboratories should update practices to ensure operational strategy 1 is no longer used. Using a single visit to conduct both steps of the HCV testing sequence will increase complete diagnosis of current HCV infection, which will increase the percentage of patients with current HCV infection who are linked to care and receive curative antiviral therapy.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^117BfuDX]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

Currently, the European Association for the Study of the Liver Diseases, IDSA‐AASLD HCV guidance panel, all recommend a minimum LLoD of 1000 IU/mL for HCV diagnosis, but none yet specify minimal test characteristics for test of cure. While some small studies have examined the distribution of viral load at end of treatment — including a cohort of eight patients from the United States, a cohort of 14 patients in Germanyand 330 treatment failures in an analysis of 34 phase 2/3 clinical trials. The latter study in clinical trials identify that 97% had a viral load > 10,000 IU/mL 12 weeks post‐treatment, and just 0.9% of patients had a viral load less than 1000 IU/mL (77, 405 and 680 IU/mL). To date, there have been no real world, global analyses of distribution of viral load in those with detectable viraemia at SVR12.

Our primary objective was to determine the LLoD for an HCV RNA assay to detect 90%, 95%, 97% and 99% of treatment failures at 12 weeks post‐treatment in a large multi‐cohort data set, and to assess the characteristics associated with low‐level viraemia (< 1000 IU/mL) at SVR12. These findings will help inform global policy as well as guide manufacturers as to whether existing platforms and assays meet requirements for their use both in diagnosis and as a test of cure, and for future development of testing technologies.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diagnostic algorithm for current infection or reinfection — For diagnosis of current initial HCV infection, begin with HCV-antibody testing and for recurrent HCV infection, begin with HCV-RNA testing; ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing. Persons who have a reactive HCV-antibody test and a negative (not detected) HCV-RNA test should be informed that they do not have evidence of current HCV infection, with terminal pathways labeled "No Current HCV Infection" or "Additional Testing as Appropriate", whereas when infection is present the pathway labels "Current HCV Infection" and "Link to Care for Treatment or Retreatment". HCV-RNA testing is required to detect reinfection, and for persons who might have been exposed to HCV within the past 6 months or who are immunocompromised, testing for HCV RNA should be performed; repeat HCV-RNA testing if the person tested is suspected to have had HCV exposure within the past 6 months or has clinical evidence of HCV disease or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen.

Hepatitis C retreatment after sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir failure — Among patients with a prior sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir treatment failure, 16 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir plus sofosbuvir and weight-based ribavirin is recommended based on the improved resistance profile of pibrentasvir and high response rate among genotype 3–infected participants, and extension to 24 weeks or longer with this regimen should be considered for persons with factors that may reduce the likelihood of achieving SVR; however, while there are case report data, no clinical trial data are available to support such an approach. A 24-week course of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir plus weight-based ribavirin is also recommended after prior sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir failure, but although there are currently no published clinical trial data that examine retreatment with the same regimen after failure, a small retrospective series included 4 persons who received 24 weeks (1 with ribavirin) and reported SVR12 was 100% (4 of 4). The recommendation to extend duration to 24 weeks with weight-based ribavirin when retreating with the same regimen is predominantly based on extrapolation from prior studies in different populations.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy — monitoring, sustained virologic response (SVR) assessment, and simplified regimens for treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis are outlined as follows: Patients taking diabetes medication(s) should be informed of the potential for symptomatic hypoglycemia during and after DAA therapy, and glucose monitoring during and after DAA treatment is recommended; dosage adjustments may be needed, and patients taking warfarin should be informed of the potential for a change in their anticoagulation status with international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring recommended during and after DAA treatment; for others, on-treatment laboratory monitoring is not required unless a patient experiences treatment-related side effects or there are adherence concerns. Based on these data, 8 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is recommended for adults eligible for the simplified treatment algorithm. To assess treatment response, HCV-RNA and hepatic aminotransferase testing is recommended 12 or more weeks after completing DAA treatment, undetectable HCV RNA represents SVR and virologic cure, and in the absence of cirrhosis, persons who attain SVR require no liver-specific follow-up; for those with ongoing HCV risk factors, risk-reduction counseling is recommended and HCV-RNA testing annually or anytime an increase in hepatic aminotransferase levels occurs. Recurrent HCV viremia after attainment of SVR represents either reinfection or a relapse; with reinfection, treatment approaches are identical to those for initial treatment, and if relapse is suspected or cannot be ruled out, such patients should be managed by clinicians with expertise in managing HCV treatment failure. Persons who attain SVR but have persistently elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels require evaluation for other causes of liver disease; if retreatment is delayed or not feasible, assessment for liver disease progression every 6–12 months is recommended, and advise all patients, regardless of SVR, to avoid excess alcohol intake to prevent liver damage.

Evidence indicates that treatment outcomes are high: studies "demonstrate SVR12 rates approaching 95%". The panel's stance is explicit: "active or recent drug use or concern for reinfection is not a contraindication to HCV treatment". After spontaneous clearance or cure, "At least annual HCV RNA testing is recommended for PWID with recent IDU after they have spontaneously cleared HCV infection or have been successfully treated".

### Hepatitis C: diagnosis and management [^111a3eT6]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Screening recommendations and treatment guidelines for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have been updated. People at the greatest risk of HCV infection are those between 18 and 39 years of age and those who use injection drugs. Universal screening with an anti-HCV antibody test with follow-up reflex HCV RNA polymerase chain reaction testing for positive results to confirm active disease is recommended at least once for all adults 18 years and older and during each pregnancy. Any person with ongoing risk factors should be screened periodically as long as the at-risk behavior persists. One-time screening is recommended for patients younger than 18 years with risk factors. For treatment-naive adults without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, a simplified treatment regimen consisting of eight weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir results in greater than 95% cure rates. Undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after completing therapy is considered a virologic cure (i.e., sustained virologic response). A sustained virologic response is associated with lower all-cause mortality and improves hepatic and extrahepatic manifestations, cognitive function, physical health, work productivity, and quality of life. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, posttreatment surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma and esophageal varices should include abdominal ultrasonography (with or without alpha fetoprotein) every six months and upper endoscopy every two to three years. In the absence of cirrhosis, no liver-related follow-up is recommended.

Post‑treatment, assessment of quantitative HCV RNA and a hepatic function panel are recommended 12 weeks or later following completion of therapy to confirm undetectable HCV RNA and transaminase normalization. After achieving cure, no liver‑related follow‑up is recommended for noncirrhotic patients; those with ongoing risk should be tested for HCV RNA annually and whenever they develop elevated ALT, AST, or bilirubin.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

### Diagnosis and management of hepatitis C [^113DQV1e]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a major cause of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, is predominantly transmitted by exposure to blood or body fluids. The infection progresses to a chronic state in 80% of patients, whereas the virus clears completely after the acute infection in 20% of patients. Screening for HCV with an anti-HCV antibody test is recommended for all adults at high risk of infection, and one-time screening is recommended in adults born between 1945 and 1965. If the anti-HCV antibody test result is positive, current infection should be confirmed with a qualitative HCV RNA test. In patients with confirmed HCV infection, quantitative HCV RNA testing and testing for HCV genotype is recommended. An assessment of the degree of liver fibrosis with liver biopsy or noninvasive testing is necessary to determine the urgency of treatment. Treatment of patients with chronic HCV infection should be considered based on genotype, extent of fibrosis or cirrhosis, prior treatment, comorbidities, and potential adverse effects. The goal of therapy is to reduce all-cause mortality and liver-associated complications. Although interferon-based regimens have been the mainstay of treatment for HCV infection, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved two combination-pill interferon-free treatments (ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir, and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir) for chronic HCV genotype 1.

- CDC recommends universal hepatitis C screening for all adults 18 and older and all pregnant women during each pregnancy.
- CDC recommends testing people in certain high-risk groups more frequently.
- Testing, diagnosis, and timely treatment can prevent hepatitis C complications and interrupt transmission. One-time testing CDC recommends one-time hepatitis C testing for people with recognized risk factors or exposures, including: Routine periodic testing CDC also recommends routine periodic testing for patients with ongoing risk factors, including:

- People who currently inject drugs and share needles, syringes, or other drug preparation equipment.
- People with selected medical conditions, including people who receive maintenance hemodialysis. Recommended tests Clinicians should use an FDA-approved HCV antibody test followed by a NAT for HCV RNA test when antibody is positive/reactive.

Tests include:

- HCV antibody test.
- Nucleic acid test to detect presence and levels of HCV RNA. CDC recommends that clinicians collect all samples needed to diagnose hepatitis C in a single visit, initiating hepatitis C testing with an HCV antibody test, and ordering HCV RNA testing automatically when the HCV antibody is reactive. * If HCV RNA testing is not feasible and person tested is not immunocompromised, do follow-up testing for HCV antibody to demonstrate seroconversion. If the patient tested is immunocompromised, consider testing for HCV RNA. † It is recommended before initiating antiviral therapy to retest for HCV RNA in a subsequent blood sample to confirm HCV RNA positivity.

§ If the patient is suspected of having HCV exposure within the past 6 months, or has clinical evidence of HCV disease, or if there is concern regarding the handling or storage of the test specimen, the clinician should follow up with the patient. What to do next CDC recommends that clinicians offer the following services to people who are diagnosed with HCV infection:

- Medical evaluation.
- Hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination.
- Screening and brief intervention for alcohol consumption.
- HIV risk assessment and testing. Learn more about hepatitis C clinical care and treatment.

### Maximizing reflexive hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA testing of HCV antibody-reactive samples within United States public health laboratories [^112BWBgX]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Testing guidelines from the CDC recommend a 2-step algorithm to diagnose current HCV infection. The first test in the algorithm is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved HCV antibody (Ab) test. A reactive Ab test indicates that the individual has been exposed to the virus at some point; however, it does not indicate whether the virus is still present in the blood. Thus, following a reactive HCV Ab test, specimens must undergo an FDA-approved nucleic acid test (NAT) that detects HCV RNA to confirm a current infection. Depending on the individual, follow-up or additional testing may be needed when the screening test is negative. Effective HCV treatment is available following a detectable HCV RNA, but loss to follow-up before a NAT can be performed is a major concern. Loss to follow-up occurs when a patient does not return for additional testing or care and can result in an active infection going undiagnosed and untreated. To ensure that patients are not lost to follow-up, best practice is to complete the entire HCV testing algorithm (Ab and NAT) on samples collected during a single patient visit. While the recommendation to test a sample that is reactive for HCV Ab using an HCV NAT is clear, it can be complicated for a laboratory to perform the reflexive testing. Discrepancies in the number of specimens that require HCV Ab testing versus HCV NAT (ie, many specimens will not require NAT), along with differences between testing methodologies typically mean that Ab tests and NATs are performed in different laboratory sections (immunology vs molecular) or even different laboratories (ie, via reference laboratories). This article aims to characterize the current landscape of HCV testing within US public health laboratories and identify critical areas for improvement of HCV testing to inform future programmatic action and advance HCV elimination goals.

### Delayed versus immediate treatment for patients with acute hepatitis C: a randomised controlled non-inferiority trial [^114RgKwT]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Early treatment of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with interferon alfa monotherapy is very effective, with cure rates of greater than 85%. However, spontaneous clearance of HCV occurs in 10–50% of cases. We aimed to assess an alternative treatment strategy of delayed antiviral therapy in patients who do not eliminate the virus spontaneously compared with immediate treatment.

Methods

In our open-label phase 3 non-inferiority trial, we enrolled adults (≥ 18 years) with acute hepatitis C but no HIV or hepatitis B co-infection at 72 centres in Germany. We randomly allocated patients with symptomatic acute hepatitis C (1:1) to receive immediate pegylated interferon alfa-2b treatment for 24 weeks or delayed treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin (for 24 weeks) starting 12 weeks after randomisation if HCV RNA remained positive. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence and block sizes of eight, stratified by bilirubin concentration. We assigned all asymptomatic patients to immediate treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2b for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was sustained HCV RNA negativity in all randomly allocated participants who completed screening (intention-to-treat analysis), with a non-inferiority margin of 10%. For the primary analysis, we calculated the virological response of patients in the immediate and delayed treatment groups and an absolute risk difference stratified by bilirubin status. The trial was stopped early on advice from the study advisory committee because of slow recruitment of participants. This study is registered, number ISRCTN88729946.

Findings

Between April, 2004, and February, 2010, we recruited 107 symptomatic and 25 asymptomatic patients. 37 (67%) of 55 symptomatic patients randomly allocated to receive immediate treatment and 28 (54%) of 52 symptomatic patients randomly allocated to receive delayed treatment had a sustained virological response (difference 13.7%, 95% CI -4.6 to 32.0; p = 0.071). 18 (72%) of 25 asymptomatic patients had a sustained virological response. 22 (42%) of 52 symptomatic patients allocated to receive delayed treatment did not complete follow-up compared with 20 (25%) of 80 symptomatic or asymptomatic patients assigned immediate treatment (p = 0.037). 11 symptomatic patients (21%) assigned delayed treatment had spontaneous HCV clearance. 14 patients who received delayed pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin treatment and completed follow-up achieved sustained virological response.

Interpretation

Delayed treatment is effective although not of equal efficacy to immediate treatment; coupled with the rate of spontaneous clearance it can reduce unnecessary treatment in closely monitored populations. Immediate treatment seems preferable in populations where loss to follow-up is great.

### Clinical care of hepatitis C… [^114FAQGe]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Hepatitis C can be cured in more than 95% of cases with just 8–12 weeks of well-tolerated oral-only treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents.
- Curative DAA treatment is recommended for essentially everyone with hepatitis C.
- Clinicians can mitigate risk for advanced liver disease progressing with lifestyle counseling, co-infection monitoring, and recommendations for vaccination against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Treatment options The use of ribavirin with interferon or peginterferon is no longer recommended due to poor efficacy and high rate of adverse effects with the regimen. DAA therapy is better tolerated and more effective and has a shorter duration. There are 3 types of later, next-generation DAA therapies for non-pregnant adults and children over age 3:
- Protease inhibitors
- Nucleoside analog polymerase inhibitors
- Nonstructural protein 5A inhibitors Many agents have antiviral activity against all genotypes.

Available therapies can cure more than 95% of people infected with HCV within 8–12 weeks of therapy. Learn more about oral therapy options from the University of Washington Infectious Disease Education & Assessment program. Treatment recommendations Except for pregnant patients and children under 3, clinicians should treat people with detectable HCV RNA in their blood with oral DAA therapy. There is no need to wait for potential spontaneous viral resolution. Clinicians should also:

- Conduct a full medical evaluation for chronic liver disease.
- Conduct a risk assessment and testing for HBV and HIV.
- Vaccinate against hepatitis A and hepatitis B as recommended. Treatment precautions DAA therapies are not approved for pregnant patients and children under 3. There are efforts underway to develop prenatal treatment options and/or infant antiviral postexposure prophylaxis to prevent perinatal transmission.
- hepatitis B surface antigen
- antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen
- total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen Clinicians should monitor people who test positive for HBsAg or for an isolated positive anti-HBc for reactivation of HBV infection while they are receiving treatment. Learn more about treating HBV/HCV co-infected patients from the AASLD and IDSA. For more information on HBV reactivation, visit the American Gastroenterological Association.

### Determining the lower limit of detection required for HCV viral load assay for test of cure following direct-acting antiviral-based treatment regimens: evidence from a global data set [^1129JxPg]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2022). Medium credibility.

This study assessed the distribution of detectable viral loads 12 weeks following the end of treatment for HCV infection in an international cohort to inform the lower limit of detection of viral load assays for test of cure to identify treatment failure as well as for diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection. Based on a combined data set of clinical trials and observational data, a LLoD of 227 IU/mL (4030 IU/mL in the clinical trials subsample) would identify 95% of patients with a detectable viral load 12 weeks after treatment. While more than 10 times higher than the analytical sensitivity of laboratory‐based NAATs, it is more than 10 times lower than the LLoD for HCV diagnosis. These findings demonstrate it might be prudent and necessary to consider different LLoD standards for HCV diagnosis and for test of cure. Development of a point‐of‐care HCV test for cure with a low enough limit of detection to identify 95% of patients and is affordable, is an important aspect of expanding access to HCV treatment and a vital component of the WHO's HCV elimination targets.

### Characterization of nonrapid virologic response patients infected with HCV genotype 1 who may relapse after standard therapy with peginterferon plus ribavirin [^112hhXPb]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2012). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) accounts for approximately 40% of liver-related mortality in the United States. Eradicating the virus may prevent life-threatening complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The current recommended standard of care for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon alfa plus weight-based ribavirin for 48 weeks. This treatment leads to a sustained virologic response (SVR; defined as absence of detectable HCV RNA by sensitive PCR 6 months after completion of therapy) in 46–52% of patients infected with HCV genotype 1. Thus, approximately 50% of these patients either discontinue treatment early or experience a suboptimal response that can include nonresponse (never achieve undetectable HCV RNA), relapse (recurrence of viraemia despite being HCV RNA undetectable at end of treatment [EOT]) or breakthrough (detectable HCV RNA at EOT after an initial undetectable HCV RNA during treatment).

Abbreviations: HCV = hepatitis C virus; SVR12 = sustained virologic response > 12 weeks after treatment completion.

Among the 871 persons who initiated treatment, 800 (91.8%) completed treatment. In addition to the 871 persons who initiated treatment during the study period, another 17 persons initiated and completed HCV treatment after the study period concluded on October 31, 2020; to align with consensus definitions, these 17 persons were included in the diagnosis and linkage to care levels but excluded from subsequent cascade levels. Among 98 persons who completed treatment but did not return for their SVR12 visit, 40 (40.8%) had evidence of SVR before a 12-week posttreatment visit was due. These results were also not included in the cascade of care. Eleven of the 98 persons who did not return for an SVR12 visit during the study period had undetectable HCV RNA test results outside of the study period. To align with consensus definitions, these 11 persons were included in all cascade levels, except the SVR12 visit (Table).

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^117Tx6ik]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

AASLD–IDSA post-treatment and follow-up guidance states that Assessment of quantitative HCV RNA and a hepatic function panel are recommended 12 weeks or later following completion of therapy to confirm HCV RNA is undetectable (virologic cure) and transaminase normalization, with further Assessment for other causes of liver disease recommended for patients with elevated transaminase levels after achieving SVR; after cure, Ultrasound surveillance for HCC (with or without alpha-fetoprotein testing) every 6 months is recommended for patients with cirrhosis and Patients with ongoing risk for HCV infection should be counseled about risk reduction and tested for HCV RNA annually, while Patients should abstain from alcohol to avoid progression of liver disease; if cure is not achieved, Patients in whom initial HCV treatment fails to achieve cure (SVR) should be evaluated for retreatment by a specialist, Ultrasound surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (with or without alpha-fetoprotein testing) every 6 months is recommended for patients with cirrhosis, and Assessment of disease progression every 6 to 12 months with a hepatic function panel, CBC, and INR is recommended.

### Role of serologic and molecular diagnostic assays in identification and management of hepatitis C virus infection [^115iy5Nf]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Another role for HCV diagnostic testing in the era of DAA-based therapy is as a measure of medication adherence. Patients who are adherent to new, highly potent DAA regimens have been shown to have undetectable HCV RNA very early in therapy. Of note, studies have shown that low levels of quantifiable HCV RNA on therapy and even at the end of treatment should not be considered indicative of nonadherence and do not preclude achieving an SVR. In this context, an accurate but less sensitive method, such as measurement of HCV core antigen levels, may be a valuable alternative to highly sensitive HCV RNA testing as an adherence measure. If a patient receiving a DAA has detectable viremia with a less sensitive method, e.g. a limit of detection (LOD) between 1,000 and 5,000 IU/ml after 4 weeks of therapy, the patient is potentially nonadherent or failing therapy. If confirmed by a more sensitive HCV RNA test, this information could trigger a valuable clinical intervention such as a change in the DAA. Alternatively, analysis of the HCV core antigen levels could be used for this purpose. Undetectable HCV core antigen levels during therapy may be particularly important in patients, such as active substance abusers, in whom adherence may be questioned.

Posttreatment, it is important to continue to monitor for HCV recurrence, particularly among high-risk groups such as active substance abusers and HCV/HIV-infected MSM. Among MSM, the acute HCV reinfection rate ranges from 7.8 to 15.2 per 100 person-years of follow-up. Antibodies to HCV persist in the body long after the patient has cleared the infection following either effective therapy or spontaneous resolution. However, achieving an SVR or spontaneous resolution of infection does not prevent subsequent reinfection with the hepatitis C virus. This means that the anti-HCV test routinely used to screen the general population is not useful to identify patients who have been reinfected. For populations who are considered at higher risk for reinfection, such as PWID or MSM, a direct marker for the presence of the virus (RNA or core antigen) should be used to screen these patients for reinfection.

### EASL recommendations on treatment of hepatitis C: final update of the series [^113GbdUd]. Journal of Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease, with approximately 71 million chronically infected individuals worldwide. Clinical care for patients with HCV-related liver disease has advanced considerably thanks to an enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, as well as developments in diagnostic procedures and improvements in therapy and prevention. These therapies make it possible to eliminate hepatitis C as a major public health threat, as per the World Health Organization target, although the timeline and feasibility vary from region to region. These European Association for the Study of the Liver recommendations on treatment of hepatitis C describe the optimal management of patients with recently acquired and chronic HCV infections in 2020 and onwards.

HCV PEP Not Recommended

HCV PEP with DAA therapy is not routinely recommended. The risk for transmission of HCV from percutaneous exposures (0.2%) and mucocutaneous exposures (0%) is low and in most situations does not justify giving DAAs to several hundred exposed HCP because of potential side effects; furthermore, efficient duration of PEP has not been established. DAA therapy is highly efficacious in eradicating acute and chronic infections; therefore, new HCV infections should be identified early and treated, and the strategy of testing and treating if transmission occurs is recommended.

Testing 3–6 Weeks Postexposure

If the source patient is HCV RNA positive or source-patient testing is not performed or not available, HCP baseline testing should be followed by a NAT for HCV RNA at 3–6 weeks after exposure. This test also should be performed if a source patient is anti-HCV positive and no source patient HCV RNA testing is available. A NAT performed at 6 weeks postexposure has the advantage of coinciding with HIV postexposure testing schedules, if recommended.

Testing 4–6 Months Postexposure

For all HCP for whom follow-up testing is recommended, a final test for anti-HCV at 4–6 months with testing for HCV RNA if positive (i.e. either reflex to or follow-up NAT) should be conducted. Testing performed at 6 months postexposure has the advantage of coinciding with hepatitis B virus (HBV) postexposure testing schedules, if recommended. Exposed HCP who develop illness with symptoms indicative of acute HCV infection at any point should be tested for HCV RNA.

No further follow-up is indicated for HCP who remain anti-HCV negative at 4–6 months. However, for those who had a negative anti-HCV result at 4–6 months and are immunocompromised or have liver disease, an additional test for HCV RNA can be considered. Seroconversion from anti-HCV negative to anti-HCV positive with undetectable HCV RNA can indicate resolved infection or acute infection during a period of aviremia. In addition, false-positive anti-HCV tests have been reported to occur. For HCP with a positive anti-HCV result and confirmed undetectable HCV RNA after 4–6 months, a NAT for HCV RNA should be repeated if clinical evidence of HCV infection is present. Tests should be repeated if concerns exist about results being compromised because of storage and handling errors or other issues that might affect specimen integrity.

Definition of Acute HCV

A new episode of acute HCV infection was defined according to previously established criteria as a positive HCV RNA test in the presence of a negative anti-HCV test within the past 12 months or a positive HCV RNA test with an acute ALT rise and no other identifiable cause. HCV reinfection was defined as a positive HCV RNA test in patients who had previously achieved spontaneous clearance (anti-HCV positive individuals with 2 consecutive negative HCV RNA results 24 weeks apart and did not receive treatment), sustained virological response following treatment (negative HCV RNA result 24 weeks for interferon [IFN]-based or 12 weeks for DAA after stopping treatment or later), or with evidence of genotype switch and potential exposure.

### Tools needed to support same-day diagnosis and treatment of current hepatitis C virus infection [^113HzcvE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Current hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevention efforts and treatment rates must improve for the United States to achieve World Health Organization global elimination targets by 2030. Within the current multiday diagnosis and treatment paradigm for HCV infection, there is a substantial loss in the cascade of care, resulting in far fewer patients receiving treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) than those with HCV infection diagnosed at initial testing. These losses are further compounded by the limited number of primary healthcare providers available to treat HCV, the difficult referral system providers have to navigate to direct patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection into care, and the lengthy time needed to procure DAAs through prior authorization requirements.

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance recommends treatment for all patients with acute or chronic HCV infection, except those with short life expectancies that cannot be remediated by HCV therapy, liver transplantation, or another directed therapy, with a goal of reducing the all-cause mortality rate and liver-related health adverse consequences through virologic cure achieved by sustained virologic response (SVR) 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Selection and initiation of a DAA regimen can often be delayed by the time required to complete pretreatment assessments.

### Hepatitis C core Ag and its clinical applicability: potential advantages and disadvantages for diagnosis and follow-up? [^111BCrjF]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection which is often a silent disease has resulted in a global epidemic. The diagnosis of hepatitis C virus often requires confirmation with molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction for detection of HCV RNA. Following laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis, molecular techniques are routinely used to monitor HCV RNA levels, particularly in those undergoing treatment. Unfortunately, molecular tests are relatively expensive and their cost may be prohibitive in the developing world. Several studies have investigated the applicability of the hepatitis C core Ag (HCVcAg), as a substitute for measuring HCV RNA levels. In this review, we provide an overview of the major findings of these studies focused on the utility of measuring HCVcAg antigen levels in the clinical setting. Overall, measuring HCVcAg levels is associated with several advantages and disadvantages. It may be useful in different clinical settings for monitoring HCV patients after obtaining an initial baseline HCV RNA result.

### Early virologic response to treatment with peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C [^116EL9UF]. Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Interferon-based regimens for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C have become increasingly effective and are able to eradicate virus in more than one half of cases. Early identification of patients who will not respond is desirable because treatment might be stopped, thereby avoiding the expense and inconvenience of unnecessary therapy. We examined the accuracy of different degrees of viral inhibition during the early weeks of treatment (early virologic response [EVR]) with pegylated interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin (PEG/R) in identifying patients who would not respond to therapy. The best definition of EVR was a reduction in hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA by at least 2 logs after the first 12 weeks of treatment compared with baseline. Between 69% and 76% of patients achieved this threshold, depending on the treatment regimen, and sustained virologic response (SVR) occurred in 67% to 80% of these patients. Patients who did not reach EVR did not respond to further therapy. If treatment had been stopped in patients without EVR, drug costs would have been reduced by more than 20%. In conclusion, early confirmation of viral reduction following initiation of antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C is worthwhile. It provides a goal to motivate adherence during the first months of therapy and a milepost at which to reassess the need for continued treatment. Most patients who are able to complete the first 12 weeks of therapy achieve EVR and have a high probability of SVR. Patients who fail to achieve EVR will not clear virus even if an additional 9 months of therapy is received. Therapy can be confidently discontinued in those cases.

Acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection — abbreviated direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens: There are presently insufficient data to recommend abbreviated courses of any approved DAA regimens; until more definitive data are available, recommended treatment is as described for chronic hepatitis C infection in the online HCV guidance. Pangenotypic regimens, as recommended in the simplified HCV treatment section, represent the preferred choice for eligible patients, and for patients who are ineligible for simplified HCV treatment, genotyping may be considered to guide DAA regimen selection.
