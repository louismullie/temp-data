## Question

hyponatremia and elevated bnp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage hyponatremia when BNP is elevated, integrating BNP into diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypotonic hyponatremia and the urgency based on symptoms. Then, I should determine chronicity and classify by volume status using exam and urine studies. Next, I will interpret the elevated BNP in clinical context rather than in isolation. After that, I will map likely etiologies to volume categories and outline cause-specific treatments, including when to use hypertonic saline and when vaptans are appropriate. Finally, I will integrate BNP into prognosis and monitoring, address special populations, and ensure safe follow-up with tight correction limits and contingency plans [^114Mg1Pm] [^1121fSgV] [^111VTuRa].

> Let me first confirm the basics before anything else, because if I start down the wrong path, I risk harming the patient. I need to verify true hypotonic hyponatremia by ensuring serum sodium is less than 135 mEq/L with low measured serum osmolality below 275 mOsm/kg, while simultaneously ruling out pseudohyponatremia and hypertonic states such as hyperglycemia or mannitol use; I should also immediately assess for severe neurologic symptoms that would mandate hypertonic saline, and I must establish chronicity because that governs safe correction rates and the risk of osmotic demyelination, particularly in chronic cases where I should target no more than 8 to 12 mEq/L in 24 hours with even tighter limits in high-risk patients, and be prepared to re-lower sodium if overcorrection occurs [^114Mg1Pm] [^114hpGSU] [^113PyTGH] [^115pq4RC].

> Hold on, I should verify volume status carefully since this is the pivot point for the entire diagnostic pathway and treatment plan. On exam, I will look for hypervolemic signs like edema, rales, and elevated JVP, hypovolemic clues such as orthostasis and dry mucosa, and euvolemia if these are absent; in parallel, I will check urine osmolality and sodium because a urine osmolality greater than 100 mOsm/kg signals impaired free water excretion while urine sodium above 30 mmol/L in the right context suggests SIADH or renal salt loss, and less than 30 mmol/L suggests hypovolemia or hypervolemia with avid sodium retention; I need to remember that in edematous states there can be intravascular depletion producing non-osmotic vasopressin release, which blurs bedside assessment, so I should synthesize findings rather than rely on a single data point [^1121fSgV] [^111B44kt] [^112qVhmp].

> Now, about the elevated BNP: my first instinct is to assume it confirms heart failure, but wait, let me verify because that would be an overreach. BNP or NT-proBNP elevations support the diagnosis and risk stratification of heart failure when integrated with the clinical picture, yet levels can be confounded by renal dysfunction, advanced age, sepsis, malignancy, and other stress states, so I should not let an elevated BNP alone exclude SIADH or hypovolemia; BNP remains valuable, but only when interpreted alongside volume status, imaging, and urine indices rather than in isolation [^111VTuRa] [^112CaAES] [^1117Q6Aw] [^116Abcnc] [^113e6SWc] [^116ZZbyH].

> If my assessment points to hypervolemia, I should consider heart failure as most likely and recognize the pathophysiology of reduced effective arterial blood volume driving non-osmotic vasopressin release and free water retention that outpaces sodium retention, producing dilutional hyponatremia; in this situation, BNP helps corroborate cardiac congestion and informs prognosis, but I need to confirm with clinical congestion, imaging, and response to decongestion rather than BNP alone [^112qVhmp] [^111VTuRa].

> If the patient appears euvolemic, I need to think about SIADH while I keep my guard up for endocrine causes like hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency, and I should use high urine osmolality with urine sodium above 30 mmol/L to support SIADH after excluding diuretics and cortisol deficiency; an elevated BNP here does not rule out SIADH and may simply reflect comorbidities or subclinical cardiac strain, so I should avoid anchoring on BNP and instead let urine studies and endocrine testing guide me [^1121fSgV] [^111B44kt] [^115XadcF].

> If I find hypovolemia, I should consider diuretics, gastrointestinal losses, or renal salt wasting, and in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage or other neurosurgical conditions, I need to distinguish SIADH from cerebral salt wasting by focusing on volume status and natriuresis; in that neuro population, natriuretic peptides including BNP may be elevated and contribute to natriuresis, and mineralocorticoids can be considered when CSW is suspected alongside appropriate sodium and volume repletion [^112qVhmp] [^112kNVG4].

> I need to decide on immediate therapy based on symptom severity before cause-specific measures begin. For severe or moderately severe neurologic symptoms attributable to hyponatremia, I should give 3% hypertonic saline boluses, typically 100 mL, repeated as needed to achieve an initial 4 to 6 mEq/L rise to abort seizures or impending herniation, with serum sodium checks every 2 to 4 hours; then, I must slow down and respect daily correction limits to prevent osmotic demyelination, and be ready to halt or re-lower with electrolyte-free water and desmopressin if overcorrection occurs in chronic cases [^114Mg1Pm] [^114hpGSU] [^113PyTGH] [^116H7fVr] [^115pq4RC].

> For hypervolemic hyponatremia in heart failure, I will prioritize decongestion with loop diuretics, implement fluid restriction and appropriate sodium restriction, and optimize guideline-directed medical therapy including renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists as tolerated; if hyponatremia remains clinically significant and refractory to fluid restriction and diuretics, vasopressin antagonists such as tolvaptan are an option, but I should remember they are not for urgent correction of severe neurologic symptoms and require close sodium monitoring and inpatient initiation per labeling [^111VTuRa] [^112UGAbo] [^111faSPw] [^113jaYcR].

> For euvolemic SIADH, I should start with fluid restriction tailored to urine osmolality and consider increasing solute intake using oral urea or a combination of oral sodium chloride plus a loop diuretic to enhance free water clearance, while simultaneously removing offending drugs and treating underlying causes; if these measures fail and the patient remains significantly hyponatremic and symptomatic, carefully monitored vaptan therapy can be considered in selected patients [^112MGZPb] [^112uhRxs] [^116Fduk1] [^111faSPw].

> For hypovolemic hyponatremia, the therapy is isotonic saline to restore intravascular volume and suppress vasopressin, with discontinuation of the precipitating diuretic if present; if cerebral salt wasting is suspected in a neurosurgical patient, I should replace both sodium and water, often with hypertonic solutions for significant hyponatremia, and consider mineralocorticoids such as fludrocortisone per guideline recommendations, while carefully monitoring for overcorrection [^114Mg1Pm] [^112kNVG4].

> Next, I should integrate BNP into monitoring and prognostication rather than as a solitary diagnostic arbiter. Let me double-check that baseline and predischarge natriuretic peptide levels in heart failure carry prognostic information and that combined hyponatremia with high NT-proBNP identifies a particularly high-risk cohort with worse renal outcomes and mortality; trending BNP or NT-proBNP alongside clinical decongestion can guide response, but I need to remember the substantial biological variation in serial measurements when interpreting small changes [^113jaYcR] [^115ntb5a] [^11463SLe] [^116XJ91Q] [^116E2jdD].

> I will now examine special contexts where BNP can mislead and hyponatremia management deviates. In oncology and septic patients, striking BNP elevations may reflect critical illness rather than volume overload, so I should not conflate BNP spikes with congestion without corroboration; in neurosurgical patients, distinguishing SIADH from cerebral salt wasting is crucial because fluid restriction worsens CSW, and mineralocorticoids may help; in cirrhosis, hyponatremia signals advanced disease and poor prognosis, so I should avoid rapid correction and consider transplant evaluation while using cautious water restriction and diuretic adjustments tailored to ascites management [^1117Q6Aw] [^112kNVG4] [^114NVLhP].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I also need to confirm medication contributors that both elevate BNP and worsen sodium balance. Desmopressin products including DDAVP and Nocdurna can precipitate severe hyponatremia, especially in older adults or those with heart failure or renal disease, so I must check for these and institute strict sodium monitoring or discontinue if hyponatremia occurs; I should also review SSRIs and thiazides and remove nonessential hyponatremia-provoking agents when possible [^117422wt] [^113UMxRk] [^1171yPCB] [^116pW7eT] [^112uhRxs] [^116Fduk1].

> I need to ensure safe inpatient monitoring and clear discharge planning. During active correction I will check serum sodium every 4 to 6 hours, perform frequent neurologic assessments for cerebral edema or osmotic demyelination, track strict intake and output with daily weights, and reassess BNP or NT-proBNP trends every 48 to 72 hours in decompensated heart failure to align with the clinical course; before discharge in heart failure I should obtain a natriuretic peptide to inform prognosis, and at discharge I will provide education on fluid and salt restrictions, review and deprescribe hyponatremia-inducing medications, and schedule early sodium rechecks with explicit return precautions for neurologic symptoms [^113PyTGH] [^113jaYcR] [^114Mg1Pm] [^117422wt] [^116pW7eT].

> Let me reconsider the overall algorithm to be sure I did not miss a critical branch. Stabilize first with hypertonic saline if there are severe neurologic symptoms, then classify volume status with exam and urine studies, diagnose likely etiologies including heart failure, SIADH, hypovolemia or cerebral salt wasting, and treat cause-specifically while capping correction rates and preparing to re-lower if needed; integrate BNP as a diagnostic adjunct and powerful prognostic tool rather than a sole determinant, and prevent recurrence by addressing medications and arranging close follow-up with repeat sodium and natriuretic peptide checks when indicated [^114Mg1Pm] [^1121fSgV] [^111VTuRa] [^113jaYcR].

Hyponatremia with elevated BNP most often reflects **hypervolemic hyponatremia from heart failure** or cirrhosis, where BNP rises with volume overload and sodium falls due to water retention [^111VTuRa] [^114NVLhP] [^116ZZbyH]. It can also occur in **cerebral salt wasting after CNS injury**, where BNP-driven natriuresis causes hypovolemia and hyponatremia [^112qVhmp] [^1176YZZ4]. Management depends on the cause: treat heart failure [^111VTuRa] or cirrhosis [^113ChaQs] with fluid restriction [^114Mg1Pm], diuretics, and vasopressin antagonists [^111faSPw]; for CSW, give isotonic/hypertonic saline and fludrocortisone [^112kNVG4]. Both hyponatremia and elevated BNP are independent predictors of worse outcomes, so careful correction and close monitoring are essential [^11463SLe] [^116XJ91Q].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

### Heart failure and cirrhosis

In heart failure, elevated BNP reflects ventricular stretch and overload [^116ZZbyH], while neurohormonal activation (RAAS, AVP) promotes water retention, resulting in **dilutional hyponatremia** [^112UGAbo]. In cirrhosis [^114NVLhP], portal hypertension reduces effective arterial volume, triggering AVP and RAAS activation that causes water retention and dilutional hyponatremia; BNP also rises with volume overload.

---

### Cerebral salt wasting (CSW)

After CNS injury (e.g. SAH, TBI), BNP/ANP-driven natriuresis leads to **hypovolemia and hyponatremia** [^112qVhmp]. BNP is typically elevated in CSW [^1176YZZ4] [^11279ycJ].

---

## Clinical implications and prognosis

Hyponatremia and elevated BNP independently predict **higher mortality**, longer hospital stay, and more complications in heart failure and cirrhosis [^115XadcF] [^114NVLhP] [^11463SLe]. CSW can cause significant morbidity and mortality if not recognized and treated promptly [^112qVhmp].

## Diagnostic approach

A **structured approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Serum sodium | Confirms hyponatremia (< 135 mmol/L) [^114Mg1Pm] [^114hpGSU] |
| 2 | Serum osmolality | Differentiates hypotonic vs. non-hypotonic hyponatremia [^114Mg1Pm] [^111PapxU] |
| 3 | Urine sodium and osmolality | Helps distinguish SIADH, CSW, and hypervolemic states [^114Mg1Pm] [^1121fSgV] [^111B44kt] |
| 4 | BNP/NT-proBNP | Assesses cardiac stress/volume overload [^111VTuRa] [^116ZZbyH] [^115ntb5a] |
| 5 | Clinical assessment | Evaluates volume status and underlying causes [^114Mg1Pm] [^112GSy2Z] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

| **Condition** | **Management approach** |
|-|-|
| Heart failure | - Fluid restriction <br/> - Loop diuretics <br/> - Vasopressin antagonists (e.g. tolvaptan) <br/> - Treat underlying cardiac dysfunction [^114Mg1Pm] [^111faSPw] [^111VTuRa] |
| Cirrhosis | - Fluid restriction <br/> - Discontinue diuretics if moderate hyponatremia <br/> - Treat underlying liver disease [^114NVLhP] [^113ChaQs] |
| CSW | - Isotonic or hypertonic saline <br/> - Fludrocortisone <br/> - Treat underlying CNS injury [^112qVhmp] [^112kNVG4] |

---

## Potential complications

Hyponatremia can cause seizures, coma, and death; rapid correction also risks **osmotic demyelination** [^114Mg1Pm] [^111WX8Kf]. BNP elevation indicates severe disease and a higher risk of adverse outcomes [^11463SLe].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should track serum sodium, BNP, and clinical status to **guide therapy** and prevent complications [^113jaYcR] [^114Mg1Pm]. Follow-up should include regular reassessment to adjust treatment and reduce recurrence risk [^115ntb5a] [^114Mg1Pm].

---

Hyponatremia with elevated BNP signals significant underlying disease, most often heart failure, cirrhosis, or CSW; **targeted therapy and careful monitoring are required** to improve outcomes [^111VTuRa] [^114NVLhP] [^112qVhmp].

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^112qVhmp]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Clinically apparent extracellular fluid (ECF) excess in the form of edema usually indicates other differential diagnoses for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), such as decompensated heart or liver failure. However, assessment is complicated by the fact that peripherally edematous patients may be intravascularly volume depleted, resulting in a baroreceptor-mediated arginine vasopressin (AVP) stimulus. Other clinical signs associated with hypervolemia include pleural effusion and ascites, provided these are transudative; exudative effusions or ascites, for example, related to malignancy or infection, can co-occur with SIAD. Hyponatremia is an independent marker of mortality in cirrhosis and heart failure and occurs due to a reduction in effective circulating volume and release of AVP in an attempt to compensate. In these conditions, managing the underlying pathology, if possible, for example, with fluid restriction or volume diuresis, is the optimal approach rather than specific sodium-directed therapy.

Cerebral salt wasting (CSW) is a somewhat controversial entity that is sometimes considered a differential diagnosis for SIAD in the setting of hyponatremia following a cerebral insult (e.g. traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), tumor, or stroke). The proposed pathophysiology of CSW involves the release of natriuretic peptides (e.g. B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP], also known as brain natriuretic peptide) and/or reduced sympathetic stimulation to the kidney, inhibiting sodium resorption and suppressing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system — leading to renal salt and water loss causing hyponatremia, which can be exacerbated by the provision of hypotonic fluids.

Specifically, they recommend recognizing that the development of hyponatremia (serum sodium concentration < 130 mmol/L) in patients with cirrhosis is linked to a dire prognosis, as it is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Therefore, it is important to evaluate patients with hyponatremia for liver transplantation.

### International expert consensus document on Takotsubo syndrome (Part II): Diagnostic workup, outcome, and management [^111hoJkC]. European Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome is frequently associated with a substantial increase in plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), reaching its peak approximately 24–48 hours after symptom onset, as a reflection of regional left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. A gradual return of BNP/NT-proBNP towards normal levels occurs within the next few months after presentation.

The degree of NT-proBNP elevation appears directly related to:

- **Sympathetic overactivation**: This is reflected by normetanephrine concentrations.
- **Inflammatory origin**: Peak C-reactive protein concentrations suggest that BNP release might be, at least in part, of inflammatory origin.
- **Systolic LV dysfunction**: This is measured by the wall motion score index (WMSI). Peak NT-proBNP levels also vary with the extent of LV oedema as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR).

- **Other potential biomarkers**: Interleukin (IL)-6 levels appear less elevated while those of IL-7 are more elevated in Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) compared with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, differences between groups were small and unlikely to be of diagnostic utility.

Two recently published studies focused on the potential utility of the release and circulation of certain microRNAs (miRNAs) in association with TTS onset. Kuwabara et al. noted that the elevation of circulating miR-133a appeared to represent an early consequence of myocardial injury, including TTS and AMI. However, subsequent analyses of cases of TTS (N = 36) and evolving STEMI (N = 27) suggested that the elevation of miR-133a was…

### Atrial and brain natriuretic peptides as markers of cardiac load and volume retention in primary aldosteronism [^112qX4B7]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). High credibility.

Atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP, respectively) are cardiac hormones with natriuretic and vasodilator actions. The present study was carried out to determine the natriuretic peptide that is closely related to cardiac load and volume retention in patients with primary aldosteronism (PA).

- **Methods**: We examined 11 patients with PA due to aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma before and after surgical resection. Plasma levels of ANP and BNP were measured by specific immunoradiometric assays, and total blood volume was determined by a plasma tracer method with (131)I-human albumin.

- **Results**: Plasma levels of ANP and BNP were elevated in the PA patients compared with normotensive control subjects (P < .01), and the elevated ANP and BNP levels were reduced (P < .01) after adenoma resection. When analyzed with the pre- and postoperative data, a significant relationship was observed between mean blood pressure and plasma levels of ANP (r = 0.64, P < .01) and BNP (r = 0.58, P < .01). The BNP was significantly correlated with the SV1 + RV5 voltage (r = 0.65, P < .01) and with total blood volume (r = 0.57, P < .01), but this was not the case for ANP.

- **Conclusion**: The present results suggest that the plasma level of BNP is more closely related to cardiac load or volume status than ANP is in patients with PA due to adrenal adenoma.

### Hyponatremia and vasopressin antagonism in congestive heart failure [^115sgsXe]. Clinical Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

In a national heart failure registry, hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mEq/L) was initially reported in 5% of patients and considered a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality. In a chronic heart failure study, serum sodium level on admission predicted an increased length of stay for cardiovascular causes and increased mortality within 60 days of discharge. Hyponatremia in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) is associated with a higher mortality rate. By monitoring and increasing serum sodium levels during hospitalization for CHF, patient outcomes may improve.

This review describes the pathophysiology of hyponatremia in relation to CHF, including the mechanism of action of vasopressin receptors in the kidney, and assesses the preclinical and clinical trials of vasopressin receptor antagonists — agents recently developed to treat hyponatremia. In hospitalized patients with CHF, hyponatremia plays a major role in poor outcomes. Vasopressin receptor antagonists have been shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials in patients with hyponatremia.

### B-type natriuretic peptide levels: a potential novel "white count" for congestive heart failure [^114skNkD]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2001). Low credibility.

Finding a simple blood test to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with congestive heart failure could have a favorable impact on the costs associated with the disease. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is synthesized in the cardiac ventricles, and its level correlates with left ventricular pressure, amount of dyspnea, and the state of neurohormonal modulation, thus making the peptide the first potential "white count" for heart failure.

Data indicate that serial point-of-care testing of BNP should be helpful in patients presenting to urgent care clinics with dyspnea. BNP may also serve as a screening tool for patients referred for echocardiography. A low BNP level makes left ventricular dysfunction (both systolic and diastolic) highly unlikely. Furthermore, BNP may provide an effective means of improving in-hospital management of patients admitted with decompensated congestive heart failure. In some cases, BNP level observations may obviate the need for invasive hemodynamic monitoring and, when such monitoring is used, may help tailor treatment of the decompensated patient.

Finally, the role of BNP in the outpatient cardiac or primary care clinic may be of critical importance in titration of therapies as well as in assessing the state of neurohormonal compensation of the patient.

### Hyponatremia and worsening sodium levels are associated with long-term outcome in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure [^116XJ91Q]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). High credibility.

Treatment‐related changes of serum sodium levels and clinical outcomes: On‐admission hyponatremia in combination with a drop of serum sodium levels during hospitalization was associated with a higher mortality rate in this study population, as demonstrated by Kaplan–Meier survival curve analysis (Figure 4). Such incremental effects were also observed in patients with either preserved or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (Figure 4). Combined on‐admission hyponatremia and drops of sodium levels were significantly associated with a higher mortality rate than either alone in Cox proportional hazards models (Table 4, Model 1). The effect remained significant when accounting for age, sex, hematocrit, eGFR, LVEF, prescribed medications, and NT‐proBNP (Table 4, models 2–4). In patients with on‐admission hyponatremia, a drop of sodium levels of > 3 mEq/L was associated with a marked increase in mortality compared to those with a drop of ≤ 3 mEq/L or no drop of sodium levels (Figure 5). In patients without hyponatremia on admission, mortality increased with the severity of sodium level drops during hospitalization (Figure 5).

- **Altered laboratory findings**:
	- **Serum electrolytes**:
		- **Hyperkalemia**: Small increases in serum potassium, especially in patients with renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS).
		- **Hyponatremia**: Particularly in patients receiving a low sodium diet or concomitant diuretics.
	- **BUN/serum creatinine**: Transient elevations of BUN or serum creatinine, especially in volume- or salt-depleted patients or those with renovascular hypertension, may occur. Rapid reduction of long-standing or markedly elevated blood pressure can result in decreases in the glomerular filtration rate, leading to increases in BUN or serum creatinine.
	- **Hematologic**: A positive ANA has been reported.
	- **Liver function tests**: Elevations of liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and serum bilirubin have occurred.

### B-type natriuretic peptide-guided treatment for heart failure [^1179NaZN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

All patients with chronic heart failure require monitoring, which should include a detailed clinical assessment and a review of medication, including the need for titration and optimization in line with guidelines and to identify possible side effects. Pharmacological treatment options for patients with LVSD (New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II–IV) include diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated), beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA).

The frequency of monitoring depends on the clinical status and stability of the patient. The monitoring interval should be short (days to two weeks) if the clinical condition or medication has changed, but it is required at least every six months for stable patients with proven heart failure.

The intervention requires monitoring of B-type natriuretic peptide concentrations to guide treatment of heart failure with the aim of enhancing the management of individual patients. B-type natriuretic peptide, along with NT-proBNP, is a natriuretic peptide secreted when the heart is stretched. B-type natriuretic peptide has a shorter half-life of 20 minutes compared to one to two hours for NT-proBNP. Both can be increased in patients with systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Both biomarkers have demonstrated diagnostic and prognostic utility in heart failure. Monitoring NP concentration provides feedback to the physician.

### Bnp and congestive heart failure [^111HiKKp]. Progress in cardiovascular diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a peptide hormone secreted chiefly by ventricular myocytes, plays a key role in volume homeostasis. The plasma concentration of BNP is raised in various pathological states, especially heart failure. Many studies suggest that measurement of plasma BNP has clinical utility for excluding a diagnosis of heart failure in patients with dyspnea or fluid retention and for providing prognostic information in those with heart failure or other cardiac disease. It may also be of value in identifying patients after myocardial infarction in whom further assessment of cardiac function is likely to be worthwhile. Preliminary evidence suggests that measuring the plasma concentration of BNP may be useful in fine-tuning therapy for heart failure. Artificially raising the circulating levels of BNP shows considerable promise as a treatment for heart failure. With simpler assay methods now available, it is likely that many physicians will measure plasma BNP to aid them in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring of their patients with heart failure or other cardiac dysfunction.

### Use of NT-proBNP for the screening, diagnosis and risk-stratification of left ventricular dysfunction [^116UNB3J]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

Recently, it has been suggested that natriuretic peptides can be used during the diagnosis of heart failure to identify particularly high-risk individuals who would merit more expedited review and investigation. This is due to the recognition that higher natriuretic peptide levels at diagnosis are associated with a higher risk of hospitalization or death.

As with the diagnosis of heart failure, there is ample evidence that higher natriuretic peptides are associated with a higher risk of hospitalizations, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death in patients with prevalent heart failure. This relationship is seen across the spectrum of ejection fraction, with rising levels of natriuretic peptides associated with a poorer prognosis and falling levels associated with a better prognosis.

Currently, there is little evidence that any of the guideline-recommended therapies should be initiated on the basis of natriuretic peptide levels. While natriuretic peptides have been used to enrich trial populations for risk of subsequent events and confirm the diagnosis of heart failure, guidelines do not recommend their use for selecting patients for therapy. They can be used to monitor risk, but how to incorporate natriuretic peptide monitoring into clinical practice is yet unclear.

There is some evidence that NT-proBNP can be incorporated into an up-titration algorithm for guideline-recommended therapies in heart failure. In the STRONG-HF (Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, helped clarify this potential role.

### Treatment guidelines for hyponatremia: Stay the course [^115pq4RC]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Subsequently, several studies confirmed that osmotic demyelination was associated with more rapid rates of correction of chronic hyponatremia. Excluding case series on the basis of patient referrals, studies of patients with a sodium ≤ 120 mmol/L that include data on correction rates and outcomes are discussed. The frequency of osmotic demyelination varied widely among studies, depending on pretreatment serum sodium, correction rate, and method of identifying post-therapeutic neurologic sequelae. However, it is apparent that in patients with chronic hyponatremia, the lower the serum sodium and the larger the increase, the more likely that osmotic demyelination will be identified.

- **Post-treatment neurologic sequelae in studies**: When osmotic demyelination syndrome was first described, it was widely believed that to avoid potentially fatal neurologic complications of severe symptomatic hyponatremia, it was important to rapidly raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level above 120 mmol/L and, according to some experts, to as high as 130 mmol/L. At a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L, it becomes impossible to both raise the serum sodium to a "safe" level and avoid correction by > 12 mmol/L per day; a choice must be made between the risks of persistent, severe hyponatremia, and the risks of osmotic demyelination. Because a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L is uncommon, a letter was sent to all members of the American Society of Nephrology seeking data on patients with a sodium ≤ 105 mmol/L who had been recently treated.

### Plasma levels of natriuretic peptides and development of chronic kidney disease [^113e6SWc]. BMC Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Both ANP and BNP are cardiac hormones with counter-regulatory roles against increased fluid volume and elevated blood pressure. In patients with heart failure, plasma levels of ANP and BNP are progressively elevated according to the severity of the disease, making them widely used markers for heart failure. Similarly, plasma levels of these natriuretic peptides are elevated in patients with chronic renal failure. Recently, elevated plasma levels of either the natriuretic peptides or the N-terminal fragments of their precursors have been identified as biomarkers for patients with CKD: the higher the plasma levels, the faster the deterioration of renal function.

Compared with these findings, there is limited data available regarding plasma levels of ANP and BNP in the early stages of renal impairment prior to CKD development. Fox et al. identified that elevation of blood levels of BNP could predict future incidents of microalbuminuria through a population-based cohort study. According to Bansal et al, higher levels of an N-terminal peptide of the BNP precursor are associated with rapid decline of renal function and incident CKD. Meanwhile, few reports show an association between plasma levels of ANP and the future development of CKD.

In the present study, we found that age-related elevation of the plasma level of ANP preceded the development of CKD in local residents without overt cardiovascular diseases, while such a phenomenon was unclear for BNP compared with ANP.

### Mechanism of hyponatremia in community-acquired pneumonia: Does B-type natriuretic peptide play a causative role [^114ycdwC]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a well-known sequela of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has a natriuretic effect and was found to be elevated in patients with CAP. We investigated whether BNP has a role in the pathophysiology of hyponatremia in pediatric CAP.

- **Methods**: Serum and urine electrolytes and osmolality, as well as NT-pro-BNP (N-BNP), were obtained in 49 hospitalized pediatric patients with CAP (29 with hyponatremia, 20 with normal sodium levels).

- **Results**: Urine sodium levels were lower in the hyponatremic group compared with the normonatremic group (24.3 meq/L vs. 66.7 meq/L, P = 0.006). No difference in N-BNP levels was found between groups (median 103.8 vs. 100.1; P = 0.06; interquartile range, 63.7–263.3 pg/mL vs. 47.4–146.4 pg/mL). N-BNP was not associated with serum or urinary sodium levels.

- **Conclusions**: These results indicate that BNP is unlikely to play a causative role in the mechanism of hyponatremia in CAP.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: Expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious but often overlooked electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema, and excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death due to osmotic demyelination. The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder.

In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the six years since the publication of that document, several notable developments have emerged, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients. Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary, and a panel of hyponatremia experts (including all of the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for optimal management of this disorder.

The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia, based on both consensus opinions of experts in hyponatremia and the most recent developments in the field.

### Skyclarys [^112UN6E9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described in greater detail in other labeling sections: Elevation of aminotransferases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]; elevation of BNP [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]; lipid abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 20% and greater than placebo) are elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), headache, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain.

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared with rates in clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

The safety of Skyclarys 150 mg once daily has been evaluated in 165 patients with Friedreich's ataxia, including 137 patients exposed for at least 48 weeks and 125 patients exposed for at least 96 weeks. The most common adverse reactions in Study 1 (≥ 20% and greater than placebo) were elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT), headache, nausea, abdominal pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and musculoskeletal pain. Table 3 shows the adverse reactions that occurred in 10% or more of patients treated with Skyclarys and greater than placebo.

- **Laboratory abnormalities**: In addition to elevated liver enzymes, additional laboratory abnormalities include the elevation of BNP.

### Hyponatremia and comparison of NT-pro-BNP concentrations in blood samples from jugular bulb and arterial sites after traumatic brain injury in adults: a pilot study [^11279ycJ]. Neurocritical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia after traumatic brain injury (TBI) may influence neurological function and treatment. A causal relationship between elevated serum concentrations of Type B natriuretic peptide (BNP) and hyponatremia has been implied after subarachnoid hemorrhage and other neurosurgical disorders, although the source of BNP has not been identified. We evaluated if hyponatremia and increased BNP occur after TBI and if BNP is produced or released by the brain within 24 hours after injury.

- **Results**: NT-proBNP was measured in concomitant jugular venous and arterial blood samples within 24 hours after TBI. NT-proBNP was elevated in both samples in six patients (24%). One patient (4%) showed an increased jugular NT-proBNP concentration above a normal arterial concentration, suggesting a brain source. In the other 24 patients, the difference between jugular and arterial NT-proBNP was not statistically significant. Hyponatremia (≤ 136 mEq/L) also occurred in six patients (24%), but only two (8%) had both increased arterial NT-proBNP and hyponatremia. In both, the urine sodium was slightly elevated above normal, but not statistically different from other patients. The difference in serum sodium between hypo- and normonatremic groups was significant, but mean NT-proBNP and jugular:arterial NT-proBNP differences were not.

- **Conclusions**: In this pilot study, BNP is elevated within 24 hours after TBI in some patients. However, it does not originate from the brain, and increased NT-proBNP concentrations are not consistently associated with hyponatremia or increased urinary sodium loss.

### Predictive value of perioperative NT-proBNP levels for acute kidney injury in patients with compromised renal function undergoing cardiac surgery: a case control study [^117CbZJk]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

In another study, Patel et al. demonstrated that higher preoperative brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels significantly predict the risk of AKI after cardiac surgery. The study suggested that incorporating BNP levels into preoperative evaluations could improve risk stratification and outcomes for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Fiorentino et al. demonstrated that while NT-proBNP alone may not significantly predict AKI recovery, its combination with other biomarkers like plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) improves predictive accuracy.

While existing research predominantly focuses on the relationship between preoperative levels of BNP and postoperative AKI, the dynamics of postoperative BNP elevations remain critically underexplored. In addition, patients with impaired kidney function tend to have elevated preoperative BNP. Therefore, in this specific population, it is difficult to draw effective conclusions only by measuring BNP before surgery. An increase in BNP levels following cardiac surgery may reflect augmented cardiac volume stress, which could indirectly impact renal function and promote the onset of AKI. Furthermore, monitoring perioperative BNP elevation could offer a novel approach for early identification of patients at elevated risk, enabling timely interventions aimed at mitigating the incidence and severity of AKI. In view of the stability of the prediction effect of NT-proBNP on cardiac function, investigating the association between perioperative elevations in NT-proBNP and the development of AKI holds significant promise.

### Cancer patients with markedly elevated B-type natriuretic peptide may not have volume overload [^1117Q6Aw]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are established as a marker for volume overload and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in patients with predominately cardiac diseases. Little is known about markedly elevated BNP values in patients with multiple comorbidities.

A total of 99 patients, admitted to M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, were identified as having a BNP value > 1000 pg/mL during the year 2003. Clinical characteristics, including the presence of volume overload and sepsis, as well as echocardiographic parameters were measured. The principal outcome was defined as 30-day mortality.

The median BNP (pg/mL) of the group was 2270 (range, 1010–5000), and there was no association between the elevation of the BNP level and the presence of volume overload or LV dysfunction. The large majority of patients (n = 71, 72%) had no volume overload and normal or nearly normal LV function (n = 60, 61%). A majority were also identified as having sepsis (n = 52, 53%). There was no echocardiographic parameter that consistently correlated with BNP levels or volume overload. However, there was a highly significant association with sepsis and mortality in patients with markedly elevated BNP values, conferring a 2.71-fold increased risk of mortality.

In patients admitted with multiple comorbidities and markedly elevated BNP values, there is no significant association with clinical evidence of volume overload or LV dysfunction. Elevated BNP levels in patients with sepsis were significantly associated with mortality.

### Differential secretion of atrial and brain natriuretic peptide in critically ill patients [^116mJkaz]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are cardiac hormones with natriuretic, vasorelaxant, and aldosterone-inhibiting properties. We analyzed the plasma of 178 critically ill patients for ANP, BNP, aldosterone, and serum sodium concentration, as well as serum and urine osmolality and sodium filtration fraction. Mean plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP were increased in critically ill patients compared with healthy controls (ANP, 14.3 ± 5.8 pmol/L versus 8.8 ± 3.2 pmol/L, P < 0.05; BNP, 26.2 ± 10.7 pmol/L versus 4.6 ± 2.8 pmol/L, P < 0.0001).

- **Variation in BNP concentrations**: The relative increases in ANP concentrations were comparable in all diseases, while BNP concentrations showed wider variation. The largest BNP concentrations were observed in patients who underwent cardiac surgical procedures and in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- **Correlation of ANP**: ANP, but not BNP, was correlated with aldosterone levels (r = 0.4, P < 0.001), serum sodium (r = 0.42, P < 0.001), sodium filtration fraction (r = 0.3, P < 0.001), serum osmolality (r = 0.25, P < 0.01), urinary osmolality (r = -0.24, P < 0.01), and central venous pressure (r = 0.22, P < 0.01).

ANP and BNP concentrations were increased in critically ill patients; however, this did not correlate with the severity of illness or mortality. Our data support a regulatory role for ANP in the maintenance of water and electrolyte balance. The physiological role of BNP, by contrast, is less clear. ANP and BNP are not predictors for the severity of illness and mortality in critically ill patients.

### Hyponatremia treatment guidelines 2007: Expert panel recommendations [^116MdcXm]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Although hyponatremia is a common, usually mild, and relatively asymptomatic disorder of electrolytes, acute severe hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with concomitant disease. Additionally, overly rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can result in severe neurologic deficits and death. Optimal treatment strategies for such cases have not been established. An expert panel evaluated the potential contributions of aquaretic nonpeptide small-molecule arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR) antagonists to hyponatremia therapies. This review presents their conclusions, including the identification of appropriate treatment populations and possible future indications for aquaretic AVPR antagonists.

### Hyponatremia in patients with heart failure [^114gMQhZ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Mild hyponatremia is frequently encountered in patients hospitalized for worsening heart failure. Admission plasma sodium concentration appears to be an independent predictor of increased mortality after discharge and rehospitalization. Recent studies have suggested that correction of hyponatremia may be associated with improved survival. This hypothesis is currently being studied in large prospective randomized clinical trials.

### The role of BNP testing in heart failure [^113vrvF2]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are simple and objective measures of cardiac function. These measurements can be used to diagnose heart failure, including diastolic dysfunction, and their use has been shown to save money in the emergency department setting. The high negative predictive value of BNP tests is particularly helpful for ruling out heart failure. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, spironolactone, and diuretics reduces BNP levels, suggesting that BNP testing may have a role in monitoring patients with heart failure. However, patients with treated chronic stable heart failure may have levels in the normal range (i.e. BNP less than 100 pg per mL and N-terminal proBNP less than 125 pg per mL in patients younger than 75 years). Increases in BNP levels may be caused by intrinsic cardiac dysfunction or may be secondary to other causes such as pulmonary or renal diseases (e.g. chronic hypoxia). BNP tests are correlated with other measures of cardiac status, such as the New York Heart Association classification. BNP level is a strong predictor of risk of death and cardiovascular events in patients previously diagnosed with heart failure or cardiac dysfunction.

### Correlation of serum brain natriuretic peptide with hyponatremia and delayed ischemic neurological deficits after subarachnoid hemorrhage [^1176YZZ4]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), causes diuresis and natriuresis (cerebral salt wasting), and may exacerbate delayed ischemic neurological deficits. We examined the temporal relationship between serum BNP elevation, hyponatremia, and the onset of delayed ischemic neurological deficits and determined whether serum BNP levels correlated with the 2-week outcome after SAH.

- **Methods**: Serum BNP and sodium were measured prospectively every 12 hours for 14 days in 40 consecutive patients admitted with SAH. All patients remained euvolemic, underwent transcranial Doppler assessment every 48 hours, and underwent angiography at the onset of delayed neurological deficits. New-onset neurological deficits were attributed to vasospasm only in the absence of other causes and when supported by transcranial Doppler or cerebral angiography.

- **Results**: Sixteen patients (40%) experienced symptomatic cerebral vasospasm after SAH. A more than threefold increase in admission serum BNP was associated with the onset of hyponatremia (P < 0.05). Mean BNP levels were similar between vasospasm and nonvasospasm patients fewer than 3 days after SAH (126 ± 39 pg/ml versus 154 ± 40 pg/ml; P = 0.61) but were elevated in the vasospasm cohort 4 to 6 days after SAH (285 ± 67 pg/ml versus 116 ± 30 pg/ml; P < 0.01), 7 to 9 days after SAH (278 ± 72 pg/ml versus 166 ± 45 pg/ml; P < 0.01), and 9 to 12 days after SAH (297 ± 83 pg/ml versus 106 ± 30 pg/ml; P < 0.01). BNP level remained independently associated with vasospasm adjusting for F.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^115XadcF]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

A consistent association between hyponatremia and increased mortality is observed. Whether this is because multimorbid patients with serious underlying conditions are prone to develop hyponatremia or whether hyponatremia itself is an independent risk factor is not entirely clear and needs to be clarified in properly designed intervention studies.

A 2013 meta-analysis identified 81 studies comparing death rates in patients with or without hyponatremia, including a total of more than 850,000 patients (nearly 148,000 with hyponatremia). Hyponatremia was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall mortality (relative risk [RR] 2.60; 95% CI, 2.31–2.93; P < .0001), and this association was maintained after adjustment for age, sex, and diabetes mellitus. The association was relatively consistent when analyzed by individual underlying condition (heart failure, cirrhosis, pulmonary infection, myocardial infarction). There was an inverse relationship between serum sodium concentration and mortality — indicating higher risk with lower sodium concentrations. The mean difference in serum sodium between individuals who died compared to survivors was 4.8 mmol/L (pNa 130.1 vs. 134.9 mmol/L), so even hyponatremia in the mild range was associated with risk. A causal relationship was not able to be established, by the nature of this analysis. The consistent association irrespective of the underlying condition suggests that the underlying mechanism, if hyponatremia is indeed causal, is not disease-specific.

A follow-up meta-analysis by the same group in 2015 sought to clarify thi…

### Hyponatremia and worsening sodium levels are associated with long-term outcome in patients hospitalized for acute heart failure [^115cFWTx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia and clinical outcomes were assessed by comparing patients with normal serum sodium levels to those with on-admission hyponatremia. Patients with hyponatremia had higher in-hospital, 90-day, and 4-year mortality rates. Subjects with severe hyponatremia experienced the worst clinical outcomes, in contrast to those with mild hyponatremia or normonatremia.

Hyponatremia was a significant predictor of cardiovascular mortality, with a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.76; 1.39–2.23, as well as total mortality at 1.64; 1.40–1.93. It remained an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality (1.71; 1.35–2.16) and total mortality (1.57; 1.34–1.85) after adjusting for age and sex. Further adjustments for hematocrit, eGFR, LVEF, use of β-blockers, RAS blockade, spironolactone, and NT-proBNP level, sustained the association of hyponatremia with adverse clinical outcomes. Additionally, the severity of hyponatremia correlated with increased mortality risks in uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.

- **Figure 1**: Shows cumulative in-hospital, 90-day, and 4-year mortality in patients with and without on-admission hyponatremia.

### The roles of natriuretic peptides in pericardial fluid in patients with heart failure [^111PfcEQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

It is well known that the plasma concentrations of atrial and brain natriuretic peptides, as cardiac hormones, are elevated in heart failure.

- **Hypothesis**: Pericardial fluid in patients with various heart diseases contains both natriuretic peptides that are released into the pericardial fluid. However, it is unknown whether these peptides reflect cardiac function in patients with various heart diseases more than the peptides in blood.

- **Methods**: Plasma and pericardial fluid samples were obtained from 22 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for the measurement of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in plasma and pericardial fluid.

- **Results**: The ANP levels in pericardial fluid were higher in patients with impaired left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction ≥ 50%; 77.0 ± 4.9 versus 14.0 ± 50.9, p = 0.017), but not BNP. However, BNP levels in pericardial fluid were significantly higher in patients with left ventricle dilatation (left ventricular diastolic dimension ≥ 54 mm; 130.3 ± 68.9: 709.7 ± 324.7, p = 0.0168). Moreover, BNP levels in pericardial fluid were significantly higher in Grade III than Grade II and I (Grade I: echo-free space ≤ 10 mm).

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that BNP levels in pericardial fluid serve as more sensitive and accurate indicators of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and that increased BNP levels in pericardial fluid may have an important pathophysiologic role in heart failure as a cardiocyte-derived antifibrotic factor.

### Hyponatremia in a pediatric stroke patient: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion or cerebral salt wasting [^116pp149]. Critical Care Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the potential role of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the pathogenesis of cerebral salt wasting.

The design was a clinical case report set in a regional pediatric intensive care unit. The patient was a 3-year-old boy with a cerebral infarct secondary to traumatic carotid artery dissection, who developed hyponatremia associated with weight loss and excessive renal sodium excretion on the sixth day after hospitalization.

Measurements and main results included serial determinations of plasma concentrations of ANP, BNP, antidiuretic hormone, and renin, which were compared with concentrations measured in a group of eight healthy children undergoing elective surgical procedures. Compared with controls, ANP and BNP plasma concentrations on the eighth day after hospitalization were increased 1.9-fold and 7.7-fold, respectively. Thereafter, the course of ANP and BNP paralleled that of sodium and H2O excretion and remained elevated until the 14th (BNP) and 16th (ANP) days after hospitalization. Serum antidiuretic hormone and renin concentrations were within normal ranges during the entire observation period.

The conclusion drawn was that cerebral salt wasting is associated with elevated plasma concentrations of ANP and BNP. Natriuretic peptides may play a role in the pathogenesis of this syndrome.

### Clinical utility of natriuretic peptides in dialysis patients [^116Abcnc]. Seminars in Dialysis (2012). Low credibility.

Dialysis patients suffer a greatly heightened risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. These patients also experience an extremely high prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. Thus, there is a clinical need to identify circulating biomarkers that have diagnostic value for cardiovascular disease and prognostic importance to facilitate earlier and more aggressive intervention. The natriuretic peptides, namely brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), belong to a family of vasopeptide hormones released from the heart. They play a major role in blood pressure regulation and volume homeostasis through their direct effects on the kidney and systemic vasculature, representing a favorable aspect of neurohumoral activation.

Testing for BNP or NT-pro-BNP has recently emerged as an important diagnostic tool for heart failure and a useful biomarker for risk stratification in the general population. In dialysis patients, there has been interest in evaluating the potential of BNP and NT-pro-BNP as markers of volume status, as they are frequently elevated in these patients. However, the interpretation of their levels is confounded by impaired renal clearance and preexisting left ventricular abnormalities, which have limited their applicability as surrogate markers of volume status. In this article, we discuss the pathophysiology accounting for the elevation of natriuretic peptides in dialysis patients and review evidence that supports their clinical utility as a diagnostic and prognostic tool.

### Association of hyponatremia and elevated copeptin with death and need for transplantation in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure [^112BsMbf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Baseline values, serial measurements, or both of multiple biomarkers (copeptin, a peptide co-secreted with arginine vasopressin; hyponatremia; B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]; and cardiac troponin T [cTnT]) may improve risk stratification in outpatients with chronic heart failure. A cohort of 157 patients with class III or IV heart failure was prospectively evaluated every 3 months over 2 years with regard to biomarker levels and risk for death or cardiac transplantation. Copeptin ≥ 40 pmol/L (cohort fourth quartile value), hyponatremia (≤ 135 mEq/L), BNP > 3 times the upper range limitation of normal adjusted for age and gender, and cTnT ≥ 0.01 ng/ml were pre hoc determined cut points.

After multivariate time-dependent regression analysis, copeptin (hazard ratio [HR] 2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 4.3, p = 0.014) and BNP (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.5, p = 0.047), but not hyponatremia, were associated with the primary endpoint of death or cardiac transplantation. In contrast to univariate prediction of mortality and transplantation, hyponatremia (HR 1.74, 95% CI 0.9 to 3.4, p = 0.099) and cTnT ≥ 0.01 ng/ml (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.0 to 3.7, p = 0.064) were not predictive in multivariate models. Interaction models of copeptin with hyponatremia, adjusted for BNP and cTnT, improved the predictive capacity of serial measurements (HR 4.20, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.9, p = 0.004).

- **Conclusion**: Marked elevations of copeptin, particularly in serial measurements, are independent predictors of poor outcomes. The combination of elevated copeptin with hyponatremia, when adjusted for BNP and cT, enhances prediction accuracy.

Although hyponatremia during hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) has been reported to correlate with poor prognosis, few studies have examined the effect of progression of hyponatremia on cardiac prognosis in ADHF patients who were normonatremic at admission.

- **Methods and results**: Consecutive ADHF patients (n = 662) categorized as New York Heart Association Class III or IV were investigated retrospectively. Of these patients, 634 who survived to discharge were examined, and 531 were normonatremic (serum sodium concentration [Na] ≥ 135 and ≤ 145 mmol/L) at admission. The 531 patients were divided into two groups: the non-developed group, who remained normonatremic at discharge (n = 455), and the developed group, who had progressed to hyponatremia (Na < 135 mmol/L) at discharge (n = 76). The cardiac event-free rate after 12 months was significantly lower in the developed group than in the non-developed group (22% vs. 71%; P < .0001). Although their baseline levels of brain natriuretic peptide and left ventricular ejection fraction were similar before discharge, the patients in the developed group exhibited higher fractional excretion of sodium and received higher doses of diuretics than those in the non-developed group.

- **Conclusion**: Our data suggest that progression to hyponatremia during hospitalization is a robust predictor of poor cardiac prognosis in ADHF patients who were normonatremic at admission.

### Hyponatremia, natriuretic peptides, and outcomes in acutely decompensated heart failure: Results from the International Collaborative of NT-proBNP Study [^11463SLe]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a well-known predictor of mortality in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure. However, associations between hyponatremia and other prognostic variables, such as amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide, remain unclear.

- **Methods and results**: Six hundred twenty-eight patients presenting to the emergency department with acutely decompensated heart failure were studied, and all were hospitalized. Serum sodium (Na) concentration at presentation was examined as a function of mortality at 1 year, both alone and relative to other predictors of death. Hyponatremia (Na ≤ 135 mmol/L) was diagnosed in 24% (n = 149) of patients. Compared with those without hyponatremia, affected individuals were less likely to be male or have hypertension or coronary artery disease, but were more likely to have severe symptoms, be anemic, and have higher amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations (all P ≤ 0.05). When examined as a function of Na deciles (ranging from Na < 132 mmol/L to Na ≤ 142 mmol/L), a U-shaped association was found between Na level and 1-year mortality. In multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, hyponatremia was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality (hazards ratio = 1.72; 95% CI = 1.22 to 2.37; P = 0.001), as was an NT-proBNP concentration above the median value of 4690 pg/mL (hazards ratio = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.10 to 2.00; P = 0.009). Those with hyponatremia and elevated NT-proBNP were more likely to develop worsening renal function during their hospitalization and had the highest risk of adverse outcomes.

### Hyponatremia in the emergency department [^112GSy2Z]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium level of less than 135 mmol/L, is frequently encountered in patients presenting to the emergency department. Symptoms are often nonspecific and include a recent history of falls, weakness, and vertigo. Common causes of hyponatremia include diuretics, heart failure, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), making correct diagnosis challenging. Emergency treatment of hyponatremia should be guided by the presence of symptoms and focus on distinguishing between acute and chronic hyponatremia.

### Clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of hyponatraemia [^113PyTGH]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hyponatremia, particularly concerning the management of overly rapid correction, the ERA-EDTA/ESE/ESICM 2014 guidelines recommend considering the administration of an infusion of 10 mL/kg body weight of electrolyte-free water (such as glucose solutions) over 1 hour. This should be done in consultation with an expert and under strict monitoring of urine output and fluid balance.

### Analysis of brain natriuretic peptide serum levels in patients with symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma: A potential reliable biomarker [^1179MLLy]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Low credibility.

The study provides new evidence regarding the BNP serum level and secretion pattern in patients with symptomatic cSDH and creates a paradigm for future studies. The BNP plasma concentrations are frequently elevated; indeed, they increase significantly after surgery and then decrease to reach the initial level. Whether BNP serum levels can be used to predict long-term functional outcomes is a further endpoint of this ongoing prospective study.

### Transient hyponatremia during hospitalization for acute heart failure [^112kEuX4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

The objective was to study whether the temporal pattern of transient hyponatremia development in acute heart failure might provide insight into its pathophysiology and prognostic relevance.

- **Methods**: A post hoc analysis of the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness (ESCAPE) and Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (DOSE AHF) studies was performed (n = 716). Patients were stratified according to the temporal pattern of hyponatremia development: (1) no hyponatremia, (2) persistent hyponatremia, (3) decompensation hyponatremia disappearing with decongestive treatment, and (4) treatment-induced hyponatremia.

- **Results**: Transient decompensation versus no hyponatremia was associated with a significantly elevated blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (P < .001), plasma renin activity (P < .001), and plasma aldosterone levels (P < .001) at baseline. Disease severity characteristics of such patients were intermediate between no and persistent hyponatremia. In contrast, patients with treatment-induced versus no hyponatremia had similar baseline characteristics and comparable natriuretic peptide levels, and both groups had little neurohumoral activation at baseline. Diuretic efficacy, defined as net fluid balance (milliliters) per 40 mg furosemide-equivalent dose administered, was lower in patients with persistent or treatment-induced hyponatremia versus decompensation hyponatremia or no hyponatremia, respectively. The former versus latter groups also had more pronounced neurohumoral activation.

### Consequences of inadequate management of hyponatremia [^1126XXxi]. American Journal of Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Dilutional hyponatremia is a commonly observed disorder in hospitalized patients. It represents an excess of water in relation to prevailing sodium stores and is most often associated with a high plasma level of arginine vasopressin, including that found in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Hyponatremia may be classified as either acute or chronic depending on the rate of decline of serum sodium concentration and can lead to a wide range of deleterious changes involving almost all body systems. Serious complications of dilutional hyponatremia most frequently involve the central nervous system. In fact, acute severe hyponatremia is potentially life-threatening and must be treated promptly and aggressively.

Chronic hyponatremia often develops in patients with nonrenal diseases and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In patients hospitalized for congestive heart failure, hyponatremia is linked to a poor prognosis and increased length of hospital stay. Prompt recognition and optimal management of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients may reduce in-hospital mortality and symptom severity, allow for less intensive hospital care, decrease the duration of hospitalization and associated costs, and improve the treatment of underlying comorbid conditions and patients' quality of life.

The proper treatment of dilutional hyponatremia, especially when chronic, must avoid increasing serum sodium too rapidly, which can lead to permanent or fatal neurologic sequelae. The treatment of hyponatremia may be facilitated by emerging therapies and management strategies that prioritize patient safety and outcome.

### Biological variation for N-terminal pro- and B-type natriuretic peptides and implications for therapeutic monitoring of patients with congestive heart failure [^116E2jdD]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Given the limitations of low enrollments, this study suggests that a change of 130% for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and 90% for N-terminal (NT)-proBNP is necessary before results of serially collected data can be considered statistically different. This study also shows that there are important differences in the performance of BNP versus NT-proBNP in monitoring patients with congestive heart failure that need to be further explored.

### Brain natriuretic peptide and all-cause mortality in patients treated with haemodialysis [^1148cYqB]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) mortality, with a 10 to 20 times greater risk than the general population. One key contributor to this elevated risk is overhydration (OH), a common condition in patients with kidney failure treated with haemodialysis. Approximately 25% of these patients present with OH of 2.5 L or more before dialysis, and OH has been linked to reduced survival. Effective volume management, therefore, is a critical aspect of care for patients with kidney failure and those undergoing haemodialysis.

Traditionally, fluid status is assessed clinically, but in the last decade, the use of bioimpedance techniques for the assessment of fluid status has increased. However, given the high prevalence of OH and its significant impact on patient outcomes, there is a need for more accurate and reliable methods to identify and manage OH. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone produced by the cardiomyocytes in the heart in response to fluid overload. Elevated levels of BNP and NT-proBNP are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated an intraindividual correlation between BNP levels and OH in patients with kidney failure and those receiving haemodialysis treatment.

Considering the critical importance of volume management in patients with kidney failure and haemodialysis, understanding the role of biomarkers such as BNP in predicting fluid status and its relation to patient outcomes is essential. The aim of this exploratory pilot study was therefore to prospectively assess the relationship between these factors.

### Natriuretic peptides [^116ZZbyH]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Natriuretic peptides (NPs) are released from the heart in response to pressure and volume overload. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal-proBNP have become important diagnostic tools for assessing patients who present acutely with dyspnea. The NP level reflects a compilation of systolic and diastolic function as well as right ventricular and valvular function. Studies suggest that using NPs in the emergency department can reduce the consumption of hospital resources and lower costs by either eliminating the need for other, more expensive tests or establishing an alternative diagnosis that does not require a hospital stay. Caveats such as body mass index and renal function must be taken into account when analyzing NP levels.

Natriuretic peptide levels have important prognostic value in multiple clinical settings, including in patients with stable coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndromes. In patients with decompensated heart failure due to volume overload, a treatment-induced drop in wedge pressure is often accompanied by a rapid drop in NP levels. Knowing a patient's NP levels might thus assist with hemodynamic assessment and subsequent treatment titration. Monitoring NP levels in the outpatient setting might also improve patient care and outcomes.

### Hyponatremia: pathophysiology, classification, manifestations and management [^115vy5DK]. International Urology and Nephrology (2014). High credibility.

Hyponatremia can be associated with a wide range of symptoms and conditions. Some of the manifestations include:

- **Neurological manifestations**: fatigue, restlessness, altered mental status, somnolence, seizure, confusion, headache, coma, irritability, gait disturbance, dysarthria

- **Muscular manifestations**: muscle weakness, muscle spasms, muscle cramps, hyporeflexia

- **Cardiovascular manifestations**: tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension

- **Gastrointestinal manifestations**: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

- **Respiratory manifestations**: pulmonary edema, crackles

- **Metabolic conditions**: hyperproteinemia, metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis

- **Other manifestations**: sweating, decreased skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, increased serum urea, increased serum uric acid, increased serum creatinine

Hyponatremia may also be linked to various conditions and contributing factors:

- **Medical conditions**: diuretics, subarachnoid hemorrhage, SIADH, Addison's disease, adrenal insufficiency, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, cerebral edema, cerebral salt wasting

- **Lifestyle and dietary factors**: increased water intake, tea and toast diet, malnutrition, heavy beer drinking, strenuous exercise

- **Laboratory and diagnostic indicators**: increased urine sodium, decreased serum sodium, decreased urine sodium, increased blood glucose, increased serum creatinine

- **Demographic factors**: elderly age, burns, ascites, peripheral edema

This range of symptoms and associations highlights the complexity and varied presentation of hyponatremia in clinical settings.

### Analysis of brain natriuretic peptide serum levels in patients with symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma: A potential reliable biomarker [^1124NDfE]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Low credibility.

The BNP plays an important role in the regulation of the water-electrolyte balance, and its hypersecretion was demonstrated to be significantly associated with the occurrence of aSAH, severe TBI, and severe ICH, but not with acute ischemic stroke. In our cohort, we found no association between BNP serum levels and hyponatremia.

Altogether, the increase in the BNP serum levels in the early post-operative period is probably because of cardiac stress induced by surgery through local manipulation of the hematoma. In this way, elevated pre-operative BNP concentrations might be the effect of cardiac stress from the increasing brain compression by the hematoma — i.e. elevation of the ICP.

Recently, a brain-heart crosstalk was described in patients with TBI who frequently experienced paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity after trauma, also known as "autonomic dysfunction", leading to cardiac wall abnormalities and dysfunction. Other authors demonstrated that elevated ICP in these patients caused increased sympathetic activity and catecholamine hypersecretion.

Although there is still a knowledge gap regarding the mechanisms of autonomic dysfunction, rat models already revealed that post-traumatic injury of the hypothalamus, increase in the activity of the hypothalamic-sympathetic-adrenal-medullary axis, and circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines play a role in autonomic and cardiovascular dysfunction. Whether a dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system is responsible for the increase in pre-operative BNP concentrations in cSDH should be further investigated.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^114dm6hA]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

While there is some preclinical evidence that sex steroids may modulate the secretion of AVP, there is no consistent effect of sex on hyponatremia rates, with some studies reporting a slight male predominance, some a female predominance, and others no effect.

In population-based studies, SIAD is the most common attributed cause of hyponatremia, accounting for 35% to 40% of cases. However, most retrospective studies to determine the etiology of hyponatremia are limited by an incomplete diagnostic workup, with one multicenter registry finding that less than 50% of 3087 patients with hyponatremia had all appropriate investigations performed. A prospective study of 121 consecutive inpatients with pNa less than 130 mmol/L at a single hospital in Germany, who were assessed by a senior endocrinologist according to a rigorous diagnostic protocol, determined that 35% had SIAD, 32% hypovolemia, 20% hypervolemia (heart failure, cirrhosis, angioedema), 7% thiazide-induced hyponatremia, 4% primary polydipsia, and 2% adrenal insufficiency. Another prospective study at a tertiary neurosurgical referral center in Ireland of 1323 patients admitted with pNa less than or equal to 130 mmol/L initially classified 573 (43.4%) of these patients as having SIAD, though 22 of these (3.8%) were subsequently reclassified to adrenal insufficiency after completing further investigation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of hyponatremia: A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements [^111PapxU]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements provide recommendations to support evidence-based practice by suggesting the most appropriate diagnostic tests and treatments. Over the years, multiple organizations have developed recommendations to assist clinicians in the management of hyponatremia. For these recommendations to be reliable, they must be based on a systematic review of the evidence and have a transparent, multidisciplinary development process. Inconsistencies between recommendations may arise from failing to meet development standards, which can contribute to unwarranted variability in management. In this study, we aimed to explore the scope, content, and consistency of the existing guidance documents on the diagnosis and management of hyponatremia in adults and children.

### Nocdurna [^1171yPCB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Nocdurna can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Nocdurna is contraindicated in patients at an increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, and in those using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Before starting or resuming Nocdurna, ensure serum sodium concentration is normal. Measure serum sodium within seven days and approximately one month after initiating therapy, and periodically during treatment. More frequent monitoring of serum sodium is necessary for patients 65 years of age and older, and for those at increased risk of hyponatremia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

If hyponatremia occurs, Nocdurna may need to be temporarily or permanently discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Pituitary cyst presenting with hyponatremia and increased secretion of brain natriuretic peptide. Case report [^115xLUum]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

In most cases of pituitary cysts, there are no clinical symptoms, and the lesions are found incidentally. The authors report the case of a 60-year-old man with a pituitary cyst causing visual disturbance and hyponatremia. The patient presented with appetite loss and general fatigue. On admission, blood workup showed severe hyponatremia (112 mEq/L), and bitemporal hemianopsia was observed on neurological examination. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intra- and suprasellar region cystic mass extending to the frontal base and hypothalamic area. The serum level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was elevated (92 pg/ml) with polyuria and excessive Na excretion. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed to drain the cyst. The cyst wall was partially excised, and the cystic fluid was aspirated. The secretion of BNP normalized postoperatively, and the hyponatremia and visual symptoms resolved. Histological examination, including an electron microscopy study, confirmed the diagnosis of a simple cyst. This appears to be the first reported case of a pituitary simple cyst associated with hyponatremia and an elevated BNP level.

### Desmopressin acetate [^113Rth2W]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Hyponatremia**: Desmopressin acetate injection can cause hyponatremia. Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, or death [see Boxed Warning]. Desmopressin acetate injection is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia (or a history of hyponatremia), excessive fluid intake (e.g. polydipsia), those using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids, and patients with known or suspected SIADH or illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7)]. Avoid concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia.

	- Prior to starting or resuming desmopressin acetate injection, ensure that the serum sodium concentration is normal. Limit fluid intake to a minimum from 1 hour before administration until 8 hours after administration. The use of desmopressin acetate injection without concomitant reduction of fluid intake may lead to fluid retention and hyponatremia. Monitor the serum sodium concentration within 1 week and approximately 1 month of initiating desmopressin acetate injection, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Base the frequency of serum sodium monitoring on the patient's risk of hyponatremia.

	- Patients with conditions associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalance (i.e. cystic fibrosis, heart failure, and renal disorders), geriatric and pediatric patients, and patients receiving concomitant treatments that also cause hyponatremia (i.e. tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) require careful monitoring.

### Desmopressin acetate [^116pW7eT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Excessive fluid intake when urine output is limited by the antidiuretic effect of desmopressin may lead to water intoxication with hyponatremia. Cases of hyponatremia have been reported from postmarketing experience in patients treated with desmopressin acetate. Unless properly diagnosed and treated, hyponatremia can be fatal.

All patients receiving desmopressin nasal spray should be observed for the following signs or symptoms associated with hyponatremia:

- **Common symptoms**: headache, nausea/vomiting, decreased serum sodium, weight gain, restlessness, fatigue, lethargy, disorientation
- **Neurological symptoms**: depressed reflexes, irritability, abnormal mental status such as hallucinations, decreased consciousness, confusion
- **Muscular symptoms**: muscle weakness, muscle spasms or cramps
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: loss of appetite

Severe symptoms due to an extreme decrease in serum sodium and plasma osmolality may include one or a combination of the following: seizure, coma, and/or respiratory arrest.

To decrease the risk of water intoxication with hyponatremia, fluid restriction is recommended. Careful fluid intake restriction is particularly important in pediatric and geriatric patients because these patients are at greater risk of developing hyponatremia. More frequent monitoring of serum sodium levels is recommended in the following patients:

- **Patients with fluid and electrolyte imbalance conditions**: cystic fibrosis, heart failure, renal disorders
- **Patients with specific behaviors**: habitual or psychogenic polydipsia
- **Drug interactions**: those taking concomitant drugs that may cause hyponatremia

### Hyponatremia in heart failure: revisiting pathophysiology and therapeutic strategies [^112UGAbo]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is frequently encountered in patients with heart failure (HF), and its association with adverse outcomes is well-established in this population. While hyponatremia is an independent marker for the severity of HF, it is not certain whether it has a causal impact on the progression of the disease.

There are no universally accepted consensus guidelines regarding therapeutic strategies for HF-associated hyponatremia and volume overload; societal guidelines do not address management of this complication. Whereas thiazide diuretics are known to induce or worsen hyponatremia in this setting through a number of mechanisms, loop diuretics can be considered a readily available first-line pharmacologic therapy. Consistent with the pathophysiology of the disease and mechanisms of action of loop diuretics, available clinical evidence supports such an approach provided that patients can be closely monitored.

Use of vasopressin receptor antagonists is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this setting, and the efficacy of these agents has so far been shown in a number of clinical studies. These agents can be reserved for patients with HF in whom initial appropriate loop diuretic therapy fails to improve serum sodium levels.
