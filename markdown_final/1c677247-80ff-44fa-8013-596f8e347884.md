## Question

Examining telehealth from an ethical perspective reveals an intricate relationship between technological advancements and core ethical principles, specifically, justice, autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Telehealth implementation is both a solution and a challenge.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how telehealth implementation can be both a solution to and a challenge for upholding the four core ethical principles of medical ethics — justice, autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying and confirming the ethical framework and its applicability to telehealth. Then, I should examine how telehealth advances each principle in practice. Next, I will analyze the ways telehealth can undermine each principle. After that, I need to consider the tensions and interrelationships between benefits and risks. Then, I should identify mediating factors that determine directionality. Finally, I will synthesize an implementation-sensitive conclusion and offer practical, evidence-informed guardrails to navigate these trade-offs.

> Let me first confirm the ethical framework and its relevance in virtual care, because if I get the grounding wrong, downstream conclusions will wobble; the AMA CEJA guidance and dementia telehealth best-practice statements explicitly extend autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice to remote encounters, emphasizing that ethical and clinical standards should mirror in-person care and that consent, privacy, and emergency protocols require special attention in telehealth settings [^1149RdJH] [^111Wg8ro] [^1157LH2P].

> Now, I will examine telehealth as an ethical solution, starting with autonomy, but wait, let me verify that patient choice is genuinely expanded; qualitative evidence from FQHC settings shows patients valued the option to choose home-based video visits, particularly when care continuity with known clinicians was maintained, and high-risk patient interviews describe how individuals weigh clinical utility, costs, effort, and safety when selecting modality, with SGIM explicitly supporting audio-only to broaden access when video is not feasible, all of which enhance self-determination when implemented intentionally [^116XZxn3] [^111DUWsy] [^111q22pJ].

> Next, I should review beneficence, and I need to ensure I am not over-claiming; during COVID-19, telehealth enabled continuity of care across multiple domains, with reported contributions to ongoing management and mitigation of service interruptions, and disease-specific studies such as maternal-fetal medicine video visits and COPD telemedicine follow-up report high satisfaction and improved adherence or treatment compliance, suggesting that well-designed programs can produce patient-centered benefits and positive clinical effects in defined contexts [^112mvUw9] [^112hjtk5] [^113tb3Wx].

> Turning to non-maleficence, I will now examine harm reduction; during infectious surges, remote visits reduced exposure risks, and dementia care guidance details remote safety practices like identity verification and emergency protocols, indicating that when clinicians anticipate remote-specific risks, telehealth can plausibly prevent harm associated with contagion and unsafe travel while maintaining standards of care [^112mvUw9] [^111Wg8ro].

> For justice, hold on, I should verify whether telehealth truly widens equitable access; equity analyses argue that telehealth can reduce geographic and transportation barriers, and policy shifts that expanded connectivity and payment during the pandemic illustrate how structural levers can promote fairness, but I need to keep in mind that achieving equity requires more than access — it requires addressing the digital determinants of health as well [^112posC3] [^111q22pJ] [^116Mp8Pu].

> Now I will analyze telehealth as an ethical challenge, starting with autonomy constraints; patients with limited devices, connectivity, or digital literacy experience constrained modality choice, two-factor identity verification requirements can inadvertently exclude those lacking the requisite technology, and informed consent processes become more complex when conducted remotely, all of which can erode genuine self-determination if not proactively mitigated [^111DUWsy] [^116C3A67] [^111Wg8ro].

> For beneficence, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that virtual equals better; certain evaluations have inherent physical exam limitations, large randomized evidence of intraoperative telemedicine decision support did not show superiority on key outcomes, and teledermatology ethics discussions highlight diagnostic uncertainties and follow-up pitfalls, which together caution that beneficence is contextual and not guaranteed by modality alone [^1155BVaL] [^114G3TGi] [^1156CUoy].

> Regarding non-maleficence, hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check the privacy and security landscape; systematic reviews identify privacy, security, and data governance as salient risks, adapting consumer platforms for clinical use can cross ethical and legal lines without appropriate safeguards, and population-level standardization can yield unintended harms if metrics displace individualized care, underscoring the potential for avoidable harm in poorly governed implementations [^112mvUw9] [^112QBKa5] [^114FRYqH] [^1152xDtA].

> Justice is particularly vulnerable, and I need to ensure I capture the breadth of disparities; evidence documents lower telehealth uptake among racial and linguistic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, the digital divide limits access for older adults and those lacking broadband or devices, age-related willingness drops after 75, clinical trials sometimes exclude those unable to use devices, and cross-national surveys show persistent inequities, all of which demonstrate how telehealth can inadvertently exacerbate disparities if equity is not engineered into deployment [^111mPD1r] [^112posC3] [^116Mp8Pu] [^117U3SkH] [^113tb3Wx].

> Let me consider the interrelationships and trade-offs, because benefits and risks are often two sides of the same design choice; the geographic access gains of virtual care can be offset by infrastructure gaps and digital literacy barriers, convenience and flexibility can improve satisfaction yet potentially weaken the relational depth established by face-to-face encounters, rapid pandemic scale-up expanded reach but sometimes compromised platform security, and innovation cycles in AI and digital tools risk privileging already advantaged populations unless corrected [^114WtXFF] [^116XZxn3] [^1139dh5E] [^112mvUw9] [^112QBKa5] [^1152xDtA].

> I should now articulate the core tensions explicitly and verify supporting guidance; there is an equity-quality tension because maintaining in-person-equivalent standards may limit reach, an access-privacy tension when consumer platforms expand convenience at the expense of confidentiality, an innovation-justice tension when rapid deployment benefits the well-resourced first, and an autonomy-paternalism tension when clinician discomfort or workflow constraints limit offering preferred modalities despite patient interest [^1114JTtA] [^1155BVaL] [^112QBKa5] [^114up6rA] [^1152xDtA] [^111mPD1r] [^116VACED] [^116XZxn3].

> Next, I should review mediating factors that determine whether telehealth advances or undermines ethics; co-creative design anchored in what matters to users can align autonomy and justice, stable payment and licensure policies are prerequisites for sustainable equitable access, strong patient-clinician relationships buffer quality concerns, hybrid models preserve choice and safety, and equity-focused investment and measurement are necessary to reduce disparities [^1179huc5] [^111q22pJ] [^1139dh5E] [^116XZxn3] [^117U3SkH] [^111mPD1r].

> Let me synthesize and I should confirm I am not overgeneralizing; telehealth is ethically neutral as a modality and derives its moral valence from implementation choices: it functions as a solution when designed for equity, supported by training, governed by robust policy, embedded in relationship-centered hybrid care, and evaluated transparently, yet it becomes a challenge when deployed reactively without addressing the digital divide, privacy and security, clinical appropriateness, and equitable offering, and wait, I notice I initially left a citation incomplete — let me correct it by explicitly citing the digital divide and equity frameworks to support this conclusion [^111mPD1r] [^111q22pJ] [^116Mp8Pu] [^112posC3].

> Finally, I need to ensure actionable guardrails are clear; in practice this means offering modality choice with accessible audio-only options, matching clinical scenarios to modality while holding virtual standards to in-person thresholds, hardening privacy and security controls rather than relying on consumer tools, investing in digital infrastructure and literacy, and measuring outcomes and equity over time to iteratively improve, with SGIM, AASM, telehealth outcomes work, and pandemic telehealth syntheses providing concrete starting points for policy and practice [^111q22pJ] [^1114JTtA] [^111dsPjC] [^112mvUw9].

Telehealth can **expand access** [^111q22pJ] and **reduce costs** [^1177uw7M], but it also risks **exacerbating disparities** [^116Mp8Pu] and compromising care quality if not carefully managed [^111q22pJ]. Ethically, telehealth must be implemented with **equitable access** [^112posC3], **informed consent** [^1149RdJH] [^112fV2sY], and **robust privacy** protections [^112mvUw9], while maintaining clinical standards and patient-centered care [^111q22pJ].

---

## Justice: equity and access

Telehealth can **improve access** [^111q22pJ] for rural and underserved populations [^1153XN9p] but also risks **widening disparities** [^116Mp8Pu] due to the digital divide [^112posC3] — limited internet access, digital literacy [^116Mp8Pu], and socioeconomic barriers [^112mvUw9]. To uphold justice, implementation should ensure **equitable access** [^111mPD1r] by addressing digital literacy [^116Mp8Pu], infrastructure [^112posC3], and socioeconomic barriers [^112mvUw9].

---

## Autonomy: informed consent and patient choice

Telehealth **supports autonomy** [^1149RdJH] by enabling patient-centered care and shared decision-making [^112fV2sY], but it also poses challenges to ensuring informed consent [^111Wg8ro] and patient understanding of its limitations [^1149RdJH]. Clear communication, transparency [^111Wg8ro], and respect for **patient preferences** [^1139dh5E] are essential to uphold autonomy [^1149RdJH].

---

## Beneficence: promoting patient well-being

Telehealth can **enhance patient well-being** by improving access [^111q22pJ], reducing costs [^1177uw7M], and enabling timely care [^116M3bE9], but it also requires careful attention to clinical appropriateness [^111q22pJ] and patient safety [^112mvUw9]. It should be used when it **clearly benefits patients** [^111q22pJ], with attention to clinical appropriateness [^1112y6nR] [^1146RH4N] and patient safety [^1149RdJH] [^112mvUw9].

---

## Non-maleficence: preventing harm

Telehealth **poses risks** related to misdiagnosis [^116VACED], data security breaches [^112mvUw9], and compromised care quality, particularly for vulnerable populations [^111mPD1r] [^112posC3]. Robust safeguards — secure platforms [^112mvUw9], clear clinical protocols [^111q22pJ], and ongoing monitoring [^111dsPjC] — are essential to **prevent harm**.

---

## Balancing ethical principles

Telehealth requires **careful balancing** of ethical principles [^1149RdJH], with attention to context, patient preferences [^111Wg8ro], and clinical appropriateness [^116VACED]. Ethical frameworks and guidelines can help navigate complexity and ensure **responsible telehealth implementation** [^111q22pJ] [^1177uw7M].

---

## Practical recommendations

- **Equitable access**: Address digital literacy [^116Mp8Pu], infrastructure [^112posC3], and socioeconomic barriers [^111q22pJ].
- **Informed consent**: Ensure clear communication and transparency [^112fV2sY] [^1149RdJH] [^111Wg8ro].
- **Clinical appropriateness**: Use telehealth [^112mvUw9] when it clearly benefits patients [^1112y6nR] [^1146RH4N] [^1149RdJH].
- **Robust safeguards**: Implement secure platforms [^112mvUw9] and clear protocols [^112QBKa5] [^112posC3].

---

Telehealth offers **significant benefits** but also presents **ethical challenges**. By addressing equity, autonomy, beneficence, and non-maleficence, telehealth can be implemented **responsibly and effectively**.

### Ethical practice in telehealth and telemedicine [^1149RdJH]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This article summarizes the report of the American Medical Association's (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) on ethical practice in telehealth and telemedicine. CEJA is responsible for maintaining and updating the AMA Code of Medical Ethics (Code) through its reports and recommendations. These reports are developed through an iterative process of deliberation with input from multiple stakeholders. Report recommendations, once adopted by the AMA House of Delegates, become the ethics policy of the AMA and are issued as Opinions in the Code.

To provide enduring guidance for the medical profession as a whole, CEJA strives to articulate expectations for conduct that are as independent of specific technologies or models of practice as possible. The present report, developed at the request of the House of Delegates, provides broad guidance for ethical conduct relating to key issues in telehealth/telemedicine. The report and recommendations were debated at meetings of the House in June and November 2015. Recommendations were adopted in June 2016 and published as Opinion E-1.2.12, Ethical Practice in Telemedicine, in November 2016.

### Could telehealth improve equity during the COVID-19 pandemic [^112posC3]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many physicians and health care systems have shifted to providing care via telehealth as much as possible. Although necessary to control the spread of the virus and preserve personal protective equipment, this shift highlights existing disparities in access and care.

Patients without the skills and tools to access telehealth services may increase their risk of exposure by seeking care in person or may delay care entirely. We know that patients need internet access, devices capable of visual communication, and the skills to use these devices to experience the full benefits of telehealth. Yet, we also know that disparities are present in each of these areas.

Currently, federal programs have given physicians greater flexibility in providing care remotely and have expanded internet access for vulnerable patients to promote telehealth services. However, these changes are temporary, and it is uncertain which will remain when the pandemic is over. Family medicine physicians have an important role to play in identifying and addressing these disparities and facilitating more equitable care moving forward.

### Application of telemedicine video visits in a maternal-fetal medicine practice at the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic [^112hjtk5]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2021). Low credibility.

Telemedicine in obstetrics has mostly been described in rural areas that have limited access to subspecialties. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health systems rapidly expanded telemedicine services for urgent and nonurgent healthcare delivery, even in urban settings. The New York University health system implemented a prompt systemwide expansion of video-enabled telemedicine visits, increasing telemedicine to over 8,000 visits daily within six weeks of the beginning of the pandemic. There are limited studies that explore patient and provider satisfaction with telemedicine visits in obstetrical patients during the COVID-19 epidemic, particularly in the United States.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to evaluate both the patients' and the providers' satisfaction with the administration of maternal-fetal medicine services through telemedicine and to identify the factors that drive the patients' desire for future obstetrical telemedicine services.

- **Study design**: A cross-sectional survey was administered to patients who completed a telemedicine video visit with the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at the New York University Langone Hospital-Long Island from March 19, 2020, to May 26, 2020. A 10-question survey assessing the patients' digital experience and desire for future use was either administered by telephone or self-administered by the patients via a link after obtaining verbal consent. The survey responses were scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). We analyzed the demographics and survey responses of the patients who agreed versus those who answered neutrally.

### Remote cognitive and behavioral assessment: Report of the Alzheimer Society of Canada Task Force on dementia care best practices for COVID-19 [^111Wg8ro]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Low credibility.

The same clinical and ethical standards that apply to in-person encounters also apply to the remote environment. The biomedical ethics principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice must also guide remote care delivery. Several frameworks are available to guide the implementation of these principles in technology development and implementation.

As one example, "ethical adoption", defined as the "deep integration of ethical principles into the design, development, deployment, ongoing usage, and management of technology", offers practical recommendations for technology developers and researchers. To meet the highest standards of ethical care delivery, the interests and welfare of the patient should come first (i.e. fidelity), and the clinician should be transparent in disclosing the rationale for and limitations of remote care delivery.

Until guidelines for implied consent with remote health care are developed, verbal informed consent detailing the limits of confidentiality, and two-factor verification of the patient's identity (i.e. name and date of birth), should precede a visit. Practitioners should be aware of methods for handling imminent risk to self or others when providing remote health care. Finally, it is recommended to minimize obtrusiveness by offering patients an alternative modality of care, such as telephone instead of videoconference.

Telemedicine has the potential benefits of enabling access to specialists among patients with reduced mobility and/or geographical constraints and improved patient convenience.

### Spirit 2025 explanation and elaboration: Updated guideline for protocols of randomised trials [^115XURKP]. BMJ (2025). High credibility.

The ethical and scientific justification for a trial depends on the uncertainty of the benefit or harm of the intervention to be tested. This uncertainty, in turn, relies on what is known on the topic before the trial commences. The background section of a protocol should summarize the relevance of the research question, justify the need for the trial in the context of available evidence, and present any preliminary data on the potential effects of the interventions (benefits and harms), thus providing a rationale for the trial.

This information is particularly important to trial participants as it provides motivation for contributing to the trial. It is also relevant to funders, research ethics committees or institutional review boards, and other groups who evaluate the scientific and ethical basis for trial approval. The background should also present a plausible explanation of how the intervention might work. Understanding the rationale or theory underpinning an intervention helps readers to comprehend which aspects or components are likely to be essential to its efficacy or harm, and which are likely to be incidental.

Reviews of two samples of 108 and 292 trial protocols from 2016 found that 44% and 26%, respectively, justified the research question.

The World Medical Association's Declaration of Helsinki states that biomedical research involving people should be based on thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, as it is unethical to expose humans unnecessarily to the risks of research.

### Addressing COVID-19 challenges in a randomised controlled trial on exercise interventions in a high-risk population [^112AUX8i]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). High credibility.

The literature on telemedicine issues was vast, and a great variety of different approaches and technologies had been described. Prior studies showed that live, synchronous, online interventions were feasible, effective, safe, and well received by participants and therapists, enabling human encounters. Still, experiences in chronically ill elderly individuals with a high risk of falling were limited. Guidance, recommendations, and discussions referred mostly to more general topics regarding ethical and legal issues, privacy, security, data safety, reimbursement, liability, cultural sensitivity, competences, and the attitudes and skills of providers. They also covered communication with and support of the users, confidence, satisfaction, adherence, ensuring continuity of care, and specific aspects of care and assessments. Some sources also provide practical recommendations and quick tips for conducting telemedicine services and for developing telemedicine programs.

The integrative medicine online task force dealt very practically with procedural, technical, and ethical issues. Interviews with experts centered on specific challenges and barriers, alongside potential solutions and steps for the ENTAIER trial. They delivered practical recommendations on all phases of the trial, as well as the interventions and organization, reflecting the specific expertise of the respective interviewee. The experts also commented on the potential solutions found in the literature, prior interviews, and our whole process of risk adjustment.

The different sources complemented each other, as their details intertwined to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced in the trial.

### Remote assessment in sport and exercise medicine (SEM): A narrative review and teleSEM solutions for and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic [^1157LH2P]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

eHealth services provide a continuum of technologies that offer new ways to deliver care. Although fundamental ethical responsibilities apply in every kind of care, the continuum of possible patient–physician/clinician eHealth interactions results in different levels of healthcare provider accountability. This also applies to eSEM and teleSEM.

Healthcare practitioners using eHealth should be guided by core ethical principles:

- **Core ethical principles**: For healthcare practitioners providing eHealth services, including e-sport-and-exercise-medicine and tele-sport-and-exercise-medicine.

Medical ethics play an important role in adhering to these principles. The five key components of an eHealth medical ethics code include mutual respect, promoting open communication and consent, informed care and shared treatment decisions, access to health information, and physician autonomy and responsibilities.

### Survey protocol for exploring video and phone use in Aotearoa New Zealand general practice: Considerations for future telehealth [^112rGPKa]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2021). Low credibility.

Telehealth became the most practical option for general practice consultations in Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) as a result of the national lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. What is the consumer experience of access to telehealth, and how do consumers and providers perceive this mode of care delivery going forward?

- **Methods and analysis**: A national survey of general practice consumers and providers who used telehealth services since the national lockdowns in 2020 will be distributed. It is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology framework of technology acceptance and the access to care framework. The data will be statistically analysed to create a foundation for in-depth research on the use of telehealth services in NZ general practice services, with a specific focus on consumer experiences and health outcomes.

- **Ethics and dissemination**: Ethics approval was granted by the Auckland Health Research Ethics Committee on 13/11/2020, reference AH2539. The survey will be disseminated online.

### Ethical considerations for telemedical delivery of fertility care: An Ethics Committee opinion [^115CHKmk]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Low credibility.

Telemedicine has the potential to increase access to and decrease the cost of care. However, it also alters the nature of the physician-patient relationship and the interaction of patients with the healthcare system, which may limit access to care in some circumstances. Regardless of the modality of care delivery, the basic tenets of medical ethics and the obligations of physicians to their patients still hold.

### Methods to increase response to postal and electronic questionnaires [^114KJjDc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Three trials, encompassing 3,372 participants, evaluated the effect of the questionnaire being printed on high-quality or thicker paper compared to standard quality or thin paper. There was no evidence of an effect on response when using high-quality or thicker paper (OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.68 to 1.02). Five trials, with 9,383 participants, assessed the effect of using a single‐sided questionnaire compared to a double‐sided questionnaire. The odds of response increased by a tenth when a single‐sided questionnaire was used (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25). One trial involving 650 participants evaluated the effect on response of using a larger font compared to a smaller font. There was no evidence of an effect on response when using larger fonts (OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.82).

A single trial, including 1,000 participants, compared the presence of a study logo on several items in the mailing package to its presence in the questionnaire only. There was no evidence of an effect on response when using the study logo on several items in the mailing package (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.18). Additionally, five trials with 3,956 participants evaluated the effect of the presence of a picture in the questionnaire. There was no evidence of an effect on response when using a picture (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.51). One trial involving 280 participants assessed the effect on response of including a cartoon in the questionnaire. There was no evidence of an effect on response when including a cartoon (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.62).

### Defining and improving outcomes measurement for virtual care: Report from the VHA State-of-the-Art Conference on Virtual Care [^111dsPjC]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Virtual care, which includes synchronous and asynchronous telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and the collection and interpretation of patient-generated health data (PGHD), was available long before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, prior to COVID-19, virtual care was primarily utilized within specific populations, such as those living in rural areas with limited access to local specialty care. Virtual care use dramatically increased during the pandemic, spurred by regulatory and reimbursement changes that were rapidly adopted to allow more care to be provided from a distance. While this shift towards virtual care offers potential benefits, such as greater access to care for patients, much remains to be learned regarding its impact on outcomes of care, health equity, and the future of healthcare delivery more broadly.

The rise in virtual care has led to a growing body of research reporting positive outcomes, including high patient satisfaction, reduced travel costs, and the successful management of chronic conditions from a distance. However, there is still much to be learned regarding the specific clinical scenarios in which virtual care is most effective. Virtual care outcomes have been inconsistently defined and reported in the literature, making it challenging to assess the generalizability of specific studies or interventions. As such, it is imperative that virtual care outcomes are appropriately measured and reported across populations, including patients with multiple chronic conditions and complex social needs.

### Initial patient satisfaction with telemedicine in neurosurgery outpatient clinic during the early COVID-19 pandemic [^114dWWsr]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the medical community has been heavily influenced by the necessity for telemedicine, or "telehealth", appointments. With limited prior exposure, the many challenges that accompany telehealth visits have affected how physicians conduct daily tasks and how patients perceive healthcare experiences. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine was new to most neurosurgical patients. This study seeks to evaluate the overall neurosurgical patient experience with telemedicine.

- **Objective**: To assess overall neurosurgical patient satisfaction with telemedicine to build an understanding of the effectiveness of these encounters for future planning.

- **Methods**: After a telemedicine appointment, patients received an electronic survey. Survey questions focused on demographic information, encounter type, medical history questions, and overall satisfaction with telemedicine. Responses for the survey questions were formulated using a 5-point Likert scale.

- **Results**: Two hundred seventy patients were seen via telemedicine by one of four providers included in this study. Forty-three patients returned the surveys, with a completion rate of 16%. Patients indicated higher scores for overall satisfaction and quality of appointments. Notably, 23% of participants responded that they would be willing to pay out of pocket for a telemedicine appointment, while 77% responded they would not be willing to pay out of pocket.

- **Conclusion**: Our survey results show patients felt comfortable discussing healthcare issues using telehealth and that appropriate levels of care were provided.

### Telehealth and telemedicine: Regulatory and medicolegal landscape [^116rkncf]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Telehealth and telemedicine experienced remarkable growth during and after the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth is generally defined as nonclinical services that employ telecommunication technology, while telemedicine refers more specifically to remote clinical services, including diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. Nuclear medicine is no exception in employing telemedicine increasingly in clinical practice for image interpretation, treatment consultation, and care delivery supervision. There is no doubt that soon, the use of tele-nuclear medicine will increase, comparable to the employment of telecommunication in other fields of medicine. We review the medicolegal and regulatory aspects of the evolution in the clinical practice of medicine through telehealth and telemedicine.

### Building the case for actionable ethics in digital health research supported by artificial intelligence [^1162DmGu]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The digital health ecosystem, though rich with potential, presents new ethical challenges in decision-making regarding the selection, testing, implementation, and evaluation of technologies in healthcare. Researchers began studying related ethical issues over 20 years ago, during the conceptualization of electronic health records technology. As new forms of pervasive information communication technologies produce data, guiding principles and standards are emerging within academic research centers and industry sectors.

Accepted ethical principles in health research, including respect for persons, beneficence, and justice, remain relevant and must be prioritized to protect research participants from harm. Applying these principles in practice ensures that people have the information needed for informed decision-making, evaluates and manages the risks of harm against potential benefits, and prevents any single group from bearing the testing burdens of new health information technologies.

However, ethical challenges arise from the combination of rapidly evolving technologies; new stakeholders, such as technology giants, digital therapeutic start-ups, and citizen scientists; data quantity; novel computational and analytic techniques; and the lack of regulatory controls or common standards to guide this convergence in the health ecosystem.

### Telehealth in the time of COVID-19 [^116M3bE9]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Telehealth, or using technology for a remote medical encounter, has become an efficient solution for safe patient care during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic. This medium allows patients immediate healthcare access without the need for an in-person visit. We designed a time-sensitive, practical, effective, and innovative scale-up of telehealth services as a response to the demand for COVID-19 evaluation and testing. As more patients made appointments through the institution's telehealth program, we increased the number of clinicians available. JeffConnect, the acute care telehealth program, was expanded to increase staffing from a standing staff of 37 to 187 doctors within 72 hours.

Telehealth care clinicians, primarily trained in emergency medicine, internal medicine, and family medicine, followed a patient decision pathway. This was used to risk stratify patients into three groups: home quarantine with no testing, home quarantine with outpatient COVID-19 testing, and referral for in-person evaluation in the emergency department for symptomatic and potentially unstable patients.

### Ethical considerations in quality improvement [^111JEV9p]. Journal of Perinatology (2025). Low credibility.

Clinicians have an ethical responsibility to improve care while safeguarding patients from harm. This ethical imperative drives the implementation of quality improvement (QI) initiatives aimed at enhancing patient outcomes. In comparison to human subjects' research, QI efforts may have different ethical considerations that seem less well-defined. This article explores the ethical complexities in neonatal and perinatal QI work associated with designing, conducting, and disseminating QI projects.

QI efforts should be grounded in ethical tenets such as beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and respect for autonomy, particularly when applied to vulnerable populations such as neonates. By recognizing the ethical considerations unique to QI, investigators can promote transparency and context-aware practices, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and safety of their initiatives. Thoughtful design and implementation can ensure that QI efforts are both ethically sound and clinically impactful, enhancing their trustworthiness and applicability across diverse clinical settings.

Clinical trial registration (if any): None.

### Ethical challenges in the care of patients with serious illness [^112UXZkQ]. Pain Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

The approach to the management of patients with advanced disease and serious illness has been strongly influenced by advances in science and technology, the increasing role of ethics in clinical practice, and the recognition of new rights and social changes. At present, decision-making is modulated by ethical and legal considerations. One of the challenges of clinical practice is to maintain the delicate balance between the technical aspects and the humanistic aspects of care.

For the resolution of this challenge, this article proposes an ethical and legal framework that considers the goals of care and respects the basic values of autonomy, beneficence, and justice. Ethical and legal principles complement sound medical practice but should never replace it. At all times, clarification of the medical situation, good communication, and information about state-of-the-art treatment proposals are essential. In the context of advanced illness, the most prominent issues relate to decision-making, justice, and research.

### Patients' perspectives on the shift to telemedicine in primary and behavioral health care during the COVID-19 pandemic [^116XZxn3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Studies specifically focused on patients' perspectives on telemedicine visits in primary and behavioral health care are fairly limited and have often focused on highly selected populations or used overall satisfaction surveys.

- **Objective**: To examine patient perspectives on the shift to telemedicine, the remote delivery of health care via the use of electronic information and communications technology, in primary and behavioral health care in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) during COVID-19.

- **Design**: Semi-structured interviews were conducted using video conference with patients and caregivers between October and December 2020.

- **Participants**: Providers from six FQHCs nominated participants. Eighteen patients and caregivers were interviewed, including six patients with only primary care visits, five with only behavioral health visits, three with both primary care and behavioral health visits, and four caregivers of children with pediatric visits.

- **Approach**: Using a protocol-driven, rapid qualitative methodology, we analyzed the interview data and assessed the quality of care, benefits and challenges of telemedicine, and the use of telemedicine post-pandemic.

- **Key results**: Respondents broadly supported the option of home-based synchronous telemedicine visits in primary and behavioral health care. Nearly all respondents appreciated remote visits, largely because such visits provided a safe option during the pandemic. Patients were generally satisfied with telemedicine and believed the quality of visits to be similar to in-person visits, especially when delivered by a provider with whom they had an established relationship.

### Twenty-first century house calls: A survey of ambulatory care providers to inform organisational telehealth strategy [^116VACED]. BMJ Health & Care Informatics (2022). Low credibility.

Overall, clinicians generally felt comfortable with telehealth, indicating that more could be done virtually with the appropriate and proper support. Clinical confidence was high among respondents, with 56% noting that they could see 39% of their patients virtually. This supports the growing trend of building new modalities of care around the patient, regardless of their location. However, not all clinicians agreed with the usability of telehealth or the ability to use technology effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily in a care context. Context is undoubtedly critical. Facilitating the selection of the ideal medium for a visit — whether in-person or mediated by technology — for both patients and providers will ultimately be a key factor in integrating technology.

The nuanced data indicate that organisations must take a customised approach to deploying telehealth across ambulatory care. Not all patients, clinical departments, or diagnoses are appropriate for telehealth. For example, telehealth may be inappropriate for encounters requiring a hands-on physical examination to manage care. Deciphering optimal telehealthcare will depend on the specialty, making a one-size-fits-all approach untenable.

Clinicians lauded the insight gained via telehealth into a patient's life circumstances. Prior work highlighted similar insights where previously invisible patient contextual factors emerged during telehealth visits. This was, however, at times uncomfortable. Clinicians reported patients taking telehealth visits in inappropriate settings.

### Building the case for actionable ethics in digital health research supported by artificial intelligence [^1152xDtA]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

This use case reflects the shift in health research associated with digital technologies, indicating that traditional methods of developing an evidence base may be pushed aside in favor of what appears to be exciting innovation. The landscape is unsettled and potentially dangerous, which makes governance important. We have identified three notable gaps: 1. disciplinary/sector challenges; 2. issues of data and technology literacy; and 3. inconsistent or non-extant standards to guide the use of AI and other emerging technologies in healthcare settings.

- **Interdisciplinary and sector challenges**: Emerging technologies and AI systems require diverse expertise when applied to digital medicine. This introduces new challenges, as technology makers may not understand patients' needs and develop tools with limited utility in practice. Computational scientists may train AI using datasets that are not representative of the public, limiting the ability to provide meaningful assessments or predictions. Clinicians may not know how to manage the depth of granular data, nor be confident in decisions produced by AI. Research is needed to examine this disconnect and identify strategies to reduce gaps and improve meaningful connections between these groups that are integral to digital health research and the use of AI in the healthcare sector.

### Centering health equity in telemedicine [^111mPD1r]. Annals of Family Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

In the wake of the racial injustices laid bare in 2020, on top of centuries of systemic racism, it is clear we need actionable strategies to fundamentally restructure health care systems to achieve racial/ethnic health equity. This paper outlines the pillars of a health equity framework from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, overlaying a concrete example of telemedicine equity. Telemedicine is a particularly relevant and important topic, given the growing evidence of disparities in uptake by racial/ethnic, linguistic, and socioeconomic groups in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the new standard of care that telemedicine represents post-pandemic.

We present approaches for telemedicine equity across the domains of:

- **Strategic priorities of a health care organization**: Engage leaders and stakeholders to prioritize health equity.
- **Structures and processes to advance equity**: Develop new protocols and utilize data-driven strategies.
- **Strategies to address multiple determinants of health**: Consider social determinants and tailor interventions.
- **Elimination of institutional racism and oppression**: Commit to systemic changes to eradicate bias.
- **Meaningful partnerships with patients and communities**: Collaborate with diverse communities to enhance trust and communication.

### Ethics as a non-technical skill for surgical education in sub-Saharan Africa [^116aTf7K]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

In recent years, surgical education has increased its focus on non-technical skills such as communication and interpersonal relationships, while continuing to strive for technical excellence in procedures and patient care. An awareness of the ethical aspects of surgical practice, which involve non-technical skills and judgment, is of vital concern to surgical educators. This awareness encompasses disparate issues ranging from adequate supervision of trainees to surgical care access.

- **Methods**: This bibliographical research effort seeks to report on ethical challenges from a sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) perspective as found in the peer-reviewed literature. It employs African Journals Online, Bioline, and other sources with African information, as well as PubMed and PubMed Central. The principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice offer a framework for a study of issues including access to care (socioeconomic issues and distance from health facilities), resource utilization, and decision-making based on availability and cost of resources, including ICU and terminal extubation. It also covers informed consent (both communication about reasonable expectations post-procedure and research participation), research ethics (including local projects and international collaboration), and quality and safety (including supervision of less experienced professionals). The religious and cultural environment receives attention because beliefs and traditions affect medical choices ranging from acceptance of procedures.

### The role of telemedicine in enhancing palliative care for older adults: Opportunities and challenges [^117U3SkH]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The gap between those willing and without requisite technology is more significant among older, less health literate, African American veterans, those with worse physical health, and those living in more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. The willingness to use video visits dropped after the age of 75 years, and there was a strong correlation between technological access and digital skills on willingness.

All of these points raise privacy and ethical concerns related to telemedicine, including data security breaches, a lack of control over personal health information, and potential miscommunication during virtual interactions. To enhance security and build trust, proposed solutions include implementing stronger encryption, establishing standardized telehealth regulations, and providing training for providers in ethical telemedicine practices. Additionally, communicating privacy policies and offering hybrid care models can further support patient confidence in virtual healthcare.

In a study with residents in long-term care homes, Perri et al. showed that most family participants were satisfied with videoconferencing and would be willing to use it again. Around 70% of them still preferred in-person visits if possible, posing a challenge for delivering telemedicine services in lower-middle-income countries and exposing risks to those more vulnerable to accessing new models of care.

In a study by Read Paul et al, elderly patients at home in a distant community received a web-based videoconferencing (WBVC) for conducting in-home palliative care consults.

### Exploring the face-to-face: Revisiting patient-doctor relationships in a time of expanding telemedicine [^1139dh5E]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The patient-doctor relationship lies at the heart of medicine. Confronted with the challenges of COVID-19, we find ourselves unable to provide care and comfort in the same physical space as our patients. As we are forced to reckon with telemedicine visits and contemplate continuing them in a post-pandemic future, it is important to understand the difference relationally between telemedicine and face-to-face encounters. I will argue that face-to-face visits remain essential in establishing the most fundamentally human components of relationships: responsibility and vulnerability. This established bond assures fidelity in subsequent encounters, whether by phone, video, or in person.

### Factors informing high-risk primary care patient choice around telehealth use: a framework [^111DUWsy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

While telehealth's presence in post-pandemic primary care appears assured, its exact role remains unknown. The expansion of value-based care has heightened interest in telehealth's potential to improve the uptake of preventive and chronic disease care, especially among high-risk primary care populations. Despite this, the pandemic underscored patients' diverse preferences around using telehealth. Understanding the factors underlying this population's preferences can inform future telehealth strategies.

- **Objective**: To describe the factors informing high-risk primary care patient choice of whether to pursue primary care via telehealth, in-office, or to defer care altogether.

- **Design**: Qualitative, cross-sectional study utilizing semi-structured telephone interviews of a convenience sample of 29 primary care patients between July 13 and September 30, 2020.

- **Participants**: Primary care patients at high risk of poor health outcomes and/or acute care utilization who were offered a follow-up primary care visit via audiovisual, audio-only, or in-office modalities.

- **Approach**: Responses were analyzed via grounded theory, using a constant comparison method to refine emerging categories, distinguish codes, and synthesize evolving themes.

- **Key results**: Of the 29 participants, 16 (55.2%) were female, and 19 (65.5%) were Black; the mean age (SD) was 64.6 (11.1). Participants identified four themes influencing their choice of visit type: perceived utility (encapsulating clinical and non-clinical utility), underlying costs (in terms of time, money, effort, and safety), and modifiers.

### Telemedicine in Alzheimer's disease and other dementias: Where we are [^1132KTjb]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2025). Low credibility.

The prevalence and global health burden of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), is rising, while patients living in remote and underserved areas face significant challenges in reaching specialized care. Telemedicine offers a valuable solution in bridging this widening gap by providing equal and timely access to tertiary-specialized centers. Accumulating evidence highlights that most parts of the remote neuropsychological and neurological evaluation are feasible, with patients, healthcare professionals, and caregivers being generally satisfied with this means of care.

Herein, we provide an updated overview of the available evidence on the use of telemedicine for patients with cognitive disorders, focusing on the different applications and settings, the remote, video-based neurological and neuropsychological assessment, recommendations, non-pharmacological interventions, as well as legal and ethical considerations. Based on the literature review and our three-year experience in the "Specialized Outpatient Clinic of Memory, Dementia and Parkinson's Disease through the National Telemedicine Network" at the Aiginition University Hospital of Athens, we propose a brief guide for assessing patients with cognitive impairment via telemedicine and suggest future research directions for the more effective and appropriate use of telemedicine in dementia assessment and care.

### Prioritizing benefits: A content analysis of the ethics in dementia technology policies [^1157qMQK]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

As the global prevalence of dementia rises, care costs impose a large burden on healthcare systems. Technology solutions in dementia care have the potential to ease this burden. While policies exist to guide and govern the use of dementia care technologies, little is known about how ethical considerations are incorporated into these documents.

The goal of this study was to examine ethics-related content in dementia care technology policies. We used a two-step data mining approach to collect a sample of dementia technology policies. Policy documents were analyzed using emergent content analysis. Following the coding of the sample, thematic categories were organized using the principles of biomedical ethics as a framework.

A total of 23 policy documents from four Alzheimer associations in four countries were included in our analysis. General ethics considerations and themes related to beneficence were mentioned in 96% of the documents. Thematic categories related to justice were present in 74% of the sample, themes related to non-maleficence appeared in 52% of documents, and themes related to autonomy appeared in 43% of the sample.

While ethical considerations are present in existing policies for dementia care technology, these considerations revolve primarily around the benefit of the technologies. Further efforts are needed to provide formal guidance that incorporates both benefits and potential harms.

### Patient-reported outcomes for remote and in-person visits for genetic counseling in adult neurology [^117Wk7NV]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). High credibility.

- **Interest in future telehealth visits**: When asked about their interest in future telehealth utilization, a subset of participants selected the option "it depends" (13% responding "it depends" after visit 1 and 29% selecting "it depends" after visit 2). Participants were given the opportunity to elaborate via a free text response. Responders noted that telehealth alleviated travel barriers, such as travel time if living far away, travel cost, needing to arrange visit travel around a work schedule, and requiring assistance traveling to in-person appointments.

- **Preference for future telehealth visits**: Responders outlined some factors that influenced potential preference for an in-person visit. These factors included being outside the COVID-19 pandemic, technical difficulties with remote visits, a preference for in-person visits for complex sessions, visits to review results with significant impact, and/or visits requiring the review of materials together. Participants explained that their preference for future visit type depends on how they are feeling and the level of rapport. Many noted a willingness to use telehealth if an in-person option was not possible.

Questions about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare were assessed in the visit 1 survey. 83% and 67% of visit 1 responders reported that they did not delay seeing a genetic counselor or nonurgent medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. Questions about at-home sample collection were assessed in the visit 2 survey.

### Mobile technologies to support healthcare provider to healthcare provider communication and management of care [^114WtXFF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Similar contextual factors might contribute to the applicability of the evidence. One factor often mentioned was the variation in healthcare professionals' willingness to use mHealth, attend training, invite people to participate, select participants for electronic referrals, hold face-to-face appointments, or provide the required feedback. Four trials reported that recruited participants might not have been representative of the general population, as the study population was more educated, more likely to be male, and more likely to be healthier. There was also variation associated with participants' location, as those allocated to the intervention who lived closer to the referral setting were less likely to accept a telephone appointment and more likely to be referred to a face-to-face appointment from their healthcare provider. One trial reported that participants allocated to the control group had to travel on average 98 km to receive face-to-face care, indicating that the intervention might provide particular benefits in settings with a low-density population.

Some of the included trials were designed and implemented to address geographical limitations on access to healthcare, allowing healthcare providers who were geographically separated to exchange clinical information.

### Methods to increase response to postal and electronic questionnaires [^114HcyTc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

One trial involving 5,413 participants evaluated the effect of textual presentation of response categories compared to visual presentation. The odds of response increased by almost a fifth when textual presentation was used (OR 1.19; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.36). A single trial with 517 participants assessed the impact of formatting a web survey as a single scrollable page versus multiple pages. There was no evidence of an effect on response for using a single scrollable page (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.66 to 1.32). Two trials with 3,676 participants evaluated email subject lines that emphasized an incentive compared to those that did not. No evidence was found for an effect on response when the email subject emphasized an incentive (OR 2.19; 95% CI 0.58 to 8.27). There was considerable heterogeneity between the trial results (I² = 97%). Additionally, a single trial with 2,963 participants examined the effect of an email reminder including humor compared to a standard email. Responses did not improve significantly with the inclusion of humor (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.38).

- **Delivery**: How are the questionnaires received or returned?

### Telehealth policy, practice, and education: A position statement of the Society of General Internal Medicine [^111q22pJ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Telehealth services, specifically telemedicine audio-video and audio-only patient encounters, expanded dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic through temporary waivers and flexibilities tied to the public health emergency. Early studies demonstrate significant potential to advance the quintuple aim — patient experience, health outcomes, cost, clinician well-being, and equity. Supported well, telemedicine can particularly improve patient satisfaction, health outcomes, and equity. If implemented poorly, telemedicine can facilitate unsafe care, worsen disparities, and waste resources. Without further action from lawmakers and agencies, payment will end for many telemedicine services currently used by millions of Americans at the end of 2024. Policymakers, health systems, clinicians, and educators must decide how to support, implement, and sustain telemedicine. Long-term studies and clinical practice guidelines are emerging to provide direction.

In this position statement, we use clinical vignettes to review relevant literature and highlight where key actions are needed. These include areas where telemedicine must be expanded, such as supporting chronic disease management, and where guidelines are needed, like preventing inequitable offering of telemedicine services and preventing unsafe or low-value care. We provide policy, clinical practice, and education recommendations for telemedicine on behalf of the Society of General Internal Medicine. Policy recommendations include ending geographic and site restrictions and expanding the definition of telemedicine to include audio-only services.

### Policy recommendations to guide the use of telemedicine in primary care settings: An American College of Physicians position paper [^1177uw7M]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Telemedicine — the use of technology to deliver care at a distance — is rapidly growing and can potentially expand access for patients, enhance patient-physician collaboration, improve health outcomes, and reduce medical costs. However, the potential benefits of telemedicine must be measured against the risks and challenges associated with its use, including the absence of the physical examination, variation in state practice and licensing regulations, and issues surrounding the establishment of the patient-physician relationship. This paper offers policy recommendations for the practice and use of telemedicine in primary care and reimbursement policies associated with telemedicine use. The positions put forward by the American College of Physicians highlight a meaningful approach to telemedicine policies and regulations that will have lasting positive effects for patients and physicians.

### Evaluation of patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in terms of treatment compliance and quality of life after follow-up with telemedicine: A randomized controlled trial [^113tb3Wx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The present study was designed as a prospective, randomized controlled trial conducted in the clinical research format. Ethical approval for the study was provided by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Gazi University Medical Faculty on June 13, 2022, under decision number 448.

The study enrolled 74 patients who had been admitted to the Department of Pulmonary Diseases at Gazi University Medical Faculty between July 1, 2022, and July 1, 2023, due to COPD exacerbation and met all the inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosis of COPD, spirometrically, according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), graded 3–4, with an acceptable mini-mental test, and at least one hospitalization in the past year. The exclusion criteria were as follows: Grade 1–2 COPD, asthma, lung cancer, combined pulmonary fibrosis emphysema, pneumonia, active infections such as COVID-19, unwillingness to participate in the study, unacceptable mini-mental test results, inability to use telemedicine devices, or not having relatives who could use telemedicine.

Patients who agreed to participate in the study were divided into two groups, telemedicine and control groups, using the closed-envelope randomization method. Gender, age range, CAT score, and Charlson comorbidity index score were considered during patient randomization. After randomization, patients were divided into two groups: the telemedicine group and the control group.

### Effect of telemedicine support for intraoperative anaesthesia care on postoperative outcomes: the TECTONICS randomised clinical trial [^114G3TGi]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). High credibility.

The TECTONICS study was published in 2025 in the British Journal of Anaesthesia. This study addresses surgery-related diseases and investigates the effect of intraoperative telemedicine decision support on postoperative outcomes in surgical patients.

- **Study design**: Single-center, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial (RCT).
- **Population**: 71,927 patients (36,636 females, 35,291 males).
- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult surgical patients.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Nonsurgical procedure suites and obstetrics.
- **Interventions**:
	- **Telemedicine decision support**: 35,302 patients received real-time recommendations based on case reviews and physiological alerts.
	- **Usual care**: 36,625 patients received standard of care without communication with intraoperative clinicians.

- **Primary outcome**: No significant difference in death from all causes at day 30 (1.8% vs. 1.8%; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.16).
- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in postoperative respiratory failure (3.2% vs. 3.2%; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09).
	- No significant difference in acute kidney injury (AKI) (7% vs. 7.1%; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06).
	- No significant difference in delirium (32.6% vs. 32.1%; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.1).

The conclusion of the TECTONICS study is that, in adult surgical patients, telemedicine decision support did not demonstrate superiority over usual care regarding mortality from all causes at day 30.

### Personalizing health care: Feasibility and future implications [^114NicsM]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

- **Ethical issues**: The concept of health and disease is evolving, particularly with the advent of predictive capabilities. There are concerns regarding ownership of information, which extends beyond genomic data. It is crucial to ensure a comprehensive understanding to justify population-based genome sequencing. Diagnostic tests and targeted treatments must be accessible both within and across countries, especially as companies seek 'orphan status' for new treatments. The understanding and role of patients in decision-making are vital. Furthermore, human dignity is at stake, with potential risks of stigmatization and discrimination, and human integrity may be affected, influencing moral convictions, preferences, and commitments.

- **Social issues**: Empowering patients and increasing the autonomy of both them and their relatives are key factors. There is a risk of stigmatizing certain subpopulations based on their genomic, clinical, and environmental data. The advancement of technology facilitates the internationalization of data. To promote personalized health services, appropriate policies must involve different people and subgroups, consider the support and costs required, and gauge public reactions through qualitative and quantitative research. Legal barriers related to varying reimbursement and pricing policies can impact the implementation of personalized healthcare services and products. If unaddressed, these barriers may lead to inequity or unequal access to new technologies.

### A double-edged sword: Telemedicine for maternal care during COVID-19: Findings from a global mixed-methods study of healthcare providers [^114up6rA]. BMJ Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

The second telehealth practice concerned the reduction or elimination of non-essential personal consultations. Providers did not seem to have a standard definition of what they considered 'essential' versus 'non-essential' health consultations. Healthcare providers used email and/or WhatsApp to send prescriptions and laboratory results to their patients if needed. This practice, while not completely new, became more common since the beginning of the pandemic, as women and their families were discouraged from visiting health facilities unless absolutely necessary. It was easily accepted by patients and implemented by providers.

Medical abortion was an example of a service mentioned within this theme. A doctor from Cameroon described how he assisted women with an abortion by providing a medical prescription and a cervical-ripening agent remotely to reduce the time spent with the patient in person. He stated, "One of the biggest successes of telemedicine is preparing women with abortion remotely for surgical aspiration. I come to perform it when ready". He mentioned this telehealth practice was routine before the pandemic.

### American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) position paper for the use of telemedicine for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders [^1114JTtA]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's (AASM) Taskforce on Sleep Telemedicine supports telemedicine as a means of advancing patient health by improving access to the expertise of Board-Certified Sleep Medicine Specialists. However, such access improvement needs to be anchored in attention to quality and value in diagnosing and treating sleep disorders. Telemedicine is also useful to promote professionalism through patient care coordination and communication between other specialties and sleep medicine.

Many of the principles and key concepts adopted here are based on U.S. industry standards, with special consideration given to the work by the American Telemedicine Association and abide by standards endorsed by the American Medical Association. Practitioners who wish to integrate sleep telemedicine into their practice should have a clear understanding of the salient issues, key terminology, and the following recommendations from the AASM:

- **Clinical care standards**: For telemedicine services, these should mirror those of live office visits, including all aspects of diagnosis and treatment decisions as would be reasonably expected in traditional office-based encounters.
- **Clinical judgment**: This should be exercised when determining the scope and extent of telemedicine applications in the diagnosis and treatment of specific patients and sleep disorders.
- **Live interactive telemedicine**: For sleep disorders, if utilized, it should be in a manner consistent with the principles outlined in this document.

### A statewide elder mistreatment virtual assessment program: Legal, ethical, and practical issues [^116C3A67]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). High credibility.

Telecommunication-assisted forensic assessments of capacity and mistreatment by geriatricians with expertise in elder abuse and self-neglect are helping to meet the demand for such forensic services for Adult Protective Services (APS) clients in remote and underserved areas of Texas. The use of synchronous audiovisual-assisted interviews instead of in-person interviews with clients to provide capacity assessments has become more important with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is growing interest in establishing similar programs in other states using geriatrician faculty from medical schools to serve the clients of their state Adult Protective Services agencies. The arrangement between APS and the geriatricians at McGovern Medical School in Houston, Texas, is novel. The structure of the arrangement is important for the success of the program.

- **Legal, ethical, and practical considerations**: The article discusses approaches to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, physician liability, state law, and resource limitations. It is hoped that sharing how one such collaboration has addressed these important issues will suggest approaches for the structuring of similar programs.

### Adapting non-medical applications for medical use: Ethical limits, coverage, and validation [^112QBKa5]. Injury (2023). High credibility.

The widespread adoption of smartphones and other mobile devices amongst healthcare providers has opened new possibilities arising from the use of non-medical apps, social media, meeting platforms, and non-medical devices with intended medical purposes. This expansion enhances communication and imaging chat systems between these professionals and their patients, as well as amongst healthcare professionals. However, adapting non-medical applications, social media, videoconferencing platforms, and devices for medical use presents potential limitations, barriers, and risks, which should be fully recognized to avoid crossing the fine line between ethical and unethical practices. In this study, we analyze the ethical limits, coverage, and validation of non-medical applications adapted for medical use. Level of evidence: IV (evidence from well-designed case-control or cohort studies).

### Legal and ethical issues in telemedicine and robotics [^113TMpn4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2006). Low credibility.

Modern medical concerns with telemedicine and robotics practiced across national or other jurisdictional boundaries engage the historical, complex area of law called conflict of laws. An initial concern is whether a practitioner licensed only in jurisdiction A who treats a patient in jurisdiction B violates B's laws. Further concerns include whether a practitioner in A who violates a contract or treats a patient in B negligently incurs liability in B, A, or both, and if treatment lawful in A is unlawful in B, whether the practitioner commits a crime. Judicial procedures are set by courts in which proceedings are initiated, but courts may decline jurisdiction due to inconvenience to parties. If courts accept jurisdiction, they may apply their own substantive legal rules but may find that the rules of a conflicting jurisdiction should apply. Cross-border care should not change usual medical ethics, for instance on confidentiality, but may mitigate or aggravate the migration of specialists.

### Making sense of technology adoption in healthcare: Meso-level considerations [^1179huc5]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

It has been clear for some time that the development of telecare faces significant problems. Large scale studies and clinical trials seem to suggest that the cost and clinical effectiveness of telecare systems are doubtful, and the claim that these systems empower or enable service users often seems greatly overstated. The question that stems from this is, can these problems be overcome?

Greenhalgh et al. have critiqued the construction of telecare as a generalized technological solution to problems of the delivery of care, and have offered a new framework for defining quality in telecare and telehealth. They outline a set of principles that focus on the premise that quality telehealth or telecare is:

- **Anchored in a shared understanding**: of what matters to the user.
- **Realistic about the natural history of illness**.
- **Co-creative, evolving, and adapting**: solutions with users.
- **Human, supported through interpersonal relationships** and social networks.
- **Integrated, through attention to mutual awareness and knowledge sharing**.
- **Evaluated to drive system learning**.

The ARCHIE model outlined by Greenhalgh et al. is useful because it promotes a solution to some of the core problems of adopting, implementing, and normalizing new technologies. In this context, it is part of a much wider shift in the way that health technologies are understood. Since the 1990s, there has been a longstanding movement to reconceptualize health technologies as elements of care that can be co-designed and co-produced, and an increasing orientation to theoretical approaches to the study of health technologies.

### Building the case for actionable ethics in digital health research supported by artificial intelligence [^114YurLd]. BMC Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The digital revolution is disrupting the ways in which health research is conducted and subsequently changing healthcare. Direct-to-consumer wellness products and mobile apps, pervasive sensor technologies, and access to social network data offer exciting opportunities for researchers to passively observe and/or track patients 'in the wild' and 24/7. The volume of granular personal health data gathered using these technologies is unprecedented and is increasingly leveraged to inform personalized health promotion and disease treatment interventions. The use of artificial intelligence in the health sector is also increasing.

Although rich with potential, the digital health ecosystem presents new ethical challenges for those making decisions about the selection, testing, implementation, and evaluation of technologies for use in healthcare. As the 'Wild West' of digital health research unfolds, it is important to recognize who is involved and identify how each party can and should take responsibility to advance the ethical practices of this work. While not a comprehensive review, we describe the landscape, identify gaps to be addressed, and offer recommendations on how stakeholders can and should take responsibility to advance socially responsible digital health research.

### Mobile technologies to support healthcare provider to healthcare provider communication and management of care [^1153XN9p]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

Use of mobile technologies between healthcare providers for communication, consultations, and patient management might contribute to developing professional skills and expertise, as well as optimizing multidisciplinary communication (AAP 2015) and evidence-based clinical practice. This is particularly relevant for settings where there is a shortage of healthcare providers, for instance, in low- and middle-income countries and in rural and remote areas (Källander 2013). By enabling healthcare providers who are geographically separated to exchange clinical information and knowledge, mobile technology can facilitate universal health coverage by increasing access to health care. In 2018, the WHO published a classification of digital health interventions to categorize the functionality of the different applications; using this classification as a guide, we include interventions that are portable and facilitate remote healthcare provider communication or coordination of referrals, or both.

Despite the possibilities, telehealth applications have been inconsistently implemented, with varying degrees of success due to technological challenges, legal considerations, human and cultural factors, and uncertainty around economic benefits and cost-effectiveness (WHO 2016), although this is changing. Overcoming these barriers requires evidence-based implementation of guidelines, driven both by governmental and professional medical organizations; legislation on confidentiality, privacy, and liability; and the involvement of stakeholders in the design.

### Cyberdermatoethics ii: A case-based approach to teledermatology ethics [^1156CUoy]. Clinics in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Teledermatology is the use of telecommunication for medical diagnosis and patient care in dermatology. The visual nature of diagnosis in dermatology makes it particularly well suited to the practice of telemedicine. The differences between the two basic types of teledermatology — real-time and store-and-forward — are reviewed. Case scenarios are used to examine some of the ethical and clinical issues that can occur, such as the nature of the doctor-patient relationship, follow-up of incidental diagnoses, limitations of telemedicine, privacy issues, and licensing. Guidelines for the use of telemedicine in dermatology are reviewed.

### Methods to increase response to postal and electronic questionnaires [^112sPXmu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Ten trials (21,393 participants) evaluated the effect on response of including a 'sensitive' question in a questionnaire. The odds of response were reduced by nearly one-tenth when sensitive questions were included (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00). A single trial (5,817 participants) evaluated the effect on response of placing the more relevant questions at the start of the questionnaire. The odds of response were increased by a quarter when more relevant questions were placed first (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.37). Three trials (11,435 participants) assessed the impact of placing the most general questions at the start. There was no evidence for an effect on response of placing general questions first (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.09). Five trials (10,565 participants) evaluated the effect on response of starting with demographic questions. No effect was observed (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.16).

Two trials (3,182 participants) studied the impact of beginning with the easiest questions. The odds of response increased by more than half when the easiest questions were presented first (OR 1.61; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.26). Two trials (4,087 participants) investigated the use of a more 'user-friendly' questionnaire. The odds of response were increased by almost half using user-friendly questionnaires (OR 1.47; 95% CI).

### Implementation of first-trimester risk assessment for trisomy 21: Ethical considerations [^1156u3ay]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

The performance and evaluation of first-trimester risk assessment should meet standards of scientific and ethical excellence. While scientific standards are well understood, ethical standards are less well defined. Based on the ethical concept of the physician as fiduciary, and the ethical principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, and justice, it is demonstrated that obstetricians have an ethical obligation to routinely offer pregnant women first-trimester risk assessment in high-quality centers.

Additionally, based on the professional virtues of integrity and self-sacrifice, it is argued that both obstetricians and specialists in risk assessment have a strict ethical obligation to identify, responsibly manage, and disclose both economic and non-economic conflicts of interest, especially when they are concealed. Ethics, therefore, is an essential dimension in the implementation of first-trimester risk assessment for trisomy 21.

### Methods to increase response to postal and electronic questionnaires [^112RpR6o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

How do the questionnaires look? **Postal questionnaires**: Seventy-four trials involving 97,674 participants evaluated the effect on questionnaire response by making questionnaire materials more personal, such as signing letters by hand. The odds of response were increased by more than a tenth with a more personalized approach to participants (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.21). However, there was considerable heterogeneity amongst the results of these trials (I² = 57%). Fourteen trials with 15,006 participants evaluated the effect of cover letters bearing a handwritten signature compared to those that are typed, scanned, or printed. The odds of response increased by a quarter using handwritten signatures (OR 1.24; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.41). Furthermore, nine trials involving 6030 participants evaluated the effect of handwritten address labels compared to computer-printed labels. The odds of response increased by a quarter with handwritten labeled questionnaires (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.37). In addition, three trials with 1364 participants evaluated the presence of a signature within the questionnaire itself. There was some evidence for an effect on response when using a signature within the questionnaire (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.76).

### What is evidence-based medicine and why should it be practiced [^111yGMc4]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Responding to the limitations of traditional expert recommendations as a guide to clinical practice, evidence-based medicine has presented a paradigm shift in the way clinicians learn and practice medicine. The practice of evidence-based medicine requires careful examination of the evidence, using a set of formal rules applied in an explicit manner. The clinician then judiciously applies the evidence to decision-making, with an understanding of the patient context and values. Using examples pertinent to respiratory therapists, we discuss evidence-based decision-making as a clinical problem-solving strategy, its basis on a hierarchy of evidence, and the interplay of values, preferences, expertise, and circumstances that affect its application. We briefly describe some resources available to obtain evidence reports and to learn to critically appraise and apply them.

### Access to digital health technologies: personalized framework and global perspectives [^116Mp8Pu]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

The emergence and rapid adoption of digital health technologies (DHT) present unprecedented opportunities to democratize and reduce disparities in health care by monitoring health and disease at the point of care in all patients. However, limited access to DHT is becoming a major obstacle to realizing these goals. Access to DHT is influenced not only by well-recognized social determinants of health but also by digital determinants of health, such as digital literacy and the need for broad access to digital infrastructure, as well as commercial and economic factors. Addressing these challenges and designing unbiased systems of care are essential to enable broad access to DHT and to benefit diverse and under-represented communities. Doing so will fill gaps in the clinical evidence base and avoid perpetuating historical biases.

In this review, we propose a personalized framework to improve access to DHT, addressing determinants of access at the individual, interpersonal, community, society, government, and industry levels. We frame these issues globally, highlighting how the challenges to DHT access and potential solutions might differ between continents while also emphasizing common themes. We provide perspectives from partners across the spectrum of health care, including clinicians, clinical trialists, and experts from digital health and industry.

### Telemedicine technology and implications for reproductive office operations [^116Nk1yd]. Fertility and Sterility (2020). Low credibility.

Telemedicine had been very slowly making inroads into standard clinical practice. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the rapid implementation of telemedicine across most practices. The efficiency and permanence of telemedicine services depend on a multitude of factors, including technological choices, governmental and insurance regulations, reimbursement policies, and staff and patient education and acceptance. Although challenges remain and the extent of implementation is still evolving, it is clear that telemedicine is here to stay and that all those involved in health care need to be familiar with its opportunities and challenges.

### The virtual visit: Using immersive technology to visit hospitals during social distancing and beyond [^1166LreR]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

Medical trainees face substantial financial and scheduling burdens during the interview process at various levels of training. With social distancing and travel restrictions in place, in-person interviews now carry an additional health risk that makes it difficult for training programs and applicants to conduct a thorough interview process. Virtual interviews and presentations are some of the technology-driven solutions that have been accelerated in this social context to mitigate financial burdens and health risks. By utilizing immersive technology to provide virtual tours of training sites, applicants have the opportunity to gain a comprehensive perspective before making the critical decision of where to continue their training.

We provide our experiences with creating a 360-degree virtual tour of our children's hospital and the methods for distribution to pediatric anesthesia fellowship applicants. Moving forward, training programs may consider immersive virtual tours as an alternative to face-to-face site visits to not only help alleviate the financial and scheduling burden for applicants but also to protect the well-being of healthcare personnel and patients in the context of a global pandemic.

### Ethical issues in the design and implementation of population health programs [^114FRYqH]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Widely recognized ethical principles — non-maleficence (do no harm) and beneficence (acting in patients' best interests), respect for persons, and justice — can help identify the ethical concerns that could arise in the design and implementation of population health programs (PHPs).

- **Non-maleficence and beneficence**: Physicians play important public health roles, such as mandatory reporting of certain infectious diseases, and have societal obligations, such as antibiotic stewardship and advocating for health care reform. However, physicians' primary ethical obligations are to focus on promoting the best interests of individual patients. Non-maleficence requires that physicians ensure PHPs cause no harm to patients. Beneficence requires physicians to support PHPs that actually benefit patients.

	- In practice, the lines between harmful, non-beneficial, and beneficial effects of PHPs for individual patients may blur. PHPs could improve a population's overall health while resulting in unintended non-beneficial or even harmful individual consequences. For instance, implementing a standard colorectal cancer screening metric with an age cutoff of 75 years — as might be done with an electronic health record pop-up reminder — appears to have been associated with underscreening of healthy individuals over age 75 and overscreening of unhealthy individuals under age 75. Unintentionally, a metric appeared to discourage appropriately individualized clinical decision-making.

### Telemedicine during COVID-19 and beyond: A practical guide and best practices multidisciplinary approach for the orthopedic and neurologic pain physical examination [^1155BVaL]. Pain Physician (2020). Low credibility.

The COVID pandemic has impacted almost every aspect of human interaction, causing global changes in financial, health care, and social environments for the foreseeable future. More than 1.3 million of the 4 million cases of COVID-19 confirmed globally as of May 2020 have been identified in the United States, testing the capacity and resilience of our hospitals and health care workers.

The impacts of the ongoing pandemic, caused by a novel strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have far-reaching implications for the future of our health care system and how we deliver routine care to patients.

- **Social distancing during the pandemic**: The adoption of social distancing has demonstrated efficacy in controlling the spread of this virus and has been the only proven means of infection control thus far. Social distancing has prompted hospital closures and the reduction of all non-COVID clinical visits, causing widespread financial despair to many outpatient centers.

- **Telemedicine adoption**: Despite the pandemic, the need to treat patients for non-COVID problems remains important, as care must continue to be delivered to patients despite their ability or desire to report to outpatient centers for their general care. Our national health care system has realized this need and has incentivized providers to adopt distance-based care in the form of telemedicine and video medicine visits. Many institutions have since incorporated these into their practices without financial penalty because of Medicare's 1135 waiver, which currently reimburses telemedicine at the same rate as evaluations.
