## Question

dose of adenosine for afib in WPW

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the dose of adenosine in atrial fibrillation with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether adenosine is appropriate or contraindicated in pre-excited atrial fibrillation. Then, I should verify what the major society guidelines say. Next, I will consider the mechanism of harm if AV nodal blocking agents are used. After that, I need to outline the evidence-based acute treatments that are actually recommended. Finally, I should confirm adenosine's proper indication and dosing for PSVT so there is no confusion, and close with a clear, safety-focused recommendation backed by labeling and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the central safety point, because I need to ensure we do not propagate a dangerous practice. In atrial fibrillation with anterograde accessory pathway conduction (pre-excited AF), adenosine is not advised, and more broadly AV nodal blocking agents are to be avoided due to risk of accelerating conduction over the pathway with possible degeneration to ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamic collapse, per the 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS AF guideline and corroborating Canadian guidance [^115hR2Ew] [^115KoJg4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without understanding why. Mechanistically, adenosine produces potent AV nodal block but does not block conduction through the accessory pathway, so in pre-excited AF it can shift more atrial impulses down the pathway, very rapidly increasing ventricular rate and precipitating instability or ventricular fibrillation; case reports and physiologic rationale align with this risk and underpin the guideline prohibition [^115hR2Ew] [^112z7pXZ].

> Next, I should review what to do instead. If the patient is unstable, synchronized electrical cardioversion is the immediate therapy. If the patient is hemodynamically stable with pre-excited AF, guideline-supported pharmacologic options are intravenous procainamide or intravenous ibutilide to slow and convert by prolonging refractoriness in the accessory pathway, rather than blocking the AV node, as specified in contemporary North American guidelines [^116hNf2o] [^115KoJg4].

> Wait, I should double-check the status of amiodarone here because older practice patterns sometimes included it. The 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline explicitly lists amiodarone among agents not advised in pre-excited AF along with adenosine, beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, and digoxin, reflecting reports of accelerated ventricular response and proarrhythmia in this setting, so I should not recommend it for acute management of pre-excited AF [^115hR2Ew].

> I will now examine adenosine's actual FDA-labeled use, because I need to avoid conflating PSVT therapy with AF care. Adenosine is indicated for conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, including PSVT associated with WPW, and it is not effective for converting atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to sinus rhythm, which directly answers why there is no adenosine dose for AF in WPW [^117D3YmF] [^115V8uTk]. Let me verify dosing for its proper indication: for PSVT, the recommended adult regimen is 6 mg rapid IV bolus, followed by 12 mg rapid IV bolus if needed, and a second 12 mg bolus may be given if necessary, which should not be extrapolated to AF management [^111Nrk6i] [^115V8uTk].

> But wait, what if the rhythm diagnosis is uncertain at the bedside. If there is a very fast, irregular wide-complex tachycardia where pre-excitation is possible, I should avoid AV nodal blockers including adenosine and default to strategies that address potential accessory pathway conduction, with early synchronized cardioversion if unstable, consistent with emergency care recommendations and guideline cautions [^115hR2Ew] [^116DiEyD].

> Final verification of the take-home message is critical. There is no recommended dose of adenosine for atrial fibrillation in WPW because adenosine is contraindicated in pre-excited AF; instead use synchronized cardioversion if unstable or IV procainamide or IV ibutilide if stable, and reserve adenosine strictly for PSVT with the labeled 6 mg then 12 mg dosing sequence, never for AF or flutter [^115hR2Ew] [^116hNf2o] [^117D3YmF] [^111Nrk6i].

Do not use **adenosine** for atrial fibrillation with WPW [^115hR2Ew] because it may precipitate dangerous ventricular acceleration or ventricular fibrillation [^112z7pXZ]. Instead, use **IV procainamide or ibutilide** [^116hNf2o] for stable patients [^115KoJg4] and perform immediate synchronized cardioversion if the patient is unstable [^115hR2Ew]. Avoid **AV nodal blockers** — including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, amiodarone, and adenosine — in pre-excited AF [^115hR2Ew] [^115YjCUR].

---

## Clinical risks of adenosine in WPW-associated AF

Adenosine **blocks the AV node** [^115hR2Ew], which can shift conduction to the accessory pathway, producing rapid ventricular rates and potentially triggering ventricular fibrillation [^112z7pXZ]. This risk is greatest when the accessory pathway has a short refractory period, allowing very rapid conduction [^112rkvvL].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines explicitly **advise against adenosine** in AF with pre-excitation [^115hR2Ew] due to the risk of ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamic collapse. Recommended alternatives include **IV procainamide or ibutilide** [^116hNf2o] for stable patients with pre-excited AF [^115KoJg4] and **immediate synchronized cardioversion** for unstable patients [^115hR2Ew].

---

## Alternative pharmacological management

For stable pre-excited AF, **use agents that slow conduction over the accessory pathway** [^116hNf2o].

| **Medication** | **Recommended dose** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|
| Procainamide | 15 mg/kg IV over 30–60 min | Monitor for hypotension and QRS widening |
| Ibutilide | - 1 mg IV over 10 min <br/> - Repeat once if needed | Monitor for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes |
| Flecainide | 2 mg/kg IV over 10 min (max 150 mg) | Avoid in structural heart disease |
| Propafenone | 2 mg/kg IV over 10 min (max 150 mg) | Avoid in structural heart disease |

---

## Clinical scenarios where adenosine may be considered

Adenosine may be used for diagnostic purposes in narrow-complex tachycardias [^112z7pXZ] when AF is not suspected, but only with continuous ECG monitoring and immediate access to resuscitation equipment. It is **not indicated for AF with pre-excitation** [^115V8uTk].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Do not use adenosine**: in AF with pre-excitation [^115hR2Ew] due to risk of ventricular fibrillation [^115YjCUR].
- **Use procainamide or ibutilide**: for stable pre-excited AF [^115KoJg4].
- **Perform immediate cardioversion**: if the patient is unstable [^115hR2Ew].

---

Adenosine is **contraindicated** in AF with WPW [^115hR2Ew] because it can precipitate ventricular fibrillation; use procainamide or ibutilide for stable patients [^116hNf2o] and perform immediate synchronized cardioversion if the patient is unstable.

In the context of atrial fibrillation, particularly concerning patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) and pre-excitation syndromes, the 2024 guidelines from ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS recommend avoiding the use of pharmacological agents that block atrioventricular nodal conduction. Specifically, drugs such as verapamil, diltiazem, amiodarone, digoxin, adenosine, or β-blockers are not advised for patients with atrial fibrillation who have anterograde accessory pathway conduction (pre-excited AF) due to the risk of precipitating ventricular fibrillation (VF) or causing hemodynamic deterioration.

### Pre-excited atrial fibrillation triggered by intravenous adenosine: A commonly used drug with potentially life-threatening adverse effects [^112z7pXZ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Although serious adverse events following adenosine administration are rare, it should only be administered in an environment where continuous ECG monitoring and emergency resuscitation equipment are available. The case report describes the development of pre-excited atrial fibrillation in a 31-year-old woman with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome following the administration of adenosine. She had previously been fit and well and was admitted to the coronary care unit with a 2-hour history of regular palpitations. A 12-lead ECG showed a narrow QRS complex tachycardia. Carotid sinus massage was unsuccessful in terminating the tachycardia and the patient subsequently received rapid boluses of intravenous adenosine. The cardiac rhythm degenerated into atrial fibrillation with ventricular pre-excitation following 12 mg adenosine.

### Determining the optimal dose of adenosine for unmasking dormant pulmonary vein conduction following atrial fibrillation ablation: Electrophysiological and hemodynamic assessment. DORMANT-AF study [^117SNqkg]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

The significance of adenosine-induced dormant pulmonary vein (PV) conduction in atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation remains controversial. The optimal dose of adenosine to determine dormant PV conduction is yet to be systematically explored.

- **Electrophysiological and hemodynamic assessment**: Consecutive patients undergoing index AF ablation received three adenosine doses (12, 18, and 24 mg) in a randomized blinded order, immediately after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Electrophysiological measures, including PR prolongation, AV block (AVB), and PV reconnection, as well as hemodynamic parameters such as blood pressure (BP), were recorded. A total of 339 doses (113 per dose) were administered to assess 191 PVs in 50 patients (66% male, 72% paroxysmal AF (PAF), 52% hypertensive). Dormant PV conduction occurred in 28% of patients, with 16.5% [32] of PVs showing reconnection. All reconnection cases were associated with AVB: PV reconnection vs. no PV reconnection was 100% vs. 83% respectively, P = 0.007. AVB occurred more frequently at 24 mg versus 12 mg (92% vs. 82%, P = 0.019) but not compared to 18 mg (91%, P = 0.62). The duration of AVB increased with dosage: 12 mg (12.0 ± 8.9 seconds), 18 mg (16.1 ± 9.1 seconds, P = 0.001), and 24 mg (19.0 ± 9.3 seconds). A difference in response based on weight was observed, where AVB at 24 mg for patients > 110 kg (65% vs. 91% in the 70–110 kg group, P < 0.001) was noted.

Conclusion: The results suggest that adenosine-induced dormant PV conduction and associated AVB can be dose-dependent, with variations observed based on dosage and patient weight. Further study is needed to establish an optimal dosing regimen to enhance the procedural efficacy and safety of AF ablation.

Regarding the medical management of atrial fibrillation, specifically in terms of rhythm control maintenance therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of sotalol for the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm. Proper dose selection should be based on kidney function, with close monitoring of the QT interval, heart rate, serum potassium, magnesium concentrations, and kidney function. These guidelines apply to patients with atrial fibrillation who do not present with significant baseline QT interval prolongation, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or bradycardia.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111m6W3b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The electrophysiological effects of nifekalant on atrioventricular node (AVN) conduction in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) but without accessory pathways (AP) were determined. Nifekalant infusion terminated AF in 33 of 87 patients (38%). Fifty-four of 87 patients (62%) continued to have AF after 30 minutes of treatment. Among those whose AF did not terminate, the mean age was 58 ± 13 years (range 18–74 years), with 32 being male. Twenty of these 54 patients (37%) had structural heart diseases and a low left ventricular ejection fraction (37 ± 5%).

- **Ventricular rate**:
	- **Baseline**: 97 ± 17 beats/min
	- **After 1 minute**: 97 ± 16 beats/min
	- **After 3 minutes**: 99 ± 18 beats/min
	- **After 5 minutes**: 101 ± 20 beats/min
	- **After 7 minutes**: 103 ± 22 beats/min
	- **After 10 minutes**: 104 ± 24 beats/min
	- **After 15 minutes**: 102 ± 21 beats/min
	- **After 20 minutes**: 96 ± 19 beats/min
	- **After 30 minutes**: 95 ± 15 beats/min
	- Nifekalant did not significantly decrease the mean ventricular rate of AF in the absence of an AP (97 ± 17 versus 95 ± 15 beats/min, n = 54, P = 0.22). A trend toward an increased ventricular rate was noted from infusion time 0 to 10 minutes, and a trend toward a decrease from 10 to 30 minutes of infusion.

- **Blood pressure and safety**:
	- The mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) in patients with AF but no AP did not change significantly with nifekalant infusion (106 ± 16 versus 109 ± 17 mm Hg, n = 54, P = 0.30).
	- No torsades de pointes (TdP) occurred in these patients during nifekalant infusion.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^111fi1R9]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates paroxysmal AF in some patients, in other patients it can recur. We investigated the clinical utility of advanced interatrial block (IAB) for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation.

This retrospective study included 103 patients (70 men, 33 women; mean age, 44 ± 16 years) with WPW syndrome who had paroxysmal AF. A resting 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed immediately after successful AP ablation to evaluate the presence of advanced IAB, which was defined as a P-wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic morphology in the inferior leads.

During the mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 20.0 months (range, 2–71 months), 16 patients (15.5%) developed AF recurrence. Patients with advanced IAB had significantly reduced event-free survival from AF (P < .001). The study identified advanced IAB (hazard ratio, 4.42; 95% CI, 1.55–12.62; p = 0.005) and age > 50 years (hazard ratio, 12.64; 95% CI, 1.33–119.75; p = 0.027) as independent predictors of AF recurrence.

In conclusion, advanced IAB was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after successful AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^112Mng4W]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

All patients undergoing electrophysiological stimulation for the induction of atrial fibrillation (AF) were under the same anesthetic regimen as those who presented with spontaneous sustained preexcited AF. Both groups received local anesthesia at the puncture sites before puncture. No other anesthetic was used during electrophysiology (EP) studies and drug infusion. Twelve of 51 patients (24%) had structural heart disease and a low mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 36 ± 6%.

Clinical characteristics of the 51 patients, before infusion of nifekalant, are presented in Table 1.

- **EP studies**: EP studies were performed using a WorkMate Claris System (St. Jude Medical Inc, Little Canada, MN). Surface ECG and bipolar intracardiac electrograms were simultaneously recorded from the high right atrium, coronary sinus, His bundle region, right ventricular apex, and left atrium, where appropriate. AF was routinely induced by rapid atrial decremental pacing (cycle length 200 to 50 ms; pulse width 2 ms). Isoproterenol and other adrenergic drugs were not used during EP studies, including the induction of AF, to avoid potential confounding effects of adrenergic stimulation on the shortest preexcited R-R (SPRR) interval and other electric parameters. AF was considered sustained if it lasted longer than 10 minutes.

- **Nifekalant infusion**: Nifekalant infusion was started following 10 minutes of successful AF induction at an initial dose of 0.3 mg/kg for 5 minutes, followed by continuous infusion at 10 µg/kg per minute for 25 minutes. The infusion was discontinued when AF terminated during the study.

### 2017 HRS/EHRA/ECAS/APHRS/SOLAECE expert consensus statement on catheter and surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation [^1133ACDD]. Heart Rhythm (2017). High credibility.

The first study was a prospective, randomized clinical trial involving 534 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). All patients were administered adenosine 20 minutes following initial pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). The initial dose was 12 mg, which was titrated until at least one blocked P wave or a 3-second pause was observed. The presence of dormant pulmonary vein conduction was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmia recurrence. Patients with dormant pulmonary vein conduction were randomly assigned to additional adenosine-guided ablation or to no further ablation. Elimination of dormant pulmonary vein conduction by additional targeted ablation significantly reduced recurrent atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATAs) by 56% during follow-up (P < .0001).

The most recent study enrolled 2,113 patients with paroxysmal, persistent, and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF). In this study, 0.4 mg per kg of adenosine was administered following a variable waiting time (median time 43 minutes). Early reconduction after the waiting time alone was observed in 42% of patients in both groups. Subsequent administration of adenosine demonstrated further reconduction in an additional 27% of the patients. Further ablation was then performed to eliminate dormant conduction. At the end of 1 year of follow-up, no difference in outcome was observed, with a success rate of approximately 65% in each group.

Of note, given the lower observed 27.6% prevalence of dormant conduction in the latter trial, a risk reduction of 72.4% in those patients with dormant conduction would have been required to detect a significant overall difference. It is also notable that the use of force-sensing ablation catheters was part of the study protocol.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^116CamTC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The trend of ventricular response at different infusion times of nifekalant during preexcitation was observed.

- **Patients and results**: The trend of preexcited ventricular response was noted in 42 patients whose conditions were not terminated before 7 minutes and 18 patients whose conditions were not terminated before 30 minutes. Both groups showed no acceleration of ventricular response during nifekalant infusion. The maximal therapeutic effects of nifekalant were observed 7 to 10 minutes into the infusion. Important indicators included atrial fibrillation, average preexcited R‐R interval, average R‐R interval, and shortest preexcited R‐R interval.

- **Adverse events**: One patient, a 58-year-old female with spontaneous sustained preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF), developed Torsades de Pointes (TdP) after nifekalant infusion. Twelve minutes post-infusion, her AF converted to sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 40 beats per minute, followed by TdP, which was immediately terminated by pacing the right ventricle at 90 beats per minute and a bolus intravenous injection of 2.5 g magnesium sulfate. She had a low blood potassium level of 3.0 mmol/L.

- **Additional observations**: AF changed to atrial flutter (AFL) in 2 patients. No patients developed ventricular fibrillation (VF), cardiac arrest, or syncope during nifekalant infusion. There was no transient loss of the δ wave, defined as its complete disappearance on the ECG for at least 1 minute, in any of the patients during the infusion.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115YJHzp]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates atrial fibrillation (AF) in some patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White (WPW) syndrome and paroxysmal AF, it can recur in others. The hypothesis is that adding pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) after successful AP ablation might effectively prevent AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome; however, this is unknown.

We retrospectively studied 160 patients (102 men, 58 women; mean age, 46 ± 14 years) with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF who underwent AP ablation. Among them, 103 (64.4%) underwent only AP ablation (AP group), while 57 (35.6%) underwent AP ablation plus PVI (AP + PVI group). Advanced interatrial block (IAB) was defined as a P‐wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads, using 12‐lead electrocardiography (ECG).

During the mean follow‐up period of 30.9 ± 9.2 months (range, 3‐36 months), 22 patients (13.8%) developed AF recurrence. The recurrence rate did not differ significantly between the AP + PVI group and the AP group (15.5% vs. 10.5%, respectively; p = 0.373). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that PVI was not associated with a reduced risk of AF recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.26‐1.68; p = 0.380). In WPW patients with advanced IAB, the recurrence rate was notably lower in the AP + PVI group compared to the AP group (90% vs. 33.3%, respectively; p = 0.032).

In conclusion, PVI after successful AP ablation significantly reduced the AF recurrence rate in WPW patients with advanced IAB. Screening of a resting 12‐lead ECG is suggested for identifying patients who may benefit from this intervention.

### Atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction in undiagnosed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1126rGuj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction via an accessory pathway is an uncommon presentation of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome not previously reported in the emergency medicine literature. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a form of ventricular preexcitation sometimes initially seen and diagnosed in the emergency department (ED), can present with varied tachydysrhythmias for which certain treatments are contraindicated. For instance, atrial fibrillation with preexcited conduction needs specific consideration of medication choice to avoid potential degeneration into ventricular fibrillation.

- **Case report**: We describe an adult female presenting with a very rapid, regular wide complex tachycardia successfully cardioverted in the ED followed by a normal electrocardiogram (ECG). Electrophysiology study confirmed atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction and revealed an accessory pathway consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, despite lack of ECG findings of preexcitation during sinus rhythm. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Ventricular tachycardia must be the first consideration in patients with regular wide complex tachycardia. However, clinicians should consider atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction related to an accessory pathway when treating patients with the triad of very rapid rate (> 250 beats/min), wide QRS complex, and regular rhythm, especially when considering pharmacologic treatment. Emergency physicians also should be aware of electrocardiographically concealed accessory pathways, and that lack of delta waves does not rule out.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^113hsdWr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The study explores the electrophysiological and clinical effects of nifekalant in patients with preexcitation (n = 51). Each line with a dot at both ends illustrates the changes in parameters for every patient with preexcitation. Horizontal bars and vertical lines indicate mean values and standard deviations (or they represent median and percentiles 25–75), including atrial fibrillation, average preexcited R-R interval, average R-R interval, heart rate, percentage of preexcitation, the ratio of preexcited complexes to total ventricular complexes, and systolic blood pressure.

- **Characteristic response of nifekalant in patients**:
	- The first patient, a 47-year-old male with preexcitation and paroxysmal but no structural heart disease, showed an initial interval of 283 ms before nifekalant infusion. At 7 minutes post-infusion, this interval prolonged to 329 ms, with intermittent narrowing. This patient underwent ablation of both the pathways.
	- The second patient, a 69-year-old female with spontaneous sustained preexcitation and rheumatic heart disease, had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%. Her interval was 310 ms before nifekalant infusion and prolonged to 420 ms at 7 minutes post-infusion, also showing intermittent narrowing. This patient underwent the ablation of only one pathway.

Arrows in the figures illustrate the narrow pathways and the absence of preexcitation.

### Variant angina in an adolescent coexisting with intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^117TPGEQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Chest pain is not an uncommon complaint among adolescents; however, it often leads them to seek emergency medical care. Variant angina, or coronary artery spasm resulting in acute myocardial ischemia, is an extremely rare cause of chest pain within the pediatric population, with very few cases reported. We describe a 13-year-old boy with underlying intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who experienced an acute coronary artery syndrome due to coronary artery vasospasm.

### Adenosine [^117GPB8J]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

The section on adverse reactions details the effects observed in controlled U.S. clinical trials involving intravenous adenosine. The placebo group reported less than 1% incidence of these reactions.

- **Post marketing experience**: The following adverse events have been reported from marketing experience with adenosine injection. Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size and are associated with concomitant diseases, multiple drug therapies, and surgical procedures, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure [see Warnings]. Decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors: (1) seriousness of the event, (2) frequency of the reporting, (3) strength of causal connection to the drug, or a combination of these factors.

- **Cardiovascular**: Prolonged asystole, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, transient increase in blood pressure, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, and Torsade de Pointes.

- **Respiratory**: Bronchospasm.

- **Central nervous system**: Seizure activity, including tonic clonic (grand mal) seizures, and loss of consciousness.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^116Yo8MW]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Because patients with advanced interatrial block (IAB) have a high risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after accessory pathway (AP) ablation, additional interventions are required to prevent AF recurrence in this population. Pulmonary vein isolation is an established effective treatment for paroxysmal AF. However, we did not assess whether pulmonary vein isolation was effective for preventing AF recurrence in patients in the present study. Although the pulmonary vein is reportedly involved in the development of paroxysmal AF in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, atrial substrate abnormalities partially determine the likelihood of AF recurrence after AP ablation in these patients. Thus, the clinical efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation for preventing AF recurrence in these patients requires further study.

### Occurrence of intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome during intravenous sedation [^1136LByR]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, defined as intermittent loss of the delta waves, can show occasional conduction through the accessory pathway. WPW syndrome often causes paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or atrial fibrillation. However, it may be difficult to identify the abnormalities preoperatively because of their only intermittent occurrence. We report a case in which exogenously administered epinephrine and an autonomic imbalance may have precipitated the abrupt occurrence and disappearance of the delta waves.

### Extracorporeal life support for cardiac arrest in a 13-year-old girl caused by Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113Y8ho9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome generally presents with a good prognosis. However, several case reports have demonstrated malignant arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death as the first presentation of WPW syndrome. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation using extracorporeal life support is a therapeutic option in cases of refractory cardiac arrest. We present a patient with WPW syndrome who experienced sudden cardiac arrest as the first presentation of the disease and was treated using extracorporeal life support, resulting in a good neurologic outcome.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^116ii4TK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

An evaluation of nifekalant was conducted in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and no accessory pathway (AP). Eighty-seven patients (mean age 53 ± 11 years, 52 males) with persistent AF and no AP were studied. The participants did not present with abnormal electrolytes, prolonged QT interval (QTc ≥ 470 ms), atrioventricular (AV) conduction disorders, or left atrial thrombus. Twenty-three of the 87 patients (26%) had structural heart disease and a low left ventricular ejection fraction (39 ± 5%).

Nifekalant was infused as described above, and the following parameters were assessed: ventricular rate of AF before, and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes from the onset of infusion; AF cardioversion; blood pressure (BP); Torsades de Pointes (TdP); and other arrhythmias.

- **Statistical analysis**: Continuous variables with normal distribution were presented as mean values ± SD. The Student paired t-test was used to determine the significance between baseline and drug infusion. Variables with a skewed distribution were presented as median (percentiles 25–75), and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied. A two-sided P value of < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.

### Impact of adenosine on wavefront propagation in persistent atrial fibrillation: Insights from global noncontact charge density mapping of the left atrium [^1166AXMJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Spatial distribution of LRA: In light of the observation of LRA occurring over a greater left atrium surface area with adenosine, each map was visually inspected at the highest cutoff to identify whether regions with repetitive LRA remained spatially consistent or were changed with adenosine use. At baseline, a region of repetitive LRA could be identified in 89% (31 of the 35) of maps, with 61 zones identified in total (1.7 ± 1.1 per map). Following adenosine infusion, 70 zones were identified across all 35 maps (2 ± 1 per map), with 42 of these zones (60%; 1.2 ± 1.0 per map) localized to the same site as LRA in baseline maps. Figure 6 illustrates regions of repetitive LRA in two patients before and after adenosine infusion.

Regions of high-frequency LIA and LRA may overlap, given that multiple wavefronts over different AF cycles may or may not satisfy criteria for LRA within the same confined region (e.g. partial rotation through 180 degrees) and be classified as LIA. A total of 81% of sites with high-frequency LRA with adenosine coincided with sites where high-frequency LIA was seen on baseline maps. There were 11 maps (in 9 patients) where the zones of LRA observed in adenosine maps were all in different sites from the baseline maps. In 4 of these, there were no regions of repetitive LRA seen at baseline.

### Atrial fibrillation with broad QRS tachycardia and undiagnosed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in a pediatric patient [^111w8og3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency department of a regional hospital with one episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Postictal monitoring followed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed fast atrial fibrillation with intermittent wide QRS regular tachycardia. Immediately following this, her rhythm changed to wide QRS irregular tachycardia without hemodynamic compromise. She was suspected to have ventricular tachycardia and was treated with intravenous amiodarone, resulting in cardioversion to sinus rhythm. A subsequent electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm displayed typical features of manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) accessory pathway. This case illustrates the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in patients with atrial fibrillation, wide QRS tachycardia, and undiagnosed WPW syndrome with antidromic conduction of atrial arrhythmias through the accessory pathway. Furthermore, this case demonstrates that undiagnosed wide QRS tachycardias need to be treated with drugs acting on the accessory pathway, considering underlying WPW syndrome as a possibility to avoid potentially catastrophic events.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend considering the initiation of warfarin (INR 2.0–3.0) or an evidence-based dose of apixaban for oral anticoagulation. This approach aims to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at elevated risk for stroke and have end-stage CKD (CrCl < 15 mL/min) or are on dialysis.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^116gNfcF]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. While successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) can eliminate paroxysmal AF in some patients, it can recur in others.

- **Hypothesis**: We investigated the clinical utility of advanced interatrial block (IAB) for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study included 103 patients (70 men, 33 women; mean age, 44 ± 16 years) with WPW syndrome who had paroxysmal AF. A resting 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed immediately after successful AP ablation to evaluate the presence of advanced IAB, defined as a P-wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic morphology in the inferior leads.

- **Results**: During the mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 20.0 months (range, 2–71 months), 16 patients (15.5%) developed AF recurrence. Patients with advanced IAB had significantly reduced event-free survival from AF recurrence. Advanced IAB (hazard ratio, 7.19; 95% CI, 1.58–32.62; p = 0.011) and age > 50 years (hazard ratio, 12.64; 95% CI, 1.33–119.75; p = 0.027) were identified as independent predictors of AF recurrence.

- **Conclusions**: Advanced IAB was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after successful AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115b9nri]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Consecutive patients with overt or intermittent Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome who were hospitalized at Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Fuwai Central China Cardiovascular Hospital for radiofrequency ablation between January 2013 and September 2018 were retrospectively reviewed.

The inclusion criteria were:

- At least one documented episode of atrial fibrillation (AF) before ablation.
- Undergoing accessory pathway (AP) ablation, with or without catheter ablation for AF during the same session.
- Successful AP ablation, defined as the elimination of AP conduction by demonstrated atrial and ventricular pacing, even after isoproterenol infusion.
- Available records of a post-ablation, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG).

The exclusion criteria were:

- Repeated ablations.
- Previous cardiac surgery, congenital heart disease, or serious valvular heart disease.
- Thyroid dysfunction on admission, indicated by abnormal free thyroxine or thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.

Patients were divided into two groups:

- **AP group**: Patients who underwent AP ablation without pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).
- **AP + PVI group**: Patients who underwent AP ablation and PVI during the same session.

The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were informed about the investigational nature of the catheter ablation procedure and provided written informed consent to undergo the procedure. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent for this study has been waived because of its retrospective nature.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115CJKrx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 201 patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), with a mean age of 38 ± 13 years, and including 128 males, underwent electrophysiological (EP) studies. All presented with sinus rhythm; 87 of 201 patients (43%) had preexcitation on ECG, while 114 (57%) had no evidence of preexcitation on ECG (concealed accessory pathway or dual atrioventricular nodal [AVN] pathways). One patient had Ebstein anomaly, but the remainder had no structural heart disease. In addition, no patients had electrolyte abnormalities or a long QT interval (corrected QT interval [QTc] ≥ 470 ms).

Nifekalant was infused as described above. EP studies were performed at the baseline before the drug infusion (baseline state) and periodically during the infusion time (7–30 minutes). Seven-beat stimuli at a basic drive cycle length (S1) of 450 or 600 ms, delivered at −10 ms decrements, were applied. The following indices were measured: antegrade accessory pathway (AP) effective refractory period (ERP) and block cycle length (BCL); antegrade AVN ERP; ERP of the right atrium; ERP of the right ventricle (RV); AH, HV, PR, QRS, and QT interval, as well as heart rate (HR) and blood pressure.

Antegrade AP and AVN ERP were defined as the longest A1-A2 interval that failed to conduct over the AP or AVN. The antegrade BCL over the AP was defined as the shortest S1 cycle length that maintained 1:1 conduction at a decremental paced interval of 10 ms. The right atrium and RV ERPs were defined as the longest S1-S2 interval at which A2 (or V2) failed to produce a response. The antegrade AP ERP and BCL were measured in patients with preexcitation, while the antegrade AVN ERP was recorded mainly in patients with no antegrade preexcitation.

For patients with obesity, particularly in the context of atrial fibrillation, the 2024 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guidelines recommend considering the initiation of warfarin over direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for stroke risk reduction. This consideration is due to concerns regarding DOAC drug absorption following bariatric surgery.

### Sinus bradycardia, Wolff-Parkinson-White, and left ventricular noncompaction: an embryologic connection [^115pPR4A]. Pediatric Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is an uncommon disorder that has recently been recognized as a distinct cardiomyopathy. LVNC is thought to result from an arrest in the normal process of myocardial compaction. The association of Wolff-Parkinson-White with noncompaction of the left ventricle is well recognized. Sinus bradycardia has also been associated with LVNC, although less frequently than Wolff-Parkinson-White. We report an infant with LVNC, Wolff-Parkinson-White, and progressive sinus bradycardia who had a myocardial vascular abnormality in the region of the sinus node evident on autopsy. We propose that the progressive nature of the conduction system abnormality was a result of abnormal angiogenesis.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^111qxFCc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation (AF), also known as preexcited AF, typically present with a rapid ventricular response rate and wide QRS complexes. The fast conduction of atrial high-frequency impulses occurs preferentially via the accessory pathway (AP), which has a shorter refractory period than the atrioventricular node (AVN). Consequently, patients are at a higher risk of hemodynamic instability, spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF), and cardiac arrest.

Patients with preexcited AF who present with hemodynamic instability typically undergo prompt electrical cardioversion. Those with stable hemodynamics are commonly treated with an infusion of an antiarrhythmic drug to decrease the preexcited ventricular rate and prevent hemodynamic instability. The 2017 European Heart Rhythm Association Consensus recommends procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, or ibutilide, whereas the 2014 American Heart Association Guidelines recommend procainamide or ibutilide for intravenous use to acutely slow the ventricular rate of preexcited AF.

- **Limitations with current treatments**: The above four agents are not recommended for the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and impaired left ventricular function (ILVF). Intravenous amiodarone, a multichannel blocker, was widely used in the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and ILVF. However, recent reports of accelerated preexcited ventricular responses and VF during amiodarone infusion have raised concerns about its utility. Therefore, intravenous amiodarone is no longer considered advisable.

### Long term risk of Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and syndrome [^112Tj9wj]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For years, conventional wisdom has held that patients with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation (asymptomatic WPW or WPW pattern) were at low risk for adverse outcomes. This assumption has been challenged more recently in a number of observational and natural history studies, as well as prospective trials, in which patients were more aggressively studied via invasive electrophysiology study (EPS) and more aggressively treated, in some cases, with pre-emptive catheter ablation, despite the lack of symptoms. In sum, the data do not definitively support one approach (early, up-stream EPS and/or ablation) versus the other (watchful waiting with close monitoring). The most recent pediatric and adult guidelines reflect this ambiguity with a broad spectrum of approaches endorsed.

### A randomized study of prophylactic catheter ablation in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^113Wdapq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Young age and the inducibility of atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia or atrial fibrillation during invasive electrophysiological testing identify asymptomatic patients with a Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern on the electrocardiogram as being at high risk for arrhythmic events. We tested the hypothesis that prophylactic catheter ablation of accessory pathways would provide meaningful and durable benefits compared to no treatment in such patients.

- **Methods**: From 1997 to 2002, among 224 eligible asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, those at high risk for arrhythmias were randomly assigned to radio-frequency catheter ablation of accessory pathways (37 patients) or no treatment (35 patients). The endpoint was the occurrence of arrhythmic events over a five-year follow-up period.

- **Results**: Patients assigned to ablation had baseline characteristics similar to those of the controls. Two patients in the ablation group (5 percent) and 21 in the control group (60 percent) experienced arrhythmic events. One control patient had ventricular fibrillation as the presenting arrhythmia. The five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of the incidence of arrhythmic events were 7 percent among patients who underwent ablation and 77 percent among the controls (P < 0.001 by the log-rank test); the risk reduction with ablation was 92 percent (relative risk, 0.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.33; P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Prophylactic accessory-pathway ablation markedly reduces the frequency of arrhythmic events in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115kLETs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

- **Effects of nifekalant on antegrade (n = 78)**: The changes in antegrade conduction were measured in every patient during the baseline and nifekalant infusion state. Nifekalant was associated with the prolongation of conduction, increasing the antegrade conduction time from 272 ± 52 ms to 309 ± 59 ms and the block cycle length from 323 ± 51 ms to 381 ± 63 ms (all P < 0.001).

- **Proportion of patients and change in conduction times**: Nifekalant significantly decreased the proportion of patients with conduction times of < 260 ms and 260 ≤ < 300 ms from 40% to 23% and from 32% to 22%, respectively. Conversely, it increased the proportion of patients with conduction times of 300 ≤ < 350 ms and ≥ 350 ms from 19% to 28% and 9% to 27%, respectively.

### Atrial electrophysiologic abnormalities in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome but without paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^116h1rSy]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.

- **Hypothesis**: The purpose of this study was to analyze the atrial electrophysiologic abnormalities and vulnerability to develop atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with WPW syndrome but with no previous history of PAF.

- **Methods**: We investigated atrial electrophysiologic abnormalities and vulnerability to AF in patients with WPW syndrome but without PAF. An electrophysiologic study was performed in 28 patients with WPW syndrome, 23 with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT), and 25 with other arrhythmias (control), all of whom had no history of PAF. The following atrial excitability parameters were assessed: effective refractory period (ERP), spontaneous or paced (A1) and extrastimulated (A2) atrial electrogram widths, percent maximum atrial fragmentation (%MAF; A2/A1 x 100), wavelength index (WLI; ERP/A2), and inducibility of AF.

- **Results**: The ERP tended to be shorter in patients with WPW syndrome and in those with AVNRT than in the control group. The %MAF increased (154 ± 33 vs. 137 ± 23%, p < 0.05) and WLI decreased (2.7 ± 0.8 vs. 3.4 ± 1.0, p < 0.05) significantly in patients with WPW syndrome compared with the control group; however, these parameters in patients with AVNRT showed intermediate values. Atrial fibrillation was more inducible in patients with WPW syndrome (4/28 [14.3%]) than in those with AVNRT (4.3% [1/23]) and the control group (0/25 [0%]).

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^112x7AwZ]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Low credibility.

The patient is a 27-year-old man with a history of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and two prior unsuccessful catheter ablation attempts, who presented with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. He was successfully resuscitated and, after recovery, was noted to have an ejection fraction of 20%, with an electrocardiogram showing a short PR interval and a delta wave (Figure 1, A). Electrophysiology mapping indicated a posterior-septal accessory pathway. Multiple attempts to ablate the accessory pathway endocardially and via the middle cardiac vein were unsuccessful. One additional attempt at catheter ablation via both endocardial and epicardial mapping and ablation was unsuccessful. In view of the resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation due to rapid atrial fibrillation conducting rapidly over the accessory pathway, the patient was referred for surgical ablation.

- **Preoperative and postoperative findings**: Figure 1 shows electrocardiograms; A, Preoperative electrocardiogram showing a short PR interval and preexcitation (delta wave); B, Five-year postoperative electrocardiogram showing a normal PR interval and absence of preexcitation.

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^113xDUCi]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Low credibility.

The surgical procedure was performed through a median sternotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass but without cardioplegic arrest. The beating heart allowed real-time electrophysiologic testing during the procedure. An incision was made through the right ventricular epicardial fat a few millimeters lateral to the atrioventricular junction and over the right coronary artery (RCA). The epicardial fat was then dissected away from the RCA in an attempt to divide the accessory pathway, which resulted in no change in preexcitation.

The right atrium was opened with a free wall incision, exposing the tricuspid valve. Sites of previous catheter ablation were clearly visible by endocardial scarring (Figure 2, A). An incision was made approximately 5 mm from the tricuspid annulus, starting at the 1 o'clock position and carried down to the coronary sinus. The dissection was extended through the endocardium, exposing the RCA from the inside and carried into the pyramidal space (Figure 2, B). At this point of dissection into the pyramidal space, as indicated by the blue arrow in Figure 2, B, the preexcitation disappeared, consistent with the division of a subendocardial posterior-septal pathway.

Adenosine was then administered for atrioventricular nodal blockade, and antegrade or retrograde conduction across the accessory pathway could not be demonstrated. Further ablation was performed by radiofrequency and cryoablative techniques along the endocardial dissection plane.

### Adenosine [^117D3YmF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

**Indications & usage**: Adenosine Injection, USP is indicated for the conversion to sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), including that associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome). When clinically advisable, appropriate vagal maneuvers (e.g. Valsalva maneuver) should be attempted before administering adenosine. It is important to ensure that the adenosine solution actually reaches the systemic circulation (see dosage and administration). Adenosine does not convert atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia to normal sinus rhythm. In the presence of atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, a transient modest slowing of ventricular response may occur immediately following adenosine administration.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115AenWH]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs frequently in patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White (WPW) syndrome, with a reported incidence of 9% to 38%. Previous studies have reported a decreased incidence of AF after the successful elimination of the accessory pathway (AP), indicating that the AP itself may play an important role in the initiation of AF. However, paroxysmal AF still frequently recurs in some patients with WPW syndrome despite successful AP elimination. The identification of patients at high risk for recurrence of AF is of clinical importance because additional therapeutic strategies are needed for these patients.

Interatrial block (IAB) denotes a conduction delay between the right and left atria that manifests in a 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as a P‐wave duration of > 120 ms. A prolonged P‐wave with biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads represents an even higher degree of IAB and has been referred to as advanced IAB. The appearance of advanced IAB is frequently associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias and has been found to predict AF in multiple clinical scenarios. However, the role of advanced IAB in predicting the recurrence of AF after AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome is unclear. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the clinical utility of advanced IAB for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation.

### Atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: ECG recognition and treatment in the ED [^116DiEyD]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Estimated to occur in 0.1% to 0.3% of the population, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is a condition where atrial impulses bypass the atrioventricular node and activate the ventricular myocardium directly via an accessory pathway. Clinical clues to the diagnosis include a young patient with previous episodes of palpitations, rapid heart rate, or syncope. Although several different rhythm presentations are possible, atrial fibrillation is a not infrequent dysrhythmia seen in the WPW patient. Electrocardiographic features suggestive of WPW atrial fibrillation include irregularity of the rhythm; a very rapid ventricular response; presence of a delta wave; and a wide, bizarre QRS complex. Stable patients suspected of having this condition should not receive agents that predominantly block atrioventricular conduction, but they may be treated with procainamide or ibutilide. If instability is present, electrical cardioversion is required.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^114YrSMx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The effects of procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide, recommended by the guideline or consensus, on preexcited atrial fibrillation have been reported by several investigators. Sellers et al. evaluated procainamide in 21 patients with preexcited atrial fibrillation. Boahene et al. evaluated procainamide in 30 patients and propafenone in 25 patients. Ludmer et al. evaluated propafenone in 10 patients, O'Nunain et al. evaluated propafenone and flecainide in 16 patients, and Glatter et al. evaluated ibutilide in 14 patients. All studies demonstrated the effectiveness of these four agents in preexcited atrial fibrillation, although with varying magnitudes of efficacy.

For example, Boahene et al. reported that propafenone prolonged the shortest preexcitation R-R interval (SPRR) from 215 ± 40 milliseconds to 415 ± 198 milliseconds (ΔSPRR 200 ms). Ludmer et al. showed a propafenone ΔSPRR of 75 milliseconds, whereas O'Nunain et al. reported a propafenone ΔSPRR of 37 milliseconds. These differences indicate significant heterogeneity among the studies. Factors contributing to this heterogeneity may include drug dose, infusion speed and duration, intrinsic effective refractory period (ERP) of antegrade accessory pathways (AP), as well as the patients' hemodynamic status, and their sympathetic and parasympathetic tone. The heterogeneity was more evident in smaller sample size studies.

Therefore, it is challenging to compare the effectiveness of nifekalant with other agents for treating preexcited atrial fibrillation. Randomized controlled studies with large samples would be valuable to determine the comparative effectiveness of these agents. A notable difference is that propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide could completely block the accessory pathway, whereas nifekalant did not completely block the accessory pathway in the present study.

### Adenosine [^111Nrk6i]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). Low credibility.

For rapid bolus intravenous use only, adenosine injection should be given as a rapid bolus by the peripheral intravenous route. To ensure the solution reaches the systemic circulation, it should be administered directly into a vein or, if given into an IV line, as close to the patient as possible followed by a rapid saline flush.

- **Adult patients**: The dose recommendation is based on clinical studies with peripheral venous bolus dosing. Central venous (CVP or other) administration of adenosine has not been systematically studied. The recommended intravenous doses for adults are as follows:
	- **Initial dose**: 6 mg given as a rapid intravenous bolus over a 1 to 2 second period.
	- **Repeat administration**: If the first dose does not eliminate the supraventricular tachycardia within 1 to 2 minutes, 12 mg should be given as a rapid intravenous bolus. This 12 mg dose may be repeated a second time if necessary.

- **Pediatric patients**: The dosages used in neonates, infants, children, and adolescents are similar to those administered to adults on a weight basis.
	- **Pediatric patients with a body weight < 50 kg**:
		- **Initial dose**: Administer 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg as a rapid IV bolus given either centrally or peripherally, followed by a saline flush.
		- **Repeat administration**: If conversion of PSVT does not occur within 1 to 2 minutes, additional bolus injections of adenosine can be administered at incrementally higher doses, increasing the amount by 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg. Follow each bolus with a saline flush.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115wfJJ7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019).

The entire process of electrophysiological (EP) studies in preexcited atrial fibrillation (AF) was recorded and analyzed. Consecutive R‐R intervals for one minute were measured before and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes from the onset of infusion. Additionally, the R‐R interval was recorded and analyzed one minute before the termination of AF. The EP parameters included the shortest preexcited R-R interval (SPRR), average preexcited R‐R interval (APRR), average R‐R interval (ARR), the ratio of preexcited QRS complexes to total ventricular complexes (percentage preexcitation, PP). Clinical outcomes assessed were heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP).

The EP parameters and clinical outcomes were compared during AF at baseline before drug infusion (baseline state) and after nifekalant infusion (during the infusion time of 7‐10 minutes, or one minute before termination of AF whenever cardioversion occurred before seven minutes). Further investigations included AF cardioversion, acceleration of preexcited ventricular responses, deterioration to syncope/cardiac arrest, and Torsades de Pointes (TdP).

### P wave signal-averaged electrocardiography predicts recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who underwent successful catheter ablation: a prospective study [^117B4cs6]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway eliminates PAF in some patients, but PAF frequently recurs in other patients. This study was designed to determine prospectively whether P wave signal-averaged electrocardiography (P-SAECG) predicts the recurrence of PAF after successful ablation in patients with WPW syndrome.

- **Methods and results**: Forty-six patients with WPW syndrome who had episodes of PAF were prospectively followed. SAECG recording was performed on day 7 after successful ablation of the accessory pathway at study entry. Abnormal P-SAECG for the prediction of recurrence of PAF was defined as a filtered P wave duration > 130 msec. Eleven patients had an abnormal P-SAECG (group 1), whereas 35 patients (group 2) did not. The two groups did not differ in terms of gender, age, left atrial dimension, and atrial vulnerability as determined by electrophysiologic study. During follow-up (40 ± 19 months), the recurrence of PAF was noted in 10 (91%) of 11 patients in group 1, whereas it was observed in only 2 (6%) of 35 patients in group 2. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the recurrence of PAF was significantly more frequent in group 1 than in group 2 (log rank test, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a filtered P wave duration > 130 msec was an independent predictor of recurrence of PAF after ablation (Chi-square = 21.5, P < 0.0001).

- **Conclusion**: The results of this study indicate that P-SAECG may be useful for identifying patients at risk for recurrence of PAF after catheter ablation in the context of WPW syndrome.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^114YuL7V]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to rhythm control and pharmacological cardioversion, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the "pill-in-the-pocket" approach. This involves a single oral dose of flecainide or propafenone, combined with an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent, for pharmacological cardioversion if previously tested in a monitored setting. This approach is suggested for patients experiencing recurrent atrial fibrillation outside the hospital.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116k1KWz]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically concerning rhythm control maintenance therapy, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend initiating dofetilide for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm. Proper dose selection should be based on kidney function, and close monitoring is essential. This includes monitoring the QT interval, serum potassium and magnesium concentrations, and kidney function in patients with AF who do not have significant baseline QT interval prolongation or uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia.

### Adenosine versus intravenous calcium channel antagonists for supraventricular tachycardia [^111dvrds]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

People with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) frequently are symptomatic and present to the emergency department for treatment. Although vagal maneuvers may terminate SVT, they often fail, and subsequently, adenosine or calcium channel antagonists (CCAs) are administered. Both are known to be effective, but both have a significant side effect profile. This is an update of a Cochrane review previously published in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To review all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare the effects of adenosine versus CCAs in terminating SVT.

- **Search methods**: We identified studies by searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registers in July 2017. We checked bibliographies of identified studies and applied no language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We planned to include all RCTs that compare adenosine versus a CCA for patients of any age presenting with SVT.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently checked results of searches to identify relevant studies and resolved differences by discussion with a third review author. At least two review authors independently assessed each included study and extracted study data. We entered extracted data into Review Manager 5. Primary outcomes were the rate of reversion to sinus rhythm and major adverse effects of adenosine and CCAs. Secondary outcomes were the rate of recurrence, time to reversion, and minor adverse outcomes. We measured outcomes by calculating odds ratios (ORs) and assessed the quality of primary outcomes using standard procedures.

### Adenosine [^115V8uTk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

In controlled studies conducted in the United States, bolus doses of 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg were examined. A cumulative 60% of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia converted to normal sinus rhythm within one minute after an intravenous bolus dose of 6 mg adenosine; some converted on 3 mg, and failures were given 6 mg. Additionally, a cumulative 92% converted following a bolus dose of 12 mg. In comparison, only 7% to 16% of patients converted after 1 to 4 placebo bolus injections. Similar responses were observed across various patient subsets, including those using or not using digoxin, those with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, and among different demographics such as males, females, blacks, Caucasians, and Hispanics.

Adenosine is not effective in converting arrhythmias other than paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia, to normal sinus rhythm.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^114xYpjb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

- **Electrophysiological findings**: The study examined the impact of nifekalant on patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation. It focused on electrophysiological characteristics, which help in understanding this group of patients.

- **Clinical findings**: Clinical data showed that the administration of nifekalant significantly altered the electrophysiological properties in patients, potentially contributing to its efficacy in managing the dual conditions.

Further investigations into the long-term benefits and potential side effects are warranted.

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: Resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^115qm9SR]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Low credibility.

Dissection of the right coronary artery (RCA) into the pyramidal space exposes the site of the accessory pathway.

- **Central message**: This article describes, in detail, the techniques of surgical ablation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Surgery is now rarely performed for this indication but may be necessary in refractory cases.

First performed by Sealy in 1968, surgical ablation of an accessory pathway was the gold standard for curative treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW). However, in the early 1990s, the safety and efficacy of catheter radiofrequency ablation replaced the surgical procedure. In most patients, catheter ablation provides a cure for WPW; however, in select, refractory cases, there is still a role for surgical intervention. Here, we present a case and the technical details for the surgical correction of WPW. Consent was obtained from the patient to publish the images and the data (IRB approval No. HM13607; July 29, 2013).

### Electrophysiologic profile and results of invasive risk stratification in asymptomatic children and adolescents with the Wolff-Parkinson-White electrocardiographic pattern [^112rkvvL]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2014). Low credibility.

Data on the results and clinical effects of an invasive risk stratification strategy in asymptomatic young patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White electrocardiographic pattern are scarce.

- **Methods and results**: Eighty-five consecutive patients aged < 18 years with a Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and persistent preexcitation at maximum exercise undergoing invasive risk stratification were retrospectively studied. Adverse accessory pathway (AP) properties were defined according to current consented criteria as any of the following: shortest preexcited RR interval during atrial fibrillation/rapid atrial pacing ≤ 250 ms (or antegrade effective refractory period ≤ 250 ms if shortest preexcited RR interval was not available) or inducible atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia. Age at evaluation was median 14.9 years. Eighty-two patients had a structurally normal heart, and 3 had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A single manifest AP was present in 80 patients, 1 manifest and 1 concealed AP in 4 patients, and 2 manifest APs in 1 patient. Adverse AP properties were present in 32 of 85 patients (37.6%) at baseline and in an additional 16 of 44 (36.4%) after isoproterenol. Ablation was performed in 41 of these 48 patients. Ablation was deferred in the remaining 7 due to pathway proximity to the atrioventricular node. Additionally, 18 of the low-risk patients were ablated based on patient/parental decision.

- **Conclusions**: Adverse AP properties at baseline were exhibited by 37.6% of the evaluated patients with asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White preexcitation persisting at peak exercise. Isoproterenol challenge testing resulted in further identification of risk.

### Management of asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern in young patients: Has anything changed [^115zVSLc]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The approach to pediatric asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) patients is controversial. The objective of this review is to update the last consensus of specialists from the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society/Heart Rhythm Society on this subject in order to summarize the most recent evidence on the management of young patients with asymptomatic WPW pattern.

A systematic review of the literature published between 2008 and 2018 was performed, taking into account the protocol of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) in PubMed (including Cochrane), Embase, and Web of Science. Observational, experimental, and multicentric studies were included. Out of a total of 37 articles selected, four were considered eligible. Most studies considered a cutoff age of 8 or greater as recommended in the 2012 consensus.

The identification of a shortest pre-excitatory RR interval (SPERRI) ≤ 250 ms seems to be the best predictor for risk stratification. The importance of routine isoprenaline use to improve the sensitivity of the electrophysiological study to identify patients at high risk of sudden death was consensual. Prophylactic ablative therapy has been indicated in asymptomatic children with an accessory pathway (AP) who have a low SPERRI and/or a low effective anterograde period of the AP and/or multiple APs. Despite the evidence found in the most recent studies, more studies are warranted in this setting.

### Differentiating fasciculoventricular pathway from Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome by electrocardiography [^116iHzEN]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Low credibility.

In school-based cardiovascular screening programs in Japan, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is diagnosed based on the presence of an electrocardiographic (ECG) delta wave without differentiation from the fasciculoventricular pathway (FVP), although the risk of sudden death is associated only with the former.

The purpose of this study was to differentiate FVP patients among children diagnosed with WPW syndrome by ECG. Children who were diagnosed with WPW syndrome through school screening between April 2006 and March 2008 and had QRS width ≤ 120 ms were included. Patients with asthma and/or coronary heart disease were excluded. FVP and WPW syndrome were differentiated based on ECG responses to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) injection. Age, PR interval, QRS width, and Rosenbaum classification were compared among patients.

Thirty patients (median age 12.7 years, range 6.5–15.7 years) participated in the study. FVP was diagnosed in 23 patients (76.7%), and WPW syndrome in 7 (23.3%). In Rosenbaum type A patients, all six patients had WPW syndrome, whereas FVP was diagnosed in 23 of 24, and WPW syndrome was diagnosed in 1 of 24 of type B patients. Age, PR interval, and QRS width were not significantly different between the two conditions.

The ATP stress test was reliable in differentiating FVP from WPW syndrome. Although FVP is considered rare, the results of our study indicate that many WPW syndrome patients with QRS width ≤ 120 ms may actually have FVP. Patients categorized as type B are more likely to have FVP, whereas type A.

### A novel technique for zero-fluoroscopy catheter ablation used to manage Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with a left-sided accessory pathway [^111CE84N]. Pediatric Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Conventional catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias is associated with the potential adverse effects of low-dose ionizing radiation on both patients and laboratory personnel. Due to the greater radiation sensitivity and the longer life expectancy of children, reducing radiation exposure for them is of particular importance. A novel technique for zero-fluoroscopy catheter ablation is described using real-time tissue-tip contact force measurements for a 10-year-old boy who had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with a left-sided accessory pathway.

### The 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Rhythm Society comprehensive guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation [^115YjCUR]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

The 2020 guidelines from the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and Canadian Heart Rhythm Society provide comprehensive management strategies for atrial fibrillation. In patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) and pre-excitation syndromes requiring rate control, the CCS/CHRS guidelines specifically recommend avoiding the use of atrioventricular nodal blocking agents, digitalis, and amiodarone in those with evidence of ventricular pre-excitation.

### Cardiovascular disease in the Young Council's Science and Clinical Education Lifelong Learning Committee: Year in review [^113bovY4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

This year, three articles have advanced our understanding of Wolf-Parkinson-White and Brugada syndromes. These articles challenge existing knowledge and provoke new thoughts about paradigms for the treatment and management of these diseases.

- **Challenging existing knowledge of Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome**:
	- Practice guidelines for the management of Wolf-Parkinson-White in children have largely been based on the assumption that the risk of sudden death is both predictable and ascertainable. A large retrospective multicenter international study of 912 children with Wolf-Parkinson-White provided evidence to suggest that, while the risk of sudden death in children remains low, the ability to identify those at highest risk remains difficult. These findings raise questions about future management recommendations and will likely affect the manner by which physicians counsel patients in the future.

- **Advancements in understanding Brugada syndrome**:
	- Brugada syndrome has classically been considered a primary ion channel disorder. Although small case studies had previously suggested ablation as a curative therapy, multiple studies this year provide further evidence that epicardial ablation may successfully treat ventricular arrhythmias associated with Brugada syndrome in symptomatic adults. While long-term follow-up following ablation is lacking and studies in children have not been performed, these preliminary results provide new insights into this disease. Regardless of whether ablation is found to be a treatment option for children with symptomatic Brugada syndrome, the manner in which we approach this disease and counsel patients regarding long-term management will likely evolve.

### Management of asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern by pediatric electrophysiologists [^114JrgTE]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

To determine the present-day approach of pediatric cardiac electrophysiologists to asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern, a questionnaire was sent to 266 Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society physician members in 25 countries. This study included 21 questions from a 2003 survey and added new questions about risk stratification and decision-making.

We received 113 responses from 13 countries, with respondents having a median of 15 years (IQR 8.5–25 years) of electrophysiology experience. Only 12 (11%) believed that intermittent pre-excitation and 37 (33%) that sudden loss of pre-excitation on exercise test were sufficient evidence of accessory pathway safety to avoid an invasive electrophysiology study. The optimal weight for electrophysiology study was considered to be 20 kg (IQR 18–22.5 kg). Furthermore, 61% and 58% of respondents indicated they would ablate all right-sided or left-sided accessory pathways, respectively, regardless of electrophysiological properties, while only 23% would ablate all septal accessory pathways (P < .001). Compared with 2003, respondents were more likely to consider inducible arrhythmia (77% vs. 26%, P < .001) as a sufficient indication alone for ablation.

Most operators are now performing electrophysiology studies for asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White irrespective of noninvasive findings. Many would then proceed to default ablation of all accessory pathways.

### Utility and safety of adenosine challenge for subtle ventricular pre-excitation in the pediatric population [^114Qvz7x]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Low credibility.

Adenosine challenge (AC) can be used to evaluate possible Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern on an electrocardiogram (ECG). Despite the use of this technique, there is a paucity of studies in the pediatric population evaluating the efficacy, safety, and outcomes of this testing modality.

- **Methods and results**: All ACs performed from January 2009 to June 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, adenosine dosing, results, adverse effects, and outcomes, including results of electrophysiology studies (EPS), were reviewed. Analysis was conducted between AC positive and negative cohorts. ECG criteria of shortest PR interval, longest QRS duration, and the number of suspected pre-excited leads were evaluated for inter-rater reliability and correlation to positive AC.

	- Fifty-six ACs (n = 51) were performed, with a median age of 13.8 years (range: 0.3–20 years). Forty-one ACs were pre-EPS and 15 post-EPS due to concern for reWPW. Of the pre-EPS ACs, 31 (76%) were negative, 9 (22%) positive, and 1 (2%) equivocal. EPS was performed following seven positive ACs, revealing 5 (71%) left posterior and 2 (29%) right posteroseptal AP. The 15 post-EPS AC were all found to be negative. The mean effective adenosine dose was 0.2 ± 0.11 mg/kg. No adverse events were reported. The mean follow-up duration after AC was 314 ± 482 days with no documented arrhythmias.

- **Conclusion**: Adenosine challenge is an effective and safe testing modality for subtle WPW in the pediatric population. In our study population, there were no adverse events or documented arrhythmias in patients following a negative study.

### Paces/HRS expert consensus statement on the management of the asymptomatic young patient with a Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW, ventricular preexcitation) electrocardiographic pattern: Developed in partnership between the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS). Endorsed by the governing bodies of PACES, HRS, the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF), the American Heart Association (AHA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society (CHRS) [^116pkzw8]. Heart Rhythm (2012). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, specifically in relation to catheter ablation, the HRS/PACES 2012 guidelines recommend considering ablation in asymptomatic patients with a WPW ECG pattern and ventricular dysfunction secondary to dyssynchronous contractions, regardless of the anterograde characteristics of the bypass tract.

### Thyroid storm in a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^115AateQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 44-year-old woman with no medical history presented to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of sudden onset chest pressure, palpitations, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath. She reported a 90-pound unintentional weight loss, increased appetite, irritability, night sweats, and palpitations for 2 months. Physical examination revealed a heart rate (HR) of 269 bpm and a blood pressure of 116/94 mm Hg. Her ECG revealed a wide-complex tachycardia with right bundle branch morphology and an HR of 265 bpm. Intravenous adenosine was administered with resolution of the arrhythmia and symptoms. Her subsequent ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with δ waves, which was consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Laboratory findings confirmed thyroid storm, and treatment began with intravenous hydrocortisone, methimazole, metoprolol, amiodarone, and iodine drops. Graves' disease was confirmed based on the presence of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibody. The patient underwent successful WPW accessory tract ablation 6 weeks after initial presentation.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: Electrophysiological and clinical findings [^115gQTAx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Nifekalant, initially named MS-551 in Japan, is a pure class 3 antiarrhythmic drug that is highly selective for blocking the rapid component of the delayed-rectifier potassium currents without affecting the inward sodium and calcium currents or β-adrenergic activity. Nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period (ERP) of ventricular and atrial myocytes, exerts antiarrhythmic effects, and decreases the defibrillation threshold. Increasing clinical data indicate that nifekalant is an effective and safe drug in the treatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients with ILVF. Nifekalant is also recommended by the European Resuscitation Council Guidelines and the International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. More recently, nifekalant has been used in the treatment of atrial arrhythmia and cardioversion of AF and atrial flutter. However, the potential utility of nifekalant in the treatment of preexcited AF has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the electrophysiological and clinical effects of nifekalant in patients with preexcited AF.

### Malignant vasovagal syndrome in two patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^117Uv3Wk]. Heart (2004). Low credibility.

The presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in patients presenting with syncope suggests that tachyarrhythmia may be the cause; however, the symptoms require careful evaluation. Two young patients presented with syncope and were found to have WPW syndrome on their ECG. In both patients, symptoms were suggestive of vasovagal syncope. During tilt testing, both patients developed their typical symptoms along with a fall in blood pressure and heart rate, confirming the diagnosis of malignant vasovagal syndrome.
