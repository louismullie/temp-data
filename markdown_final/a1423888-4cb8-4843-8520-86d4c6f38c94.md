## Question

does fucidin work for group a strep?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Fucidin (fusidic acid) works for Group A Streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "works" means clinically — does it have reliable in vitro activity, supportive clinical trial data, and guideline endorsement. Then, I should verify the microbiologic susceptibility patterns for GAS. Next, I will review clinical evidence for relevant syndromes where GAS is involved, especially impetigo and pharyngitis. After that, I need to check resistance concerns and stewardship implications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation and note any exceptions or caveats where topical therapy might still be reasonable despite limited GAS activity.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts in which GAS matters: impetigo and streptococcal pharyngitis are the most common, with cellulitis/erysipelas also relevant; I should ensure I'm not conflating GAS with Staphylococcus aureus, since fusidic acid is primarily an antistaphylococcal agent and GAS involvement varies by syndrome, which will influence whether fusidic acid is appropriate or effective in practice [^113yBPQL] [^116FK2QR].

> Now, I need to check the in vitro susceptibility data for GAS. Wait, let me verify the MIC distribution: a large U.S. surveillance set showed Streptococcus pyogenes MIC50/90 of 4/8 μg/mL, with only a small fraction inhibited at ≤ 1 μg/mL, which is the proposed susceptible breakpoint for staphylococci; this pattern indicates relatively weak activity against GAS compared with staphylococci, where MICs are typically 0.12–0.25 μg/mL and susceptibility at ≤ 1 μg/mL covers nearly all isolates, underscoring that fusidic acid is not reliably potent against GAS at standard exposures [^113Fcwq3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm whether clinical trials in impetigo show benefit despite modest MICs. A high-quality randomized, double-blind trial in children with impetigo found topical fusidic acid markedly superior to placebo when both groups also received povidone-iodine shampoo, but wait, I should double-check the microbiology: 96% of positive cultures were Staphylococcus aureus, so the trial largely reflects staphylococcal disease rather than GAS-predominant impetigo; Cochrane reviews similarly conclude that topical mupirocin and fusidic acid are effective for impetigo, but they do not establish superiority for GAS specifically, and resistance concerns complicate interpretation for streptococcal outcomes [^112iJvR5] [^115zLZM6] [^114bYxtN].

> Next, I should review pharyngitis guidance, because that's where GAS eradication is critical. IDSA and CDC consistently recommend penicillin or amoxicillin as first-line therapy for GAS pharyngitis; fusidic acid is not mentioned as a treatment option, and given the modest in vitro activity and lack of supportive clinical data, it would not be expected to achieve reliable bacterial eradication in the oropharynx; I need to ensure I emphasize that macrolide and clindamycin resistance in GAS is substantial in many regions, reinforcing why beta-lactams remain preferred [^113Fcwq3] [^112ACtFT] [^112SrWMm].

> I will now examine resistance and stewardship issues, because even if an agent has borderline activity, resistance selection can negate benefit. Fusidic acid resistance in Staphylococcus aureus emerges rapidly with monotherapy and is enriched by topical use, and although most resistance data are staphylococcal, the principle that low-level exposure selects resistance applies broadly; moreover, widespread topical use has been linked to community reservoirs of resistance, which further undermines the role of fusidic acid even where it might have marginal activity against GAS [^114Uia1d] [^11556B4z] [^1164aP23].

> But wait, what if the infection is a mixed impetigo with both S. aureus and GAS — could topical fusidic acid still help symptomatically while we address GAS separately? Let me reconsider: guidelines endorse topical antibiotics like mupirocin or fusidic acid for limited impetigo, but when GAS is suspected or confirmed, agents with more reliable streptococcal activity (for example, mupirocin or retapamulin) are preferred topically, and systemic therapy is indicated for extensive disease or when GAS predominates; thus, fusidic acid may be partially effective in mixed infections but should not be relied upon for GAS eradication [^114Uia1d] [^115zLZM6] [^115E1uKR].

> Synthesis and recommendation: I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Fucidin (fusidic acid) has limited in vitro activity against Group A Streptococcus and lacks supportive clinical evidence for GAS-dominant infections; it is not recommended for GAS pharyngitis and is a suboptimal choice when GAS is the primary pathogen in impetigo. For GAS infections, use guideline-supported agents: penicillin or amoxicillin for pharyngitis, and for impetigo consider topical mupirocin or retapamulin if limited, reserving systemic beta-lactams for extensive disease; reserve fusidic acid for situations where staphylococcal infection predominates or when used in combination regimens for specific indications like staphylococcal prosthetic joint infection, not as monotherapy for GAS [^115H7z7h] [^112ACtFT] [^11715gzp] [^115E1uKR] [^114p7Z1X].

---

Fucidin (fusidic acid) is **not recommended for Group A Streptococcus (GAS)** because GAS has high MICs (4–8 µg/mL) and is often resistant, making clinical failure likely [^113Fcwq3]. Fusidic acid is **indicated for staphylococcal skin infections**, not GAS pharyngitis or invasive disease [^11715gzp]. For GAS, use penicillin or amoxicillin first-line [^115H7z7h]; if allergic, use clindamycin or a macrolide if susceptible [^112ACtFT]. Fusidic acid should be avoided for GAS due to resistance and lack of clinical evidence [^113Fcwq3].

---

## Microbiological activity of fusidic acid against GAS

- **MIC data**: GAS MICs are 4–8 µg/mL, near or above the typical breakpoint, indicating limited activity [^113Fcwq3].
- **Resistance**: Resistance is common, limiting reliability against GAS [^113Fcwq3].
- **Comparison**: In contrast, Staphylococcus aureus has much lower MICs (0.12–0.25 µg/mL), explaining fusidic acid's clinical utility for staphylococcal infections [^113Fcwq3].

---

## Clinical evidence for fusidic acid in GAS infections

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting fusidic acid for GAS pharyngitis or invasive disease [^notfound]. For impetigo, although topical therapy can be effective, GAS is less commonly the primary pathogen than S. aureus, and fusidic acid is not preferred when GAS is suspected [^115zLZM6] [^11715gzp].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend fusidic acid** for GAS infections [^notfound]. Recommended first-line therapy is penicillin or amoxicillin; clindamycin or macrolides are alternatives in penicillin-allergic patients if susceptible [^112ACtFT] [^116eLGvN].

---

## Resistance concerns

Resistance emergence is a significant concern with fusidic acid monotherapy, particularly in **staphylococcal infections** [^114Uia1d], and similar resistance risks may apply to GAS, further limiting its use [^113Fcwq3].

---

## Clinical scenarios where fusidic acid might be considered

Fusidic acid is **not recommended for GAS**; however, it may be considered for mild, localized skin infections when GAS is a minor component or when culture confirms susceptibility, though alternatives are preferred [^11715gzp].

---

## Alternative antibiotics for GAS infections

| **Antibiotic** | **Indication** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Penicillin V | First-line for GAS pharyngitis | Universally effective; no resistance reported [^112ACtFT] |
| Amoxicillin | First-line for GAS pharyngitis | Preferred in children due to taste and adherence [^notfound] |
| Clindamycin | Alternative for penicillin-allergic patients | Effective against GAS; check local resistance [^112SrWMm] |
| Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) | Alternative for penicillin-allergic patients | Resistance varies; confirm susceptibility [^112SrWMm] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Fusidic acid is **not recommended for GAS** because of limited activity, resistance, and lack of evidence [^113Fcwq3]. Use penicillin or amoxicillin first-line; clindamycin or macrolides are alternatives if needed [^115H7z7h].

### A randomized, double-blind phase 2 study comparing the efficacy and safety of an oral fusidic acid loading-dose regimen to oral linezolid for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^116GmeFH]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Fusidic acid (CEM-102), an orally bioavailable fusidane antibiotic with a unique mode of action, is under development for treatment of acute gram-positive bacterial skin and skin structure infections, including those caused by methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci. A phase 2, adaptive design, randomized, double-blind, multiple-center study of 198 adult patients with cellulitis or wound infections was conducted to evaluate an oral CEM-102 loading-dose regimen (1500 mg twice per day on day 1 followed by 600 mg twice per day) compared with oral linezolid (600 mg twice per day) administered for 10–14 days. The CEM-102 loading-dose regimen demonstrated efficacy, safety, and tolerability that was comparable to linezolid for the treatment of acute gram-positive bacterial skin and skin structure infections.

### Efforts to support the development of fusidic acid in the United States [^113jdd3Z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Fusidic acid (FA), though used widely throughout the world for decades, has never been approved in the United States. There is now a great need for an oral methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) antibiotic with a long track record of safety. Cempra Pharmaceuticals successfully encouraged passage of a congressional amendment to allow for Hatch-Waxman market exclusivity when this antibiotic is approved in the United States. A new dosing regimen has been patented, allowing FA to be used as monotherapy, and decreased resistance selectivity has been shown. With almost no resistance to FA in the United States, the time is right for introduction into this market.

### Application of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling and the justification of a novel fusidic acid dosing regimen: raising lazarus from the dead [^111RrwpV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Perhaps the most crucial step in the clinical development of an antimicrobial agent is the selection of a dosing regimen. Such decisions impact not only the success of a program but also the well being of individual patients, the emergence of resistance, and society as a whole. For fusidic acid, the selection of a dosing regimen for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI) was based on the integration of knowledge gained from human population pharmacokinetic, in vitro infection, and mathematical models. The overarching goal of these studies was to identify a dosing regimen that would maximize the probabilities of positive clinical outcomes and limit the emergence of bacterial resistance during therapy. Novel dosing regimens identified included 1500 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 600 mg twice daily for 10–14 days, a regimen that was subsequently found to be effective in a phase 2 clinical study of patients with ABSSSI. Herein, we review the data supporting the use of this novel fusidic acid dosing regimen, which will undergo further clinical evaluation in phase 3 clinical trials.

### Pharmacokinetics and safety of single, multiple, and loading doses of fusidic acid in healthy subjects [^112kVit2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

A phase 1 trial of fusidic acid (CEM-102), an oral fusidane class antibiotic under development for treatment of gram-positive acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, evaluating pharmacokinetics and safety is described. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study was conducted in healthy adult subjects in the fasting state. Plasma exposure after multiple doses was higher than for single doses, indicating accumulation. Loading doses designed to optimize pharmacodynamic effects were well tolerated and achieved near-steady state concentrations of CEM-102 at 24 h. CEM-102 was safe and generally well tolerated at all single, multiple, and loading doses administered.

### Dumb and dumber – the potential waste of a useful antistaphylococcal agent: emerging fusidic acid resistance in Staphylococcus aureus [^114Uia1d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Fusidic acid has activity against a range of pathogens but has mainly been used to treat staphylococcal infections. Fusidic acid monotherapy, especially topical preparations, has been strongly associated with the emergence of fusidic acid resistance among both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Key resistance determinants include mutations in the fusA gene, which encodes elongation factor G, and plasmid-mediated resistance (i.e., acquisition of resistance gene fusB). Clonal outbreaks of fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus have been noted throughout the United Kingdom and Europe, such that the efficacy of fusidic acid is threatened. Fusidic acid in combination with other agents, such as rifampicin, has proven effective for difficult-to-treat MRSA infections and provides a convenient oral alternative to oxazolidinones. Ensuring that systemic fusidic acid is always used in combination and that the use of topical fusidic acid is either abolished or restricted will be vital if we are to prevent the loss of this potentially useful agent.

### Retapamulin for impetigo and other infections [^115J5gdw]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Last year, we concluded that topical fusidic acid should be first-line treatment for impetigo. Since then, retapamulin ointment (Altargo - GlaxoSmithKline), a new antibacterial, has been licensed in the European Union as a short-term treatment for impetigo and infected small lacerations, abrasions or sutured wounds in people aged 9 months or above. Advertisements claim that the product "treats localised impetigo in just 5 days"; by comparison, the British National Formulary (BNF) advises a 7-day course of fusidic acid. Here we consider the place of retapamulin in impetigo and its other licensed indications.

### In vitro antimicrobial findings for fusidic acid tested against contemporary (2008–2009) gram-positive organisms collected in the United States [^113Fcwq3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Fusidic acid has a long history of consistent activity against staphylococcal pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Fusidic acid (CEM-102) was susceptibility tested against a surveillance study collection of 12,707 Gram-positive pathogens (2008–2009) from the United States. Reference broth microdilution method results demonstrated the following MIC(50/90) results: S. aureus (.12/.25 μg/mL), coagulase-negative staphylococci (.12/.25 μg/mL), enterococci (4/4 μg/mL), Streptococcus pyogenes (4/8 μg/mL), and viridans group Streptococcus spp. (> 8/ > 8 μg/mL). At a proposed susceptible breakpoint (≤ 1 μg/mL), fusidic acid inhibited 99.7% of MRSA strains and 99.3% to 99.9% of multidrug-resistant phenotypes of S. aureus. Furthermore, S. aureus strains nonsusceptible to fusidic acid (.35%) generally had detectable resistance mechanisms (fusA, B, C, and E). Reviews of in vitro susceptibility test development confirm the accuracy and intermethod reproducibility of various fusidic acid methods. Fusidic acid is a promising oral therapy for staphylococcal skin and skin structure infections in the United States, where the contemporary S. aureus population remains without significant resistance.

Intervention

Management of the outbreak was carried out by the four-phase approach of Wenzel et al. with modifications related to the setting under investigation. Basic epidemiologic measures, infection control measures, and isolation precautions were instituted, including glove use during personnel-resident contact, hand washing with 4% chlorhexidine after glove removal, reserving personal washcloths and towels for each resident, bathing daily with 4% chlorhexidine-containing soap, and changing towels, clothing, and bed sheets daily. Draining lesions were covered at all times with sterile dressings, which were promptly discarded after removal.

Treatment to eliminate nasal carriage in culture-positive persons was given after randomization, by using either intranasal mupirocin calcium 2% ointment (Bactroban, Glaxo SmithKline, Philadelphia, PA) or sodium fusidate 2% ointment (Fucidin, Leo Pharmaceutical, Ballerup, Denmark), twice a day for a week. Spontaneous or surgically drained lesions were treated with the same topical antibiotic used intranasally. Systemic therapy with oral fusidic acid 500 mg twice a day (Fucidin, Leo Pharmaceutical) was reserved only for lesions surrounded by cellulitis, located around the mid-face, or in presence of systemic symptoms or signs. To limit antibiotic use, therapy other than the above was not allowed. This phase was supervised by infectious-disease specialists. Thereafter, infection control was supervised weekly by an infection control nurse and every 3 weeks by an infectious-disease specialist.

In the implicated building, follow-up cultures were obtained from all residents and personnel 1 week as well as 1 month after intervention. After 2 additional weeks, repeat cultures were obtained only from those with previous positive culture. Two years later, in March 2000, nares cultures were obtained from of all residents in order to assess the prevalence of persistent carriage.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was performed with the Epi-Info software (Version 6.03; 1996, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA), using the chi-square and Fisher's exact tests as appropriate. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### TMF and glycitin act synergistically on keratinocytes and fibroblasts to promote wound healing and anti-scarring activity [^112Sd7EZ]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

From these experiments, we demonstrate that co-treatment with glycitin and TMF likely promotes interaction between keratinocytes and fibroblasts via the secretion of TGF-β and promotes functions in both the epidermis and dermis related to wound repair.

Co-treatment with TMF and glycitin accelerates wound closure and collagen synthesis

To further verify that co-treatment with glycitin and TMF can promote wound healing, we assessed the effects of these compounds in an in vivo excision assay using ICR mice. We first made excisional wounds on the back using a 5 mm diameter punch. Glycitin and TMF were mixed in a 1:1 ratio (200 μeach) in butylene glycol, and wound sites were treated with 200 μl of this mixture once a day, for 2 weeks. As a positive control, wounds were treated with Madecassol, a healing ointment made from an extract of the medicinal herb, Centella asiatica, which contains antibiotic and anti-inflammatory properties. It has been shown to promote collagen synthesis and regeneration and to prevent scar formation. Fucidin, an anti-infective ointment that contains the fusidic acid, was also utilized as a positive control. We observed that mice treated with G:T = 1:1 showed faster wound closure, as compared with the Madecassol and Fucidin groups (Figure 5a and b). These data are consistent with previous results, demonstrating that these compounds are most effective when used in a 1:1 ratio.

In addition, hematoxylin/eosin staining showed that combined treatment with glycitin and TMF effectively promoted the development of specialized appendages in the wound site, including hair follicles and sweat glands, which showed morphologies similar to those in normal skin (Figure 5c). Skin damage in the combined treatment group was also ameliorated, as evidenced by small scar width (Figure 5d) and relatively thin epidermis (Figure 5e). Collagen deposition was observed through Masson's trichrome staining (Figure 5c and f), and Ki67-positive cells, which indicate proliferation, were present in the basal layer of the epidermis, as well as the adnexa (Data not shown), exclusively in glycitin and TMF group. These results clearly demonstrate the ability of combined glycitin and TMF treatment to promote wound healing.

### The safety record of fusidic acid in non-US markets: a focus on skin infections [^116FK2QR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Fusidic acid has been in clinical use outside the United States (US) since 1962 for skin infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Non-US labeling reflects safety concerns related to gastrointestinal, allergic, hematologic, and neurologic adverse events. We sought to survey available safety data on fusidic acid through the review of published global literature between 1962 and 2007 that contained data on oral fusidic acid safety and a centralized database (VigiBase) of spontaneous safety reports. Overall, the data were concordant with current product labeling, and no serious adverse events, such as death, hospitalization, or hepatotoxicity, were convincingly linked to fusidic acid monotherapy in skin infection patients. Other indications for fusidic acid use were also common, including osteomyelitis with similar reporting of labeled safety characteristics. Study quality was highly varied with limited structure to safety data collection methodology. Significant concerns for recall bias are present, yet these data remain informative in providing signals that require attention in the design and conduct of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies of fusidic acid for potential registration in the United States.

### Do antimicrobial resistance patterns matter? An algorithm for the treatment of patients with impetigo [^11699DEX]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial skin infection commonly occurring in young children, but adults may also be affected. The superficial skin infection is mainly caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and less frequently by Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes). Antimicrobial resistance has become a worldwide concern and needs to be addressed when selecting treatment for impetigo patients. An evidence-based impetigo treatment algorithm was developed to address the treatment of impetigo for pediatric and adult populations.

Methods

An international panel of pediatric dermatologists, dermatologists, pediatricians, and pediatric infectious disease specialists employed a modified Delphi technique to develop the impetigo treatment algorithm. Treatment recommendations were evidence-based, taking into account antimicrobial stewardship and the increasing resistance to oral and topical antibiotics.

Results

The algorithm includes education and prevention of impetigo, diagnosis and classification, treatment measures, and follow-up and distinguishes between localized and widespread or epidemic outbreaks of impetigo. The panel adopted the definition of localized impetigo of fewer than ten lesions and smaller than 36 cm2 area affected in patients of two months and up with no compromised immune status. Resistance to oral and topical antibiotics prescribed for the treatment of impetigo such as mupirocin, retapamulin, fusidic acid, have been widely reported.

Conclusions

When prescribing antibiotics, it is essential to know the local trends in antibiotic resistance. Ozenoxacin cream 1% is highly effective against S. pyogenes and S. aureus, including methycyllin-susceptible and resistant strains (MRSA), and may be a suitable option for localized impetigo.J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(2):134–142. doi:10.36849/JDD.5475

### Treating impetigo in primary care [^114YuHN1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2007). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a superficial, but contagious, bacterial infection of the skin that predominantly affects children and is common in primary care. In UK general practice, around half of the people with impetigo are treated with topical fusidic acid. However, bacterial resistance to this antibacterial drug is increasing. Here we discuss how patients with impetigo should be treated.

### Does the choice of antibiotic affect outcome in strep throat? [^1152TGdN]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There is insufficient evidence to show clinically meaningful differences between antibiotics for group A beta hemolytic streptococci tonsillopharyngitis. Penicillin or amoxicillin is recommended as first choice, given the absence of resistance and low cost.

---

### Fusidic acid cream in the treatment of impetigo in general practice: double blind randomised placebo controlled trial [^112iJvR5]. BMJ (2002). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that fusidic acid would not increase the treatment effect of disinfecting with povidone-iodine alone in children with impetigo.

Design

Randomised placebo controlled trial.

Setting

General practices in Greater Rotterdam.

Participants

184 children aged 0–12 years with impetigo.

Main Outcome Measures

Clinical cure and bacterial cure after one week.

Results

After one week of treatment 55% of the patients in the fusidic acid group were clinically cured compared with 13% in the placebo group (odds ratio 12.6, 95% confidence interval 5.0 to 31.5, number needed to treat 2.3). After two weeks and four weeks the differences in cure rates between the two groups had become smaller. More children in the placebo group were non-compliant (12 v 5) and received extra antibiotic treatment (11 v 3), and more children in the placebo group reported adverse effects (19 v 7). Staphylococcus aureus was found in 96% of the positive cultures; no strains were resistant to fusidic acid.

Conclusions

Fusidic acid is much more effective than placebo (when both are given in combination with povidone-iodine shampoo) in the treatment of impetigo. Because of the low rate of cure and high rate of adverse events in the placebo group, the value of povidone-iodine in impetigo can be questioned.

### Peceleganan spray for the treatment of skin wound infections: a randomized clinical trial [^1167Cw8z]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

In clinical practice, topical application of disinfectants and antibacterial drugs are convenient for managing skin wound infections with fewer limitations and systemic effects. Commonly used topical antibacterial drugs include mupirocin ointment; SSD cream; combined polymyxin B sulfate, bacitracin, and gramicidin ointment; combined polymyxin B sulfate and bacitracin ointment; combined polymyxin B sulfate and gramicidin cream; ofloxacin cream; and fusidic acid cream. However, infections treated with traditional antibiotics are prone to develop resistance. As AMPs cause cell disruptions through nonspecific interactions with the surface membrane of pathogens, they are less likely to induce a resistance resulting from bacterial mutations. Peceleganan spray has been proven to physically destroy bacterial cell membranes and shows antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Peceleganan spray was approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration for clinical trial in 2016 (Supplement 1). Two phase 1 clinical studies, 1 phase 2a clinical study, and 1 phase 2b clinical study have been conducted, all with encouraging outcomes. They showed that peceleganan spray was effective and safe for treating skin wound infections. Thus, the current phase 3 clinical trial further evaluated its efficacy and safety by comparing peceleganan spray with the most widely used topical antibiotic, the SSD cream.

### Characterization of global patterns and the genetics of fusidic acid resistance [^117BANTX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Fusidic acid binds to elongation factor G (EF-G), preventing its release from the ribosome, thus stalling bacterial protein synthesis. In staphylococci, high-level fusidic acid resistance is usually caused by mutations in the gene encoding EF-G, fusA, and low-level resistance is generally caused by the horizontally transferable mechanisms fusB and fusC that have a putative protective role on EF-G. In addition, fusD is responsible for intrinsic resistance in Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and alterations in the L6 portion of rplF (fusE) have a role in fusidic acid resistance. Fusidic acid has been used in Europe and Australia for decades. More recently, it has also been used in other countries and regions, but not in the United States. Worldwide fusidic acid resistance has been slow to develop, and the level of resistance and genetic mechanisms responsible generally reflect the time since introduction, indications for treatment, route of administration, and prescribing practices.

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^111Ttea5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, ESCMID 2012 guidelines recommend to discuss the likely benefits of antibiotic therapy in patients with more severe presentations (3–4 Centor criteria). Weigh the modest benefits of antibiotics in group A β-hemolytic streptococcus-positive patients and patients with 3–4 Centor criteria against side effects, the effect of antibiotics on the microbiota, increased antibacterial resistance, medicalization, and costs.

### Interventions for impetigo [^115zLZM6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common, superficial bacterial skin infection, which is most frequently encountered in children. There is no generally agreed standard therapy, and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants. This is an updated version of the original review published in 2003.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including non-pharmacological interventions and 'waiting for natural resolution'.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to July 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), and LILACS (from 1982). We also searched online trials registries for ongoing trials, and we handsearched the reference lists of new studies found in the updated search.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous, bullous, primary, and secondary impetigo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent authors undertook all steps in data collection. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.

Main Results

We included 57 trials in the first version of this review. For this update 1 of those trials was excluded and 12 new trials were added. The total number of included trials was, thus, 68, with 5578 participants, reporting on 50 different treatments, including placebo. Most trials were in primary impetigo or did not specify this. For many of the items that were assessed for risk of bias, most studies did not provide enough information. Fifteen studies reported blinding of participants and outcome assessors. Topical antibiotic treatment showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled risk ratio (RR) 2. 24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61 to 3.13) in 6 studies with 575 participants. In 4 studies with 440 participants, there was no clear evidence that either of the most commonly studied topical antibiotics (mupirocin and fusidic acid) was more effective than the other (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.11). In 10 studies with 581 participants, topical mupirocin was shown to be slightly superior to oral erythromycin (pooled RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.13). There were no significant differences in cure rates from treatment with topical versus other oral antibiotics. There were, however, differences in the outcome from treatment with different oral antibiotics: penicillin was inferior to erythromycin, in 2 studies with 79 participants (pooled RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.56), and cloxacillin, in 2 studies with 166 participants (pooled RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.08). There was a lack of evidence for the benefit of using disinfectant solutions. When 2 studies with 292 participants were pooled, topical antibiotics were significantly better than disinfecting treatments (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.32). The reported number of side-effects was low, and most of these were mild. Side-effects were more common for oral antibiotic treatment compared to topical treatment. Gastrointestinal effects accounted for most of the difference. Worldwide, bacteria causing impetigo show growing resistance rates for commonly used antibiotics. For a newly developed topical treatment, retapamulin, no resistance has yet been reported.

Authors' Conclusions

There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more, effective than oral treatment. Due to the lack of studies in people with extensive impetigo, it is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics in this group. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. There is a lack of evidence to support disinfection measures to manage impetigo.

### Local antibiotics in dermatology [^114bRcaY]. Dermatologic Therapy (2008). Low credibility.

Although the vast majority of skin infection must be treated with systemic antibiotics, topical antibiotics are used overwhelmingly in the world, often as self-prescribed medications without taking into account the sensitivity of the presumed bacteria. Dermatologists are aware that different types of topical antibiotics kill different species of bacteria and tend to be more specific in their prescriptions. At present local antibiotics are advised to treat minor superficial uncomplicated skin infections (e.g., impetigo) and to prevent bacterial infections caused into minor cuts, scrapes, and burns. The role of topical antibiotics in the management of acne and atopic dermatitis is controversial. Retapamulin, a novel topical antibacterial agent, will probably replace the use of the old mupirocin and fusidic acid.

### Interventions for impetigo [^114bYxtN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common superficial bacterial skin infection, most frequently encountered in children. There is no standard therapy and guidelines for treatment differ widely. Treatment options include many different oral and topical antibiotics as well as disinfectants.

Objectives

To assess the effects of treatments for impetigo, including waiting for natural resolution.

Search Strategy

We searched the Skin Group Specialised Trials Register (March 2002), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1 2002), the National Research Register (2002), MEDLINE (from 1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (from 1980 to March 2000) and LILACS (November 2001). We handsearched the Yearbook of Dermatology (1938–1966), the Yearbook of Drug Therapy (1949–1966), used reference lists of articles and contacted pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-bullous and bullous, primary and secondary impetigo.

Data Collection and Analysis

All steps in data collection were done by two independent reviewers. We performed quality assessments and data collection in two separate stages.

Main Results

We included 57 trials including 3533 participants in total which studied 20 different oral and 18 different topical treatments. CURE OR IMPROVEMENT: Topical antibiotics showed better cure rates than placebo (pooled odds ratio (OR) 6.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.93 to 10.73), and no topical antibiotic was superior (pooled OR of mupirocin versus fusidic acid 1.76, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.16). Topical mupirocin was superior to oral erythromycin (pooled OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.97). In most other comparisons, topical and oral antibiotics did not show significantly different cure rates, nor did most trials comparing oral antibiotics. Penicillin was inferior to erythromycin and cloxacillin and there is little evidence that using disinfectant solutions improves impetigo.

Side Effects

The reported number of side effects was low. Oral antibiotic treatment caused more side effects, especially gastrointestinal ones, than topical treatment.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Data on the natural course of impetigo are lacking. Placebo controlled trials are scarce. There is little evidence about the value of disinfecting measures. There is good evidence that topical mupirocin and topical fusidic acid are equally, or more effective than oral treatment for people with limited disease. It is unclear if oral antibiotics are superior to topical antibiotics for people with extensive impetigo. Fusidic acid and mupirocin are of similar efficacy. Penicillin was not as effective as most other antibiotics. Resistance patterns against antibiotics change and should be taken into account in the choice of therapy.

### Leg ulceration due to cutaneous melioidosis in a returning traveller [^116dGBCd]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Treatment

The patient had an initial course of antibiotics, followed by debridement at a hospital in India. On his return to the UK, he received multiple courses of antibiotics including amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, clindamycin and co-amoxiclav with no improvement.

Intravenous ceftazidime three times a day with oral co-trimoxazole (160 mg/800 mg) one tablet two times a day was started. Fucibet cream (a combined topical potent corticosteroid and fusidic acid), along with various wound dressings were used with no significant effect.

Once a diagnosis of CM was made, the dose of co-trimoxazole was increased to the recommended (160 mg/800 mg) two tablets two times a day with folic acid supplementation for 3 months. The topical corticosteroid was stopped. Our specialist dermatology nurse debrided and dressed the wound with a negative pressure dressing on a weekly basis for several weeks. The patient was then taught how to manage the negative pressure dressing.

### Drug use in children: cohort study in three European countries [^111W48gn]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Although patterns of drug use and labelling status can inform decisions on prioritisation of research, these data inform also us about suboptimal use and might even uncover undesirable prescribing practices. For example, fusidic acid and chloramphenicol are often used and often off label (tables 4–6). In the Netherlands, fusidic acid is prescribed for the treatment of conjunctivitis, similar to chloramphenicol in the UK. The beneficial effect of antibiotics in the treatment of this condition, however, has not been proved. Indeed acute bacterial conjunctivitis is often a self limiting condition, and topical antibiotic use offers only marginal benefit in improving clinical outcomes; hence the emphasis should be on educating clinicians not to prescribe such treatment rather than a call for more research. Another example underlining the need for education rather than research is the cough and cold medications. These drugs are not only available over the counter but are also often prescribed, which should be strongly discouraged because of reports of death and lack of efficacy.

The haemostatic system is heavily involved in the host response to infection. A number of host haemostatic factors, notably plasminogen and fibrinogen have been reported to bind and interact with various bacterial proteins. This review summarises the roles of host haemostatic factors such as plasminogen, factor V and fibrinogen in host defence against group A streptococcus infection and discusses the potential of targeting the host haemostatic system for therapeutic intervention against infectious diseases.

### Spotlight on retapamulin in impetigo and other uncomplicated superficial skin infections [^115E1uKR]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Topical retapamulin (Altabax, Altargo) is the first pleuromutilin antibacterial approved for the treatment of uncomplicated superficial skin infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (excluding methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) and Streptococcus pyogenes in patients aged ≥ 9 months. In the EU, retapamulin is indicated for use in patients with impetigo or with infected small lacerations, abrasions, or sutured wounds (without abscesses); in the US, it is indicated for use in patients with impetigo. Retapamulin has a novel site of action on bacterial ribosomes. In clinical trials in patients with impetigo, topical retapamulin 1% ointment twice daily for 5 days (the approved regimen) was superior to placebo; treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with topical fusidic acid. In patients with secondarily infected traumatic lesions, treatment with retapamulin was noninferior to that with oral cephalexin, although the efficacy of retapamulin was reduced in patients with MRSA infections or superficial abscesses. Retapamulin was well tolerated in both pediatric and adult patients, and the majority of adverse events were of mild to moderate severity. Thus, the introduction of topical retapamulin 1% ointment extends the treatment options available in the management of impetigo and uncomplicated secondarily infected traumatic lesions.

### Treatment of staphylococcal prosthetic joint infections with debridement, prosthesis retention and oral rifampicin and fusidic acid [^114p7Z1X]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence of the efficacy of treating early staphylococcal infections of prosthetic joints with surgical debridement and prosthesis retention, combined with oral antibiotic regimens that include rifampicin in combination with a fluoroquinolone. With rising rates of fluoroquinolone-resistant staphylococci, evidence concerning the efficacy of alternative combinations of antibiotics is required. Twenty patients with staphylococcal prosthetic joint infections who had been treated with surgical debridement and prosthesis retention, and a combination of rifampicin and fusidic acid were analysed. The mean duration of symptoms before initial debridement was 16 (range 2–75) days. The median time of follow-up was 32 (range 6–76) months. Treatment failure occurred in two patients. The cumulative risk of treatment failure after 1 year was 11.76% (95% CI 3.08–39.40%). Two patients had their treatment changed because of nausea. Ten of 11 patients with infections involving methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus had successful outcomes. Debridement without prosthesis removal, in combination with rifampicin and fusidic acid treatment, was effective and should be considered for patients with early staphylococcal prosthetic joint infections, including those with infections involving fluoroquinolone-resistant organisms.

### Biosynthesis of helvolic acid and identification of an unusual C-4-demethylation process distinct from sterol biosynthesis [^114VT68D]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Triterpenoids possess a variety of pharmacological activities and serve as an invaluable source of pharmaceuticals. Ginsenosides and ganoderic acids are drug candidates, and ginsenoside Rg3 has been clinically approved to treat cancers in China. However, extremely low amounts of these medicinal constituents in natural hosts have significantly hampered their applications. Combinatorial biosynthesis is a feasible option to improve the yields of target compounds and expand chemical diversity, which however requires a thorough understanding of their biosynthesis. To date, only a few triterpenoids such as ginsenosidesand betulinic acidhave been demonstrated.

Fusidane-type antibiotics, a group of fungi-derived triterpenes, originate from protosta-17(20) Z,24-dien-3 β -ol (2) with unique tetracyclic skeleton, which is formed by enzymatic cyclization of (3 S)-2,3-oxidosqualene. Thus, after the formation of the tetracyclic C-20 protosteryl tertiary intermediate cation, the cyclization reaction is terminated by elimination of H-17 to form a double-bond between C-17 and C-20 without the backbone rearrangement. Helvolic acid (1), fusidic acid, and cephalosporin P 1 are the most representative fusidane-type antibiotics (Fig. 1a), all of which exhibit potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Amongst them, fusidic acid has been used to treat staphylococcal skin infections in Europe for nearly 60 years. In the United States, the recent phase II clinical trial has demonstrated that fusidic acid showed comparable efficacy to linezolid for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs). Along with the advancement of global antimicrobial resistance, fusidane-type antibiotics have drawn renewed attentions because they have no cross-resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^114AaBsW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

Objectives

To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). We also searched clinical trial registers on 3 September 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics, and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and used the GRADE approach to assess the overall certainty of the evidence for the outcomes. We have reported the intention-to-treat analysis, and also performed an analysis of evaluable participants to explore the robustness of the intention-to-treat results.

Main Results

We included 19 trials reported in 18 publications (5839 randomised participants): six trials compared penicillin with cephalosporins; six compared penicillin with macrolides; three compared penicillin with carbacephem; one compared penicillin with sulphonamides; one compared clindamycin with ampicillin; and one compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All participants had confirmed acute GABHS tonsillopharyngitis, and ages ranged from one month to 80 years. Nine trials included only, or predominantly, children. Most trials were conducted in an outpatient setting. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both; heterogeneity; and wide confidence intervals. Cephalosporins versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference in symptom resolution (at 2 to 15 days) for cephalosporins versus penicillin (odds ratio (OR) for absence of symptom resolution 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55 to 1.12; 5 trials; 2018 participants; low-certainty evidence). Results of the sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants differed (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 5 trials; 1660 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 50; 4 trials; 1386 participants; low-certainty evidence). Very low-certainty evidence showed no difference in reported adverse events. Macrolides versus penicillin We are uncertain if there is a difference between macrolides and penicillin for resolution of symptoms (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.35; 6 trials; 1728 participants; low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis of evaluable participants resulted in an OR of 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.09; 6 trials; 1159 participants). We are uncertain if clinical relapse may be different (OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.03; 6 trials; 802 participants; low-certainty evidence). Azithromycin versus amoxicillin Based on one unpublished trial in children, we are uncertain if resolution of symptoms is better with azithromycin in a single dose versus amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Sensitivity analysis for per-protocol analysis resulted in an OR of 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; 1 trial; 482 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are also uncertain if there was a difference in relapse between groups (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; 1 trial; 422 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adverse events were more common with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; 1 trial; 673 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Carbacephem versus penicillin There is low-certainty evidence that compared with penicillin, carbacephem may provide better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14.3; 3 trials; 795 participants). Studies did not report on long-term complications, so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We are uncertain if there are clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Low-certainty evidence in children suggests that carbacephem may be more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the other comparisons in this review. Data on complications were too scarce to draw conclusions. These results do not demonstrate that other antibiotics are more effective than penicillin in the treatment of GABHS pharyngitis. All studies were conducted in high-income countries with a low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is a need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities, where the risk of complications remains high.

### Three cases of tickborne Francisella tularensis infection, Austria, 2022 [^113CG2V2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The Cases

Patient 1 was a 64-year-old woman who had received a tick bite in the right inframammary region. After experiencing fever, chills, and a general feeling of discomfort, along with nausea and vomiting, she sought emergency care when symptoms persisted. Clinical examination detected a 20-mm skin lesion surrounded by a reddish hem and central necrotic ulcer. Results of serologic testing for Lyme borreliosis were negative. Stab incision of the skin lesion was performed, and no bacteria grew in culture of the sampled pus. Blood cultures grew F. tularensis. Antimicrobial treatment with oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg 2×/d) led to sign/symptom resolution.

Patient 2 was a 5-year-old girl seen at a pediatric outpatient clinic for retroauricular pain after a tick bite 9 days earlier. Clinical examination showed a swollen and reddened pinna, a pus-covered 5-mm retroauricular skin lesion with a central ulcer (Appendix Figure), and swollen cervical lymph nodes. After 2 days, fever, increased lymph node swelling, and tonsillitis developed, and the retroauricular wound deteriorated. Therapy was switched from oral amoxicillin/clavuanic acid (250 mg 4×/d) and fucidin ointment to intravenous ceftriaxone (520 mg 1×/d), followed by oral cefixim (64 mg 2×/d), which alleviated signs and symptoms. A wound swab sample culture yielded F. tularensis. Antimicrobial treatment, changed to oral ciprofloxacin (250 mg 2×/d), led to substantial signs/symptom improvement.

### Fusidic acid and heparin lock solution for the prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections in critically ill neonates: a retrospective study and a prospective, randomized trial [^114av5uW]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are one of the main morbidities in critically ill neonates. The objective of the present study was to assess the efficacy of a fusidic acid-heparin lock in the prevention of CRBSIs.

Design

A preliminary retrospective study showed that staphylococcal infections were largely prevalent. We planned a prospective, randomized trial to ascertain whether fusidic acid and heparin lock of central venous catheters would reduce the incidence of CRBSIs.

Setting

Level III neonatal intensive care unit.

Patients

One hundred three neonates were enrolled and randomly assigned to a treatment group (n = 50) or control group (n = 53).

Interventions

Fusidic acid (4 mg/mL) and heparin (10 IU/mL) lock in the treatment group.

Measurements and Main Results

The treatment group showed significantly lower incidence of CRBSIs (6.6 vs. 24.9 per 1000 catheter days; p < .01; relative risk 0.28; 95% confidence interval 0.13–0.60). No staphylococcal infections occurred in the treatment group, while in the control group Staphylococcus remained the main agent of CRBSI. Cost analysis comparing the present study and for the treatment of CRBSIs proved that antibiotic lock is financially favorable.

Conclusions

Fusidic acid-heparin lock solution reduced the incidence of CRBSIs in our neonatal intensive care unit. However, we recommend basing antibiotic lock on local CRBSI epidemiology. With regard to fusidic acid, further and broader studies could be useful to confirm our results.

The guideline is intended for use by healthcare providers who care for adult and pediatric patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. The guideline updates the 2002 Infectious Diseases Society of America guideline and discusses diagnosis and management, and recommendations are provided regarding antibiotic choices and dosing. Penicillin or amoxicillin remain the treatments of choice, and recommendations are made for the penicillin-allergic patient, which now include clindamycin.

### High usage of topical fusidic acid and rapid clonal expansion of fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a cautionary tale [^11556B4z]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Our aim was to assess national prescribing trends and determine longitudinal resistance patterns for topical antimicrobials in New Zealand. We observed a dramatic increase in fusidic acid (FA) resistance, and clonal expansion of FA-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. This increase was concurrent with a significant national increase in topical FA dispensing.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^1126Pbf7]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation

We performed randomisation centrally in advance by using a computerised random number generator within fixed blocks (blinded to the investigators) on a one to one basis and stratified by primary healthcare centres. We concealed allocation by distributing sealed opaque randomisation envelopes to the healthcare centres. The local investigators enrolled participants and assigned them to intervention groups by opening the randomisation envelopes in consecutive order. The allocated treatment regimen was open to participants, investigators, study nurses, and outcome adjudicators. The steering committee agreed definitions of outcome measures to guide the outcome adjudicators before unblinding the two study groups. The steering committee also performed correction of data and made all decisions regarding definitions of analysis populations, variables, and coding of incidences while still blinded to the intervention groups.

### Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance in Croatia [^117Ca29i]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Results

The centers providing data included 22 hospital and public health laboratories (Figure 1). Resistance rates for the organisms isolated in different centers varied widely, but certain trends were apparent.

Gram-Positive Bacteria (Figure 2)

Figure 2
Resistance rates (%) to selected antimicrobial agents in gram-positive bacteria in Croatia (June 1 to December 31, 1999.) The number of resistant organisms / number of organisms tested is given in brackets. Note: macrolide resistance = resistance to erythromycin; azithromycin/penicillin resistance in pneumococci = nonusceptibility to penicillin; gentamicin resistance in enterococci = high-level resistance.

Among group A Streptococcus isolates, the overall resistance was 19% to erythromycin and 6% to clindamycin. S. pneumoniae isolates included those from primarily sterile sites, as well as from respiratory specimens and nasopharyngeal swabs. Resistance to penicillin and other antimicrobial agents was common. Both penicillin and cotrimoxazole resistance averaged 38%, macrolide resistance 23%, and tetracycline resistance 21%. Chloramphenicol resistance was relatively uncommon, averaging 7%.

These figures, however, obscure a wide range of results from different centers. Penicillin resistance ranged from 8% in Osijek to 62% in _akovec; erythromycin and azythromicin resistance from 9% in Dubrovnik to 31% in one Zagreb center; and cotrimoxazole resistance from 14% in Sisak to 70% in Pula.

Overall, 18% of Croatian isolates of S. aureus were resistant to oxacillin (and therefore methicillin). Methicillin-resistant strains were often multidrug resistant, averaging 65% resistance to gentamicin, 49% to clindamycin, 57% to ciprofloxacin, and 50% to rifampicin. Resistance to fucidic acid (5%), cotrimoxazole (7%), and mupirocin (7% when tested by a 5-mg disk) was uncommon. Again, wide variation in resistance rates was seen, with strikingly low rates of MRSA in the _akovec General Hospital.

Overall, only 2% of Enterococcus spp. isolates were resistant to ampicillin and 1% to nitrofurantoin. Resistance to gentamicin was 12% (when tested by a 120-mg disk), and vancomycin-resistant isolates occurred in only one Zagreb hospital (with 4% resistance).

### Activity of fusidic acid against extracellular and intracellular Staphylococcus aureus: influence of pH and comparison with linezolid and clindamycin [^111nwsqs]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Emergence of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has triggered a reassessment of fusidic acid (CEM-102, sodium fusidate).

Methods

Fusidic acid was examined for (1) activity against recent methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates; (2) modulation of activity by acidic pH; and (3) accumulation by phagocytic cells and intracellular activity against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA.

Results

About 96% of strains (N = 94) were susceptible (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing breakpoint [≤ 1 mg/L]). Activity was enhanced at pH 5.5 (6 dilutions decrease for minimum inhibitory concentration) in parallel with an increase of drug bacterial accumulation (opposite effects for clindamycin; linezolid remained unaffected). Fusidic acid accumulated in THP-1 cells (about 5.5 fold), with further accumulation at pH 5.5 vs pH 7.4. The intracellular activity of Fusidic acid was similar to that of clindamycin and linezolid (maximal relative activity, 0.4–0.6 log(10) colony-forming unit decrease). No cross-resistance to vancomycin or daptomycin was observed.

Conclusions

Fusidic acid is active against S. aureus in broth as well as intracellularly, with no cross-resistance to other antibiotics.

### Diagnosis and treatment of impetigo [^114EwzT8]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Impetigo is a highly contagious, superficial skin infection that most commonly affects children two to five years of age. The two types of impetigo are nonbullous impetigo (i.e., impetigo contagiosa) and bullous impetigo. The diagnosis usually is made clinically, but rarely a culture may be useful. Although impetigo usually heals spontaneously within two weeks without scarring, treatment helps relieve the discomfort, improve cosmetic appearance, and prevent the spread of an organism that may cause other illnesses (e.g., glomerulonephritis). There is no standard treatment for impetigo, and many options are available. The topical antibiotics mupirocin and fusidic acid are effective and may be superior to oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics should be considered for patients with extensive disease. Oral penicillin V is seldom effective; otherwise there is no clear preference among antistaphylococcal penicillins, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cephalosporins, and macrolides, although resistance rates to erythromycin are rising. Topical disinfectants are not useful in the treatment of impetigo.

### Clinical practice guidelines for Clostridium difficile infection in adults and children: 2017 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) [^116CATJJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Guideline narrative — study scope and graded considerations for initial therapy are provided. The trials informing fidaxomicin and vancomycin excluded fulminant disease and together randomized more than a thousand patients: "patients with fulminant CDI were not included, both studies included the same treatment protocols and > 1000 patients were randomized in a double-blinded manner". Based on this evidence, "fidaxomicin should be considered along with vancomycin as the drug of choice for an initial episode of CDI". Agents "that are probably effective… and which have not received FDA approval, include nitazoxanide and fusidic acid", whereas "Additional agents with inadequate evidence to recommend treatment of an initial CDI episode include rifaximin, tigecycline, and bacitracin". A resistance caution is noted: "Isolates with high MICs (> 256 μg/mL) and development of high MICs during treatment with rifaximin are well documented".

### Extensive pigmented abdominal plaque in a diabetic patient [^114DLMqm]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2. Which of the following contributes to the pathogenesis of drug-induced AN?
A. Induction by insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)
B. Inflammation secondary to Malassezia furfur
C. Genetic predisposition
D. Underlying malignancy
E. Impairment of the barrier skin function

Answers:

A. Induction by insulin and IGF – Correct. The pathogenesis of AN, when benign, is likely related to the induction of insulin and IGF, which stimulates the proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Compensatory hyperinsulinemia secondary to insulin resistance (from type 2 diabetes) is a pathogenic factor that is considered to drive this condition. It is believed that long-term exogenous insulin injections to the subcutaneous tissue stimulates epidermal cell growth, leading to the development of AN over these injected areas.
B. Inflammation secondary to M furfur – Incorrect. Fungal organisms do not contribute to the development of this condition.
C. Genetic predisposition – Incorrect. There is no clear evidence suggesting genetic predisposition plays a contributing role in drug-induced AN, which is in contrast to hereditary benign AN that can manifest in an autosomal dominant fashion.
D. Underlying malignancy – Incorrect. Benign insulin-induced AN is not related to more worrisome variants of AN, which are often associated with aggressive malignancies.
E. Impairment of the barrier skin function – Incorrect. This is not considered to contribute to drug-induced AN development.

Question 3. Other than insulin, which of the following medications is most likely to cause a drug-induced AN?
A. Methotrexate
B. Fusidic acid ointment
C. Vancomycin
D. Testosterone
E. Nicotinic acid

Answers:

A. Methotrexate – Incorrect. This medication has not been reported to cause AN.
B. Fusidic acid ointment – Incorrect. Fusidic acid is a bacteriostatic antibiotic that inhibits translocation in protein synthesis and is effective in treating gram-positive bacteria especially Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Although this medication has been reported in one case to cause AN from topical application, it is not the most likely to cause drug-induced AN.
C. Vancomycin – Incorrect. To our knowledge, there have been no reported cases of vancomycin-induced AN.
D. Testosterone – Incorrect. There have been a few cases of testosterone-induced AN, although this is not a common side effect of this medication.
E. Nicotinic acid – Correct. It is estimated that as many as 20% of patients on oral nicotinic acid will have drug-induced AN at some point.

Table 4 — empirical antibiotic therapy according to clinical presentation and microbiological data aligns infection severity and risk factors with likely pathogens and candidate agents. For mild infection with no complicating factors targeting gram‑positive cocci (GPC), potential regimens include semisynthetic penicillinase‑resistant penicillin (cloxacillin) or 1st generation cephalosporins (cephalexin). For mild infection with β‑lactam allergy or intolerance (GPC), options include clindamycin, fluoroquinolone (levo/moxi‑floxacin), trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline. For moderate or severe infection without complicating factors (GPC ± GNR), options include β‑lactam; β‑lactamase inhibitor regimens (amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam), 2nd or 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), or group 1 carbapenem (ertapenem). For moderate or severe infection with MRSA risk factors, the table states to "consider adding, or substituting with" glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin), linezolid, daptomycin, fusidic acid, trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline. Footnotes specify practical use: antibiotics enclosed in boxes are cited as examples; "where more than one agent is listed, only one of them should be prescribed unless otherwise indicated"; "oral antibiotic agents should generally not be used for severe infections, except as a follow‑on (switch) after initial parenteral therapy"; and clinicians should "consider modifying doses or agents selected for patients with comorbidities such as azotaemia, liver dysfunction, and obesity".

### Diagnosis and prevention of periprosthetic joint infections [^116jBXL7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). High credibility.

Perioperative antibiotic selection — rationale and evidence profile: A total of 13 studies met the inclusion criteria to evaluate evidence for the use of one preoperative antibiotic over another in the prevention of hip and knee PJI; of those, 3 were classified as high-quality studies, 5 were classified as moderate quality, and 5 were classified as low quality. Three of the studies compared 1st and 2nd generation cephalosporins and showed no difference in post-operative PJI; additional comparisons found no difference in infection comparing cefuroxime with fusidic acid after THA or TKA and also failed to show benefit of one antibiotic class over the other when 2nd generation cephalosporins were compared with glycopeptides. One RCT evaluating timing of antibiotic relative to tourniquet inflation versus deflation in TKA found no significant differences between the two treatment arms. Because most of these studies were lacking in statistical power, the strength of this recommendation was reduced to limited, and a definitive statement on the superiority of one antibiotic over another cannot be made. There is no current reliable evidence to support one antibiotic versus the other: Glycopeptide vs. 1st generation cephalosporin; 2nd generation cephalosporin vs. fusidic acid; Fusidic acid vs. glycopeptide; Lincosamides (e.g. clindamycin) vs. penicillinase resistant penicillin.

### Novel antibacterial activity of monolaurin compared with conventional antibiotics against organisms from skin infections: an in vitro study [^115C6hr9]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

A cross-sectional laboratory study to determine the in vitro sensitivity and resistance of organisms in culture isolates from skin infections and mechanisms of action of monolaurin, a coconut lauric acid derivative, compared with 6 common antibiotics: penicillin, oxacillin, fusidic acid, mupirocin, erythromycin, and vancomycin.

Methods

Skin culture samples were taken from newborn to 18-year-old pediatric patients with primary and secondarily infected dermatoses. Samples were collected and identified following standard guidelines, then sent to the laboratory for sensitivity testing against the 6 selected antibiotics and monolaurin.

Results

Sensitivity rates of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp., and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Gram-negative E. vulneris, Enterobacter spp., and Enterococcus spp. to 20 mg/ml monolaurin was 100% and of Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis was 92.31%. Escherichia coli had progressively less dense colony growths at increasing monolaurin concentrations, and at 20 mg/ml was less dense than the control. Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus spp. did not exhibit any resistance to monolaurin and had statistically significant (P < .05) differences in resistance rates to these antibiotics.

Conclusions

Monolaurin has statistically significant in vitro broad-spectrum sensitivity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial isolates from superficial skin infections. Most of the bacteria did not exhibit resistance to it. Monolaurin needs further pharmacokinetic studies to better understand its novel mechanisms of action, toxicity, drug interactions, and proper dosing in order to proceed to in vivo clinical studies.

### Flucloxacillin and fusidic acid-associated neutropenia in a patient with periaortic abscess: rare side effects of commonly used antibiotics [^111M1Un9]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

The use of long-term antibiotics for deep-seated infections is very common, and is associated with many clinically significant side effects. In this report we describe the history of a 48-year-old man who attended West Suffolk Hospital with nausea and vomiting, and was subsequently found to have a deep-seated infection following his repeat aortic valve replacement. He completed a 7-week course of intravenous flucloxacillin and oral fusidic acid, however, prior to finishing this course a random blood test revealed a neutrophil count of zero. He was re-admitted to hospital with fever, and was treated accordingly as per the trust's neutropenic sepsis protocol with the addition of growth colony stimulating factor (GCSF). His neutrophil count recovered after 3 days and has remained within the normal range ever since.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^117K3jjR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although effectiveness increases in participants with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated.

Objectives

To assess the evidence on the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in: (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing relapse; and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). To assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March week 3, 2016), Embase Elsevier (1974 to March 2016), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (2010 to March 2016). We also searched clinical trials registers.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications or adverse events, or both.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion, and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed risk of bias of included studies according to the methods outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and used the GRADE tool to assess the overall quality of evidence for the outcomes.

Main Results

We included 19 trials (5839 randomised participants); seven compared penicillin with cephalosporins, six compared penicillin with macrolides, three compared penicillin with carbacephem, one trial compared penicillin with sulphonamides, one trial compared clindamycin with ampicillin, and one trial compared azithromycin with amoxicillin in children. All included trials reported clinical outcomes. Reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and blinding was poor in all trials. The overall quality of the evidence assessed using the GRADE tool was low for the outcome 'resolution of symptoms' in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and very low for the outcomes 'resolution of symptoms' of evaluable participants and for adverse events. We downgraded the quality of evidence mainly due to lack of (or poor reporting of) randomisation or blinding, or both, heterogeneity, and wide confidence intervals (CIs). There was a difference in symptom resolution in favour of cephalosporins compared with penicillin (evaluable patients analysis odds ratio (OR) for absence of resolution of symptoms 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 20, N = 5, n = 1660; very low quality evidence). However, this was not statistically significant in the ITT analysis (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.12; N = 5, n = 2018; low quality evidence). Clinical relapse was lower for cephalosporins compared with penicillin (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99; NNTB 50, N = 4, n = 1386; low quality evidence), but this was found only in adults (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.88; NNTB 33, N = 2, n = 770). There were no differences between macrolides and penicillin for any of the outcomes. One unpublished trial in children found a better cure rate for azithromycin in a single dose compared to amoxicillin for 10 days (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.73; NNTB 18, N = 1, n = 482), but there was no difference between the groups in ITT analysis (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.05; N = 1, n = 673) or at long-term follow-up (evaluable patients analysis OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.82; N = 1, n = 422). Children experienced more adverse events with azithromycin compared to amoxicillin (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.78 to 3.99; N = 1, n = 673). Compared with penicillin carbacephem showed better symptom resolution post-treatment in adults and children combined (ITT analysis OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.99; NNTB 14, N = 3, n = 795), and in the subgroup analysis of children (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.99; NNTB 8, N = 1, n = 233), but not in the subgroup analysis of adults (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.22, N = 2, n = 562). Children experienced more adverse events with macrolides compared with penicillin (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.15; N = 1, n = 489). Studies did not report on long-term complications so it was unclear if any class of antibiotics was better in preventing serious but rare complications.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no clinically relevant differences in symptom resolution when comparing cephalosporins and macrolides with penicillin in the treatment of GABHS tonsillopharyngitis. Limited evidence in adults suggests cephalosporins are more effective than penicillin for relapse, but the NNTB is high. Limited evidence in children suggests carbacephem is more effective than penicillin for symptom resolution. Data on complications are too scarce to draw conclusions. Based on these results and considering the low cost and absence of resistance, penicillin can still be regarded as a first choice treatment for both adults and children. All studies were in high-income countries with low risk of streptococcal complications, so there is need for trials in low-income countries and Aboriginal communities where risk of complications remains high.

### A 3-day regimen with azithromycin 1.5% eyedrops for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in children: efficacy on clinical signs and impact on the burden of illness [^116X875N]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bacterial conjunctivitis is one of the most common eye infections, accounting for 70%–80% of all cases of infectious conjunctivitis in children.–It is mainly characterized by purulent discharge, moderate diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, and burning or stinging sensations. Follicular reaction of palpebral conjunctiva, eyelid erythema, and swelling are also common clinical signs. In preschool- and school-age children, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most common pathogens, and thus quite different from the bacteriological profile in adults in whom Staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and S. aureus pathogens are predominantly found.–

Although bacterial conjunctivitis generally resolves spontaneously in a few days, there is broad agreement that topical antibiotics are worthwhile, particularly in moderate to severe infection, to shorten the course of the illness and allow the child to return to school and other daily activities. Choice of antibiotic is usually informed predominantly by the clinician's judgment since the results of microbial tests are generally not available at the initial consultation.

Azithromycin 1.5% ocular solution is approved for the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in adults as well as in children (including infants and neonates) and has a shorter and less frequent therapeutic scheme than conventional antibiotic eyedrops. The 3-day twice-daily regimen with azithromycin 1.5% ocular solution is much shorter and requires less frequent daily administrations. In addition, azithromycin 1.5% eyedrops have been recently shown to provide a more rapid clinical cure than tobramycin 0.3% eyedrops in the treatment of purulent bacterial conjunctivitis in the pediatric population. Although several topical antibiotics are employed in this indication in children, tobramycin 0.3% was chosen as comparator because it can be considered a standard of care and has been widely investigated.–Although other twice-daily preparations such as fusidic acid are available, they are generally formulated as an ophthalmic gel that is somewhat less convenient for use in young children. Moreover, tobramycin has been used as comparator in other similar studies.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^113LPs5M]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

According to a Cochrane report from 2012, clinical trials on shorter treatment duration with oral penicillin for streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis are encouraged. Moore and colleagues (DESCARTE study) called for randomised controlled trials to confirm if a shorter course of penicillin might be sufficient when symptomatic cure is the goal. Increasing overall antimicrobial resistance and the lack of new antimicrobial agents emphasise the importance of correctly using existing antibiotics to their full potential. A Cochrane review published in 2016 concluded that penicillin is the preferred first line treatment for pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococcus in adults and children. This review compared penicillin with broader spectrum antibiotics. A meta-analysis from 2008 stated that clinical success and bacteriological eradication are less likely in patients with group A streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis on a short course of treatment (five to seven days) compared with those on a long course of treatment (10 days). The total daily doses in these studies ranged from 750 to 1600 mg, either twice daily or three times daily. However, the inclusion criteria did not always follow current ESCMID guidelines, and the dosing regimens were suboptimal according to current knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

The efficacy of β lactam antibiotics is dependent on time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the unbound drug concentration in serum. The most important determinants for time above minimum inhibitory concentration are dose and frequency, and the dosing regimen of 800 mg four times daily provides better target attainment compared with 1000 mg three times daily. The risk with a shorter regimen might be a lower rate of clinical resolution and microbiological eradication. However, reducing the treatment duration could cause fewer side effects, improve patient adherence, cause less impact on the human microbiota, lower the total antibiotic use, and reduce drug costs for patients and the community. The rationale for a non-inferiority trial design was based on the expectation that non-inferiority of the clinical efficacy of a shorter treatment duration compared with the currently recommended treatment would be sufficient from a clinical perspective. The efficacy of 10 day treatment compared with placebo is previously well documentedand in line with international guidelines. The non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint was agreed upon by the trial steering committee based on European Medicines Agency guidelinesand on the judgment that a difference in the rate of clinical cure up to 10 percentage points is not clinically relevant for non-serious infections.

### Surveillance of the susceptibility of ocular bacterial pathogens to the fluoroquinolone gatifloxacin and other antimicrobials in Europe during 2001 / 2002 [^112qGUFC]. The Journal of Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the identity of European ocular bacterial pathogens and their susceptibility to topical antimicrobial agents.

Methods

Bacterial isolates derived from clinically significant ocular infections were collected from 10 European centres. Bacteria were re-identified and susceptibility to gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, fusidic acid, gentamicin and chloramphenicol was determined using the NCCLS agar incorporation method at a central testing laboratory.

Results

Five hundred and thirty-two isolates were submitted for analysis. The most common pathogen was methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Gatifloxacin was the most potent antimicrobial agent tested for isolates from each European country as measured by pure MIC or percentage resistance (using 95% confidence intervals). Only methicillin-resistant S. aureus was in any way refractory to the action of gatifloxacin and other fluoroquinolones.

Conclusions

Fluoroquinolones offer broad-spectrum coverage for the treatment of ocular pathogens. Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution should be a significant improvement on currently available fluoroquinolones mainly due to enhanced activity against streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci (which accounted for almost one-third of ocular pathogens).

### Current state of Clostridium difficile treatment options [^114a4Gen]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Bacitracin

Bacitracin is a polypeptide antibiotic with activity against mainly gram-positive organisms. Early studies comparing bacitracin with vancomycin showed that both were similar in the control of symptoms, but bacitracin was inferior in the clearance of C. difficile from feces. Two recent susceptibility studies of 276 clinical isolates showed that 100% of isolates had high-level resistance with an MIC > 128 μg/mL. In the larger of these 2 studies, 69% of the typed isolates were found to be the North American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1 (NAP1) strain. With these recent reports of high-level resistance and known outbreaks with the NAP1 strain occurring worldwide, bacitracin may have limited clinical efficacy in the current management of CDI.

Fusidic Acid

Fusidic acid had been used primarily for the management of bone and soft-tissue infections due to Staphylococcus aureus. Early studies have shown that, when used against other standard therapies for CDI, the cure rates were 83%–93% and the recurrence rate was 28%. In a comparison trial with metronidazole, the development of resistance to fusidic acid occurred in more than half the treatment group that had a positive culture result at follow-up. This finding raises the concern for selection of resistant isolates during treatment. As is the case with S. aureus infections, single-drug management with fusidic acid for the treatment of CDI may not be ideal. Oral fusidic acid is not available for use in the United States.

Teicoplanin

Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic shown to have activity against gram-positive anaerobes, including C. difficile. In a prospective study of teicoplanin and vancomycin, clinical cure and recurrence rates were similar in both groups. In a subsequent study, cures in the teicoplanin group were 100% in patients with endoscopically confirmed pseudomembranous colitis. It had significantly lower rates of relapse, compared with fusidic acid, and lower rates of persistence of cytotoxin at the end of therapy, compared with fusidic acid and metronidazole. Although teicoplanin appears to have acceptable cure rates and similar recurrence rates, it also appears to be efficacious in the management of severe CDI. Teicoplanin is not currently available in the United States for clinical use.

### Outcome and predictors of treatment failure in total hip / knee prosthetic joint infections due to Staphylococcus aureus [^117SAFSm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

In the present study, the ASA score was an independent variable associated with patient outcome, consistent with results of a recent study of patients with group B streptococcal prosthetic hip infections reported by Zeller et al. We also found that use of rifampin-fluoroquinolone combinations as definitive antibiotic therapy was another independent factor associated with remission of PJI due to S. aureu s. The efficacy of a rifampin-containing regimen in patients with staphylococcal orthopedic implant–associated infection has also been reported in more recent observational studies, confirming initial experimental model studies. In our series of patients treated in the majority of cases with rifampin combinations, we found a trend toward higher failure rate only in patients with MRSA infections, compared with those with MSSA infections (29.4% and 19.7%, respectively), but this may be related to the small size of the studied population. Salgado et al described a significant poor outcome associated with MRSA infections in a series of patients treated with vancomycin without rifampin as the main treatment. Nonetheless, rifampin associated with such antibiotics as fusidic acid, levofloxacin, vancomycin or linezolid, and clindamycin or linezolid has been associated with similar failure rates between MRSA- and MSSA-related PJIs. In the present study, patients with polymicrobial infections experienced the highest rate of treatment failure (33.3%) and also received rifampin treatment in a significantly lower proportion than did patients with monomicrobial S. aureus infection. All these data support the concept that rifampin is essential for the treatment of S. aureus –related PJIs. Use of rifampin for staphylococcal infections may be limited by the emergence of rifampin-resistant mutants, although this was not observed in our patients. According to our protocol of antibiotic therapy for PJI, rifampin was not administered as empirical therapy but exclusively as definitive antibiotic therapy consisting of a combination of 2 agents active against the pathogen(s) identified in intraoperative samples. The aim of this restriction in rifampin prescription is to prevent rifampin monotherapy for S. aureus infection, a situation likely to result in emergence of rifampin-resistant S. aureus mutants. For the same reason, rifampin combinations were initially administered to our patients intravenously in order to alleviate interindividual variability in absorption of antibiotics, in particular, fluoroquinolones. Despite the use of higher daily doses of rifampin in our patients than reported in most previous studies and the high proportion of our patients with chronic liver disease, rifampin had to be withdrawn in only 3 (4.3%) of 69 patients.

### Oral and topical antibiotics for clinically infected eczema in children: a pragmatic randomized controlled trial in ambulatory care [^1141NJ9x]. Annals of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Eczema may flare because of bacterial infection, but evidence supporting antibiotic treatment is of low quality. We aimed to determine the effect of oral and topical antibiotics in addition to topical emollient and corticosteroids in children with clinically infected eczema.

Methods

We employed a 3-arm, blinded, randomized controlled trial in UK ambulatory care. Children with clinical, non-severely infected eczema were randomized to receive oral and topical placebos (control), oral antibiotic (flucloxacillin) and topical placebo, or topical antibiotic (fusidic acid) and oral placebo, for 1 week. We compared Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) scores at 2 weeks using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).

Results

We randomized 113 children (40 to control, 36 to oral antibiotic, and 37 to topical antibiotic). Mean (SD) baseline Patient Oriented Eczema Measure scores were 13.4 (5.1) for the control group, 14.6 (5.3) for the oral antibiotic group, and 16.9 (5.5) for the topical antibiotic group. At baseline, 104 children (93%) had 1 or more of the following findings: weeping, crusting, pustules, or painful skin. Mean (SD) POEM scores at 2 weeks were 6.2 (6.0) for control, 8.3 (7.3) for the oral antibiotic group, and 9.3 (6.2) for the topical antibiotic group. Controlling for baseline POEM score, neither oral nor topical antibiotics produced a significant difference in mean (95% CI) POEM scores (1.5 [-1.4 to 4.4] and 1.5 [-1.6 to 4.5] respectively). There were no significant differences in adverse effects and no serious adverse events.

Conclusions

We found rapid resolution in response to topical steroid and emollient treatment and ruled out a clinically meaningful benefit from the addition of either oral or topical antibiotics. Children seen in ambulatory care with mild clinically infected eczema do not need treatment with antibiotics.

### Safety analysis of fidaxomicin in comparison with oral vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infections [^1161Zyq7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Clostridium difficile was recognized as the causative agent for antibiotic-associated colitis in 1978, first observed in conjunction with clindamycin treatment. Since then, C. difficile infection (CDI) has become an increasingly challenging nosocomial infection with severe medical consequences.

Hamster animal models showed some protective and beneficial effect from oral vancomycin, which quickly became the treatment drug of choice. However, the use of all vancomycin formulations (parvules and intravenous vancomycin used orally) had to be limited either because of its high price (parvules) or to curtail the potential risk for the emergence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In 1995, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that vancomycin not be used orally for CDI in hospital settings as a strategy to prevent the emergence of VRE and vancomycin intermediate Staphylococcus aureus.

Prior to the approval of fidaxomicin, oral vancomycin was the only agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis produced by C. difficile. Metronidazole was subsequently used off-label and, as a much less expensive alternative, became the de facto first-line treatment for mild to moderate cases of CDI. Other antibiotics have been tried in the past (fusidic acid, bacitracin, rifaximin, and nitazoxanide), but only limited clinical data are available for the treatment of CDI. Thus, there has been a need for new therapies to treat this challenging disease.

Ideally, drugs against C. difficile should be minimally absorbed, remain in the intestinal lumen, and have a narrow spectrum of activity, preserving the normal microbiota of the gut.

Fidaxomicin has a narrow-spectrum antibacterial profile, with potent bactericidal activity specifically against C. difficile. It displays moderate in vitro activity against some Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and Enterococcus spp.) and is inactive against Gram-negative organisms and yeast. Fidaxomicin is minimally absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with plasma concentrations in the nanogram-per-milliliter range after oral dosing.

In 2 phase 3 trials, fidaxomicin demonstrated noninferiority to vancomycin for clinical response in the treatment of CDI and superiority to vancomycin for sustained clinical response (cure without recurrence during the 30-day follow-up period). The efficacy results are presented in detail elsewhere. The safety results from nonclinical and clinical studies are summarized in the following sections.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^112ZhZTW]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

General Principles

For Staphylococcus species, the curative treatment of choice with implants in situ is a combination of rifampicin with a second active antibiotic after the initial IV period. Rifampicin is a bactericidal agent active against growing and nongrowing staphylococci in biofilms. – However, monotherapy with rifampicin leads to rapid emergence of resistance. The risk of superinfection with (a) rifampicin-resistant strain(s) increases when the bacterial load is high and the wound is oozing or drains are present. The recommended dose of oral rifampicin is 300–450 mg twice or 600–900 mg once daily started after debridement and when the wound has sealed. The expert group recommends liver function tests at baseline and thereafter if there are clinical concerns.

Once the wound is stable, drains are out, and microbiology results are available, it is recommended to switch to an oral antibiotic in combination with rifampicin. The first choice is a fluoroquinolone. Patients should be warned about adverse effects including Achilles tendon tendinitis and photosensitivity. Second-line antimicrobials combined with rifampicin include sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in high dose (960 mg, 8 hourly). Other second-line agents include doxycycline or minocycline and fusidic acid. In some cases, where there is resistance or intolerance to the other agents, oral pristinamycin can be used. The dosages for the aforementioned antimicrobials are summarized in Table 1.

### Antimicrobial drugs for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization [^112BgAn8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Eradication strategies for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are variable. We sought to summarize the evidence for use of antimicrobial agents to eradicate MRSA.

Objectives

To describe the effects of topical and systemic antimicrobial agents on nasal and extra-nasal MRSA carriage, adverse events, and incidence of subsequent MRSA infections.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group's trials register (August 2003), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to 2003), EMBASE (1988 to 2003), handsearched relevant literature, and contacted MRSA experts and the manufacturer of mupirocin.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials of patients colonized with MRSA comparing topical or systemic antimicrobials to placebo or no treatment, and trials comparing various combinations of topical or systemic agents to no treatment, placebo, or to topical or systemic agents.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied inclusion criteria to potentially relevant trials, assessed trial methodological quality, and extracted data. Primary outcomes included eradication of MRSA, infection due to MRSA, and adverse events.

Main Results

Six trials (384 participants) met the inclusion criteria. No difference in MRSA eradication was detected in four studies: one that compared mupirocin to placebo, two that compared one systemic agent to no treatment (fusidic acid in one and rifampin or minocycline in the other) and one that compared mupirocin to topical fusidic acid and oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, examining nasal MRSA eradication as an outcome. One study compared minocycline to rifampin, with rifampicin being more effective in relation to eradication of MRSA from all sites at day 30 (relative risk 0.16; 95% confidence intervals 0.02 to 1.00), but the difference at 90 days was not statistically significant (n = 18). Two studies (one testing novobiocin and rifampin, the other ciprofloxacin and rifampin, versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and rifampin) did not demonstrate a difference in eradication of MRSA at all sites (n = 94). Adverse events with systemic agents occurred in up to 20% of participants, however reporting was sporadic and denominators small. All trials reported development of resistance to antimicrobial agents used.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support use of topical or systemic antimicrobial therapy for eradicating nasal or extra-nasal MRSA. There is no demonstrated superiority of either topical or systemic therapy, or of combinations of these agents. Potentially serious adverse events and development of antimicrobial resistance can result from therapy.

### The widespread use of topical antimicrobials enriches for resistance in Staphylococcus aureus isolated from patients with atopic dermatitis [^112pCvG3]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

While fusC prevalence seems clonally influenced, the fusA mutations are indicative of prior exposure and adaptation to fusidic acid therapy. Numerous fusA SNPs were identified across the whole population (Fig. 2), demonstrating that this was the consequence of repeated independent events. Several case isolates had multiple mutations in fusA. Previously it has been reported that secondary mutations in fusA provide a potential mechanism to offset the fitness deficit incurred by maintaining this amino acid change. 32

These observations raise several important points for clinical consideration. Firstly, do our prescribing practices at a population level select for specific colonizing strains in AD? Strain prevalence in AD is an emerging area of interest, and little is presently understood about the genetic basis of the preferential success of certain lineages, but this study supports the recent findings of strain preponderance. 20 Secondly, does patient behaviour in addition to prescribing practice contribute to the accumulation of fusA mutations in cases? Anecdotally, patients often report using repeated short bursts of fusidic acid preparations at home for disease flares. Several studies have that suggested both intermittent and prolonged usage of such therapies is very likely to contribute to the development of resistance. 30, 33 The patients with AD in this study were attending a tertiary clinic for the first time, and will likely have received this antibiotic in the community.

One limitation of this study was the lack of detailed prescribing records for the participants. The results nonetheless highlight the importance of antimicrobial stewardship in this specific disease context. Finally we have to consider whether the use of any antibiotic is warranted in many cases of AD flare. Recent clinical trial evidence has clearly demonstrated a lack of objective benefit of antimicrobials over use of a moderate‐potency topical steroid, at least in mild disease exacerbation. 34, 35

Future studies are specifically needed to assess the impact of antimicrobial usage on S. aureus populations in AD. Topical antimicrobials, both antibiotics and antiseptics, are of particular interest. These studies must incorporate both community‐based patients and those under specialist dermatological care, and correlate with prescribing data. Patients of different ages must be assessed to allow examination of the selective impact of prescribing in dermatological and wider clinical practice. With increasing evidence of lack of benefit of these treatments, and growing resistance, we must reassess and change our clinical practice accordingly.

### Clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride (Cleocin pediatric) [^117FfcXb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic.

Resistance

Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test.

### Impetigo: incidence and treatment in Dutch general practice in 1987 and 2001 – results from two national surveys [^115Kbmqf]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Impetigo is a common skin infection in children. The epidemiology is relatively unknown, and the choice of treatment is subject to debate.

Objective

The objective of our study was to determine the incidence and treatment of impetigo in Dutch general practice, and to assess trends between 1987 and 2001.

Methods

We used data from the first (1987) and second (2001) Dutch national surveys of general practice. All diagnoses, prescriptions and referrals were registered by the participating general practitioners (GPs), 161 and 195, respectively.

Results

The incidence rate of impetigo increased from 16.5 (1987) to 20.6 (2001) per 1000 person years under 18 years old (P < 0.01). In both years, the incidence was significantly higher in summer, in rural areas and in the southern region of the Netherlands, compared with winter, urban areas and northern region, respectively. Socioeconomic status was not associated with the incidence rate. From 1987 to 2001, there was a trend towards treatment with a topical antibiotic (from 43% to 64%), especially fusidic acid cream and mupirocin cream. Treatment with oral antibiotics (from 31% to 14%) and antiseptics (from 11% to 3%) was prescribed less often.

Conclusions

We have shown an increased incidence of impetigo in the past decade, which may be the result of an increased tendency to seek help, or increased antibiotic resistance and virulence of Staphylococcus aureus. Further microbiological research on the marked regional difference in incidence may contribute to understanding the factors that determine the spread of impetigo. Trends in prescribing for impetigo generally follow evidence-based knowledge on the effectiveness of different therapies, rather than the national practice guideline.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in primary hip and knee arthroplasty: comparison between cefuroxime and two specific antistaphylococcal agents [^112v1CYC]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2010). Low credibility.

This is a prospective randomized study comparing cefuroxime to 2 antistaphylococal agents (fusidic acid and vancomycin), for prophylaxis in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in an institute, where methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) prevalence exceeds 25% of orthopedic infections. There were 3 patient groups. Group A included the patients who received cefuroxime, group B those who received fusidic acid, and group C those who received vancomycin. Patients were evaluated for the presence of superficial and/or deep infection at the surgical site. Statistical analysis did not reveal any substantial difference between the 3 groups. We do not recommend the use of specific antistaphylococcal agents for prophylactic use in primary THA and TKA, even in institution where MRSA and MRSE exceed 25% of orthopedic infections.

### Treatment outcomes for serious infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with reduced vancomycin susceptibility [^113rQBQN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Although infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with reduced vancomycin susceptibility (SA-RVS) have been reported from a number of countries, including Australia, the optimal therapy is unknown. We reviewed the clinical features, therapy, and outcome of 25 patients with serious infections due to SA-RVS in Australia and New Zealand. Eight patients had endocarditis, 9 had bacteremia associated with deep-seated infection, 6 had osteomyelitis or septic arthritis, and 2 had empyema. All patients had received vancomycin before the isolation of SA-RVS, and glycopeptide treatment had failed for 19 patients (76%). Twenty-one patients subsequently received active treatment, which was effective for 16 patients (76%). Eighteen patients received linezolid, which was effective in 14 (78%), including 4 patients with endocarditis. Twelve patients received a combination of rifampicin and fusidic acid. Surgical intervention was required for 15 patients (60%). Antibiotic therapy, especially linezolid with or without rifampicin and fusidic acid, in conjunction with surgical debulking is effective therapy for the majority of patients with serious infections (including endocarditis) caused by SA-RVS.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^1173vLqs]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a scoping review of the literature for all studies evaluating Strep A treatment or prevention strategies from an economic perspective. A review protocol was developed but not registered at the start of the study and is described here, along with the main findings by following the "Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses" (PRISMA) guidelines.

Eligibility criteria

We included all studies published between Jan 1, 2000 and Oct 12, 2022, that measured and valued, in monetary terms, the resources used to treat or prevent Strep A infections or clinical manifestations. We did not include studies on nosocomial infections and on diseases caused by a pathogen other than Strep A (e.g. bacteraemia or toxic shock syndrome due exclusively to Staphylococcus aureus). There were no restrictions on study language or country; however, the search terms were in English only. Clinical manifestations arising from Strep A infection included pharyngitis, tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess (quinsy), impetigo, cellulitis, erysipelas, scarlet fever, necrotising fasciitis, bacteraemia, toxic shock syndrome, sepsis (including maternal sepsis), septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, meningitis, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), rheumatic heart disease (RHD), and acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN).

Relevant economic study designs included cost-of-illness, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit, budget-impact, and return-on-investment studies. Studies that did not calculate the intervention cost and compare it to the intervention benefits (clinical or economic) were excluded from the analysis. We did not attempt to calculate cost-effectiveness ratios because any number of measures of effectiveness could be chosen (e.g. cost per disease averted, cost per surgery averted, cost per anaphylaxis reaction averted, cost per days of illness reduced, etc) and interpretation of the ratio is subjective.

Search strategy

A literature search was conducted using Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science (WoS) search platform, which includes multiple databases such as the WoS core collection and Medline, and Elsevier's Embase search platform. Search strings for each database are provided in Supplemental Material 1.

General economic terms and disease terms were restricted to a title search to increase the sensitivity of the search strategy. However, to maximize that chance of identifying all relevant data, references lists of each eligible study were evaluated and hand-searched for studies not identified by the search string.

### High levels of fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus despite restrictions on antibiotic use [^1164aP23]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

High rates of fusidic acid (FA)-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (FRSA) in patients with skin disease have been previously attributed to high usage of topical FA.

Aims

To assess whether local community guidelines to restrict topical FA has affected its prescription and use and the level of FRSA in patients with skin disease.

Methods

Stapylococcus aureus isolates from microbiology samples received over a 4-month period in 2004 were tested for antibiotic sensitivities. Comparison was then made with the results of a previous study carried out in 2001.

Results

A significant fall was seen in the use of topical FA in dermatology patients. In 2001, 62% of patients had used FA-containing preparations within the previous 6 months, compared with just 15% of patients in 2004 (P < 0.001). The number of topical FA prescriptions in primary and secondary care dropped between 2001 and 2004. The proportion of S. aureus isolates resistant to FA in dermatology patients had not significantly fallen between 2001 (50%) and 2004 (41%) (P = 0.4). However, there was a significant increase in FA resistance within hospital inpatients, nondermatology outpatients and primary-care patients (P < 0.05). The FRSA level had doubled in hospital inpatients (20%) and almost tripled in nondermatology outpatients (28%) and primary care patients (25%).

Conclusion

Persistent high levels of FA resistance may represent the development of an FRSA reservoir in the community. Continued restriction of FA is still recommended.

### Short-term effects of topical fusidic acid or mupirocin on the prevalence of fusidic acid resistant (fusR) Staphylococcus aureus in atopic eczema [^112Ec2Tb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Staphylococcus aureus has a role in the pathophysiology of atopic eczema. Topical fusidic acid is widely used in its treatment. There is concern that topical use of fusidic acid may be driving the selection and dissemination of fusidic acid-resistant (FusR) S. aureus.

Objectives

To test the hypothesis that treatment of atopic eczema for 2 weeks with topical fusidic acid/steroid combination can increase carriage of FusRS. aureus.

Methods

Forty-six patients with atopic eczema were allocated randomly to one of two treatment groups. Group 1 (28 patients) were treated with topical 2% fusidic acid plus 0.1% betamethasone cream, and group 2 (18 patients) with topical 2% mupirocin and 0.1% betamethasone cream. The clinical response and nasal and skin colonization with S. aureus were recorded before treatment and after 1 and 2 weeks of therapy.

Results

Baseline samples from the site of worst eczema showed S. aureus (sensitive and resistant) in 76% of patients, and FusRS. aureus in 26%, with no significant difference between treatment groups. After 1 and 2 weeks, both groups showed similar significant clinical improvement. The overall median clinical improvement was paralleled by a reduction in prevalence and population density of S. aureus (sensitive and resistant) at the worst eczema site (P < 0.0001). However, for FusRS. aureus there was no significant change in the prevalence of carriage, or population density in either group compared to baseline. Over 50% of patients carried S. aureus in the nerves and over 20% carried FusRS. aureus. Neither regimen affected either the prevalence or population density of S. aureus or FusRS. aureus in the nerves.

Conclusions

In this small study there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that short-term treatment of atopic eczema with fusidic acid/steroid combination increases fusidic acid resistant S. aureus during a 2-week period.

Necrotizing soft tissue infection — intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been explored for streptococcal toxin–mediated disease, but there is considerable batch-to-batch variation and clinical data of efficacy are lacking; an observational study suggested better outcomes but was confounded by greater use of surgery and clindamycin, and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed no statistically significant improvement in survival with a statistically nonsignificant reduction in median time to further progression (20 hours for the IVIG group vs 24 hours for the placebo group); additional studies of the efficacy of IVIG are necessary before a recommendation can be made supporting its use in this setting.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to anti-streptococcal antibodies, IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to do not obtain anti-streptococcal antibody titers in the routine workup of acute pharyngitis, as they reflect past rather than current infection.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^1135mzEd]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Decision making may also be hindered by epidemiological uncertainties and inconsistencies between Strep A disease models and observational studies, as well as lacking evidence on the effectiveness of several evaluated strategies. The majority of evaluations were model-based evaluations, which used arguably outdated data or assumptions for parameter estimates. This included the risk of ARF after an untreated Strep A infection, which ranged from 0.00007 cases of ARF per 100untreated Strep A infections to approximately 2 cases of ARFor 2 cases of RHDper 100 untreated Strep A infections across evaluations of pharyngitis management and ARF prevention strategies. Further, strategies for the primary prevention of ARF and RHD did not include the treatment or prevention of impetigo as a risk factor, yet an increasing amount of studies during the period of this review have indicated that impetigo is likely to be implicated in ARF pathogenesis. Several studies made assumptions around the effectiveness of the prevention strategy, primarily strategies that are hindered, in part, by the expense of evaluating them by clinical trials. While this is not an exhaustive list, there is a clear need for new primary research to improve model certainty in modelled outcomes and utility for people relying on them for decision making.

The absence of studies addressing key issues in Strep A control was revealing. For example, there were no economic evaluations for primordial prevention of infection by addressing environmental or social factors or hygiene infrastructure or behaviours. Nor were there evaluations of tertiary prevention of invasive infection (i.e. adjuvant therapy). No evaluations addressed all strategies along the aetiological pathway between infection and severe disease as independent or combined strategies. One cost-of-illness study estimated reductions in direct healthcare expenditure due to primordial prevention; estimates for these costs were presented but not formally contrasted against the costs of the interventions. On inspection, the intervention costs dwarf the cost savings related to ARF/RHD prevention. However, interventions which address social determinants of health are likely to result in health and economic benefits for other infectious disease, as well as a broader range of economic benefits, such as improved educations and productivity. Of note however, most studies used a human capital approach to estimating productivity gains, whereas a frictional cost approach, particularly in the context of strategy affordability, may be more suited among settings where disease prevention does not necessarily translate into an increased and fully employed labour force. This illustrates an important unmet need to comprehensively evaluate a wider range of health, economic, and social benefits associated with public health strategies, rather than attempting to quantify the potential benefits for single disease endpoints.

### Clindamycin hydrochloride (Cleocin hydrochloride) [^115tGZYS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic.

Resistance

Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test.

Antimicrobial Activity

Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (See INDICATIONS AND USAGE):

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains)
Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains)
Streptococcus pyogenes

Anaerobic bacteria

Clostridium perfringens
Fusobacterium necrophorum
Fusobacterium nucleatum
Peptostreptococcus anaerobius
Prevotella melaninogenica

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for clindamycin against isolates of a similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of clindamycin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible strains)
Streptococcus agalactiae
Streptococcus anginosus
Streptococcus mitis
Streptococcus oralis

Anaerobic bacteria

Actinomyces israelii
Clostridium clostridioforme
Eggerthella lenta
Finegoldia (Peptostreptococcus) magna
Micromonas (Peptostreptococcus) micros

### High levels of fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in dermatology patients [^112jDmFz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Antibiotic resistance is a significant problem both in hospitals and the community. Topical antibiotics are widely used for dermatological problems and this may be leading to the emergence of resistant bacteria.

Objective

To assess the level of fusidic acid-resistant Staphylococcus aureus inpatients with dermatological problems.

Methods

All microbiology samples over a 4-month period were tested for antibiotic sensitivities. Patients with cultures positive for S. aureus were studied.

Results

The study shows 50% of S. aureus isolates from dermatology patients were resistant to fusidic acid. This figure rose to 78% inpatients with atopic eczema. Of patients with fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus isolates, 96% had used a fusidic acid-containing preparation within the previous 6 months. The level of fusidic acid resistance in S. aureus samples cultured from nondermatology patients was only 9.6%, a level significantly below that for dermatology patients (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

High levels of fusidic acid-resistant S. aureus are found in dermatology patients. Inappropriate use of topical antibiotics in dermatology patients leading to fusidic acid resistance may threaten the efficacy of systemic fusidic acid for the treatment of serious S. aureus infections. Education of health professionals and restriction of the use of fusidic acid is needed.

### Prospects for a group A streptococcal vaccine: rationale, feasibility, and obstacles – report of a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases workshop [^115D8CV8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Infections due to group A streptococci (GAS) represent a public health problem of major proportions in both developing and developed countries. Currently available methods of prevention are either inadequate or ineffective, as attested to by the morbidity and mortality associated with this ubiquitous pathogen worldwide. Advances in molecular biology have shed new light on the pathogenesis of GAS infections and have identified a number of virulence factors as potential vaccine targets. Therefore, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases convened an expert workshop in March 2004 to review the available data and to explore the microbiologic, immunologic, epidemiologic, and economic issues involved in development and implementation of a safe and effective GAS vaccine. Participants included scientists and clinicians involved in GAS research, as well as representatives of United States federal agencies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, Department of Defense, and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), the World Health Organization, and the pharmaceutical industry. This report summarizes the deliberations of the workshop.

### Modalities of group A streptococcal prevention and treatment and their economic justification [^113yBPQL]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Infection by group A Streptococcus (Strep A) results in a diverse range of clinical conditions, including pharyngitis, impetigo, cellulitis, necrotising fasciitis, and rheumatic heart disease. In this article, we outline the recommended strategies for Strep A treatment and prevention and review the literature for economic evaluations of competing treatment and prevention strategies. We find that most economic evaluations focus on reducing the duration of illness or risk of rheumatic fever among people presenting with sore throat through diagnostic and/or treatment strategies. Few studies have evaluated strategies to reduce the burden of Strep A infection among the general population, nor have they considered the local capacity to finance and implement strategies. Evaluation of validated costs and consequences for a more diverse range of Strep A interventions are needed to ensure policies maximise patient outcomes under budget constraints. This should include attention to basic public health strategies and emerging strategies such as vaccination.

### Antibiotic regimens | Group A strep… [^112SrWMm]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple antibiotic regimens have been used to eradicate carriage of group A Streptococcus in previous outbreaks.
- Regimen should be chosen on a case-by-case basis.
- Some regimens require antibiotic susceptibility test results prior to their use.
- Follow recommended guidance on preventing and treating GAS infections. Regimen choice Which antibiotic regimen to use for GAS carriage eradication during an outbreak depends on multiple considerations. Long-term care facility and public health staff should carefully consider the pros and cons of each regimen on a case-by-case basis. Key decision makers from the LTCF include the medical director and infection prevention and control personnel. In addition to a first-line regimen, it's likely necessary to choose alternative regimens for those
- With allergies to antibiotics
- At risk for drug-drug interactions with antibiotic regimens.

First-line regimens GAS is universally susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and cephalosporins. LTCFs and public health don't need to consider antibiotic susceptibility when selecting one of these treatment regimens. Universally susceptible antibiotic regimens, with dosages. Benzathine penicillin G plus rifampin BPG: 600, 000 units for patients < 27 kilograms or 1, 200, 000 units for patients ≥ 27 kg intramuscular in a single dose Rifampin: 20 mg/kg/day oral in 2 divided doses for 4 days. Alternative regimens LTCFs and public health should only consider clindamycin or macrolides if the outbreak strain is documented as susceptible to these antibiotics. Clindamycin and macrolide resistance have been commonly reported. Among invasive disease isolates in 2023, 27% of GAS isolates were macrolide resistant and 26% of isolates were clindamycin resistant.

### Antibiotic use for streptococcal pharyngitis groups C and G… [^114K63oY]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

to the editor: The article 1 by Vincent and colleagues in American Family Physician reviews a topic that is highly relevant to my everyday practice in primary care: pharyngitis. Thank you for articles on such topics. I would like to ask the authors if they have any information on the need or validity of offering antibiotic treatment to patients whose throat cultures reveal groups of streptococci other than A. My laboratory routinely evaluates for groups C and G, and there is some literature 2–5 that suggests that treating these groups of patients may be clinically beneficial. However, I am loath to extend the use of antibiotics further in an era of significant rates of microbial resistance and physician tendency to offer treatments without good evidence of efficacy. in reply: I would like to thank Dr. Mosby for a most intriguing question. Groups C and G beta-hemolytic streptococci certainly have caused well-documented epidemics of acute pharyngitis.

These outbreaks often have been associated with contaminated foods. Groups C and G streptococci also are frequently isolated from asymptomatic persons. Groups C and G streptococci express the virulence factor, M protein. 6 It is difficult to differentiate between colonization and infection. The benefit of antimicrobial therapy has not been established. One author advises that patients with streptococci C and G be treated solely for symptomatic relief. 7 Others state that there is no proven benefit in treating any pharyngitides other than group A beta-hemolytic strep, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. 8, 9 It would appear that we do not understand the pathogenic burden of these organisms, although it is known that the more virulent strains express a C5a peptidase enzyme similar to group A beta-hemolytic strep.

10 My conclusion is that local strain virulence results in the different clinical pathogenic presentations of the organisms under question. The answer: we don't know if groups C and G streptococci deserve antibiotic therapy, and, of course, we never routinely know if they express C5a peptidase.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal pharyngitis… [^112ACtFT]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Many pathogens can cause pharyngitis.
- Patients with clear viral symptoms don't need testing for group A streptococcal bacteria.
- Confirm a negative rapid antigen detection test with a throat culture for symptomatic children aged 3 years or older.
- Treat group A streptococcal pharyngitis with antibiotics.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with group A streptococcal pharyngitis. Treatment Patients, regardless of age, who have a positive RADT or throat culture need antibiotics. Don't treat viral pharyngitis with antibiotics. Benefits of antibiotics Using a recommended antibiotic regimen to treat group A strep pharyngitis:

- Shortens the duration of symptoms
- Reduces the likelihood of transmission to close contacts
- Decreases the development of complications. Recommended antibiotics Penicillin or amoxicillin is the antibiotic of choice to treat group A strep pharyngitis.

Penicillin V, oral Children: 250 mg twice daily or 3 times daily for 10 days Adolescents and adults: 250 mg 4 times daily or 500 mg twice daily, for 10 days. Antibiotic resistance There's never been a report of a clinical isolate of group A strep bacteria that's resistant to penicillin or cephalosporins. However, resistance to azithromycin, clarithromycin, and clindamycin is well known and varies geographically and temporally. Prevention Hand hygiene Good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette can reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria. Antibiotic treatment Treatment with an appropriate antibiotic for 12 hours or longer limits a person's ability to transmit group A strep bacteria. People with group A strep pharyngitis should stay home from work, school, or daycare until both of the following are met:

- They are afebrile
- At least 12–24 hours after starting appropriate antibiotic therapyA.

CDC
- Per the American Academy of Pediatrics Red Book 2024–2027, children with group A strep infections should not return to school or a childcare setting until well appearing and at least 12 hours after beginning appropriate antibiotic therapy. In certain scenarios, such as an infection in a healthcare worker or in a group A strep outbreak setting, staying home for at least 24 hours after beginning appropriate antibiotics should be considered.
