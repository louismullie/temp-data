## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to diagnose benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to structure the initial assessment: history, symptom characterization, and red flags. Then, I should confirm objective symptom quantification with IPSS and quality-of-life assessment. Next, I will review the physical exam, core tests such as urinalysis, post-void residual (PVR), uroflowmetry, and selective PSA testing. After that, I should consider adjuncts like bladder diaries, targeted imaging, and the role of urodynamics when uncertainty persists or before invasive interventions. Finally, I will integrate differential diagnosis and escalation triggers that change the diagnostic pathway or urgency of care, tying each step to guideline recommendations and key evidence points.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and set the frame: BPH is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), so the initial pass is a thorough history that distinguishes storage, voiding, and post-micturition symptoms, clarifies bother and quality-of-life impact, and screens for red flags such as gross hematuria, recurrent UTIs, urinary retention, stones, or neurological symptoms that might redirect evaluation toward malignancy, infection, or neurogenic etiologies before labeling symptoms as BPH-related LUTS [^114MiWjR].

> Wait, let me verify the symptom quantification step because it is easy to gloss over. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) with a bother/quality-of-life question is the validated instrument recommended for both baseline assessment and follow-up, and severity ranges are commonly interpreted as mild 0–7, moderate 8–19, and severe 20–35, which helps align patients to watchful waiting, medical therapy, or more active intervention pathways respectively [^114MiWjR] [^111Np3jy]. I initially thought the IPSS was mandatory, but hold on, I should correct that: EAU 2025 recommends its use as the standard tool for initial evaluation and re-evaluation rather than imposing a mandate, although it functions as the de facto core metric in most pathways, and higher IPSS scores predict future healthcare utilization for LUTS suggestive of BPH, supporting its central role in risk stratification [^114MiWjR] [^117KGYgz].

> Next, I should review the physical examination. A focused exam including an abdominal assessment for bladder distention, targeted neurological screening when indicated, and particularly a digital rectal examination (DRE) to estimate prostate size, assess symmetry and consistency, and detect nodularity or induration is required to exclude concerning pathology that would redirect toward a prostate cancer workup rather than isolated LUTS management pathways [^112NxLdm]. I was about to say DRE is mandatory across all eras; wait, I need to be precise: current EAU 2025 guidelines recommend performing a physical exam including DRE, while earlier EAU guidance labeled DRE as mandatory, which remains instructive historically but should be framed as a strong contemporary recommendation rather than a rigid rule [^112NxLdm] [^116WaV8z].

> I will now examine the core laboratory screen. Let me first confirm that urinalysis (dipstick or microscopy) should be obtained in all patients to detect infection, hematuria, or glucosuria that might shift the diagnostic trajectory toward UTI, malignancy, stones, or diabetes, respectively, before concluding that BPH is the proximate driver of LUTS [^1133Q5tt]. But wait, what about PSA testing? I need to ensure I present this carefully: EAU 2025 recommends measuring PSA if the result will assist in treatment or decision-making, such as estimating prostate volume for 5-alpha reductase inhibitor candidacy, and also recommends counseling patients on the implications of a raised PSA and measuring PSA if a prostate cancer diagnosis would change management [^115A5reb] [^116vSFvD] [^114iWikc].

> Hold on, I should double-check the hemodynamic tests and bladder emptying measures. Uroflowmetry is recommended in the initial evaluation when feasible, ideally with sufficient voided volume, to provide an objective correlate of obstruction, and low maximum flow rates are clinically suggestive of bladder outlet obstruction, although thresholds should be interpreted in context with volume and symptoms rather than in isolation [^11324X6e] [^111dNShi]. I should confirm post-void residual assessment as well: EAU 2025 recommends measuring PVR to complement the assessment of emptying, and AUA 2024 recommends obtaining a PVR before interventions for LUTS attributed to BPH, which helps identify retention risk and informs procedural planning [^116zaVUu] [^116h18Qo].

> Next, I should review adjunctive symptom tools where storage symptoms or nocturia are prominent. A bladder diary of at least three days is recommended to characterize frequency, urgency, nocturnal polyuria, and voided volumes, which can significantly refine the differential and guide targeted therapy beyond prostate-focused interventions [^111pZJjU]. Let me also not forget incontinence evaluation nuances: validated symptom scores, bladder diary, and pad testing are recommended for structured assessment when urinary incontinence is present, ensuring we do not miss non-BPH drivers or mixed pathophysiology that would alter management plans [^112ESfAh].

> I need to check imaging indications because they are often overused. Imaging of the prostate is recommended when considering surgical treatment, and can be considered to assist in selecting medical therapy when it clarifies prostate size or configuration including median lobe, while upper urinary tract ultrasound is recommended selectively in LUTS where upper tract involvement is suspected or when clinical context warrants it, rather than as a blanket screen [^112EVVum] [^1146zrZS]. Before interventions, AUA 2024 further supports assessing prostate size and shape by ultrasound, cystoscopy, or cross-sectional imaging if available, with standardized size categories to inform procedural selection across small, moderate, large, and very large glands, which I should remember to integrate for pre-procedural planning rather than initial triage alone [^11739kap] [^115XF8zA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about obstruction without pressure-flow confirmation in complex cases. Noninvasive surrogates are not recommended as alternatives to urodynamics for diagnosing bladder outlet obstruction, and pressure-flow studies should be considered before invasive treatment when diagnostic uncertainty exists, particularly in men with inadequate voided volume during testing or when voided volume consistently remains below about 150 mL, where EAU recommends obtaining urodynamic studies if invasion is being considered [^1161gGwa] [^115PEhXb] [^116HUV5e]. I should confirm that this is a targeted test rather than routine for all patients to balance diagnostic yield, patient burden, and procedural risk, which aligns with contemporary guideline nuance [^115PEhXb] [^1161gGwa].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis carefully so I do not misattribute LUTS to BPH. Painful LUTS suggests chronic prostatitis or pelvic pain syndromes, sterile pyuria or culture-positive urine suggests infection, hematuria requires evaluation for malignancy or stones, neurological findings push toward neurogenic bladder, and overlapping imaging features across prostate conditions mean that even sophisticated tools like mpMRI can require biopsy for clarification in selected scenarios when cancer is suspected based on PSA, exam, or imaging patterns [^111H3wT4] [^115m1uvc]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost suggested advanced molecular imaging routinely, but I should correct that impulse: PSMA-PET can yield false positives in BPH and is not part of the standard LUTS/BPH diagnostic algorithm, reinforcing the primacy of guideline-directed, stepwise evaluation rather than early adoption of advanced modalities without a clear oncologic indication [^115PNafZ].

> I should confirm triggers that change diagnostic urgency or route patients to procedural evaluation. Indications for surgical management include BPH-related renal insufficiency, refractory urinary retention, recurrent UTIs, bladder stones or gross hematuria due to BPH, or LUTS refractory to or in patients unwilling to use other therapies, and these conditions should prompt expedited reassessment and often imaging and cystoscopic evaluation before definitive intervention planning [^112ZMJ5o]. Let me also remember that while diagnostic pathways lead to therapy choices, alpha-blockers are an excellent first-line medication for symptomatic patients once serious alternatives are excluded, but that belongs to treatment planning after diagnostic clarification rather than as part of the initial exclusionary workup [^113KWhdq].

> To synthesize, I need to ensure the pathway remains sequential and evidence-based: establish symptom phenotype and bother, quantify with IPSS and QoL, examine including DRE, obtain urinalysis, measure PVR and uroflow as feasible, selectively measure PSA with counseling where it will change decisions, use bladder diaries for storage-predominant symptoms, and reserve imaging and urodynamics for scenarios where results will alter management or before interventions, while continuously watching for red flags that mandate an oncologic or urgent urologic route rather than routine BPH evaluation, and I should recheck each step against EAU and AUA touchpoints before finalizing the diagnostic plan [^114MiWjR] [^11324X6e] [^116zaVUu] [^115A5reb] [^111pZJjU] [^11739kap] [^115PEhXb].

Diagnose BPH by confirming **LUTS with IPSS** [^114MiWjR] [^111Np3jy] and **DRE for prostate size/consistency** [^112NxLdm]. Obtain **urinalysis** [^1133Q5tt] to exclude infection, measure **post-void residual** [^116zaVUu], and perform **uroflowmetry** [^11324X6e] to assess obstruction. Use **PSA** selectively when results will change management [^115A5reb] [^114iWikc], and consider imaging (ultrasound [^1146zrZS] or MRI) [^11739kap] if planning intervention [^112EVVum] or if cancer is suspected. Differentiate BPH from prostate cancer [^1132KNzx], prostatitis, and urethral stricture with clinical assessment, PSA, and imaging as needed [^111H3wT4].

---

## Clinical presentation and symptom assessment

BPH typically presents with **LUTS**, including:

- **Obstructive symptoms**: Hesitancy [^117AzJAp], weak stream [^116phYin], straining, prolonged voiding, incomplete emptying, postvoid dribble, split stream.

- **Irritative symptoms**: Frequency [^117AzJAp], urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence, reduced voiding volumes [^116phYin].

- **Post-micturition symptoms**: Sensation of incomplete emptying [^117AzJAp], postvoid dribble.

The International Prostate Symptom Score (**IPSS**) [^111Np3jy] is a validated EAU-recommended tool [^114MiWjR] for initial assessment and follow-up that quantifies symptom severity and quality-of-life impact.

---

## Physical examination

A digital rectal examination (**DRE**) [^112NxLdm] is mandatory to assess prostate size and consistency and to exclude malignancy. Findings consistent with BPH include a smooth, enlarged, firm prostate.

---

## Laboratory tests

Obtain **urinalysis** [^1133Q5tt] to exclude urinary tract infection or hematuria. Measure prostate-specific antigen (PSA) selectively [^115A5reb] when results will influence management or if cancer is suspected [^114iWikc]. Patients should be counseled on PSA implications [^116vSFvD].

---

## Imaging studies

Transrectal or abdominal **ultrasound** [^1146zrZS] is recommended to assess prostate size and shape, especially before interventions [^11739kap]. **MRI** should be considered when prostate cancer is suspected or to delineate prostate anatomy in detail.

---

## Urodynamic studies

- **Uroflowmetry**: Recommended to assess urinary flow rate and obstruction severity [^111CDoum] [^11324X6e].

- **Post-void residual (PVR)**: Measure to evaluate incomplete bladder emptying [^116h18Qo] [^116zaVUu].

- **Pressure-flow studies**: Consider when diagnostic uncertainty exists or before invasive treatment [^115PEhXb] [^116HUV5e].

---

## Differential diagnosis

It is essential to differentiate BPH from other causes of **LUTS**:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnostic tests** |
|-|-|-|
| Prostate cancer | - Elevated PSA <br/> - Abnormal DRE <br/> - Suspicious MRI | - PSA <br/> - MRI <br/> - Biopsy [^1132KNzx] |
| Prostatitis | - Pain <br/> - Fever <br/> - Dysuria <br/> - Elevated PSA | - Clinical assessment <br/> - PSA <br/> - MRI [^1132KNzx] |
| Urethral stricture | - Weak stream <br/> - Straining <br/> - History of trauma or infection | - Uroflowmetry <br/> - Cystoscopy |

---

## Risk factors and progression

Risk factors for BPH include **advancing age**, family history, obesity [^115mfP28], diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease [^1127wzht] [^117AzJAp]. BPH is a progressive condition [^113gUSZM] that may lead to acute urinary retention, urinary tract infections, bladder stones, and renal insufficiency if untreated [^112ZMJ5o].

---

## Summary of diagnostic approach

- **Clinical assessment**: IPSS [^114MiWjR], DRE [^112NxLdm], urinalysis [^1133Q5tt], selective PSA [^115A5reb].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, MRI if indicated [^11739kap] [^1146zrZS].

- **Urodynamics**: Uroflowmetry [^11324X6e], PVR [^116zaVUu], pressure-flow studies if needed [^115PEhXb].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Exclude prostate cancer, prostatitis, urethral stricture [^1132KNzx].

---

Diagnosing BPH requires a **structured approach** [^1133Q5tt] integrating symptom assessment, physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging, and urodynamic studies, while excluding other causes of LUTS.

### Differential diagnosis of uncommon prostate diseases: Combining mpMRI and clinical information [^1132KNzx]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Common prostatic diseases, other than typical benign lesions such as acinar adenocarcinoma, BPH, and prostatitis, are usually inert or chronic. They can present varying degrees of elevated serum PSA levels or disturbing symptoms such as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), impacting the quality of life as a long-term problem for males, particularly elderly males. This is because BPH and prostate cancer are age-related conditions. PSAs are proteinases produced mainly in the epithelial cells of the prostate. When various factors cause the destruction of epithelial cells or the blood-epithelial barrier, there is a substantial increase in PSA secretion from tumor cells, or an increase in the entry of PSAs into the blood, resulting in elevated serum PSA levels.

- **Prostate cancer (PCa)**: PCa is among the most common groups of malignancies occurring in the male population after lung cancer, with acinar adenocarcinoma being the most prevalent type observed. On MRI, csPCa presents with homogeneous and moderate hypointensity on T2WI, hyperintensity on high b-value DWI, a low ADC, and early enhancement, without capsules, and easily forms extraprostatic extensions (EPEs). These findings lead to a PI-RADS 4–5 classification.

- **Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)**: BPH is the fifth most prevalent non-cancer-related disorder among men aged 50 or older. By the age of 60, the prevalence of BPH is 50%, and it increases to 80% by the age of 80. BPH tissue produces PSA and primarily arises in the transition zone (TZ). BPH consists of glandular hyperplasia and stromal hyperplasia. Predominantly glandular BPH nodules exhibit moderate hyperintensity.

### EAU guidelines on benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) [^116WaV8z]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective is to establish guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of BPH.

- **Methods**: A search of published work was conducted using Medline. In combination with expert opinions, recommendations were made on the usefulness of tests for assessment and follow-up, categorizing them as mandatory, recommended, or optional. Additionally, indications and outcomes for the different therapeutic options were reviewed.

- **Results**: A digital rectal examination is mandatory in the assessment for the diagnosis of BPH. Recommended tests include the International Prostate Symptom Score, creatinine measurement (or renal ultrasound), uroflowmetry, and postvoid residual urine volume. All other tests are optional. The aim of treatment is to improve patients' quality of life, depending on the severity of BPH symptoms. A watchful waiting policy is recommended for patients with mild symptoms, medical treatment for those with mild-moderate symptoms, and surgery for patients who failed medication or conservative management and who have moderate-severe symptoms and/or complications of BPH that require surgery. For non-surgical treatments, transurethral microwave thermotherapy is the most attractive option. These treatments should be reserved for patients who prefer to avoid surgery or who no longer respond favorably to medication. Finally, recommendations for follow-up tests and a recommended follow-up schedule after BPH treatment are provided.

- **Conclusions**: Recommendations for assessment, possible therapeutic options, and follow-up of patients with BPH are made.

### Differential diagnosis of uncommon prostate diseases: Combining mpMRI and clinical information [^111H3wT4]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of abnormalities in the prostate is broad, including both common and less common conditions. Common conditions encompass acinar adenocarcinoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis, hemorrhage, cysts, calcifications, atrophy, and fibrosis. Less common conditions include tumors other than acinar adenocarcinoma, granulomatous prostatitis containing tuberculosis, abscesses, other conditions, and idiopathic disorders such as amyloidosis and exophytic benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate gland and imaging guidelines — such as the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.1 (PI-RADS v2.1) — have dramatically improved the ability to distinguish common abnormalities, particularly in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Despite these advancements, overlap can exist in the clinical history and imaging features associated with various common and uncommon prostate abnormalities, necessitating biopsy, which is invasive.

Prostate abnormalities can be divided into two categories:

- **Category 1**: Diseases for which PI-RADS scores are suitable for use.
- **Category 2**: Diseases for which PI-RADS scores are unsuitable for use.

Radiologists must possess an intimate knowledge of other diseases, especially uncommon conditions. Past relevant history, symptoms, age, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, MRI manifestations, and the applicability of the PI-RADS assessment should be considered when diagnosing prostate abnormalities.

### Prevention of benign prostatic hyperplasia disease [^113gUSZM]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed the evidence that benign prostatic hyperplasia is a progressive condition. Men at risk for benign prostatic hyperplasia disease can be identified, treated, and protected to a meaningful extent regardless of symptom status.

- **Materials and methods**: The MEDLINE database was searched in four areas of interest relating to benign prostatic hyperplasia. These areas include: 1) progression of clinical manifestations with age, especially concerning baseline symptom status, 2) incidence of complications due to disease progression, 3) use of predictive factors that may help identify men at risk for disease progression, and 4) prevention of benign prostatic hyperplasia disease with medical therapy.

- **Results**: Tissue changes in the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) are inevitable consequences of aging. However, benign prostatic hyperplasia disease, which we define as a life-altering urinary condition requiring medical intervention, is predictable and preventable. Benign prostatic hyperplasia disease progression is associated with increasing prostate volume, decreasing urinary flow, and symptomatic deterioration often to the point of major lifestyle interference and serious complications, such as acute urinary retention and the need for surgery. The risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia disease progression was found to be directly related to prostate volume and its surrogate marker, serum prostate-specific antigen, after prostate cancer is excluded. Other factors, such as baseline symptoms and the flow rate, were found to be less relevant compared with prostate-specific antigen.

Prevalence data processing

The processing of these data sources has been described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, for claims data, we used the unique enrollee identification numbers to link inpatient and outpatient claims to a single individual. An enrollee was then extracted as a prevalent case if they had at least one inpatient or two outpatient medical encounters with any of the defining ICD codes for benign prostatic hyperplasia in either the primary or secondary diagnostic position.

Processing of inpatient admissions data involved converting benign prostatic hyperplasia admission counts into cause fractions, which are the number of hospital admissions specifically for benign prostatic hyperplasia divided by the total number of admissions in the data year. These cause fractions were then multiplied by the hospital admission rate per capita and the total population size for each unique source, age, sex, and year combination to convert data to population-level inpatient admission rates. Details of the data and methods used to estimate hospital admission rates and population sizes have been previously described. Population-level benign prostatic hyperplasia admission rates were then transformed to population prevalence data by applying a ratio of total benign prostatic hyperplasia cases to inpatient benign prostatic hyperplasia admissions modelled from claims data.

We treated claims data and outpatient-adjusted inpatient admission data from Taiwan (province of China) and Poland as reference data, meeting our ICD-based case definition and representing a general population.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^111wY98Q]. The Lancet. Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

Data used for estimating the symptomatic proportion of benign prostatic hyperplasia prevalence and for estimating disability weights were more limited than prevalence data. Disability weights associated with health state descriptions used in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) are derived from a series of face-to-face, telephone, and internet surveys conducted over several years and in nine countries, and these are reported in a series of publications. If these nine countries are poorly representative of the values surrounding health in other countries, this could misrepresent the disability globally. Estimation of the proportion of doctor-diagnosed symptomatic versus asymptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia cases rests on an even smaller database. We used four community-based surveys of International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) scores to calculate the pooled proportion of symptomatic cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This approach makes two important assumptions: that the distribution of I-PSS scores in community-based samples is similar to the distribution of I-PSS scores among cases identified from administrative data, and that the distribution of I-PSS scores from these four surveys done in Japan, the United States, Scotland, and France is reflective of the global distribution.

We acknowledge a pair of analytical limitations. Due to the GBD principle of assigning every death in our estimation framework to a single underlying cause of death, we elected to assign deaths related to benign prostatic hyperplasia to other diseases in the cascade of events that lead to death. Mortality related to benign prostatic hyperplasia was therefore not directly attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Clinical evaluation of prostate cancer gene 3 score in diagnosis among Chinese men with prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia [^116e6m3A]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men. Due to the low specificity of diagnosis methods for detecting prostate cancer, the identification of new biomarkers is highly desirable. This study was conducted to determine the clinical utility of the prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) assay to predict biopsy-detected cancers in Chinese men.

- **Methods**: The study included men who had a biopsy at The Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital of Shanghai Jiao Tong University from January 2013 to December 2013. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were used to test PCA3 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) mRNA. The diagnostic accuracy of the PCA3 score for predicting a positive biopsy outcome was evaluated using sensitivity and specificity and was compared with PSA.

- **Results**: The probability of a positive biopsy increased with increasing PCA3 scores. The mean PCA3 score was significantly higher in men with prostate cancer (198.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 74.79–321.27) compared to those with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (84.31, 95% CI 6.47–162.15, P < 0.01). The PCA3 score, with a cutoff of 35, showed a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 62.5%. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated higher areas under the ROC curve for the PCA3 score compared to PSA, though this was not statistically significant.

- **Conclusions**: Increased PCA3 in biopsy tissue correlated with prostate cancer, and the PCA3 assay may improve diagnostic efficacy, being independent of PSA level. The diagnostic significance of urinary PCA3 testing should be explored in future studies to develop more effective diagnostic protocols.

### Global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia from 1990 to 2021 and projection to 2035 [^112TucPN]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the persistent burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) continues to pose a critical public health challenge. The escalating prevalence among middle-aged and elderly populations underscores the imperative to tackle this widespread condition. Formulating strategies that emphasize prevention, facilitate timely diagnosis, and ensure effective management can contribute to mitigating both the direct and indirect impacts of BPH, ultimately reducing the overall burden of the disease.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^114og8wu]. The Lancet. Healthy Longevity (2022). High credibility.

Research in context

- **Evidence before this study**: Given that the global population is both growing and aging, addressing the burden of age-associated diseases, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, has become a global health priority. Although a systematic review was not conducted before producing and reporting these estimates, we identified many studies that have examined the prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia in different communities. However, varied case definitions, research methodologies, access to care, diagnostic modalities, and coding practices created a challenge in assessing and comparing the disease burden across different populations and over time. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) assembles data from diverse sources worldwide and applies standardized data processing and modeling techniques to facilitate like-versus-like comparisons across time and space. Previous GBD publications on multiple diseases, and a previous study by Launer and colleagues based on GBD 2017 estimates, reported a rising burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia worldwide.

- **Added value of this study**: The present study overcomes some of the limitations of epidemiological studies conducted in one or a few locations by making use of the GBD modeling methods. This approach leverages international administrative data to systematically estimate the prevalence of, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with, benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories between 2000 and 2019. We extended and improved upon the results of GBD 2017.

### Importance of individual response in symptom score evaluation [^113gU9WQ]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

In making treatment decisions for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), physicians rely on the efficacy data published in the literature and adapt this to individual patients' needs. Criticism can be made, however, of the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that are performed, as the patients enrolled are not an adequate reflection of the general patient population. Although internal validity is high in RCTs with regard to inclusion criteria, external validity is reduced. Another failing of RCTs is the way in which patients are assessed. Typically, in many studies, symptom improvement is expressed as a percentage of the Symptom Index improvement. This can be misleading if the results of two trials are compared, as this value depends on the pre-treatment Symptom Index.

Other methods of evaluation should be considered, such as the presentation of direct symptom outcomes (threshold improvement), the cumulative frequency distribution of threshold improvements, or linear regression analysis of individual IPSS. All of these means of expressing the results focus clinical evaluation on the patient himself.

### Simple case definition of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia, based on International Prostate Symptom Score, predicts general practitioner consultation rates [^117KGYgz]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

To determine which case definition of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has the best predictive value for general practitioner visits for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of BPH, a longitudinal, population-based study was conducted from 1995 to 2003. It involved 1688 men aged 50 to 78 years old. The study also determined the incidence and prevalence rates of general practitioner visits for LUTS. Data were collected on physical urologic parameters, quality of life, and symptom severity as determined by the International Prostate Symptom Score. Information on the health-care-seeking behavior of all participants was gathered from general practitioner (GP) records using a computerized search engine alongside a manual check of the electronically selected files.

The results indicated that the incidence and prevalence rates of men at risk were 19.6% and 14.0%, respectively, with these rates increasing with age. In terms of sensitivity and positive predictive value, the case definition of clinical BPH, characterized by an International Prostate Symptom Score greater than 7, provided the best predictive value for GP visits for LUTS within two years after the baseline assessment.

Because only marginal improvement (greater specificity but lower sensitivity) in predicting GP visits for LUTS was achievable by adding information on prostate volume and flow, it is suggested for predicting future GP visits for LUTS suggestive of BPH that the International Prostate Symptom Score questionnaire should be utilized, and that estimation of prostate volume and flow is not necessary.

### Obesity and benign prostatic hyperplasia: Clinical connections, emerging etiological paradigms and future directions [^115mfP28]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is a highly prevalent disease in older men with substantial adverse effects on public health. Classic etiological paradigms for benign prostatic hyperplasia focus on nonmodifiable risk factors; however, obesity also potentially promotes benign prostatic hyperplasia.

We performed a structured, comprehensive literature review to identify studies of obesity, benign prostatic hyperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, and physical activity.

A preponderance of published evidence suggests strong positive associations of obesity with benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms. This evidence encompasses most established metrics of adiposity, including body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio, and falls under three general categories, including prostate volume, clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia, and lower urinary tract symptoms.

- **Prostate volume**: Prior studies consistently showed that increased adiposity is positively associated with radiographically determined prostate volume and enlargement, suggesting that obesity promotes prostate growth.

- **Clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia**: Most studies revealed that obesity increases the risk of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia by several measures, including the initiation of benign prostatic hyperplasia medical treatment, noncancer prostate surgery, physician-diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia, histological diagnosis, and urinary flow rate.

- **Lower urinary tract symptoms**: Prior studies demonstrated that obesity increases the risk of lower urinary tract symptoms, as measured by a validated questionnaire.

### Global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia from 1990 to 2021 and projection to 2035 [^11297ThZ]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Our study found that the highest incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) occurs at the age range of 60–79, while individuals over 80 experience the highest prevalence of BPH by 2035. This finding underscores the crucial period, specifically the age range of 60 to 79, when BPH is most likely to develop due to various biological and hormonal changes that men experience as they age.

By 2035, the demographic shift towards an older population could lead to a significant increase in the number of BPH cases among individuals aged 80 and older, creating a heavy disease burden. It is important to note that the progression of BPH is often gradual and may not initially present with significant symptoms. However, as men age, the enlargement of the prostate gland can compress the urethra, leading to a variety of urinary symptoms such as frequent urination, urgency, difficulty in starting urination, and a weak urine stream. These symptoms can significantly impact a man's quality of life and may necessitate medical intervention.

Therefore, targeted screening and early diagnosis programs could be implemented for men in their 50s and 60s, when the incidence of BPH is rapidly rising, to identify and manage the condition before it progresses to more severe stages. Moreover, research into the underlying mechanisms of BPH progression and the identification of modifiable risk factors could aid in developing novel therapeutic approaches and reducing the burden of the disease. Lifestyle modifications, such as maintaining a healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity, and managing other comorbidities like diabetes, may also be beneficial.

### The American Urological Association symptom index for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The Measurement Committee of the American Urological Association [^111Np3jy]. The Journal of Urology (1992). High credibility.

The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) is a clinical calculator used primarily in the field of urology. It is specifically designed for men who are suspected of having benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common condition in older men characterized by an enlarged prostate. The IPSS assesses the severity of a patient's urinary symptoms and their impact on quality of life. It includes seven questions related to urinary symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, and weak stream, and one question about quality of life. Each question is scored from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms or a greater impact on quality of life. The total score can range from 0 to 35. The IPSS is not suitable for use in women or in men who have already been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection, bladder stones, or prostate cancer, as these conditions can also cause urinary symptoms.

The IPSS is a valuable tool for evaluating urinary symptom severity based on a set of seven questions. These questions focus on various urinary issues experienced over the past month, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of symptoms often associated with prostate conditions.

The questions cover the following areas:

- **The feeling of not fully emptying the bladder after urination**: This evaluates whether individuals feel they cannot completely relieve themselves.
- **The need to urinate again within two hours after finishing**: This assesses the frequency of urination and the degree to which it is influenced by incomplete emptying.

### Race and socioeconomic status are independently associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^113ujhkt]. The Journal of Urology (2008).

Prostate enlargement is common as men age. However, differences in the diagnosis or treatment of clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) between black and white men remain poorly understood. We investigated racial differences in, and surgical intervention for, BPH in a large and predominantly low-income population.

Participants included 21,949 men, of whom 79.8% were black and 20.2% were white, recruited from 60 community health centers in the southeastern United States between 2002 and 2007. BPH, surgical intervention for BPH, and economic and demographic indexes — such as education, household income, health insurance, and marital status — were determined by an in-person interview. Logistic regression was used to summarize the association between race and BPH while controlling for health care access and socioeconomic status.

Black men were approximately half as likely to report a BPH diagnosis compared to white men (4.1% vs. 9.9%, age-adjusted OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.40, 0.51), a difference that persisted with only small abatement after controlling for age, income, insurance coverage, comorbidity, education, and other factors (adjusted OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.43, 0.56). Among men with BPH, surgical intervention for that condition was more prevalent in black men versus white men (12.9% vs. 9.1%, adjusted OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.10, 2.48).

After controlling for economic factors associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, racial disparities in diagnosis and surgical intervention remained evident.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia: Clinical manifestations and evaluation [^115cJoQd]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a very common condition related to aging, leading to symptoms known as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Given its high prevalence, it is crucial for clinicians managing patients with BPH to adhere to the strict recommendations for BPH evaluation. This article outlines the steps and procedures physicians should follow to evaluate these patients. It reviews the symptoms and signs of BPH as well as the clinical evaluation steps and examinations that are available.

The basic evaluation of patients with BPH should include, according to the recommendations of the most relevant international guidelines, an evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms with appropriate symptom scores, digital rectal examination, voiding charts, measurement of prostate-specific antigen and creatinine, urinalysis, and imaging of the urinary tract.

### Managing patients with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^115cwx6k]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Many men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia can be managed safely and effectively by primary care providers. After a basic evaluation to exclude other diseases that may cause lower urinary tract symptoms, quantifying the degree of symptoms and bother, and perhaps making an assessment of prostate size, the primary care provider can determine which men require immediate evaluation by a urologist and which men may choose among various treatment options, including watchful waiting and various single-agent or combination medication strategies. Recent information about risk factors for disease progression has also helped to inform patient decisions on which treatment option is best for the individual patient. The purpose of this review is to provide primary care providers with an approach to the management of men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of new surgical treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114ffU2t]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia are the most common urological problem among men, affecting about a third of men over age 50. Surgical intervention is the most effective treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, with around 100,000 procedures carried out annually in the United States. Of all surgical treatments, monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), in which the enlarged prostate tissue is resected piece by piece using a monopolar electrode, has been the preferred method since the 1970s. It can substantially improve the maximal flow rate (Qmax), urinary symptoms (based on the international prostate symptom score (IPSS)), and health-related quality of life, with long-term efficacy compared with drugs or other minimally invasive treatments. However, monopolar TURP is a risky procedure because of the likelihood of severe complications such as massive bleeding or transurethral resection syndrome. Therefore, minimally invasive surgical techniques need to be developed with outcomes similar to those of monopolar TURP, but with fewer side effects.

Since the 2000s, new energy systems for surgical interventions treating benign prostatic hyperplasia have quickly become popular, including systems that use bipolar energy and various laser systems such as the holmium laser, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, thulium laser, and diode laser. The trend in surgical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia has shifted from monopolar TURP to laser treatments and bipolar TURP over the past 10 years. Bipolar energy can be

### The urologist view of BPH progression: results of an international survey [^113wJvEC]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

To assess the opinion amongst the international urological community on whether benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a progressive disease, a 15-item questionnaire was distributed to the mailing list of the publication European Urology Today, as well as being accessed through the website of the European Association of Urology (EAU).

A total of 472 completed questionnaires from 47 countries were evaluated. Overall, the urologists surveyed agreed that BPH was a progressive disease and that some patients were more prone to this progression than others. Increased post-void residual urine, reduced flow rate, increased urinary symptoms, and urodynamic evidence of obstruction were considered to be the most significant risk factors for progression. Half of the urologists surveyed considered that medical therapies could prevent progression of BPH, while a significant proportion thought that surgery was an effective preventative measure.

BPH, although a benign disease, has a considerable impact on the patient's quality of life. Its progressive nature and the identification of risk factors for progression warrant further investigation. In the future, there is likely to be a shift in the paradigm from treatment of BPH complications to include the prevention of BPH progression.

### A comprehensive approach toward novel serum biomarkers for benign prostatic hyperplasia: the MPSA Consortium [^113uqsup]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia is primarily diagnosed based on a diverse array of progressive lower urinary tract symptoms. It is likely distinct from histological benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is detected by the presence of nonmalignant proliferation of prostate cells but may or may not be associated with symptoms. Pharmacological management of lower urinary tract symptoms has emerged as an effective initial treatment for clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia due to the introduction of new drug therapies shown to be effective in recent large clinical trials. Despite advances in symptom management and research into disease pathology, diagnostic strategies for predicting the progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia and response to drug modalities are lacking. Additionally, questions remain about the molecular differences underlying clinical (symptomatic) versus histological (nonsymptomatic) benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Materials and methods**: As part of the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) clinical trial, which demonstrated the effectiveness of combination drug therapy in slowing benign prostatic hyperplasia progression, an archive of biological specimens linked to clinical data was collected. This collection is intended for future profiling of disease pathology and changes associated with response to drug therapy. The MTOPS Prostatic Samples Analysis (MPSA) Consortium was established to identify and validate molecular markers that may better define benign prostatic hyperplasia-related pathologies, identify the risk of progression of lower urinary tract symptoms, and predict response.

### Symptomatic benign prostate hyperplasia: Impact on partners' quality of life [^116txDhX]. European Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Symptomatic benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), besides affecting patients' quality of life through lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and related acute events, may also affect their partners' quality of life. This study focused on exploring partner morbidity in cases of symptomatic BPH patients being evaluated for surgical treatment.

The study group comprised 50 couples where male partners suffered from symptomatic BPH and were referred for further evaluation and, possibly, surgical treatment. Male subjects completed the IPSS form, while female partners separately filled out a structured questionnaire addressing seven items: sleep disturbance, social disruption, performance of essential tasks, psychological impact, sex life, fear of cancer, and fear of surgery. Data were analyzed in relation to the severity of symptoms (IPSS), patient's and partner's age, couple's age difference, marriage duration, and mode and place of living.

- **Results**:

	- **Partners' morbidity due to their husbands' condition included**:

	- Sleep disturbance (28%).
	- Disruption of social life (30%), positively related to IPSS and negatively to symptom duration.
	- Inability to take care of essential tasks outside and inside the house (8%).
	- Psychological burden (66%), positively related to the wife's age, the couple's age difference, and the marriage duration.
	- Inadequate sex life (48%).
	- Fear of prostate cancer (62%).
	- Fear of surgery (82%).

Partners of patients with symptomatic BPH experience significant morbidity due to their partners' condition.

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia-related false-positive of prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: The Achilles' heel of biopsy-free radical prostatectomy [^115PNafZ]. The Journal of Urology (2023). Low credibility.

Radical prostatectomy is one of the primary treatments for localized clinically significant prostate cancer, generally based on prior biopsy. PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen)-PET (positron emission tomography) is considered promising in biopsy-free radical prostatectomy. However, the expression of PSMA in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue and the corresponding positive reaction are crucial concerns for a no-biopsy strategy. Currently, no study has explored the benign prostatic hyperplasia-related false-positive of PSMA-PET in the detection of prostate cancer. Furthermore, the influence of maximum standardized uptake value and Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System on biopsy-free radical prostatectomy is also poorly characterized.

A retrospective study was conducted on patients who received PSMA-PET due to clinical suspicion of prostate cancer and were confirmed to have benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostate cancer. The receiver operating characteristic curve was generated for the maximum standardized uptake value. Of interest were the false-positive rate of PSMA-PET and the efficacy of maximum standardized uptake value or multiparametric MRI in excluding false-positives.

The benign prostatic hyperplasia-related false-positive rate of PSMA-PET in detecting prostate cancer was 30%. Maximum standardized uptake value could effectively exclude benign prostatic hyperplasia and Grade Group 1 patients, with an area under the curve of 0.86. The optimal maximum standardized uptake value cutoff value with 100% specificity was identified.

### The link between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer [^114uZZif]. Nature Reviews Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer are among the most common diseases of the prostate gland and represent significant burdens for patients and health-care systems in many countries. The two diseases share traits such as hormone-dependent growth and response to antiandrogen therapy. Furthermore, risk factors such as prostate inflammation and metabolic disruption play key roles in the development of both diseases. Despite these commonalities, BPH and prostate cancer exhibit important differences in terms of histology and localization.

Large-scale epidemiological studies have shown that men with BPH have an increased risk of prostate cancer and prostate-cancer-related mortality, although it remains unclear whether this association reflects a causal link, shared risk factors or pathophysiological mechanisms, or detection bias upon statistical analysis. Establishing BPH as a causal factor for prostate cancer development could improve the accuracy of prognostication and expedite intervention, potentially reducing the number of men who die from prostate cancer.

The disability weight represents the severity of health loss associated with a generic health state, described in lay language. It ranges from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (death). Disability weights for generic health states were estimated using nine large population-based surveys and one open-access internet survey where participants were asked to compare pairwise combinations of health states. Two health states were assigned to benign prostatic hyperplasia: asymptomatic and symptomatic. The symptomatic health state has a disability weight of 0.067 (95% CI 0.043–0.097). The asymptomatic health state has a disability weight of zero, assuming no 95% CIs.

To determine what proportion of the estimated benign prostatic hyperplasia prevalence to assign to the symptomatic health state, we used data from four community-based surveys from Japan, the United States, Scotland, and France that recruited men aged 40–84 years. The surveys used the International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS), a validated questionnaire, to measure the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms among men. We modeled the cumulative distribution of the I-PSS scores in survey participants using MR-BRT to estimate the mean proportion of individuals with symptomatic lower urinary tract symptoms. The symptomatic and asymptomatic proportions were applied to the prevalence estimates from DisMod-MR to produce estimates of the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Economic evaluation of treatment strategies for benign prostatic hyperplasia — is medical therapy more costly in the long run [^1147E3YH]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Although medical therapy for newly diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia is initially less expensive than surgery, the long-term costs of these treatments are unknown. This study aimed to define the longer-term costs of these treatment strategies for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Materials and methods**: We examined spending on benign prostatic hyperplasia-related services by reviewing health care claims for a 5-year period following a new diagnosis. Expenditures for subjects initially treated with surgery were compared to those with initial medical treatment. We projected expenditures over longer periods and calculated the net value of these expenditures.

- **Results**: Of the 970 subjects identified who received treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, 913 (94.1%) relied on medical therapy as the initial treatment. Among these subjects, 832 (91.1%) were on alpha-blockers. The secondary treatment rates for surgery significantly exceeded those for medical therapy (37% vs. 8%). Average total expenditures were higher for subjects who initially received surgery ($12,699, 95% CI 9,865–15,533) compared to those initially treated with medication ($2,193, 95% CI 1,959–2,428). When future spending was discounted at standard rates (3%), the costs of initial medical therapy as a treatment strategy remained lower than those of initial surgical therapy, even at 40 years.

- **Conclusions**: In this cohort of privately insured men with newly diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia, monotherapy with alpha-blockers was the most common initial treatment.

### Benign prostate hyperplasia: A review of the year's progress from bench to clinic [^111Muqx8]. Current Opinion in Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Therapeutic tools for classic benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) have focused on the dynamic component of obstruction and/or the elimination of the static component via surgical or pharmaceutical therapies. Unfortunately, an exact cause for this disease process has not been identified, but additional insight has been achieved. This article presents an update of the BPH literature with a special focus on basic science or translational studies concerning the cause of clinically significant BPH with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Investigators are exploring connections between BPH with clinically significant LUTS, the metabolic syndrome, inflammation, alterations in cell signaling, and genetics, which in turn has provided additional information concerning the pathogenesis, medical therapies, and surgical therapies.

BPH is a chronic, progressive disease with significant care implications and financial risks to the healthcare system. Continued improvements in life expectancy will demand unlocking the cause of LUTS secondary to BPH, with the goal of prevention as the ideal therapy. Studies reported in the last year contributed to our understanding of the disease process and provide insight for additional studies.

### The overlapping lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis [^11394Myz]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

To investigate the relationship, diagnosis, and treatment of the overlapping lower urinary tract symptoms experienced by men diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis, recent studies have shown that men can suffer from both conditions. Approximately 5–20% of men diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia experience prostatitis-like symptoms, and over one-third of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia have had a previous diagnosis of prostatitis. Differentiation between these conditions can be challenging due to overlapping symptoms; however, chronic prostatitis is typically identified by the presence of pain.

Treatment options for men with co-occurring benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis may include alpha-blockers, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, and phytotherapies such as saw palmetto and bee pollen extract. Evidence strongly supports the effectiveness of alpha-blocker therapy.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia and chronic prostatitis are common causes of lower urinary tract symptoms and frequently co-occur in older men. The optimal treatment for such symptoms involves the use of alpha-blockers.

### Enhanced clinical decisions for management of benign prostatic hyperplasia using patient-reported outcomes: Protocol for a prospective observational study [^112Tpica]. BMC Urology (2024). High credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) significantly impact the quality of life among older men. Despite the prevalent use of the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) for BPH, this measure overlooks key symptoms such as pain and incontinence, underscoring the need for more comprehensive patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools. This study aims to integrate enhanced PROs into routine clinical practice to better capture the spectrum of LUTS, thereby improving clinical outcomes and patient care.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study will recruit men with LUTS secondary to BPH aged ≥ 50 years from urology clinics. Participants will be stratified into medical and surgical management groups, with PRO assessments scheduled at regular intervals to monitor LUTS and other health outcomes. The study will employ the LURN Symptom Index (SI)-29 alongside the traditional AUA-SI and other non-urologic PROs to evaluate a broad range of symptoms. Data on comorbidities, symptom severity, and treatment efficacy will be collected through a combination of electronic health records and PROs. Analyses will focus on the predictive power of these tools in relation to symptom trajectories and treatment responses. Aims are to: (1) integrate routine clinical tests with PRO assessment to enhance the screening, diagnosis, and management of patients with BPH; (2) examine psychometric properties of the LURN SIs, including test-retest reliability and establishment of clinically meaningful differences; and (3) create care-coordination recommendations.

### Investigation of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1124mYYp]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

This is a concise and timely update of the most recent developments in the clinical research on the investigation of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

- **Recent findings**: Analysis of the peer-reviewed literature confirms a high level of consensus regarding the management of prostatic hyperplasia; analysis of practice trends suggests a satisfactory degree of adoption of the proposed guidelines. The evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms remains the mainstay in the investigation of prostatic hyperplasia, although problems concerning the evaluation of nocturia and the differential diagnosis between hyperplasia and chronic prostatitis were identified. Lower urinary tract symptoms have confirmed their value as predictors of disease progression. The extent of patient involvement in the decision-making process is increasing, and new tools to elicit patient preferences have been developed. A growing consensus on the concept of disease progression has been reached concerning prostatic hyperplasia. Analysis of patient sexual function is now considered an important part of the patient's interview. More sophisticated instruments, such as time trade-off values, have been successfully tested to elicit patient preferences in the management of prostate disease. The value of serum prostate-specific antigen as a predictor of prostate volume growth has recently been confirmed, even in an unselected male population.

Research into the investigation of benign prostatic hyperplasia provides new insight into the pathophysiology of lower urinary tract symptoms and identifies parameters to explore further.

### Differential diagnosis of uncommon prostate diseases: Combining mpMRI and clinical information [^115m1uvc]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of abnormalities in the prostate is extensive, encompassing both common conditions such as acinar adenocarcinoma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, chronic prostatitis, hemorrhage, cysts, calcifications, atrophy, and fibrosis, as well as less common conditions. These include tumors other than acinar adenocarcinoma, granulomatous prostatitis containing tuberculosis, abscesses, and other conditions, along with idiopathic disorders such as amyloidosis and exophytic benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate gland, combined with imaging guidelines like the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.1 (PI-RADS v2.1), have significantly enhanced the ability to distinguish common abnormalities, particularly in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Despite these advancements, there can be overlap in the clinical history and imaging features associated with various common and uncommon prostate abnormalities. Consequently, biopsy, although invasive, is often required.

Prostate abnormalities can be divided into two categories:

- **Category 1**: Diseases for which PI-RADS scores are suitable.
- **Category 2**: Diseases for which PI-RADS scores are unsuitable.

Radiologists must possess a thorough understanding of other diseases, particularly uncommon conditions. A comprehensive assessment should include consideration of past relevant history, symptoms, age, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, MRI manifestations, and the applicability of the PI-RADS assessment when diagnosing prostate abnormalities.

Evidence on the clinical presentation of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is scarce, and studies involving outpatients are lacking. This study aimed to provide insight into the contemporary Italian scenario of BPH-affected outpatients using symptom scores (International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS], BPH Impact Index [BII]) and to compare characteristics of patients with known BPH and those first diagnosed at the visit.

- **Methods**: The "IMPROVING THE PATH" project working group designed a questionnaire prospectively administered to BPH-affected outpatients by urologists. A cross-sectional study was performed, and data were adjusted for patient age as a potential confounding factor.

- **Results**: Of 5815 patients enrolled, BPH was already diagnosed in 4144 (71.3%) and not in 1671 (28.7%). Patients with known BPH, compared to newly diagnosed patients, were older (median 68 versus [vs] 55), and had more frequent smoking (smoker 27.2% vs 22.6%, and ex-smoker 16.4% vs 12.5%) and drinking habits (55.4% vs 45.1%). They were more frequently affected by hypertension (60.0% vs 42.4%), obesity (15.3% vs 9.6%), diabetes (17.9% vs 12.5%), and cardiovascular diseases (14.2% vs 9.5%), p < 0.001.

	- At IPSS, moderate and severe symptoms correlated with already known BPH (56.1% vs 47.3% and 24.8% vs 7.8%), whereas newly diagnosed patients showed milder symptoms (44.9% vs 19.1%), all p < 0.001. At BII, concern for one's health and time lost due to urinary problems were higher in patients with known BPH (p < 0.001). For these patients, the urologist changed at least one of the ongoing medications in 63.5%. For patients newly diagnosed, s

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia in primary care: What you need to know [^111Tca3G]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

We reviewed recent literature and treatment guidelines regarding the prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of bladder outlet obstruction (BPO) related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as well as the management of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to BPH.

Published literature and treatment concepts were reviewed concerning the diagnosis and treatment options for BPO. BPH is a histological diagnosis that can contribute to medical problems, including enlargement of the prostate and BPO. These conditions should be treated only if the symptoms are troublesome, there is considerable risk of progression, or cancer is suspected. Very effective medical and surgical options are available to treat BPO and improve patient quality of life.

BPO is highly treatable, but should be managed in close collaboration with the patient. Pharmacological agents and minimally invasive procedures, when appropriate, are generally preferred to more invasive surgery. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms usually can be treated by a primary care physician. More complicated cases should be referred to a urologist for evaluation and management.

### Patterns of care for newly diagnosed benign prostatic hyperplasia in the United States [^11483UXo]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Low credibility.

We examined diagnostic tests and treatment patterns in men with new onset benign prostatic hyperplasia using consolidated national electronic health record data.

- **Materials and methods**: The Humedica® electronic health record database consists of de-identified patient records from approximately 25 million patients in the United States. Using this database, men with a new benign prostatic hyperplasia diagnosis (benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder neck obstruction, urinary retention, and incomplete bladder emptying) between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2012, were included in the study. Exclusion criteria included conditions such as genitourinary cancers, radiation cystitis, neurogenic bladder, and urological pain diagnoses. Diagnostic tests and treatments were summarized and stratified by age (less than 65 vs. 65 years or greater) and serum prostate-specific antigen level.

- **Results**: A total of 38,252 men met the inclusion criteria. The mean follow-up was 1,020 days. Serum creatinine in 92% of patients, serum prostate-specific antigen in 76%, and urinalysis in 52% were the most common tests. Invasive testing was obtained in less than 20% of patients. Treatments included watchful waiting in 40% of patients, pharmacological therapy in 59.4%, and surgery in 2.2%. α-Blockers were prescribed in 50.7% of men. Men older than 65 years and with higher prostate-specific antigen levels were less likely to be treated with watchful waiting. Therapy with a 5-ARI (5-α reductase inhibitor) was prescribed in 23% to 29% of men across all prostate-specific antigen categories.

- **Conclusions**: The majority of c

### Risk factors for disease progression in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH): A systematic analysis of expert opinion [^115rg76s]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Disease progression has become an important issue for the management of lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH). Although several risk factors have been identified, no specific patient risk profiles have been established that can be useful in the day-to-day management of LUTS/BPH. In this study, an international panel of urologists developed a risk classification based on the attribution of a risk score to 243 unique patient profiles. From the perspective of clinical decision making, it was concluded that postvoid residual, symptom severity, and maximum flow rate are the most relevant determinants of the risk of disease progression.

### Landmarks in BPH: From aetiology to medical and surgical management [^113uWcTV]. Nature Reviews Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Clinicians treat the symptoms associated with BPH on a daily basis. Although BPH is nearly universal with age, not all men develop lower urinary tract symptoms. Over the past 100 years, several notable advances in the field of urology have not only improved our understanding of the aetiology and natural history of this common disease, but have also facilitated the development of therapeutics to effectively manage BPH-related symptoms. The high quality of modern-day diagnosis, as well as medical and surgical treatment for BPH, is a testimony to centuries of observation and decades of scientific research.

Regarding surgical interventions for benign prostatic hyperplasia, specifically with respect to indications for surgery, AUA 2024 guidelines recommend performing surgery in patients with any of the following conditions:

- **Renal insufficiency**: Secondary to BPH.

- **Refractory urinary retention**: Secondary to BPH.

- **Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs)**: Due to BPH.

- **Bladder stones or gross hematuria**: As a result of BPH.

- **Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)**: Attributed to BPH that are refractory to or for patients unwilling to use other therapies.

### Recent developments in guidelines on benign prostatic hyperplasia [^114hWYUz]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Guidelines within the healthcare system aim to rationalize the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of a particular disease. They can be applicable on an international scale or may be country-specific. Specialists prepare these guidelines by determining the clinical evidence for individual practices. The strength of these recommendations depends on the available evidence. The assessment of patients includes a minimal number of non-invasive tests. Additional, more invasive tests are recommended only in cases of abnormalities.

Treatment decisions should be evidence-based. However, despite the guidelines, the choice of treatment often relies on the personal preference of the urologist. Patients' awareness of different treatment options and their involvement in choosing a treatment are also increasing. Economical aspects are becoming increasingly important in making healthcare decisions. Data on the durability of treatments are limited and deserve special attention to provide the most cost-effective care for different patient groups.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: A systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^117T1vfK]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

Our study suggests a close and nuanced link between the benign prostatic hyperplasia burden and national sociodemographic status, highlighting the potential for intervention to make an impact. As noted, the absolute benign prostatic hyperplasia burden has increased globally between 2000 and 2019, but age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates were more stable. This pattern of rising absolute burden with stability or only small changes in age-standardized rates was seen in most regions and many countries, reflecting the major role of widespread population growth and aging in the substantial increase in benign prostatic hyperplasia cases.

A rising absolute burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia was observed across all Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) quintiles. The middle SDI quintile, in particular, carried the greatest absolute DALY burden by 2019. Notably, countries in the lowest three SDI quintiles (low, low-middle, and middle) had the largest percentage change in absolute DALYs between 2000 and 2019 and also had age-standardized DALY rates that overall trended upwards over the study period. In contrast, countries in the highest two SDI quintiles (high-middle and high) experienced somewhat smaller relative increases in absolute DALY counts and had age-standardized rates that overall trended downwards.

While population growth and aging are the two most important factors contributing to the rising burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia worldwide, divergent trends in age-standardized rates suggest some influence from other risk factors, such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia has been identified as a major urological health problem in older men in many countries. The prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia from descriptive epidemiology studies ranges from 12% to 42%, and one study estimated the lifetime risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia to be 29%. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Lee and colleagues in 2017 identified 30 population-based, hospital-based, and community-based epidemiological studies in different countries, yielding a 26% point prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia in older men for the years 1990–2016. Another meta-analysis conducted in China indicated that the pooled overall prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia among men aged 40 years or older was 36.6% during 1989–2014.

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is the largest and most comprehensive scientific effort to produce estimates of health loss due to 369 diseases and injuries. GBD overcomes some limitations of the epidemiological studies described above by utilizing a large number of administrative datasets from around the world, processing them in a comparable fashion, and using regional patterns and predictive covariates to provide the most precise annual estimates of disease burden possible for a large number of countries and territories, including those without primary data, over a long time series. The burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia has been estimated and included in comprehensive reports since GBD 2010, and Launer and colleagues previously reported the global…

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia [^117AzJAp]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2016). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which causes lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), is a common diagnosis among the aging male population with increasing prevalence. Many risk factors, both modifiable and non-modifiable, can increase the risk of development and progression of BPH and LUTS. The symptoms can be obstructive, resulting in urinary hesitancy, weak stream, straining or prolonged voiding, or irritative, resulting in increased urinary frequency and urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence, and reduced voiding volumes. Symptoms can also affect the patient after micturition, for example, postvoid dribble or incomplete emptying.

BPH occurs when both stromal and epithelial cells of the prostate in the transitional zone proliferate by processes thought to be influenced by inflammation and sex hormones, causing prostate enlargement. Patients with LUTS undergo several key diagnostic investigations before being diagnosed with BPH. Treatment options for men with BPH start at watchful waiting and progress through medical to surgical interventions. For the majority of patients, the starting point on the treatment pathway will be dictated by their symptoms and degree of bother.

### Modern evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms in 2014 [^11164Vm2]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate and present the evidence for the use of different investigation modalities in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia/lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in 2014.

- **Recent findings**: Cystometry remains the gold standard in differentiating obstructed from non-obstructed men with LUTS. Prostatic ultrasound measures, such as the intravesical prostatic protrusion, may be useful in counseling men before a trial without a catheter or commencing α antagonists. Using a higher cut-off, the bladder thickness/weight measurement has a higher sensitivity but lower specificity and may allow men with obstruction to be excluded from requiring cystometry. These and other techniques, such as near-infrared spectroscopy, penile cuff compression, and computational flow modeling, have shown good correlation with cystometry but still require more data, technical refinement, and standardization before they can be considered appropriate for routine clinical practice.

- **Summary**: The last few years have seen an increase in the data regarding less invasive methods of cystometry. Although these do not provide the same information as cystometry, they may have a role in answering specific questions and counseling men with benign prostatic hyperplasia/LUTS. The key to incorporating these techniques in the assessment of men will lie with standardization and use for specific indications.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: A systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^1121hhpr]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations, which can be broadly organized into limitations of prevalence inputs, severity inputs, and analytical considerations.

- **Prevalence inputs**: Data to estimate the prevalence of benign prostatic hyperplasia are sparse and heterogeneous, carrying inherent biases from administrative records in medical facilities and claims. Despite using international administrative data in our analyses, we lacked prevalence data for many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, Australasia, South Asia, Andean Latin America, and Eastern Europe. We partially overcame data scarcity by using regional estimates and predictive covariates to estimate prevalence in locations without local data.

- **Predictive covariates**: Our predictive covariates are estimated for all year, age, and location combinations, generally with stronger input databases than those available for benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, there is some uncertainty in estimation. Although the uncertainty intervals we report with our final prevalence estimates include uncertainty due to sampling, bias adjustment of input data, and the model fitting itself, uncertainties in the covariate estimation processes are not reflected. Future rounds of the Global Burden of Disease Study should better account for covariate uncertainty.

- **Heterogeneity**: The data we have may vary based on health-care-seeking behaviors and access to quality health care, rather than differences in the underlying disease.

### The prostate microbiome is associated with prostate size and PSA level, independent of age, in BPH patients [^116tQ17m]. The Prostate (2025). Low credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a prevalent condition that, when symptomatic, is marked by bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). More concerning, BPH can result in urinary retention with possible impacts on renal function and infection through bladder outlet obstruction. The incidence of BPH increases with age, with approximately 70% of men between 60 and 69 years of age being impacted. BPH also has significant direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts.

There are currently no updated cost analyses of BPH evaluation and treatment within the United States; however, a 2005 study found that BPH requiring treatment would impact approximately 2.2 million men of working age (45–64 years old), resulting in an annual loss of $3.4 billion in health care expenses and $500 million in lost workdays.

### The global, regional, and national burden of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 204 countries and territories from 2000 to 2019: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2019 [^1167oQhH]. The Lancet Healthy Longevity (2022). Low credibility.

We present a comprehensive assessment of the temporal and geographical patterns of the benign prostatic hyperplasia burden from GBD 2019. Our findings are consistent with previous reports, showing that the absolute disease burden is rising in many parts of the world. The global number of prevalent cases almost doubled in the past 20 years. Despite the increase in the absolute benign prostatic hyperplasia burden, the global age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates remained largely unchanged during the study period. This suggests that population growth and aging have a greater impact on driving the increased prevalence of, and DALYs associated with, benign prostatic hyperplasia at the global level than other risk factors for benign prostatic hyperplasia do.

Our study shows that the peak absolute benign prostatic hyperplasia burden occurred in men aged 65–69 years, with the age-specific prevalence highest in men aged 75–79 years. This trend contrasts with the age trend found in autopsy studies, where the histological prevalence continues to rise with advancing age, but was similar to the age trend found in community-based studies. In these studies, the diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia was based on lower urinary tract symptoms and prostatic enlargement in clinical practice. Geographically, the age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates were lowest in countries in North Africa, the Middle East, and sub-Saharan Africa, and highest in countries in Eastern Europe. Although this geographical variation could be attributable to the varying stages at which…

### Enhanced clinical decisions for management of benign prostatic hyperplasia using patient-reported outcomes: Protocol for a prospective observational study [^112qk7MA]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) significantly impact the quality of life among older men. Despite the prevalent use of the American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA-SI) for BPH, this measure overlooks key symptoms, such as pain and incontinence, underscoring the need for more comprehensive patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools. This study aims to integrate enhanced PROs into routine clinical practice to better capture the spectrum of LUTS, thereby improving clinical outcomes and patient care.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational study will recruit men with LUTS secondary to BPH aged ≥ 50 years from urology clinics. Participants will be stratified into medical and surgical management groups, with PRO assessments scheduled at regular intervals to monitor LUTS and other health outcomes. The study will employ the LURN Symptom Index (SI)-29 alongside the traditional AUA-SI and other non-urologic PROs to evaluate a broad range of symptoms. Data on comorbidities, symptom severity, and treatment efficacy will be collected through a combination of electronic health records and PROs. Analyses will focus on the predictive power of these tools in relation to symptom trajectories and treatment responses. Aims are to: (1) integrate routine clinical tests with PRO assessment to enhance screening, diagnosis, and management of patients with BPH; (2) examine psychometric properties of the LURN SIs, including test-retest reliability and establishment of clinically meaningful differences; and (3) create care-coordination recommendations.

### Integrative multiplatform molecular profiling of benign prostatic hyperplasia identifies distinct subtypes [^1127wzht]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on benign prostatic hyperplasia:

- **Definition**: BPH is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate gland that affects aging men.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of BPH is complex and not fully understood; however, androgenic hormones, particularly dihydrotestosterone, play a significant role in the growth and maintenance of the prostate gland. Dihydrotestosterone is synthesized from testosterone by the action of 5-alpha reductase enzymes, and both normal and pathological growth of the prostate is dependent on dihydrotestosterone synthesis.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of BPH/LUTS in men is estimated at 15,000 per 1,000 person-years. The reported prevalence of BPH ranges from 8–14% in men aged 40–49 years to 21–43% in men aged 60–69 years.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for BPH include advancing age, familial predisposition, obesity, and the presence of comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus and CVD.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, BPH is primarily diagnosed based on a diverse array of progressive LUTS. These symptoms include increased urinary frequency, nocturia, urinary urgency, weak urinary stream, and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of BPH is variable. It is a progressive condition but is not necessarily life-threatening.
