## Question

Tips for sleep regression in one year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for tips for managing sleep regression in a one-year-old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining what "sleep regression" means at 12 months and how common it is. Then, I should verify the normal sleep needs for a 1-year-old to anchor expectations. Next, I will examine the most likely contributors to regression at this age, including developmental milestones, circadian maturation, and environmental or behavioral factors. After that, I should prioritize evidence-based behavioral strategies, consider when to add melatonin, and outline red flags that warrant medical evaluation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, family-centered plan and note special considerations like breastfeeding and room-sharing, making sure each point aligns with guidelines and high-quality evidence where available.

> Let me first confirm the construct of "sleep regression" at 12 months. In clinical practice, this typically refers to a transient deterioration in sleep consolidation with increased night wakings, difficulty settling, or shorter naps, often coinciding with developmental leaps or environmental changes; prevalence estimates suggest 20–30% of infants and toddlers have clinically significant sleep problems, underscoring how common parent-reported regressions are at this age [^fc8b8c7f] [^64ec59ca].

> I need to check the normal sleep needs to avoid overcalling pathology. For toddlers 1–2 years, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends 11–14 hours per 24 hours, including naps, with most children consolidating to one nap by 12–18 months; night wakings are still common but typically decrease toward 1–2 per night by 1–2 years, so expectations should be calibrated to this developmental range [^a57f3fc0] [^f24ce509].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causes; I should review the likely contributors at 12 months. Developmental milestones such as walking, language bursts, and separation anxiety can disrupt sleep, circadian maturation may shift sleep timing, and behavioral insomnia of childhood (limit-setting or sleep-onset association disorder) becomes more prominent as toddlers assert autonomy; environmental contributors like inconsistent routines, screen exposure, and bedsharing can also fragment sleep, so I need to keep these in mind as I tailor advice [^d3a2bd4b] [^2c5265f6] [^7855b787].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy to prioritize interventions. Behavioral strategies are first-line for pediatric insomnia, with multiple guidelines recommending parent education and consistent implementation of sleep hygiene and behavioral plans; melatonin may be considered in select cases, but it is not first-line for typically developing toddlers without a specific indication, so I need to be cautious and indication-specific here [^6572fad9] [^b661e490].

> I will now examine concrete behavioral strategies. Consistent bedtime routines with predictable cues, putting the child down drowsy but awake to foster self-soothing, and limit-setting for protests are foundational; extinction-based approaches (graduated or unmodified) can be effective when consistently applied, though I should screen for family tolerance and cultural preferences before recommending them, and I should double-check that we are not inadvertently reinforcing problematic associations like feeding or rocking to sleep [^d3a2bd4b] [^c99dea14] [^082d3243].

> Wait, let me verify the role of scheduling and circadian alignment. Regular wake and bedtimes with adequate daytime sleep pressure improve consolidation; if bedtime resistance or night wakings persist, bedtime fading (temporarily moving bedtime later and then gradually advancing) can help align sleep pressure with the desired schedule, and minimizing evening screen time reduces circadian disruption and arousal, which is particularly relevant as toddlers are exposed to more devices [^d3a2bd4b] [^7855b787].

> But wait, what if the family is breastfeeding and room-sharing; I should confirm safe, feasible adjustments. The ABM advises against formal sleep training in the first year and supports responsive nighttime parenting; if night nursing is frequent, I can suggest consolidating feeds, using a consistent response, and gradually reducing duration rather than abrupt withdrawal, while reinforcing daytime calories and ensuring safe sleep surfaces if bedsharing is unavoidable, with explicit risk-minimization counseling [^b29afb71] [^0425e681].

> I need to ensure I am not missing medical contributors. Snoring, gasping, or observed apneas raise concern for obstructive sleep apnea and warrant evaluation; persistent extreme sleep fragmentation with excessive daytime sleepiness should prompt consideration of other sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, though this is rare at 12 months; iron deficiency can drive restless sleep and should be screened when clinically indicated, particularly in picky eaters or those with restless legs–like symptoms [^cb3202ae] [^52840dc3] [^b661e490].

> Let me consider melatonin carefully. For typically developing 1-year-olds, evidence is limited and routine melatonin is not recommended; however, in children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD, guidelines support melatonin 1–6 mg for sleep onset difficulties when combined with behavioral strategies, so I should reserve pharmacotherapy for defined indications and coordinate dosing and monitoring with a clinician [^b661e490] [^5999701a].

> Next, I should review how to monitor progress and define success. A 2-week sleep diary tracking bedtime, latency, night wakings, and total sleep time helps quantify change; I should set realistic goals such as reducing night wakings to 1–2, shortening sleep-onset latency to under 30 minutes, and stabilizing bedtime within 30 minutes, recognizing that gains are often incremental and require consistency over 2–4 weeks to consolidate [^d3a2bd4b] [^f24ce509].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that need escalation. Persistent snoring or breathing pauses, failure to thrive, extreme daytime sleepiness, or behavioral regression beyond 4–6 weeks merits referral to pediatric sleep or ENT for evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea or other sleep disorders; likewise, if parental distress is high or family functioning is impaired, connecting families with behavioral sleep resources or early intervention can improve adherence and outcomes [^cb3202ae] [^d3a2bd4b].

> Let me synthesize a practical, family-centered plan. First, stabilize the routine: fixed wake time, consistent bedtime with a 20–30 minute wind-down, and a media-free bedroom. Second, address sleep-onset associations by placing the child down drowsy but awake and using a brief, consistent response to protests. Third, optimize daytime sleep with one nap after lunch and adequate outdoor activity. Fourth, tailor to family context by avoiding cry-it-out if incompatible and using graduated strategies or bedtime passes for limit-setting. Fifth, track with a diary for 2 weeks and adjust based on response, escalating to medical evaluation if red flags emerge or if no improvement after 4–6 weeks of consistent implementation [^d3a2bd4b] [^c99dea14] [^a57f3fc0].

> Finally, I should confirm that my advice aligns with the evidence and note limitations. While many pediatric sleep studies focus on older children, behavioral interventions remain the most consistently supported approach for toddler insomnia, and small-to-moderate improvements in sleep duration are realistic with targeted strategies; I need to emphasize that inconsistency undermines efficacy and that cultural tailoring improves uptake, which is why shared decision-making and follow-up are integral to success [^fd0e7eb7] [^d3a2bd4b] [^2c5265f6].

Sleep regression at 12 months is common and usually linked to developmental milestones, separation anxiety, or changes in routine [^d3a2bd4b]. The most effective approach is **consistent bedtime routines** and **behavioral strategies** (gradual extinction, bedtime fading, and positive reinforcement) [^d3a2bd4b] [^2660f5dd]. Maintain a regular sleep schedule, limit screen time before bed, and avoid late naps; use comfort objects and brief, consistent responses to night wakings [^d3a2bd4b] [^7855b787]. Melatonin is **not routinely recommended** for typically developing toddlers; reserve it for persistent cases with a pediatrician's guidance [^b661e490]. Most regressions resolve in 2–6 weeks with consistency; seek medical evaluation if sleep problems persist beyond 6 weeks or are accompanied by concerning symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Understanding sleep regression at 12 months

Sleep regression at 12 months typically manifests as:

- **Increased night wakings**: More frequent awakenings and difficulty returning to sleep independently [^notfound].

- **Difficulty falling asleep**: Prolonged bedtime resistance or delayed sleep onset [^notfound].

- **Shorter naps**: Reduced daytime sleep duration or skipped naps [^notfound].

Common causes include developmental milestones (e.g. walking, language acquisition), separation anxiety, and changes in routine or environment [^d3a2bd4b].

---

## Establishing consistent bedtime routines

A consistent bedtime routine is foundational for managing sleep regression. Recommended elements include:

- **Regular bedtime**: Aim for the same bedtime each night, ideally between 7:00–8:00 PM [^notfound].

- **Calming activities**: Incorporate quiet activities such as reading, gentle music, or a warm bath [^d3a2bd4b].

- **Limit stimulation**: Avoid stimulating activities, screens, and sugary snacks in the hour before bedtime [^7855b787].

- **Comfort objects**: Introduce a security object (e.g. a soft toy or blanket) to provide reassurance [^notfound].

---

## Behavioral strategies for managing night wakings

Behavioral interventions are effective for reducing night wakings and improving self-soothing:

- **Gradual extinction (Ferber method)**: Allow brief, timed intervals of crying before offering comfort, gradually increasing the interval length [^notfound].

- **Bedtime fading**: Temporarily delay bedtime to match the child's natural sleep onset time, then gradually advance it earlier [^2660f5dd].

- **Positive reinforcement**: Use praise or small rewards for staying in bed and falling asleep independently [^notfound].

- **Consistent response**: Keep nighttime interactions brief and consistent, avoiding prolonged comforting or feeding [^d3a2bd4b].

---

## Environmental modifications

Optimizing the sleep environment can significantly improve sleep quality:

- **Dark, quiet room**: Use blackout curtains and white noise machines to minimize disturbances [^notfound].

- **Comfortable temperature**: Maintain a room temperature between 18–21°C (65–70°F) [^notfound].

- **Safe sleep space**: Ensure the crib or bed is safe, with minimal bedding and no loose objects [^e3407d4e].

---

## Daytime strategies

Daytime habits influence nighttime sleep:

- **Regular naps**: Maintain consistent nap times, avoiding late afternoon naps that can interfere with bedtime [^notfound].

- **Physical activity**: Encourage active play during the day to promote better sleep at night [^notfound].

- **Balanced diet**: Ensure adequate nutrition and avoid caffeine-containing foods or beverages [^notfound].

---

## Parental self-care and support

Parental well-being is crucial during this challenging period:

- **Rest when possible**: Take turns with a partner or caregiver to manage night wakings [^b29afb71].

- **Seek support**: Connect with other parents, support groups, or healthcare professionals for guidance and reassurance [^notfound].

- **Manage stress**: Practice stress-reduction techniques such as mindfulness or relaxation exercises [^notfound].

---

## When to consider medical evaluation

Persistent sleep difficulties may warrant medical evaluation. Consider consulting a pediatrician if:

- **Sleep problems persist**: Beyond 6 weeks despite consistent interventions [^notfound].

- **Concerning symptoms**: Snoring, breathing difficulties, or signs of illness [^cb3202ae].

- **Developmental concerns**: Significant developmental delays or behavioral issues [^b661e490].

---

## Role of melatonin supplementation

Melatonin is **not routinely recommended** for typically developing toddlers. It may be considered for persistent sleep difficulties only under pediatric supervision, with careful attention to dosing and potential side effects [^b661e490].

---

## Expected duration and prognosis

Most sleep regressions at 12 months resolve within 2–6 weeks with consistent implementation of strategies. Persistence beyond this period may indicate underlying issues requiring further evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

| **Strategy** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Bedtime routine | Consistent, calming, and predictable |
| Behavioral interventions | Gradual extinction, bedtime fading, positive reinforcement |
| Environment | Dark, quiet, comfortable temperature |
| Daytime habits | Regular naps, physical activity, balanced diet |
| Parental support | Self-care, stress management, seek support |
| Medical evaluation | Persistent issues beyond 6 weeks or concerning symptoms |

---

Sleep regression at 12 months is a common, usually self-limited phase. Consistent routines, behavioral strategies, and environmental adjustments are the cornerstone of management, with melatonin reserved for select cases under medical guidance. Most families see improvement within weeks, but persistent or atypical symptoms should prompt further evaluation.

### Does an intervention that improves infant sleep also improve overweight at age 6? Follow-up of a randomised trial [^4bac203c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Short sleep duration may contribute to childhood obesity. Amenable to intervention, sleep thus provides a potential path for prevention. The authors aimed to determine the impact of a behavioural intervention that successfully reduced parent-reported infant sleep problems on adiposity at age 6.

Design

5-year follow-up of a previously reported population-based cluster randomised trial. Participant allocation was concealed to researchers and data collection blinded.

Setting

Recruitment from well-child centres in Melbourne, Australia.

Participants

328 children (174 intervention) with parent-reported sleep problems at age 7–8 months drawn from 49 centres (clusters).

Intervention

Behavioural sleep strategies delivered over one to three structured individual nurse consultations from 8 to 10 months, versus usual care. MAIN OUTCOMES AT AGE 6 YEARS: Body mass index (BMI) z-score, percentage overweight/obese and waist circumference.

Analyses

Intention-to-treat regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders.

Results

Anthropometric data were available for 193 children (59% retention) at age 6. There was no evidence of a difference between intervention (N = 101) and control (N = 92) children for BMI z-score (adjusted mean difference 0.2, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.4), overweight/obese status (20% vs 17%; adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.8) and waist circumference (adjusted mean difference -0.3, 95% CI -1.6 to 1.1). In posthoc analyses, neither infant nor childhood sleep duration were associated with anthropometric outcomes.

Conclusions

A brief infant sleep intervention did not reduce overweight/obesity at 6 years. Population-based primary care sleep services seem unlikely to reduce the early childhood obesity epidemic.

### Sleep hygiene intervention for youth aged 10 to 18 years with problematic sleep: a before-after pilot study [^64821d06]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

This study was not without limitations. First, our sample was a small community-recruited sample, which limits generalizability. For example, as enrolment to the study was voluntary and dependent on the participant/family approaching us, this cohort of participants could have been especially motivated. Secondly, this was a before and after intervention study and did not include a control group, thus any improvements seen could be due to the placebo effect which might have been amplified by the participants' motivation for change. Thirdly, although the measurement of sleep quality by participant using the PSQI is written in a language easily understood by this age group, the validity and reliability of the instrument in this young age group has yet to be demonstrated. Finally, it is likely that the self-selected recruitment of parents will have produced a sample of children with high levels of sleep problems. This was an intended effect of the recruitment strategies used in order to demonstrate that the pilot was acceptable for this population and so could be used in a larger trial. In the absence of a control group, however, regression towards the mean cannot be ruled out as at least partially explaining the changes observed during the study. The full study was completed over a school year, thus we cannot exclude seasonal changes being an advantage or disadvantage to sleep changes in some. A strength of the study was the retention rate at 100% with every enrolled participant completing the 20 week F.E.R.R.E.T sleep hygiene programme. This is probably atypical, but the high retention may have reflected the age-appropriateness of the intervention, perhaps aided by the multiple researcher contact time points and/or by the individuals being more motivated to complete because they volunteered and presented with self-identified sleep problems.

### Sleep duration and body mass index in 0-7-year olds [^8ce36985]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine in children aged 0–7 years (1) cross-sectional relationships between body mass index (BMI) and sleep duration, and whether (2) sleep duration predicts later BMI and/or (3) BMI predicts later sleep duration.

Design

Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, Waves 1 and 2.

Participants

Infants aged 0–1 years (Wave 1), followed at age 2–3 years (Wave 2); children aged 4–5 years (Wave 1), followed at age 6–7 years (Wave 2).

Main Outcome Measures

BMI, sleep duration by time-use diary, parent-reported sleep problems (none/mild vs moderate/severe).

Analyses

Cross-sectional, ANOVA (sleep duration) and χ(2) (sleep problems); longitudinal, linear regression.

Results

3857 (76%) infants and 3844 (77%) children had BMI and sleep data. At every wave, approximately 15% and 5% of children were overweight and obese, respectively. Obesity was not associated with sleep duration at 0–1, 2–3 or 4–5 years, though obese 6-7-year olds slept approximately 30 min less (p < 0.001). Sleep problems were similar across BMI categories at all ages. Wave 1 sleep duration did not predict Wave 2 BMI, nor did Wave 1 BMI predict Wave 2 sleep duration.

Conclusions

In these large child population cohorts, sleep duration did not predict obesity up to age 6–7 years. Current trials of sleep interventions to prevent or manage obesity in young children may be premature.

Q2. What investigations would be useful? Tick all that apply. (Answer: A, C)
Visual sleep diary
Written sleep diary
Actigraphy
Polysomnography
Multiple sleep latency test
Overnight video recording

Answer: At this stage, polysomnography would not be very helpful (he reportedly sleeps through although his BTs and wake times 'move round the clock') though it may be necessary in the future. The initial investigation of choice is actigraphy or a visual sleep diary (if actigraphy is not available). This will allow delineation of a possible circadian rhythm disturbance and will help pinpoint a diagnosis simply and quickly.

Q3. How would you interpret this sleep diary (figure 2)? What clues can you get from it? (Answer: see text)

Answer:

TST: 8.5 hours.

BT: Irregular BT 13:30–10:10.

SL: < 30 min.

TIB: 10.5 hours.

Night waking: Number of night wakings average = 1 per night.

Figure 2
Sleep diary for case 2–John.

Q4. What should be considered next? (Answer: A, D)
Behavioural intervention
Alimemazine
Chloral hydrate
Melatonin
Clonidine

Our approach: The debilitating aspect of his sleep problem was non-school attendance with accompanying comorbidity of social anxiety. His mother had tried against considerable odds to get him back into education and the diagnosis of a circadian rhythm disturbance helped move things forward in terms of liaison with local teams. The key intervention was engagement with school with a planned staged return to education, and support for home curriculum in subjects or activities of interest. The treatment for this case had to be planned in advance with the aim to move wake activities at time when the family had the resilience to participate and at a speed that was acceptable to them. Supporting the young person and the main carer/parent was paramount. There was potential for psychological work to explore systemic factors contributing to presentation, as well as motivational interviewing to explore goals and whether change is currently a realistic expectation.

Statistical Analysis

Data analysis was performed using Stata, version 18 (StataCorp). The feasibility analysis included all randomized families, and pilot efficacy analyses used complete cases. Demographic and efficacy outcomes were summarized by group using descriptive statistics. Rates/proportions and corresponding 95% CIs were reported for the feasibility parameters and assessed against the predefined success metrics. Adjusted mean differences (MDs) for efficacy outcomes were obtained using linear regression for each continuous outcome predicted by allocation arm, baseline values of outcomes, and minimization factors (child sex, age, and IMD). Cohen d is reported as a measure of effect size.

- strategic avoidance of light

- timed physical activity or exercise as monotherapy

- wakefulness-promoting medications

- other somatic interventions

- combination treatments in pediatric/adolescent patients.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^6cdc67fa]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine pediatric sleep duration consensus — discussion emphasizes fundamentals and scope: "Sleep is a necessity for health," with variability "explained by psychological, behavioral, social, cultural, and environmental factors," and "Sleep disorders also contribute to this variability." The panel "focused solely on the dimension of sleep duration," and recommendations "provide sleep durations that promote optimal health, but do not address other sleep factors"; studies included excluded "total sleep deprivation (no sleep for 24 hours)" because "Total sleep deprivation is not sustainable and thus not reflective of habitual sleep," In developmental context, "total sleep time is high in infants and toddlers, with gradual reduction over time as one approaches pre-adolescence and adolescence," paralleling cerebral metabolism "studied in 100 healthy children using positron emission tomography," and "The reduction in total sleep time over the first decade is felt to be related to an initial overproduction, and subsequent pruning away of unnecessary synapses." The panel noted that "too little sleep for each age group was unhealthy," discussed longer sleep durations, highlighted that longer sleep can be associated with sleep disorders and limited sleep-extension evidence, identified "a few U-shape curves that showed that both, too little and too much sleep were associated with poorer outcomes," and "strongly encourages future experimental studies to examine the effects of sleep extension on health outcomes." The guidance "reflect typical or habitual sleep duration, i.e., the ideal average sleep duration," while "sleep duration in the real world is a dynamic process" with "variable sleep schedules depending on school start times, work, and extracurricular activities that may curtail sleep on weekdays and extend sleep on weekends," and "More studies are needed to better characterize effects of this "social jet lag"."

### Treatment alternatives for sleep-disordered breathing in the pediatric population [^9530aff5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

PURPOSE FOR REVIEW: Childhood sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is associated with a myriad of health problems that underscore the need for early diagnosis and treatment. Children with SDB present with behavior problems, deficits of general intelligence, learning and memory deficits, evidence of brain neuronal injury, increased cardiovascular risk, and poor quality of life. Children are in a rapid state of cognitive development; therefore, alterations of health and brain function associated with SDB could permanently alter a child's social and economic potential, especially if the disorder is not recognized early in life or is treated inadequately.

Recent Findings

There is evidence that the majority of the problems associated with SDB improve with treatment. Treatment strategies are now being aimed at mechanisms underlying the disorder. There are multiple treatment options available to children; some are novel, with pending treatments on the horizon that may replace age-old therapies such as adenotonsillectomy or nasal positive pressure.

Summary

It is imperative that healthcare workers actively seek out signs and symptoms of SDB in patients to improve early detection and treatment for prevention of long-term morbidity.

### Impact of a behavioural sleep intervention on symptoms and sleep in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and parental mental health: randomised controlled trial [^2660f5dd]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Intervention

Families in the intervention group were offered two face to face, fortnightly consultations about sleep with a trained clinician (five psychologists; four with 1–4 years of clinical experience and one with 10 years, or a trainee consultant paediatrician with four years of paediatric clinical experience) at their paediatrician's office, the hospital clinic, or home. Families were offered one follow-up telephone call two weeks later. The clinicians' training consisted of two three hour sessions, conducted by HH and ES, and included information on normal sleep, sleep cycles, sleep cues, sleep hygiene (that is, set bed time, bedtime routines, keeping the bedroom media-free, and avoiding caffeine consumption after 3 pm), and standard management strategies for behaviour known to be effective in typically developing children; details have been published previously. None of the clinicians had received specialised training in paediatric sleep management before the trial.

At the first consultation, the clinician assessed the child's sleep problem, elicited parent goals for sleep management, provided information about normal sleep, sleep cycles, and sleep hygiene strategies, and formulated a behavioural sleep management plan tailored to the child's sleep problem. For example, limit setting disorder was managed by ignoring child protests and rewarding compliance with bedtime routines. Delayed sleep phase was managed using bedtime fading whereby the child's bedtime is temporarily set later and gradually brought forward, while continuing to wake the child at a preset time in the morning. Anxiety related insomnia was managed by visual imagery and relaxation techniques. Parents were asked to complete a sleep diary between the first and second consultation. The second consultation and follow-up telephone call were used to review the sleep diary, reinforce suggested strategies, and troubleshoot any problems.

Families were provided with information sheets designed for the study, dealing with normal sleep, common sleep problems, and strategies for managing specific problems (see supplementary information). The clinicians completed a standardised consultation form, recording the duration of the consultation and key components of the programme (history, diagnoses, management) to maximise programme fidelity.HH and ES met with the clinicians fortnightly to consult on clinical issues.

Efficacy of therapeutic strategies relative to patient- and family-centered outcomes in pediatric oncology must be assessed. We sought to identify outcomes important to children with acute myeloid leukemia and their families related to inpatient versus at-home management of neutropenia. We conducted qualitative interviews with 32 children ≥ 8 years old and 54 parents. Analysis revealed the impact of neutropenia management strategy on siblings, parent anxiety, and child sleep quality as being outcomes of concern across respondents. These themes were used to inform the design of a questionnaire that is currently being used in a prospective, multiinstitutional comparative effectiveness trial.

Study Objectives

Cultural sleep practices and COVID-19 mitigation strategies vary worldwide. The sleep of infants and toddlers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is understudied.

Methods

Caregivers of children aged < 3 years responded to a cross-sectional survey during 2020 (divided into quarters, with the year quarter 1 being largely prelockdown). We assessed the global effect of year quarter on parent-reported total sleep time (hours) and sleep onset latency (hours) using an analysis of variance. We used multivariable linear regression to assess the adjusted effect of year quarter on total sleep time, sleep onset latency, and parental frustration. We used logistic regression to assess the adjusted effect of year quarter on nap consistency.

Results

Of 594 children, the mean age was 18.5 ± 9.7 months; 52% were female. In the adjusted analyses, the reference categories were as follows: quarter 1 (year quarter), ≤ 6 months (age category), and < $25,000 (annual household income). Total sleep time was associated with age category (ages 12 to ≤ 24 months: β = -2.86; P = 0.0004; ages 24 to ≤ 36 months: β = -3.25; P < .0001) and maternal age (β = -0.04; P = 0.05). Sleep onset latency was associated with year quarter (year quarter 3: β = 0.16; P = 0.04), age category (ages 24 to ≤ 36 months: β = 0.28; P < .0001), annual household income ($100,000-$150,000: β = -0.15; P = 0.03; > $150,000: β = -0.19; P = 0.01), and lack of room-sharing (β = -0.09; P = 0.05). Parental frustration with sleep increased with age (all P < .05) and lack of room-sharing (P = 0.01). The effect of lack of room-sharing on nap consistency approached significance (adjusted odds ratio, 1.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.95–3.72).

Conclusions

Social factors such as lower household income and room-sharing affected the sleep of U.S. infants and toddlers as opposed to the COVID-19 lockdown itself.

### A randomized controlled trial of an intervention for infants' behavioral sleep problems [^b7425e2e]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

Our sample size was based on detecting an arithmetic difference of 20% in outcome proportion reporting severe sleep problems between the intervention and control groups, using results obtained by Hiscock and colleagues' (2007) who reported 70% in control group and 50% in intervention group. That absolute difference required 97 subjects per group to obtain power of 0.80 in a two-sided test with type I error rate of 0.05. Allowing for loss of follow up of up to 20%, our planned sample size was 240 families; we recruited and randomized a total of 235 families. We did not incorporate secondary outcomes in our power calculation. No interim analysis was planned.

The primary analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis considering a two-tailed p-value ≤ 0.05 as significant and using R (version 2.13.0). We compared observed proportions of parents reporting severe sleep problems and actigraphic wakes of ≥ 2 per night between groups using a Fisher's exact test, with adjustment for baseline sleep problem severity using the Mantel-Haenszel test, including corresponding 95% confidence intervals for differences in proportions or relative risks. Means for continuous outcomes were compared using linear (both fixed and mixed effects) model analyses, with adjustment for baseline measurements. We adjusted our analysis of sleep problem severity for infant gender and feeding status.

Because families were assigned to groups associated with particular health centers and providers we examined health center and provider effects on primary outcomes using mixed effects logistic regression. In addition, we generated multiple imputations for incomplete data using iterative regression imputation. The results reported are based on the available data. Multiple imputation was undertaken to confirm the validity of the available data analysis.

Other medication options:

Further medications for use in disability include trazodone (in Angelman syndrome) and low-dose gabapentin in children with significant epilepsy (both with specialist advice from a tertiary sleep centre). Other medications such as clonazepam for parasomnia/night terrors.

For smaller children doses range from 10–70 mcg.

Q5. Are there any other alternatives for children with disability to help with frequent night wakings or early morning wakings?

Answer: In some cases the level of challenging behaviour is significant enough that it warrants treatment from: specialist LD health visiting/nursing team in first instance or to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). These will need to be worked on at the same time, as sleep is addressed. It is helpful if members of LD teams have some training in sleep and disability (see box 1).

Outcome: We used alimemazine to stabilise sleep and to allow sleep training and the addition of a safe sleeping space resulted in Caitlyn having a much improved sleep pattern (11–12 hours) and brought the family back from crisis.

Case 2

John is a 15-year-old boy with an underlying diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder with secondary social anxiety.

PC: John has a disturbed sleep pattern described by his mother as 'moving around the clock'. His anxiety is so severe that he was unable to leave the house to attend appointments regularly and also has been having problems attending school.

HPC: John has had difficulty maintaining a normal sleep routine for 4 years. This was following a traumatic incident in school that he 'put himself to bed' in order to avoid schooling. This initial picture of school avoidance evolved to a disturbed pattern of sleep. John is sleeping approximately 10 hours a day but can fall asleep at different times. When he is asleep he is reportedly very difficult to wake. He does not describe excessive sleepiness during waking hours and no unusual arousals or night terrors were reported.

### A randomized trial of a self-administered parenting intervention for infant and toddler insomnia [^317bfb82]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Self-administered treatments may overcome access barriers to evidence-based care for pediatric sleep problems. Two hundred thirty-nine families participated in a randomized controlled trial with 3 study arms: a DVD intervention condition (the Sleep Easy Solution), a Website comparison condition, and a Wait-List comparison condition. The primary outcome was trichotomous-Do you consider your child's sleep a problem? (not a problem at all, a small problem, a very serious problem). DVD was superior to Wait-List in terms of the primary outcome (P = 0.03; odds ratio = 0.44; 95% confidence interval = 0.21–0.93). Similarly, regarding secondary outcomes, DVD was superior to Wait-List in terms of longer continuous sleep periods (P = 0.003), more favorable perceptions of the child's overall sleep (P = 0.001), and higher parental confidence in managing the child's sleep (P = 0.001). Results suggest that the DVD intervention is a promising self-administered treatment for pediatric insomnia.

### Impact of a behavioural sleep intervention on symptoms and sleep in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and parental mental health: randomised controlled trial [^c3869b33]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Statistical methods

Analysis was conducted on an intention to treat basis. For parent reported outcomes, we calculated the changes in each outcome between baseline and three months and between baseline and six months. We estimated the mean differences in the change in the outcomes between the intervention and control arms and 95% confidence intervals using linear regression adjusted for confounders identified a priori. The confounders were the child's age, sex, medication use (yes or no), and total number of mental health comorbidities identified on the anxiety disorders interview schedule for children IV; age and education level of primary caregiver (completed high school: yes or no); and family socioeconomic status, measured according to postal code of residence using the index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage. To calculate effect sizes, we standardised the changes in each outcome to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and repeated regression analyses. Effect sizes with standard deviations of 0.20 or less are considered as small, 0.50 or less as moderate, and around 0.80 as large.

For teacher reported outcome we compared the outcome between the intervention and control arms, adjusting for baseline scores and confounders rather than considering change in scores, as originally specified in the protocol. We used this alternative approach because many of the children had changed teachers between the three and six month surveys and the baseline survey (74 children at three months, 121 children at six months) and thus the correlation between teachers' measures was lower than expected and the analysis of change scores was a less efficient approach.

Using logistic regression we compared the proportions of children with moderate-severe versus no or mild sleep problems between the two arms; we estimated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals adjusted for potential confounders.

To detect whether any improvement in the severity of ADHD symptoms was associated with improvement in sleep, we conducted a post hoc analysis of mediation. We examined whether the improvement in parent reported total symptom scores for the intervention group at three and six months, compared with the control group, was mediated by improved sleep (children's sleep habits questionnaire total score) using causal mediation models. All mediation models were adjusted for confounding variables (as previously).

A longitudinal study of approximately 3,000 children beginning at age 0–1 year with follow-up at age 6–7 years found that persistent short sleepers and poor sleepers within the 12 month to < 3 year old and 3 to < 6 year old age categories had greater difficulties with emotional, social and physical functioning at age 6–7 years compared to "typical sleepers" who slept approximately 14.5 hours at age 0–1 year and 10.75 hours at age 6–7 years. Another study collected almost 33,000 parental surveys regarding child sleep duration and the emotional and behavioral regulation of these children at 18 months and 5 years of age.

### Nonpharmacological interventions to lengthen sleep duration in healthy children… [^fd0e7eb7]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Marked differences in sleep patterns are observed through childhood, with declines in sleep duration with increasing age. Guidance from the US National Sleep Foundation recommends that toddlers age 1 to 2 years should sleep 11 to 14 hours per night, preschool-aged children age 3 to 5 years should sleep 10 to 13 hours, school-aged children age 6 to 13 years should sleep 9 to 11 hours, and teenagers age 14 to 17 years should sleep 8 to 10 hours, 1 with similar decreasing sleep durations with increasing child age in the UK, 7 reflecting the changes in circadian rhythm and homeostatic sleep processes during child development. Interventions in school-aged children may offer an ideal age group to alter nocturnal sleep behavior, given circadian sleep patterns are well established, and scope to deliver interventions within both school and home settings.

Hence, we have carried out an up-to-date systematic review of intervention studies to promote optimal sleep patterns in all children, including those of school age. This systematic review found that sleep interventions in children aged 1 to 18 years were associated with 10. 5 minutes longer sleep duration per night. Many intervention components have small effects on sleep duration. Substantial increases in sleep duration were observed in a subgroup of trials encouraging earlier bedtimes, with objectively measured sleep durations increasing by 47 minutes. Interventions that have a broader focus were ineffective in increasing sleep duration, extending sleep by 1. 2 minutes compared with 16 minutes in interventions focused on sleep only.

Notably, the pooled effect estimate from that review is similar to the estimate reported in the present review for trials that encouraged earlier bedtimes and importantly used objective actigraphy measurement of sleep duration, which limits well-known biases associated with self-reported or parent-reported sleep times. 26 While prior qualitative reviews have suggested that multicomponent interventions underpinned by behavioral theory might be more effective, 25 our findings demonstrate that simple sleep-focused interventions are more effective. The trials included delivered interventions in both school and home settings, and no difference was found in the effect sizes of interventions in either setting. These findings suggest that reinforcement of interventions in both settings could be used for future implementation.

Differences in individual study results were reflected by high levels of heterogeneity in both the main and subgroup analyses.

### Helping children and families deal with divorce and separation [^1ad44471]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Children's reactions to parental divorce — developmental stages from infancy through school age — show age-specific distress patterns. Infants react to changes in routine and caregivers with fussiness, irritability or listlessness, and sleep/feeding disturbances, and at approximately 6 months of age normal separation and stranger anxiety may be increased. Toddlers frequently manifest separation anxiety, reluctance to separate even in familiar settings, developmental regression including loss of toileting and language skills, and common eating and sleep disorders. Preschool-aged children do not understand permanence, may repeatedly ask for the absent parent, be demanding and defiant with sleeping/eating problems and regression, often test and manipulate differences in parental limit setting, and by age 4 to 5 years may blame themselves, act out, have nightmares, increased reluctance to separate, and fear abandonment. School-aged children often have self-blame and fantasize about parental reunion, with frequent mood and behavior changes such as withdrawal and anger, declining school performance, and feelings of abandonment by the nonresident parent.

### Management of persistent, post-adenotonsillectomy obstructive sleep apnea in children: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^382049e8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Justification and implementation

The panel suggests a collaborative approach when evaluating children with persistent OSA to determine the most suitable treatment options. This is best accomplished with a multidisciplinary team. A drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) with other imaging modalities as available (cine magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or orthodontic evaluation, for example) may be considered if CPAP is not desired, adherence is poor, or surgically modifiable sites of airway obstruction are suspected. This recommendation places a high priority on the need to identify upper airway abnormalities that are amenable to surgery and/or orthodontic care.

Once the decision to use CPAP is made, physicians must determine the need for an in-laboratory titration study (based on availability or if partial response occurs after autoadjusting CPAP) versus empiric autoadjusting CPAP therapy (e.g. healthy adolescents). The panel suggests regular download of CPAP data to assess adherence and clinical visits to assess facial appearance/growth and side effects.

After starting CPAP, an initial visit within 30–90 days (preferably within a few weeks) is recommended. There is variation in practice for follow-up visits, which is based on tolerability/adherence (and within the United States, at times, determined by third-party payor types). For children who have a partial response or have adherence issues, a behavioral psychologist may also be useful. CPAP coordinators/liaisons may be helpful in monitoring patients. Based on the panel's experience, providing CPAP may be challenging in resource-limited countries or regions.

In general, adherence reported in the literature has not accounted for the duration of nighttime sleep in children; this is surprising because of the importance of sleep for a developing child. To this effect, the recent European Respiratory Society statement on chronic CPAP and non invasive ventilation use in children decided that the use of CPAP/noninvasive ventilation during the entire sleep time should be the goal. Numerous predictors of adherence have been identified and can be identified using the Adherence Barriers to CPAP questionnaire. Several strategies/tools can be used to improve adherence and include behavioral therapy, therapeutic education sessions by a respiratory therapist, token economy, medical hypnosis, and shared decision-making tools. It is critical to heavily focus on patient and caregiver education from the start of CPAP therapy, as early successful use is associated with long-term success. Patients should therefore be enrolled in an intensive follow-up program in the first weeks after initiation.

### ABM clinical protocol # 37: physiological infant care-managing nighttime breastfeeding in young infants [^b29afb71]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #37 — Recommendations 6–11 for nighttime caregiving and sleep training in young infants include: Encourage the mother and infant to return to sleep without interruption after nighttime breastfeeding while bedsharing; avoid burping the infant after breastfeeding, and avoid unnecessary diaper changes during the night; a barrier cream applied to the diaper area can help prevent diaper dermatitis (Level of evidence: 2–3. Strength of recommendation: C.). Sleep training in approximately the first 6 months of life is contraindicated, and sleep training in the first year is not recommended; a cued care program for infant sleep may be a physiological-based alternative for parents who desire a sleep intervention (Level of evidence: 3. Strength of recommendation: B.). Encourage the mother to sleep when the infant sleeps, when this is possible, and remind parents that not all sleep must occur during the nighttime hours (Level of evidence: 2. Strength of recommendation: B.). Encourage the mother to get help with other household tasks so that she can focus on breastfeeding and caring for the infant (Level of evidence: 2. Strength of recommendation: B.). Encourage the safe use of baby carriers during the day to promote physical contact with the infant; Baby-wearing can help mothers manage daytime tasks while keeping the infant calm (Level of evidence: 1. Strength of recommendation: A.). Including some supervised "tummy time" may be important to help achieve developmental motor goals (Level of evidence: 2. Strength of recommendation: B.).

### Bedtime schedules and sleep regulation among children of incarcerated Parents [^018143e0]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate variation by parental incarceration history in the bedtime schedules set for elementary-age children and whether sleep was effectively regulated.

Study Design

We ran multivariate regression models estimating the relationship between parental incarceration and 6 measures of bedtime schedules and sleep regulation. Our sample included 9-year-olds in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (n = 3246), a survey of children born in large US cities between 1998 and 2000 that has an oversample of unmarried mothers.

Results

Children's bedtime schedules did not differ at a statistically significant level by parental incarceration history, but children of ever- vs never-incarcerated fathers had lower odds of consistently adhering to a set bedtime. Children of ever-incarcerated fathers also slept for less time on average than did children of never-incarcerated fathers, and they had lower odds of obtaining sufficient sleep. Bedtime consistency partly mediated the association between paternal incarceration and total sleep duration.

Conclusions

Although caregivers set appropriate bedtime schedules for children of ever-incarcerated fathers, consistent adherence to those schedules may be particularly challenging given the structural hardships of paternal incarceration. Policymakers, researchers, and practitioners working to improve sleep among children of incarcerated fathers should focus on helping families to develop strategies for implementing bedtime schedules as consistently and effectively as possible.

### ABM clinical protocol # 37: physiological infant care-managing nighttime breastfeeding in young infants [^02879bf9]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Sleep training in young infants — techniques intended to condition infants and toddlers to sleep longer at night are described as causing significant infant stress when training infants to sleep alone by not responding to crying in a distant crib, with elevated cortisol persisting even when the infant no longer cries. Parents often experience distress and often find sleep training is not effective, and objective measures of infant sleep outcomes do not find that these methods improve infant sleep; infants cease to signal distress but do not cease to wake or remain awake. Sleep training in infants younger than 6 months of age can impact breastfeeding success due to separation and reduced nighttime feedings. Separate-room sleep as part of sleep training could be associated with increased SIDS risk, but this association has not been substantiated and requires further research; one randomized control trial of 14 infants found no connection between graduated sleep interventions and emotional or behavioral problems 12 months later, though results were too small to generalize.

### Long-term efficacy of an internet-based intervention for infant and toddler sleep disturbances: one year follow-up [^d4d1d0c2]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine at one-year follow-up the efficacy of an internet-based intervention for infant and toddler sleep disturbances, as well as to assess any indirect benefits to maternal sleep and confidence.

Methods

Participants included 171 (64.8%) of 264 mothers of an infant or toddler (ages 18–48 months) who had previously participated in a 3-week study. Families had been randomly assigned to one of 2 intervention groups (algorithmic internet-based intervention alone or in combination with a prescribed bedtime routine) or a control group. After a one-week baseline, the intervention groups followed personalized sleep recommendations. The initial internet-intervention was found to be efficacious at 2 weeks post-intervention. The current study investigates a one-year follow-up, with mothers completing a short survey that included 8 questions from the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire and 1 question from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.

Results

Improvements in difficulty falling asleep, number/duration of night wakings, and longest continuous sleep period were maintained at one year follow-up in the 2 intervention groups compared to baseline and end of the initial study, p < 0.001. Children in the control group, in which limited changes were seen in the initial study, showed improvements in the duration of night wakings and longest continuous sleep period compared to the end of the initial study. Mothers in all groups were less likely to describe their child's sleep as a problem.

Conclusions

These results suggest that a brief internet-intervention for early childhood sleep problems is effective in improving child and maternal sleep, with improvements maintained one year later.

General health outcomes across childhood — sleep duration patterns and associations: In this domain, study sizes ranged from less than 25 to over 74,000. In the 4-months to < 12 months age range, two large prospective birth cohorts indicated healthy infants slept slightly > 13 to slightly > 14 hours. For children in the 1 to < 3 years and 3 to < 6 years age ranges, one cohort reported sleep durations between 11 and 12 hours, and limited data suggested that sleeping less than 10 hours was associated with greater risk of accidental injury and reduced quality of life. In the 6 to < 13 years age group, a large meta-analysis of children from 20 countries indicated children between 9 and 12 years of age slept approximately 10 hours per night, and children sleeping 10 hours or more per night reported better health. In the 13–18 year age range, increased rates of injury were noted for those sleeping less than 7 or 8 hours, with better health for those sleeping 9 hours or more; a meta-analysis found sleep declined from between 9 and 10 hours at age 13 to slightly less than 8 to slightly greater than 9 hours at age 18 years.

Restless sleep and night wakings would suggest a need for laboratory evaluation for ferritin and other indicators of iron sufficiency to determine if low iron stores might be present. Empirical support exists for the effectiveness of parent education and behavioral interventions for children with ASD and sleep disturbances, and despite these challenges, behavioral strategies are successful when consistently implemented. No medication is currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of insomnia in children with or without ASD, and any medication elected should be started at a low dose and monitored for adverse effects. Sleep onset may be aided by treatment with melatonin at doses from 1 to 6 mg and may be maintained with long-acting melatonin; adverse effects are uncommon but may include nightmares. α-adrenergic agents (eg, clonidine) and antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine) are often prescribed to help with sleep onset or to address night-waking in children, but the literature provides little support for their use. Disordered sleep is associated with challenging daytime behaviors in children with ASD; addressing one may help with the other.

Human performance outcomes across childhood — study designs and key thresholds: Most studies were cohort or cross-sectional with some case-control and experimental designs, and sample sizes ranged from less than 100 to over 3,000. In an experimental sample of 10 children aged 30–36 months, loss of a daytime nap resulting in total 24-h sleep of less than 11 hours was associated with more negative emotional responses. In preschoolers, less than 8 h in the previous 24 hours was associated with a more than 2-fold increased risk of accidental falls. A longitudinal cohort of 1,492 children aged 6 years found that sleep durations less than 10 hours as toddlers and preschoolers were associated with higher parent-reported hyperactivity indices and lower cognitive performance. Among 812 school-aged children, sleeping less than 9 hours per night was associated with worse teacher-reported academic achievement but not with attention, motivation, or relationships.

### Home and videotape intervention delays early complementary feeding among adolescent mothers [^f9c89eee]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The American Academy of Pediatrics, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and the World Health Organization recommend that infants receive only breast milk or formula for the first 4 to 6 months of life, followed by the introduction of complementary foods. Despite these recommendations, many infants, particularly those with adolescent mothers, receive solid foods (often cereal mixed with formula in a bottle) and liquids other than formula or breast milk in the first few weeks of life. Decisions on early feeding are often guided by grandmothers and influenced by beliefs that infants need complementary food to counteract signals of hunger, reduce crying, and sleep through the night.

Objective

This investigation evaluated the efficacy of an intervention to delay the early introduction of complementary feeding among first-time, black, adolescent mothers living in multigenerational households. The intervention focused on reducing the cultural barriers to the acceptance of the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics, WIC, and World Health Organization on complementary feeding by highlighting 3 topics: 1) recognition of infants' cues; 2) nonfood strategies for managing infant behavior; and 3) mother-grandmother negotiation strategies. The intervention was delivered through a mentorship model in which a videotape made by an advisory group of black adolescent mothers was incorporated into a home-visiting program and evaluated through a randomized, controlled trial.

Methods

One hundred eighty-one first-time, low-income, black mothers < 18 years old, living in multigenerational households were recruited from 3 urban hospitals. Infants were born at term, with birth weight appropriate for gestational age and no congenital problems. Shortly after delivery, mothers and grandmothers completed a baseline assessment and mothers were randomized into an intervention or control group. Intervention group mothers received home visitation every other week for 1 year. At 3 months, a subset of 121 adolescent mothers reported on their infant's intake through a food frequency questionnaire. Mothers who fed their infant only breast milk, formula, or water were classified as optimal feeders. Mothers who provided complementary foods other than breast milk, formula, or water were classified as less optimal feeders.

Results

Sixty-one percent of the infants received complementary foods before 3 months old. Multivariate hierarchical logistic regression was used to evaluate the determinants of being in the optimal versus less optimal feeders group. After controlling for infant age and family income, mothers of infants in the optimal feeders group were more likely to report accurate messages from WIC regarding the timing of complementary food and nearly 4 times more likely to be in the intervention group. The most common complementary food was cereal mixed with formula in the bottle.

Conclusions

The success of this relatively brief intervention demonstrates the importance of using ecological theory and ethnographic research to design interventions that enable participants to alter their behavior in the face of contradictory cultural norms. The intervention focused on interpreting infants' cues, nonfood methods of managing infant behavior, and mother-grandmother negotiations. It was delivered through methods that were familiar and acceptable to adolescent mothers-a mentorship model incorporating home visits and videotape. The skill-oriented aspects of the intervention delivered in a culturally sensitive context may have enabled the young mothers to follow the guidelines that they received from WIC and from their pediatricians. Strategies, such as those used in this intervention, may be effective in promoting other caregiving recommendations, thereby enabling providers to meet the increasing demands from parents for advice regarding children's early growth and development.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^cb91ffd3]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

GINA 2024 — starting treatment in children aged 6–11 years with a diagnosis of asthma — uses symptom frequency to guide initial therapy as follows: For patients with "Symptoms less than two days a week", start with "Take low dose ICS whenever SABA is taken" (inhaled corticosteroid [ICS]; short-acting beta2-agonist [SABA]). For those with "Symptoms 2–5 days a week", start with "Daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA". If there are "Symptoms most days, or waking at night once or more a week", start with "Low-dose ICS-LABA or medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA; or very-low-dose MART" (long-acting beta2-agonist [LABA]; maintenance and reliever therapy [MART]). If there are "Symptoms most days, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function", start with "Refer for expert advice, or medium dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, or low-dose MART". A "Short course of OCS may also be needed for children presenting with an exacerbation", and for children with "symptoms 1–2 days a week or less", "adherence with daily ICS is likely to be very poor, so taking low-dose ICS whenever SABA is taken may be a better option for reducing exacerbation risk" (oral corticosteroids [OCS]).

### Normal sleep patterns in infants and children: a systematic review of observational studies [^f24ce509]. Sleep Medicine Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

This is a systematic review of the scientific literature with regard to normal sleep patterns in infants and children (0–12 years). The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Mean and variability data for sleep duration, number of night wakings, sleep latency, longest sleep period overnight, and number of daytime naps were extracted from questionnaire or diary data from 34 eligible studies. Meta-analysis was conducted within age-bands and categories. In addition, fractional polynomial regression models were used to estimate best-fit equations for the sleep variables in relation to age. Reference values (means) and ranges (± 1.96 SD) for sleep duration (hours) were: infant, 12.8 (9.7–15.9); toddler/preschool, 11.9 (9.9–13.8); and child, 9.2 (7.6–10.8). The best-fit (R(2) = 0.89) equation for hours over the 0–12 year age range was 10.49–5.56×[(age/10)^0.5–0.71]. Meta-regression showed predominantly Asian countries had significantly shorter sleep (1h less over the 0–12 year range) compared to studies from Caucasian/non-Asian countries. Night waking data provided 4 age-bands up to 2 years ranging from 0 to 3.4 wakes per night for infants (0–2 months), to 0–2.5 per night (1–2 year-olds). Sleep latency data were sparse but estimated to be stable across 0–6 years. Because the main data analysis combined data from different countries and cultures, the reference values should be considered as global norms.

### Sleep and adjustment in preschool children: sleep diary reports by mothers relate to behavior reports by teachers [^35baa03c]. Child Development (2004). Low credibility.

Prior literature suggests that there may be relations between children's sleep disorders or inadequate amounts of sleep and behavioral adjustment. Most relevant studies concern clinical populations, however, and relatively few concern community populations. Moreover, previous studies have not addressed empirically the possible role of family functioning as a factor in the relation between children's sleep and adjustment. The present study, conducted in a predominantly low-income, community sample (N = 202), measured 4- to 5-year-old children's sleep patterns through daily logs kept by mothers, and measured family stress and parenting practices through detailed, multifaceted interviews and incidental observations of parent-child interactions. Children's adjustment, both positive and negative, was measured through preschool teacher reports on multiple occasions. A structural equation model showed that disrupted child sleep patterns (variability in reported amount of sleep, variability in bedtime, and lateness of bedtime) predicted less optimal adjustment in preschool, even after considering the roles of family stress and family management practices.

### Consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine on the recommended amount of sleep for healthy children: methodology and discussion [^a6405ad5]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Sleep duration and longevity — evidence limitations and lack of direct associations are emphasized: Most studies reviewed were cross-sectional with correlational findings, and some studies included participants aged 8–18 years; additionally, without prospective, long-term studies, pediatric sleep duration data on outcomes such as longevity are lacking. None of the articles either evaluated or demonstrated any direct relationship between sleep duration and longevity in the pediatric population, and therefore, no recommendation was made for optimal sleep duration at any age as related to longevity. Methods limitations included reliance on parent- or self-reported duration, variation in reporting per 24 hours or overnight sleep, and experimental manipulations almost always < 2 weeks with few studies examining sleep duration in the range between 8 and 12 hours.

### Clinical practice guideline: tonsillectomy in children [^227cd21d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Tonsillectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in the United States, with more than 530,000 procedures performed annually in children younger than 15 years. Tonsillectomy is defined as a surgical procedure performed with or without adenoidectomy that completely removes the tonsil including its capsule by dissecting the peritonsillar space between the tonsil capsule and the muscular wall. Depending on the context in which it is used, it may indicate tonsillectomy with adenoidectomy, especially in relation to sleep-disordered breathing. This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care and management of children 1 to 18 years old under consideration for tonsillectomy. In addition, this guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who interact with children 1 to 18 years of age who may be candidates for tonsillectomy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based guidance in identifying children who are the best candidates for tonsillectomy. Secondary objectives are to optimize the perioperative management of children undergoing tonsillectomy, emphasize the need for evaluation and intervention in special populations, improve counseling and education of families of children who are considering tonsillectomy for their child, highlight the management options for patients with modifying factors, and reduce inappropriate or unnecessary variations in care.

Results

The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should administer a single, intraoperative dose of intravenous dexamethasone to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made a strong recommendation against clinicians routinely administering or prescribing perioperative antibiotics to children undergoing tonsillectomy. The panel made recommendations for (1) watchful waiting for recurrent throat infection if there have been fewer than 7 episodes in the past year or fewer than 5 episodes per year in the past 2 years or fewer than 3 episodes per year in the past 3 years; (2) assessing the child with recurrent throat infection who does not meet criteria in statement 2 for modifying factors that may nonetheless favor tonsillectomy, which may include but are not limited to multiple antibiotic allergy/intolerance, periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis, or history of peritonsillar abscess; (3) asking caregivers of children with sleep-disordered breathing and tonsil hypertrophy about comorbid conditions that might improve after tonsillectomy, including growth retardation, poor school performance, enuresis, and behavioral problems; (4) counseling caregivers about tonsillectomy as a means to improve health in children with abnormal polysomnography who also have tonsil hypertrophy and sleep-disordered breathing; (5) counseling caregivers that sleep-disordered breathing may persist or recur after tonsillectomy and may require further management; (6) advocating for pain management after tonsillectomy and educating caregivers about the importance of managing and reassessing pain; and (7) clinicians who perform tonsillectomy should determine their rate of primary and secondary posttonsillectomy hemorrhage at least annually. The panel offered options to recommend tonsillectomy for recurrent throat infection with a frequency of at least 7 episodes in the past year or at least 5 episodes per year for 2 years or at least 3 episodes per year for 3 years with documentation in the medical record for each episode of sore throat and 1 or more of the following: temperature > 38.3°C, cervical adenopathy, tonsillar exudate, or positive test for group A β-hemolytic streptococcus.

### Recommended amount of sleep for pediatric populations: a consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [^a57f3fc0]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine consensus — pediatric sleep duration ranges by age: Infants 4 months to 12 months should sleep 12 to 16 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 1 to 2 years of age should sleep 11 to 14 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 3 to 5 years of age should sleep 10 to 13 hours per 24 hours (including naps) on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Children 6 to 12 years of age should sleep 9 to 12 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Teenagers 13 to 18 years of age should sleep 8 to 10 hours per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health. Recommendations for infants younger than 4 months are not included due to the wide range of normal variation in duration and patterns of sleep, and insufficient evidence for associations with health outcomes.

### Clinical significance of sleepiness: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^bc09cd5c]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Insufficient sleep and recommended sleep duration — although individual sleep needs vary, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society recommend that the average adult should get 7 or more hours per night of sleep on a regular basis to promote optimal health, and the National Sleep Foundation and American Thoracic Society provide similar consensus recommendations of 7–9 hours of sleep for adults; pediatric recommendations vary by age range, with younger children generally requiring more sleep. Insufficient sleep from sleep deprivation (for example, getting no sleep in the previous 24 hours) results in sleepiness that is maximal during the typical sleep period due to circadian processes, the pressure to sleep can culminate in "microsleeps" that intrude into wakefulness, and inadequate opportunity to sleep (such as restricting time in bed to only a few hours at night) produces patterns in which self-reported sleepiness increases acutely and then plateaus across several days while cognitive performance continues to deteriorate, whereas objectively measured sleepiness continues to increase during a prolonged period of inadequate sleep opportunity.

### Common sleep disorders in children [^64ec59ca]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Up to 50% of children will experience a sleep problem. Early identification of sleep problems may prevent negative consequences, such as daytime sleepiness, irritability, behavioral problems, learning difficulties, motor vehicle crashes in teenagers, and poor academic performance. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs in 1% to 5% of children. Polysomnography is needed to diagnose the condition because it may not be detected through history and physical examination alone. Adenotonsillectomy is the primary treatment for most children with obstructive sleep apnea. Parasomnias are common in childhood; sleepwalking, sleep talking, confusional arousals, and sleep terrors tend to occur in the first half of the night, whereas nightmares are more common in the second half of the night. Only 4% of parasomnias will persist past adolescence; thus, the best management is parental reassurance and proper safety measures. Behavioral insomnia of childhood is common and is characterized by a learned inability to fall and/or stay asleep. Management begins with consistent implementation of good sleep hygiene practices, and, in some cases, use of extinction techniques may be appropriate. Delayed sleep phase disorder is most common in adolescence, presenting as difficulty falling asleep and awakening at socially acceptable times. Treatment involves good sleep hygiene and a consistent sleep-wake schedule, with nighttime melatonin and/or morning bright light therapy as needed. Diagnosing restless legs syndrome in children can be difficult; management focuses on trigger avoidance and treatment of iron deficiency, if present.

### Sleep symptoms predict school attendance after pediatric concussion [^f9265a63]. Clinical Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

This study examined the relationship between postconcussive symptom domain and school attendance. Retrospective chart review was completed for 88 children aged 6 to 18 years who were evaluated within 30 days postinjury. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess the association of physical, cognitive, emotional, and sleep symptoms with extent of school attendance. A subgroup multiple regression analysis was conducted to evaluate whether age affected the relationship of symptoms to school attendance. After controlling for demographic variables and total number of symptoms, a higher number of postconcussive sleep symptoms strongly predicted less school attendance. Specifically, older children (≥ 14 years old) with more sleep symptoms demonstrated less school attendance. For children presenting for specialty care after concussion, sleep symptoms are unfavorably associated with return to school. Future work aimed at optimizing sleep regulation following concussion may assist with early reengagement in school as recommended by current concussion management guidelines.

### Counseling on early childhood concerns: sleep issues, thumb sucking, picky eating, and school readiness [^082d3243]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Sleep issues, thumb sucking, coping with picky eating, and determining if a child is ready for school are common concerns of families with young children. Information and resources to help counsel on these topics include recommendations from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the American Dental Association, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Infant sleep times can be prolonged by unmodified or graduated extinction, maintaining routines, scheduled awakenings, and parent education. Thumb sucking can be addressed with positive reinforcement, alternative comfort measures, reminders, and child involvement in solutions. Worry about picky eating can be eased by educating parents about the dietary requirements of toddlers. Social and emotional factors most influence kindergarten success. Keeping children from starting school may not be in their best interest academically.

For patients with "Daily symptoms, waking at night once a week or more and low lung function, or recent exacerbation," options are "Medium dose ICS-formoterol maintenance and reliever (MART)" or "Medium/high dose ICS-LABA + as-needed SABA (or ICS-SABA)." For those with "Symptoms most days, or waking at night once a week or more, or low lung function," options are "Low dose ICS-formoterol maintenance and reliever (MART)" or "Low dose ICS-LABA + as-needed SABA (or ICS-SABA)." For "Symptoms less than 3–5 days a week, with normal (or mildly reduced) lung function," options include "As-needed-only low dose ICS-formoterol" or "Take low dose ICS whenever SABA is taken," with the note that "In patients with symptoms 1–2 days a week or less, adherence with daily ICS would be very poor, so taking low-dose ICS whenever SABA is taken could reduce the risk of exacerbations." An additional option shown is "Low dose ICS + as-needed SABA (or ICS-SABA)."

### Sleep quality and temperament in association with autism spectrum disorder among infants in Japan [^c49fafa2]. Communications Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, no studies have thoroughly investigated sleep quality and temperament in early infants as predictors of a later ASD diagnosis. Such associations must be ascertained for identifying the mechanism and management of autism. Hence, this study investigates whether the sleep quality and temperament of 1-month-old infants are associated with ASD diagnosis by 3 years old using data from a large-cohort study. We also assess the sex-stratified associations of sleep quality, temperament, and autism. Our findings suggest that sleep quality and temperament are associated with ASD diagnosis.

Immunologic health in older children and adolescents — sleep duration evidence indicates that 13 non-randomized studies with participant counts ranging from as few as 54 to just under 1,500 reported mixed findings: one study linked 8–8.9 hours to a healthier immune profile and another found higher CRP with less than 8 hours; no studies suggested too much sleep was harmful. Overall, sleep durations less than 8 hours are associated with worse overall immunological health, and optimal sleep is between 8–9 hours in older children and adolescents.

REM‑suppressing medication washout before MSLT — "A 2-week washout period is generally considered adequate for most REM-suppressing medications, although medications with longer half-lives may require a longer period." A study found "13.2% of patients weaned off REM-suppressing medications ≥ 2 weeks prior to MSLT vs 5.9% of patients with no history of such medication use had a positive MSLT." Before stopping therapy, "the health care provider should consider an appropriate taper to also minimize withdrawal effects and ensure the patient's safety." Additionally, "A 2-week washout is generally recommended; agents with an asterisk in Table 1 have long half-lives and longer washout (up to 6 weeks) may be needed," and "A sufficient period of time for observation after discontinuation should be established and will depend on the pharmacokinetics of each medication."

### Technical report: diagnosis and management of childhood obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [^63fcbab1]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

This technical report describes the procedures involved in developing the recommendations of the Subcommittee on Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in children. The group of primary interest for this report was otherwise healthy children older than 1 year who might have adenotonsillar hypertrophy or obesity as underlying risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The goals of the committee were to enhance the primary care clinician's ability to recognize OSAS, identify the most appropriate procedure for diagnosis of OSAS, identify risks associated with pediatric OSAS, and evaluate management options for OSAS.

Methods

A literature search was initially conducted for the years 1966–1999 and then updated to include 2000. The search was limited to English language literature concerning children older than 2 and younger than 18 years. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance, and committee members reviewed in detail any possibly appropriate articles to determine eligibility for inclusion. Additional articles were obtained by a review of literature and committee members' files. Committee members compiled evidence tables and met to review and discuss the literature that was collected.

Results

A total of 2115 titles were reviewed, of which 113 provided relevant original data for analysis. These articles were mainly case series and cross-sectional studies; overall, very few methodologically strong cohort studies or randomized, controlled trials concerning OSAS have been published. In addition, a minority of studies satisfactorily differentiated primary snoring from true OSAS. Reports of the prevalence of habitual snoring in children ranged from 3.2% to 12.1%, and estimates of OSAS ranged from 0.7% to 10.3%; these studies were too heterogeneous for data pooling. Children with sleep-disordered breathing are at increased risk for hyperactivity and learning problems. The combined odds ratio for neurobehavioral abnormalities in snoring children compared with controls is 2.93 (95% confidence interval: 2.23–3.83). A number of case series have documented decreased somatic growth in children with OSAS; right ventricular dysfunction and systemic hypertension also have been reported in children with OSAS. However, the risk growth and cardiovascular problems cannot be quantified from the published literature. Overnight polysomnography (PSG) is recognized as the gold standard for diagnosis of OSAS, and there are currently no satisfactory alternatives. The diagnostic accuracy of symptom questionnaires and other purely clinical approaches is low. Pulse oximetry appears to be specific but insensitive. Other methods, including audiotaping or videotaping and nap or home overnight PSG, remain investigational. Adenotonsillectomy is curative in 75% to 100% of children with OSAS, including those who are obese. Up to 27% of children undergoing adenotonsillectomy for OSAS have postoperative respiratory complications, but estimates are varied. Risk factors for persistent OSAS after adenotonsillectomy include continued snoring and a high apnea-hypopnea index on the preoperative PSG.

Conclusions

OSAS is common in children and is associated with significant sequelae. Overnight PSG is currently the only reliable diagnostic modality that can differentiate OSAS from primary snoring. However, the PSG criteria for OSAS have not been definitively validated, and it is not clear that primary snoring without PSG-defined OSAS is benign. Adenotonsillectomy is the first-line treatment for OSAS but requires careful postoperative monitoring because of the high risk of respiratory complications. Adenotonsillectomy is usually curative, but children with persistent snoring (and perhaps with severely abnormal preoperative PSG results) should have PSG repeated postoperatively.

### Preventing sleeping problems in infants who are at risk of developing them [^16094f84]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

(1) To identify factors at 1 week of age which put infants at risk of failing to sleep through the night at 12 weeks of age. (2) To assess whether a behavioural programme increases the likelihood that these infants will sleep through the night at 12 weeks of age.

Methods

A community sample of 316 newborn infants was employed to identify the risk factors at 1 week of age which increased the likelihood of failing to sleep through the night at 12 weeks of age. Infants who met these risk criteria and were randomly assigned to a behavioural programme were compared with at risk infants in the control group on measures of sleeping, crying, and feeding at 12 weeks of age.

Results

Infants who had a high number (> 11) of feeds in 24 hours at 1 week were 2.7 times (95% CI 1.5 to 4.8) more likely than other control group infants to fail to sleep through the night at 12 weeks of age. At 12 weeks, 82% of these at risk infants assigned to the behavioural programme, compared to 61% in the control group, slept through the night. The findings were similar in breast and bottle feeders.

Conclusions

Preventing infant sleeping problems should be more cost effective than treating them after they have arisen. This study provides evidence that it is possible to identify infants who are at risk of failing to sleep through the night at an early age, and that a simple, three step, preventive behavioural programme increases the number who sleep through the night by 21%.

### Recommended amount of sleep for pediatric populations: a consensus statement of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine [^194017f1]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion and future directions — pediatric sleep duration recommendations state that current evidence supports the general recommendations for obtaining an adequate number of hours of sleep per 24 hours on a regular basis to promote optimal health among children aged 4 months to 18 years. Individual variability in sleep need is influenced by genetic, behavioral, medical, and environmental factors. Implementation goals include disseminating the recommendations to clinicians, public health professionals, healthcare providers/trainees, and the general public on the importance of adequate sleep duration for health; encouraging parents and caregivers to help children obtain adequate sleep duration; initiating discussions of social, educational, and economic benefits of adequate sleep duration, thereby informing public policy; and promoting research on the role of sleep duration in health and well-being, noting that research that directly examines the effects of sleep duration on health may lead to revisions of these recommendations in the future. Methods notes indicate the review resulted in a total of 864 scientific articles, the process was further guided by the Oxford grading system, and, consistent with the RAND Appropriateness Method, multiple rounds of evidence review, discussion, and voting were conducted to arrive at the final recommendations. These recommendations have been endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Sleep Research Society and the American Association of Sleep Technologists.

### Vagus nerve stimulation for electrographic status epilepticus in Slow-wave sleep [^6ae2788d]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Electrographic status epilepticus in slow sleep or continuous spike and waves during slow-wave sleep is an epileptic encephalopathy characterized by seizures, neurocognitive regression, and significant activation of epileptiform discharges during nonrapid eye movement sleep. There is no consensus on the diagnostic criteria and evidence-based optimal treatment algorithm for children with electrographic status epilepticus in slow sleep.

Patient Description

We describe a 12-year-old girl with drug-resistant electrographic status epilepticus in slow wave sleep that was successfully treated with vagus nerve stimulation. Her clinical presentation, presurgical evaluation, decision-making, and course after vagus nerve stimulator implantation are described in detail.

Findings

After vagus nerve stimulator implantation, the girl remained seizure free for more than a year, resolved the electrographic status epilepticus in slow sleep pattern on electroencephalography, and exhibited significant cognitive improvement.

Conclusion

Vagus nerve stimulation may be considered for electrographic status epilepticus in slow sleep.

### "Struggle at night-He doesn' T let me sleep sometimes": a qualitative analysis of sleeping habits and routines of hispanic toddlers at risk for obesity [^2c5265f6]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Co-sleeping, defined here as bedsharing rather than room-sharing, has also been strongly associated with fragmented sleep for infants and toddlers; bedsharing is a strong predictor of nocturnal awakenings. Bedsharing is a parent behavior that may also increase the feeding-to-sleep association. The type of food offered at waking is also important: breastfeeding offered at waking is less obesogenic than formula, and co-sleeping is more closely associated with breastfeeding than formula feeding. Co-sleeping varies by culture and was found to occur at a higher rate in Hispanic families compared to white families. There are mixed studies on the association of co-sleeping and obesity; in a Danish study of 2–6 year old children, co-sleeping was associated with a decreased risk of overweight.

Pediatricians often make recommendations to parents that align with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP); however, what the AAP recommends isn't always practical advice for some families. For example, AAP recommends against co-sleeping and promotes a studied set of specific safe sleep and nighttime behaviors for infants such as back sleeping, separate sleeping surface, and avoiding bedsharing, but promoting room-sharing until one year of age. Additionally, the AAP does not specifically endorse sleep training (or "cry it out" methods), though they do encourage independent nighttime sleep by recommending phasing out nighttime feeding after six months of age. These strategies may conflict with parent values and advice from that of other family members. Parents rely heavily on their family members' experience and cultural ties to develop their particular "parenting style". Notably, controlling and permissive parenting styles tend to be found in Hispanic families, and these parenting styles have been associated with overfeeding of young children. Research into infant obesity prevention focuses on responsive feeding, recommending parents pay close attention to hunger and satiety cues, but limiting feeding at other times, i.e. an authoritative style. However, research does not include attention to these behaviors (i.e. responsive feeding) at their intersection with sleep. For example, it is suggested that trained feeding-to-sleep has roots in overly responsive (permissive) parenting and this is an often understudied but important area of research that is relevant to the current study.

### Sounding the alarm on sleep: a negative association between inadequate sleep and flourishing [^fa172e10]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the national prevalence of inadequate sleep among school-age children and its relationship with childhood flourishing.

Study Design

This cross-sectional study analyzed 49 050 parental responses from the 2016–2017 National Survey of Children's Health for school-age children. Inadequate sleep duration was defined as < 9 hours for 6- to 12-year-olds and < 8 hours for 13- to 17-year-olds on an average weeknight. Five markers of flourishing were examined individually and as a combined measure. Logistic regression was used with complex survey design and applied weights.

Results

Inadequate sleep was found in 36.4% of 6- to 12-year-olds and in 31.9% of 13- to 17-year-olds. Compared with children with adequate sleep, 6- to 12-year-olds with inadequate sleep had increased odds of not showing interest and curiosity in learning (aOR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.34–1.94), not caring about doing well in school (aOR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.23–1.71), not doing homework (aOR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.24–1.68), and not finishing tasks (aOR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03–1.35). Children aged 13–17 years with inadequate sleep had increased odds of not doing homework (aOR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.17–1.58), not staying calm and in control when challenged (aOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16–1.54), not showing interest and curiosity in learning (aOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.14–1.58), not finishing tasks (aOR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.03–1.40), and not demonstrating the combined flourishing measure (aOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.17–1.56).

Conclusions

Nationally representative data show that one-third of school-age children have inadequate sleep. Inadequate sleep is associated with decreased flourishing. These data will help inform sleep policies and optimize child development.

### Practical advice for pediatric sleep concerns… [^c99dea14]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

This association could be the presence of a caregiver in their bed, rocking a child until they are asleep, or some other similar activity. This type of sleep concern is often seen in children who had colic as young infants. The primary solution suggested by the authors is to put the child into bed while the child is still slightly drowsy so the child can learn to put themselves to sleep. This is not always easy to do but is crucial to developing good sleep habits. Providing this advice at all well-visits is an important thing that we as clinicians can do to support parents and caregivers. LSSD is often seen in older children who don't want to stay in bed and keep coming out of their rooms. My daughter also had this issue, this time as a toddler, and we implemented a system similar to what the authors describe, using bedtime passes. This worked really well for us, and my daughter adapted pretty quickly.

As a parent, I found that instituting the bedtime pass resulted in less stress and conflict. As we address sleep problems in practice, I would again say that providing family-centered advice is critical. Over the years, I have cared for many families who cannot let their child "cry it out" for a variety of reasons. Sometimes they live in an apartment with walls that allow sound to penetrate another apartment. Other times families have other young children who awaken easily when one child is awake and crying. Aligning our recommendations with the needs of the family can help us be more successful in altering behavior. Also, acknowledging the challenges of raising children is important even for these relatively "simple" problems. Lastly, while this article focuses on scientific literature, clinicians should become familiar with some of the common books and resources designed for children or for caregivers that address sleep problems at different ages.

After reviewing some of these resources, clinicians can make appropriate recommendations to families who could benefit from them. One of the other key insights that I gained from this article was the authors' statement that polysomnogram-confirmed resolution of obstructive apnea occurs in up to 50% of children without any intervention. I didn't realize that this was so likely, and as a result I am reminded of the old adage, "Don't just do something. Sleep problems are common in our practice, and even in our own home. This article is an easy read and relevant to our patients. I hope you will take the time to read it and share it with your learners and colleagues.

### Perspective: teenagers and the sleep paradox [^fce0b59b]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objectives

Teenagers experience sleep deficits as they try to manage expectations with school, their social media presence, and increasingly competitive extracurriculars. Late-night screen time is a barrier to sleep hygiene. It is important to acknowledge and understand lifestyle challenges that can prevent teenagers from receiving adequate sleep every night. A teenager perspective on these issues and recommendations can incite better ways to outreach, educate, and support teenagers in maintaining good sleep.

Methods

We describe what is known and not known about sleep health among teenagers and challenges to maintaining adequate sleep from the perspective of a third-year high school student. We also provide recommendations for outreach to promote early recognition of issues and tools that can support sleep hygiene to reinforce future mental and physical health.

Results

While teenagers enjoy good sleep, this is limited by heavy loads of homework along with increasingly competitive extracurriculars, keeping up with social and cultural demands, and early school starts. Also, teenagers may not understand what adequate sleep entails and the full impact of sleep on well-being.

Conclusions

Social media provides a channel to extend outreach to teenagers to communicate the importance of consistent quality and quantity of sleep, increase awareness of sleep tracking tools, and highlight the impact of sleep on mental health. Additionally, better engagement is needed with schools and community to manage academic and extracurricular schedules that allow teenagers to schedule consistent bedtimes and wake times.
