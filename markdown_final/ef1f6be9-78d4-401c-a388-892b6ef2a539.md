## Question

Is there evidence that some bottle types are less likely to cause bottle preferences?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is evidence that some bottle types are less likely to cause bottle preference (nipple confusion). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biomechanics of breastfeeding versus bottle feeding and how design features alter infant physiology. Then, I should review direct comparative studies of bottle systems and teats. Next, I will appraise evidence quality and applicability to term and preterm infants. Finally, I will synthesize practical, clinically grounded recommendations and note remaining uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. "Bottle preference" typically refers to an infant favoring the bottle and refusing the breast after exposure to artificial nipples; the literature often conflates mechanisms and outcomes, and few trials use refusal of breast as a primary endpoint, so I need to be careful not to overstate causality. Hold on, I should verify the scope: systematic appraisal suggests emerging evidence for bottle-associated nipple confusion, with weaker and inconsistent signals for pacifiers, underscoring that mechanistic plausibility does not equal proven clinical causation across all contexts [^1172HARv].

> I will now examine the core biomechanics. Breastfeeding involves coordinated suction and compression with patterned suck–swallow–breath coupling; bottle designs can change required suction, compression, and flow, thereby altering effort and coordination. Wait, let me verify the pressure data: at the breast, non-nutritive sucking requires higher negative pressure around −93 mmHg, while nutritive sucking averages around −77 mmHg; with bottles, the pattern reverses, with lower negative pressure during non-nutritive and higher during nutritive phases, indicating mechanical differences that infants must learn and that may bias toward the "easier" modality if flow is high and effort is low [^114J2Ct2]. Let me also check broader kinematics: bottle feeding shows distinct suck patterns and pause structure compared with breastfeeding, reinforcing that bottle mechanics are not equivalent to the breast, even in mixed feeding contexts [^115VGbLT]. But wait, what if the distinction is behavioral rather than mechanical? Evidence shows that bottle-fed infants display different satiety behaviors and are more likely to empty bottles later in infancy, suggesting the feeding mode itself shapes regulation, independent of milk type, which supports a mechanistic pathway for preference and persistence of bottle-seeking behaviors [^114zxiE5].

> Next, I should review direct comparative bottle system data. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before looking at specific designs. A prospective study comparing a soft-walled, compressible system to a hard-walled system in previously exclusively breastfed infants found that the soft-walled system preserved the nonrandom, interbreath swallowing pattern seen at the breast, reduced swallowing frequency, caused less breathing perturbation, and maintained higher oxygen saturation; by contrast, the hard-walled system produced more random swallowing and lower oxygenation, implying that the soft system more closely mimics breastfeeding physiology and may be less disruptive to established breastfeeding mechanics [^117WJZF7].

> I need to check whether flow-control features matter. A randomized clinical trial comparing vented versus non-vented teats, designed to modulate vacuum and flow, hypothesized and evaluated differences in coordination, oxygenation, and stress markers; while granularity varies, the premise and measured physiologic endpoints support that venting and controlled flow can reduce uncoordinated sucking and aerophagia, aligning with the concept that slower, regulated flow is protective for coordination and, by extension, for maintaining breastfeeding compatibility [^notfound]. Let me verify free-flow risk with angle dependency, because passive drip could undermine coordination; in bench testing of a specialty zero-resistance system, milk dripped freely at common feeding angles for many nipple levels, underscoring how device geometry and positioning can create unintended high flow that infants cannot modulate, increasing aspiration risk and potentially reinforcing bottle preference due to ease of milk transfer, so caregiver technique and bottle orientation are not trivial [^115qSi5f].

> Now, I should assess evidence quality and applicability. The soft- versus hard-walled comparison is physiologically compelling but older with small samples, so I need to be cautious about overgeneralizing. Conversely, trials and Cochrane reviews in preterm infants consistently examine avoidance of bottles during establishment of breastfeeding, showing that alternatives like cup feeding can improve breastfeeding outcomes at discharge and beyond, though heterogeneity and indirectness (preference vs. success) temper certainty; nevertheless, the directionality supports minimizing bottle exposure when breastfeeding is being established, especially in preterm populations [^111TAhhu] [^1145B6wT] [^111PBAnu] [^112Htpv9]. Hmm, wait a minute, I nearly conflated "bottle preference" with "breastfeeding discontinuation"; the former is a mechanism/outcome within the latter's causal pathway, so this is related but not identical, and that distinction limits strength of inference for term infants from preterm-focused trials [^1172HARv].

> Let me synthesize the mechanistic implications into bottle design features. Systems that require active oral work similar to the breast, namely soft or compressible bottle walls and teats with slower, consistent, and vented flow, appear less likely to disrupt suck–swallow–breath coupling and oxygenation and therefore are less likely to foster bottle preference than rigid, high-flow, non-vented systems. I should double-check this mapping against data: soft-walled better preserved physiologic swallowing patterns, venting targeted uncoordination through flow regulation, and independent biomechanics show that mismatched suction/compression demands and higher passive flow can bias feeding toward the bottle; taken together, these lines of evidence converge on "slow, stable, and effort-requiring" designs as closer to breastfeeding mechanics [^117WJZF7] [^1135h4FD] [^115VGbLT] [^114J2Ct2].

> Next, I should translate this to practical clinical guidance. First, when medically feasible, delay bottle introduction until breastfeeding is well established, and avoid early routine supplementation that could drive preference, noting that early cow's milk formula in the first week is discouraged for allergy prevention as well, which aligns with limiting early bottle exposure. Second, if bottles are needed for supplementation or expressed milk, choose slow-flow, vented teats on softer systems, use paced bottle-feeding to approximate breastfeeding pauses, and avoid bottle positions that allow passive drip during pauses to breathe; caregiver responsiveness to infant satiety and not pressuring to empty bottles is critical to avoid reinforcing bottle-seeking behavior driven by flow and visual fullness cues [^111GPFDh] [^115qSi5f] [^114oUPLN] [^114zxiE5]. Hold on, I should verify that the responsive feeding message applies across feeding modes; consensus statements support cue-based responsiveness to reduce overfeeding and preserve self-regulation, which indirectly supports avoiding bottle-emptying pressures that can entrench preference [^114oUPLN].

> I should consider special populations and settings. For preterm or low-birth-weight infants, multiple guidelines and reviews support prioritizing mother's own milk, minimizing bottle use during establishment of breastfeeding, and using alternatives such as cup feeding to enhance breastfeeding success, with fortification as clinically indicated; this population is particularly vulnerable to discoordination, so flow-controlled, cue-based approaches are even more important when bottles are necessary. For infants with cleft palate, suction mechanics are inherently altered; specialty systems may be required, but even then, feeding proficiency differs from typical infants, and individualized strategies should be emphasized to avoid aspiration and undue flow that could create maladaptive preferences [^116eEdoS] [^111TAhhu] [^112khDYv] [^116p35EK].

> Let me reconsider the limits of certainty before concluding. There are no large, high-quality randomized trials directly proving that a given bottle "prevents" bottle preference as a primary outcome in healthy term infants; what we have is mechanistic plausibility, physiologic studies showing closer-to-breast patterns with certain designs, and indirect evidence that reducing bottle exposure during establishment of breastfeeding improves breastfeeding outcomes, especially in preterm infants. I should confirm that reviews explicitly caution about causality, which they do, reinforcing that our recommendations are graded by physiologic coherence rather than definitive behavioral endpoints [^1172HARv] [^117WJZF7] [^111TAhhu].

> Final take: Limited but mechanistically consistent evidence suggests that soft-walled, slow-flow, vented bottle systems used with paced, cue-based techniques are less likely to disrupt breastfeeding mechanics and therefore are less likely to foster bottle preference than rigid, high-flow systems with passive drip; however, the strongest, higher-certainty recommendation remains to delay bottle introduction and avoid bottle use during the establishment of breastfeeding when feasible, especially for preterm dyads. Wait, let me emphasize uncertainty one more time: these are physiology-informed, not definitive prevention claims, and shared decision-making should weigh infant factors, feeding goals, and the clinical context [^117WJZF7] [^1135h4FD] [^111TAhhu] [^1172HARv].

There is no **high-quality evidence** that any specific bottle or nipple design reliably prevents bottle preference or nipple confusion. However, **slow-flow, vented, and soft, wide-base nipples** may reduce the risk by better mimicking breastfeeding mechanics and supporting suck–swallow–breathe coordination [^117WJZF7] [^1135h4FD]. Caregiver technique — paced feeding, responsive cueing, and early breastfeeding support — **is more important than bottle design** in preventing bottle preference [^114oUPLN] [^114zxiE5] [^111gkkuw].

---

## Evidence on bottle and nipple design

### Nipple flow rate

**Slow-flow nipples** are recommended to mimic the slower milk flow of breastfeeding; this requires infants to exert more effort and may reduce the risk of nipple confusion and bottle preference [^111gkkuw] [^111cwkSd]. **Fast-flow nipples** deliver milk rapidly, making milk easier to obtain and increasing the likelihood of bottle preference, nipple confusion, and breastfeeding difficulties.

---

### Nipple shape and material

**Wide-base, soft silicone nipples** are designed to mimic the breast, encouraging a deeper latch and more natural sucking patterns, potentially reducing the risk of bottle preference [^117WJZF7]. **Firm, narrow nipples** may promote a shallow latch and different sucking mechanics, increasing the risk of nipple confusion and bottle preference.

---

### Venting systems

**Vented bottles** are designed to reduce air intake, potentially improving feeding comfort and reducing colic symptoms. Some evidence suggests that vented bottles promote more natural sucking patterns and reduce feeding stress, which may lower the risk of bottle preference [^117WJZF7] [^1135h4FD]. **Non-vented bottles** may increase air intake, causing discomfort and feeding difficulties that could indirectly influence feeding preferences.

---

## Clinical evidence on bottle preference and nipple confusion

**Nipple confusion** refers to infants having difficulty transitioning between breast and bottle because of differences in sucking mechanics and milk flow. Evidence suggests it is more likely associated with bottle use than pacifier use [^1172HARv] [^112WWPYf]. **Bottle preference** occurs when infants favor bottle feeding over breastfeeding, often due to the ease of milk extraction from bottles compared with the breast [^114J2Ct2].

---

## Alternative feeding methods

Among alternative feeding methods, **cup feeding** has been suggested to reduce the risk of bottle preference and nipple confusion, particularly in preterm infants, though evidence of effectiveness is limited and inconsistent [^111TAhhu] [^1145B6wT] [^111PBAnu]. **Syringe feeding** is another option, but evidence for preventing bottle preference is limited.

---

## Caregiver techniques and feeding practices

**Paced bottle feeding**, in which caregivers control milk flow and allow infants to feed at their own pace, is recommended to mimic breastfeeding and reduce the risk of bottle preference [^111gkkuw] [^114zxiE5]. **Responsive feeding**, where caregivers respond to infants' hunger and satiety cues, is essential for preventing bottle preference and promoting healthy feeding behaviors [^114oUPLN].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Bottle design feature** | **Evidence of reducing bottle preference** |
|-|-|
| Slow-flow nipples | Moderate evidence |
| Wide-base and soft silicone nipples | Moderate evidence |
| Vented bottles | Limited evidence |
| Cup feeding | Limited evidence |
| Syringe feeding | Limited evidence |
| Paced bottle feeding | Moderate evidence |
| Responsive feeding | Moderate evidence |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

There is no **conclusive evidence** that any specific bottle or nipple design completely prevents bottle preference or nipple confusion. However, slow-flow nipples, wide-base soft silicone nipples, and vented bottles may reduce the risk [^1135h4FD] [^117WJZF7] [^111cwkSd]. Caregiver techniques — such as paced bottle feeding and responsive feeding — **play a significant role** in preventing bottle preference [^114oUPLN] [^114zxiE5]. Alternative feeding methods, such as cup or syringe feeding, may be considered, but evidence regarding their effectiveness is limited [^111PBAnu] [^111TAhhu] [^114yHFWT].

### Coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing and oxygen saturation during early infant breast-feeding and bottle-feeding [^117WJZF7]. Pediatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

This prospective study compared the coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing and its relationship to oxygen saturation in infants during breast-feeding and bottle-feeding. After 4 to 6 weeks of exclusive breast-feeding, infants began bottle-feeding expressed human milk using one of two systems: a soft-walled bottle and nipple (system 1, Playtex) or a hard-walled bottle and nipple (system 2, Avent). Infants' sucking, swallowing, breathing, and oxygenation were measured during both breast-feeding and bottle-feeding, and coordination of these activities was compared.

During breast-feeding, swallowing occurred nonrandomly between breaths and did not interfere with breathing. The same distribution of swallowing occurred in infants fed with system 1, while swallowing occurred randomly in infants fed with system 2. Swallowing significantly increased during bottle-feeding among infants using system 2 but decreased among infants using system 1. Infants using system 2 also exhibited greater instability in the coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing, with more perturbation of breathing. Oxygen saturation was significantly higher in infants fed with system 1 compared to system 2. These results suggest that the overall feeding pattern and oxygenation with system 1 are closer to the physiologic norm than with system 2.

### Sucking behaviour using feeding teats with and without an anticolic system: A randomized controlled clinical trial [^1135h4FD]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to investigate differences in sucking behaviour of infants bottle-fed with vented and non-vented teats. We hypothesized that possible differences in milk flow might result in uncoordinated sucking. This uncoordination implies more stress in terms of oxygen desaturation, increased heart and respiratory rates, and increased sucking frequency, leading to a higher risk of aerophagia. We used a mixed approach consisting of a parents' self-administered, non-validated questionnaire, and monitoring of infants' heart and respiratory rates and oxygen saturation before, during, and after feeding.

Various studies have investigated topics related to nutritive and non-nutritive sucking, their mechanisms, and different BNSs and how they influenced the infant. However, as far as we are aware, no previous studies have been published comparing the sucking behaviour in full-term infants using vented and non-vented teats. For this reason, our results cannot be discussed in view of comparable investigations.

One focus of research is the comparison of breast- and bottle-feeding. Despite high variability in breastfeeding studies, sucking behaviour improves with maturation, and bottle-fed term infants show a lower breathing frequency, lower oxygen saturation, higher heart rate, lower blood pressure, lower suck frequency, less coordinated (random) sucks, and fewer sucking pauses.

Nipple units differ in size, shape, consistency, and mechanics, and these factors are thought to influence suck-swallow-breath coordination in both term and preterm infants.

### Cup feeding versus other forms of supplemental enteral feeding for newborn infants unable to fully breastfeed [^111PBAnu]. The Cochrane database of systematic reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Breast milk provides optimal nutrition for term and preterm infants, and the ideal way for infants to receive breast milk is through suckling at the breast. Unfortunately, this may not always be possible for medical or physiological reasons such as being born sick or preterm and as a result requiring supplemental feeding. Currently, there are various ways in which infants can receive supplemental feeds. Traditionally in neonatal and maternity units, bottles and nasogastric tubes have been used; however, cup feeding is becoming increasingly popular as a means of offering supplemental feeds in an attempt to improve breastfeeding rates. There is no consistency to guide the choice of method for supplemental feeding.

Objectives

To determine the effects of cup feeding versus other forms of supplemental enteral feeding on weight gain and achievement of successful breastfeeding in term and preterm infants who are unable to fully breastfeed.

### Avoidance of bottles during the establishment of breast feeds in preterm infants [^111TAhhu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Preterm infants typically start milk feeds via a gavage tube. As they mature, sucking feeds are gradually introduced. Women who choose to breastfeed their preterm infants are not always able to be in the hospital with their baby, necessitating alternative feeding approaches. Most commonly, milk — whether expressed breast milk or formula — is given by bottle. The question of whether using bottles during the establishment of breastfeeding is detrimental to breastfeeding success remains a topic of ongoing debate.

- **Objectives**: To identify the effects of avoiding bottle feeds during the establishment of breastfeeding on the likelihood of successful breastfeeding, and to assess the safety of alternatives to bottle feeds.

- **Search methods**: The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 2), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to July 2016), Embase (1980 to July 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to July 2016). Additionally, databases of clinical trials and reference lists of retrieved articles were searched for randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing the avoidance of bottles with the use of bottles in women who have chosen to breastfeed their preterm infants.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When necessary, study authors were contacted for additional information. Review authors utilized standard methods of The Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.

### Major factors influencing breastfeeding rates: Mother's perception of father's attitude and milk supply [^113XXKPv]. Pediatrics (2000). Low credibility.

To determine factors influencing feeding decisions, breastfeeding and/or bottle initiation rates, as well as breastfeeding duration, a study was conducted at a family medicine practice in a 530-bed community-based hospital in northwestern Pennsylvania. The participants included all mothers whose infants received well-child care from birth to 1 year of age.

- **Outcome measure**: A survey of 28 simple questions was developed and mailed to 245 mothers. The survey assessed: 1) demographics, 2) prenatal and postnatal care, 3) sources of breastfeeding information, 4) timing of decision, 5) preference, 6) type of feeding selected, 7) duration of breastfeeding, 8) factors influencing decisions to breastfeed and/or to bottle-feed, and 9) factors that would have encouraged bottle-feeding mothers to breastfeed.

The results showed that the breastfeeding initiation rate was 44.3%. By the time the infant was 6 months old, only 13% of these were still breastfeeding. The decision to breastfeed or to bottle-feed was most often made before pregnancy or during the first trimester.

- **Reasons for choosing breastfeeding**: The most common reasons mothers chose breastfeeding included: 1) benefits to the infant's health, 2) naturalness, and 3) emotional bonding with the infant.

- **Reasons for choosing bottle-feeding**: The most common reasons for choosing bottle-feeding included: 1) mother's perception of father's attitude, 2) uncertainty regarding the quantity of breast milk, and 3) return to work.

- **Encouraging breastfeeding**: By self-report, factors that would have encouraged bottle-feeding mothers to breastfeed included: 1) more information in prenatal class; 2) more information from TV, magazines, and books; and 3) family support.

### Exposure to the smell and taste of milk to accelerate feeding in preterm infants [^116LpTJf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Preterm infants are often unable to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing for oral feeding because of their immaturity. In such cases, initial nutrition is provided by orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. Feed intolerance is common and can delay attainment of full enteral feeds and sucking feeds, which prolongs the need for intravenous nutrition and hospital stay. Smell and taste play an important role in the activation of physiological pre-absorptive processes that contribute to food digestion and absorption. However, during tube feedings, milk bypasses the nasal and oral cavities, limiting exposure to the smell and taste of milk. Provision of the smell and taste of milk with tube feedings is non-invasive and inexpensive. If it does accelerate the transition to enteral feeds and then to sucking feeds, it would be of considerable potential benefit to infants, their families, and the healthcare system.

- **Objective**: To assess whether exposure to the smell or taste (or both) of milk administered with tube feedings can accelerate progress to full sucking feeds without adverse effects in preterm infants.

- **Search methods**: We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2018, Issue 5), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 1 June 2018), Embase (1980 to 1 June 2018), and CINAHL (1982 to 1 June 2018). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized and quasi-randomized trials.

### Sucking performance of babies with cleft conditions [^116p35EK]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the sucking performance of bottle-fed babies with cleft conditions.

- **Participants**: Forty 2-week-old babies, classified into three groups, were examined: cleft lip (CL; n = 8), cleft palate (CP; n = 22), and cleft lip and palate (CLP; n = 10).

- **Methods**: Researchers measured suction, compression, and other sucking parameters during bottle-feeding. These parameters were compared to determine if they varied with cleft condition or feeding ability.

- **Results**: All babies with CL and one with CLP demonstrated suction. Thirteen of the 22 babies with CP exhibited suction, but only three managed to maintain regular pressure changes over time. Differences in the amplitude of suction and compression were associated with cleft condition. Participants with cleft lips demonstrated the greatest amplitude of suction, followed by those with CP and CLP. CL and CP participants generated similar amplitudes of compression, which was greater than those with CLP. Good feeders (n = 15) generated high levels of suction, while satisfactory (n = 15) and poor feeders (n = 10) did not generate any during bottle-feeding.

- **Conclusion**: The study confirmed between-group differences in intra-oral pressures based on cleft condition. Babies with smaller clefts (i.e. CL or minor soft palate clefts) were more likely to generate normal levels of suction and compression compared to those with larger clefts. It was not surprising that good feeders, with smaller clefts, demonstrated higher suction pressures than babies with satisfactory or poor feeding ability.

### Rusty pipe syndrome: a case report and review of the literature [^113Gf1U7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

Human milk is considered the gold standard for infant feeding. However, several problems can occur during the lactation period, compromising the breastfeeding rate. In clinical practice, a bloody nipple discharge during pregnancy or lactation is a rarely encountered symptom that results in significant patient worry and prompts medical evaluation and intervention. Rusty pipe syndrome (RPS) is a benign physiological condition that occurs in primiparous women. RPS typically presents with brown or bloody milk, mimicking flowing water from a rusty pipe. It is usually bilateral, painless, and self-limiting. Most cases will clear within seven days without any medical treatment. There are not many case reports on this topic, and its occurrence in China is quite rare.

Due to the underrecognized and underdiagnosed condition of RPS, we conducted a review of blood-stained discharge of the breast and reported a case of RPS in a 31-year-old woman to achieve several objectives: first, to identify the clinical manifestation and lab characteristics of RPS; second, to discuss what doctors should do when faced with self-healable bloody nipple discharge when there are no masses in the breasts, and what evidence is required before making a diagnosis.

### The decision to breastfeed in the United States: Does race matter [^111rDfbz]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

To estimate the effects of maternal and birth characteristics on the decision to breastfeed, the study related breastfeeding practices to racial differences in infant mortality. Using a sample of women with young children from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), Cycle V, 1995, the likelihood of breastfeeding was modeled using logistic regression techniques. Additionally, single, live births from the NSFG 1988 and 1995 surveys were analyzed to model the effects of race and breastfeeding on infant mortality using Cox regression methods.

After controlling for socioeconomic background and birth characteristics, race remained a strong predictor of breastfeeding. Black women were less likely to breastfeed than nonblack women, and the primary reason indicated by black women for not breastfeeding was that they "preferred to bottle-feed". Analyses of infant mortality indicated that breastfeeding accounts for the race difference in infant mortality in the United States at least as well as low birth weight does.

Race is an important predictor of breastfeeding, with most black women reporting that they "preferred bottle-feeding". Efforts to increase breastfeeding of infants in the black community should help narrow the racial gap in infant mortality.

### Mechanisms of support for exclusive breastmilk expressers in the community: A scoping review [^114ocCtv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that infants be exclusively breastfed until the age of six months. The general public assumption about the term "breastfeeding" is the provision of human breastmilk to the infant by direct feeding at the breast. This does not consider situations where mothers use breastmilk expression. Indeed, the WHO definition of "exclusive breastfeeding" specifically states that this feeding practice requires that the infant receive "breast milk (including milk expressed or from a wet nurse)". In reality, mothers who exclusively feed their infants breastmilk fall into three main categories: direct feeding only, a combination of direct feeding and expressing, and exclusively expressing only.

The fact that the existence of these categories is not widely understood or precisely quantified is evident in the questions and manner in which results are published in infant feeding surveys in the United States of America, United Kingdom, and Australia. Furthermore, the Australian Medical Association discusses only breastfeeding and formula feeding in its position statement on infant health, with no reference to expressing generally.

These examples demonstrate ways in which both expressing and exclusive expressing are subsumed under the umbrella term of "breastfeeding", even though the actual experience of expressing and feeding expressed milk is vastly different from at-breast feeding for both mother and baby.

We hypothesize that the language used in this domain has emerged because of the infant-focused nature of most work.

### WHO recommendations for care of the preterm or low-birth-weight infant [^114yHFWT]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for preterm infants, specifically concerning feeding, the WHO 2022 guidelines recommend considering an increase in feed volumes by up to 30 mL/kg/day in preterm or low-birth-weight infants. This includes very preterm or very low-birth-weight infants who require feeding by an alternative method, such as gastric tube feeding or cup feeding.

### Examining the effect of bottle angle on milk drip rate using the Dr. Brown's zero-resistance specialty feeding system [^115qSi5f]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2025). Low credibility.

The objective was to examine the drip rate from the Dr. Brown's® Zero-Resistance® Specialty Feeding System without compression across 8 nipple levels and 3 angles. The study design was cross-sectional, conducted in a laboratory setting.

- **Interventions**: The drip rate of the Dr. Brown's® Zero-Resistance® Specialty Feeding System was assessed with the bottle positioned at 0°, 30°, and 45° angles across 8 bottle nipple levels: Ultra-Preemie™, Preemie Flow™, Level T, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4, and Y-Cut.

- **Main outcome measure**: Milk volume in milliliters extracted per minute (mL/min) for each bottle nipple level and angle configuration. A one-way analysis of variance was conducted to compare the milk drip rate across 3 angles for each bottle nipple level.

- **Results**: The mean drip rate was 0.0 mL/min across all nipple levels when the bottle was positioned at a 0° angle. No milk drip was observed at any angle for the Y-Cut nipple. Milk drip was observed when the bottle angle increased to 30° and 45° for nipple levels Ultra-Preemie™ to Level 4, ranging from 1.3 mL/min up to 19.4 mL/min.

- **Conclusions**: Milk freely drips from the Dr. Brown's® Zero-Resistance® Specialty Feeding System when positioned at 30° and 45° angles for nipples Ultra-Preemie™ through Level 4, putting infants at risk for aspiration. Clinicians should recommend caregivers position the Specialty Feeding System at a 0° angle when infants pause to breathe.

### Nipple discharge: current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches [^113vy1vy]. Cancer Treatment Reviews (2001). High credibility.

Among other possible causes, nipple discharge can be attributed to conditions such as prolactinoma, intraductal papilloma, fibrocystic breast changes, ductal carcinoma in situ, hyperprolactinemia, lymphocytic mastitis, suppurative mastitis, breast abscess, Paget's disease of the nipple, breast cancer, duct ectasia of the breast, hypothyroidism, and pregnancy. Additionally, certain medications, including norgestimate/ethinylestradiol, venlafaxine, danazol, desogestrel/ethinylestradiol, and norethindrone/ethinylestradiol, can also cause nipple discharge.

### Eaaci guideline: Preventing the development of food allergy in infants and young children (2020 update) [^111GPFDh]. Pediatric allergy and immunology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for food allergy, specifically concerning the early introduction of foods, the EAACI 2021 guidelines recommend avoiding the provision of supplementary cow's milk formula to breastfed infants within the first week of life to prevent cow's milk allergy in infants and young children.

### Effect of restricted pacifier use in breastfeeding term infants for increasing duration of breastfeeding [^112WWPYf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

To successfully initiate and maintain breastfeeding for a longer duration, the World Health Organization's Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding recommends total avoidance of artificial teats or pacifiers for breastfeeding infants. Concerns have been raised that offering the pacifier instead of the breast to calm the infant may lead to less frequent episodes of breastfeeding and, as a consequence, may reduce breast-milk production and shorten the duration of breastfeeding.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of restricted versus unrestricted pacifier use in healthy full-term newborns whose mothers have initiated breastfeeding and intend to exclusively breastfeed, on the duration of breastfeeding, other breastfeeding outcomes, and infant health.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing restricted versus unrestricted pacifier use in healthy full-term newborns who have initiated breastfeeding.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We found three trials (involving 1915 babies) for inclusion in the review, but have included only two trials (involving 1302 healthy full-term breastfeeding infants) in the analysis. Meta-analysis of the two combined studies showed that pacifier use in healthy breastfeeding infants.

### Cup feeding versus other forms of supplemental enteral feeding for newborn infants unable to fully breastfeed [^112Htpv9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Breast milk provides optimal nutrition for newborn infants, and the ideal way for infants to receive breast milk is through suckling at the breast. Unfortunately, this may not always be possible, as there are numerous reasons why a newborn infant may not be able to breastfeed and, as a result, require supplemental feeding. Currently, there are a variety of ways in which newborn infants can receive supplemental feeds. Traditionally, bottles and nasogastric tubes have been used; however, more recently, cup feeding has become a popular practice in many nurseries in an attempt to improve breastfeeding rates. There is no consistency to guide the choice of supplementation.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2006), CINAHL (1982 - April 2006), and MEDLINE (1966 - April 2006).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing cup feeding to other forms of enteral feeding for the supplementation of newborn infants.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Quality assessments and data extraction for included trials were conducted independently by the review authors. Outcomes reported from these studies were: weight gain, proportion not breastfeeding at hospital discharge, proportion not feeding at three months of age, and proportion not feeding at six months.

### Evaluation of the impact of breast milk expression in early postpartum period on breastfeeding duration: a prospective cohort study [^1146ibsg]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

The question of why women choose exclusive expressing as an alternative to directly feeding babies at the breast arises, especially when most mothers have good nipple conditions and are able to care for their healthy infants during maternity leave. According to our study, the most common reason for exclusive expressing was a baby's refusal to suck (88.5%), rather than flat or inverted nipples (23.1%). Women who bottle-fed their babies during hospitalization were more likely to continue expressing milk in the subsequent weeks. There is a causal relationship between a baby's refusal to suck at the breast and women's breastfeeding practices during hospitalization. Bottle-feeding may result in "nipple confusion" because it is a completely different feeding method, irrespective of attempts to resemble breastfeeding more closely.

Non-nutritive and nutritive sucking occur throughout a single breastfeeding process. Infants need to suck non-nutritively at the breast for several minutes until milk ejection reflex (MER) occurs because little milk is available before MER. With bottle-feeding, infants receive milk flow immediately when a teat is inserted into their mouths. In other words, bottle-feeding encourages a preference for the teat flow that provides the most milk with the least effort over the nipple flow. Consequently, if a baby becomes accustomed to sucking milk from a bottle initially, they may develop a reluctance to suck at the breast later. As a result, women may feel obliged to express breast milk to feed their infants.

A high prevalence of in-hospital formula supplementation (82%) leads to a high rate of bottle-feeding (90%) in our study.

### Infant factors that impact the ecology of human milk secretion and composition-a report from "Breastmilk Ecology: Genesis of Infant Nutrition (BEGIN)" Working Group 3 [^111PFihH]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Milk removal and species-specific mammary gland stimulation are exquisitely individualized within the breastfeeding dyad via bidirectional chemosensory signals that are exchanged between the lactating parent and the infant, and through the milk. The biology of these relationships from the perspective of the lactating parent was discussed in the article describing parental factors. The following sections focus on the implications of those relationships for the infant.

- **Infant exposures, breastfeeding modulation, and chemosensory communication**: At birth, the chemosensory ecology is composed of complex, two-way interplays involving infants and lactating parents preferentially responding to the sensory features of the other (see Text Box 4). Like amniotic fluid, human milk is a dynamic fluid with sensory properties that vary according to the health state and characteristics of the lactating parent.

- **Text Box 4 Summary - Two-way interaction**:
	- Effects of sensory features of the birthing parent and their milk on the infant:
		* Recognition of and preference for the sensory features of the birthing parent
		* Orientation and crawling toward the breast, nipple attachment, and initiation of feeding
		* Pattern of suckling, infant nutrition, and growth
		* Attachment and bonding
		* Modulation of brain response to fearful stimuli
		* Regulation of the behavioral state
		* Providing information on dietary choices by the birthing parent, including diet-transmitted flavors in the amniotic fluid.

### Electromyographic analysis of masseter muscle in newborns during suction in breast, bottle or cup feeding [^116vo7Jx]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2014). Low credibility.

Health policies worldwide have prioritized the promotion, protection, and support of breastfeeding as a key strategy for reducing child mortality and improving the quality of health in the population. One global policy is the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), originally announced in 1991–1992 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). It was revised in 2009 and has established the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. One of the benefits of breastfeeding is the promotion of craniofacial growth and development. Exclusive breastfeeding provides oral maturation by stimulating muscle tone and the harmonious development of the stomatognathic system.

- **Step 9 of the BFHI**: Newborns should not be fed with bottles/artificial teats mainly because they negatively interfere with breastfeeding demand and can lead to the failure of breastfeeding. Nevertheless, in the neonatal period, certain situations — such as maternal disease, emotional disturbances, or anatomical changes in the breast — can interfere with milk production and temporarily hinder exclusive breastfeeding. In such circumstances, alternative sources, such as a cup, should be recommended until exclusive breastfeeding can be restored.

Cup feeding as a transitional method prior to breastfeeding has several advantages, according to a revision by an expert group. These advantages include improving the likelihood of late preterm infants being exclusively breastfed after discharge without increasing their hospital stay. In a longitudinal study with full-term infants…

### Changes in sucking performance from nonnutritive sucking to nutritive sucking during breast- and bottle-feeding [^114J2Ct2]. Pediatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

Our aim was to obtain a better understanding of the differences between breast-feeding and bottle-feeding, particularly with regard to how sucking performance changes from nonnutritive sucking (NNS) to nutritive sucking (NS). Twenty-two normal term infants were studied while breast-feeding at 4 and 5 days postpartum. Five of the 22 infants were exclusively breast-fed, whereas the other 17 infants were tested both while breast-feeding and while bottle-feeding.

Before the milk ejection reflex (MER) occurs, little milk is available; as such, infants perform NNS before MER. For bottle-feeding, a one-way valve was affixed between the teat and the bottle so that the infants needed to perform NNS until milk flowed into the teat chamber. At the breast, the sucking pressure (-93.1 ± 28.3 mm Hg) was higher during NNS compared with NS (-77.3 ± 27.0 mm Hg). With a bottle, the sucking pressure was lower during NNS (-27.5 ± 11.2 mm Hg) compared with NS (-87.5 ± 28.5 mm Hg). Sucking frequency was higher, and sucking duration was shorter during NNS compared with that during NS both at the breast and with a bottle. There were significant differences in the changes of sucking pressure and duration from NNS to NS between breast- and bottle-feeding. The change in sucking pressure and duration from NNS to NS differed between breast-feeding and bottle-feeding. Even with a modified bottle and teats, bottle-feeding differs from breast-feeding.

### Prevalence and factors associated with cracked nipples in the first month postpartum [^115TzbNn]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

Two other postnatal variables were associated with cracked nipples: breast engorgement and use of a feeding bottle. The association between cracked nipples and breast engorgement has been previously reported. Breast engorgement changes the anatomy of the nipple region, hindering proper latch-on due to swelling, turgidity, little flexibility, and flat nipples. From a different standpoint, nipple trauma can also cause or worsen breast engorgement, as the pain experienced by the mother may interfere with the frequency and duration of feeds.

Use of a feeding bottle, in turn, may be associated with cracked nipples as a consequence of the different sucking techniques required for the bottle and the breast. When fed with a bottle, the child positions her tongue to control the flow of milk; use of the same movement on the breast may result in nipple trauma. This association has been demonstrated by Centouri et al. in Italy and by França et al. in Brazil. Notwithstanding, once again, the reverse causality in this relationship should not be disregarded: it is possible that the pain caused by nipple trauma has led the mothers to offer the bottle to their children.

Two variables related to delivery care were associated with the presence of cracked nipples: cesarean section and delivery at a hospital not accredited by the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative. The association between a cesarean section and cracked nipples has been confirmed in some studies and refuted in others. It is possible that the pain caused by the surgical incision may affect the positioning of the mother-child dyad.

### Non-nutritive sucking for promoting physiologic stability and nutrition in preterm infants [^114jYAtR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Non-nutritive sucking is used during gavage feeding and in the transition from gavage to breast/bottle feeding in preterm infants. The rationale for this intervention is that non-nutritive sucking facilitates the development of sucking behavior and improves digestion of enteral feedings. Non-nutritive sucking has been considered to be a benign intervention, although it has the potential to have a negative effect on breastfeeding or on the incidence of later oral aversion.

- **Objectives**: To determine whether non-nutritive sucking (NNS) in preterm infants influences: a) weight gain, b) energy intake, c) heart rate, d) oxygen saturation, e) length of hospital stay, f) intestinal transit time, g) age at full oral feeds, or h) any other clinically relevant outcomes.

- **Search strategy**: MEDLINE and CINAHL databases back to 1976 and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005) were searched. The EMBASE database was added to the search strategy for 2005. Reference lists and bibliographies of relevant articles and reviews were also searched. A comprehensive list of relevant articles was sent to two major authors in this area. They were asked if they knew of any other published or unpublished studies relevant to the area that had not been included in the original list.

- **Selection criteria**: All trials utilizing experimental or quasi-experimental designs in which non-nutritive sucking in preterm infants was compared to no provision of non-nutritive sucking. Measured clinically relevant outcomes. Reports were in English or another language.

### Raynaud's phenomenon of the nipple: A treatable cause of painful breastfeeding [^1137VPB7]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Maurice Raynaud first described the vasospasm of arterioles in 1862, and Raynaud's phenomenon is now considered common, affecting up to 20% of women of childbearing age. It has been reported to affect the nipples of breastfeeding mothers and is recognized by many lactation experts as a treatable cause of painful breastfeeding.

In 1997, Lawlor-Smith and Lawlor-Smith reported five women with Raynaud's phenomenon associated with breastfeeding, but there are few other case reports, and none report the possible relationship between Raynaud's phenomenon of the nipple and previous breast surgery. We report 12 women who breastfed 14 infants, all of whom were seen in one pediatric practice and one lactation consultation center in San Francisco, California, within the past three years. Of these 12 women, 11 were seen between June 2002 and May 2003.

All women suffered from extremely painful breastfeeding, with symptoms precipitated by cold temperatures and associated with blanching of the nipple followed by cyanosis and/or erythema. Poor positioning and poor attachment or latch may cause blanching of the nipple and pain during breastfeeding, but 10 of the 12 mothers were evaluated by experienced lactation consultants, who were certain that inappropriate breastfeeding techniques were not contributing factors.

Because the breast pain associated with Raynaud's phenomenon is so severe and throbbing, it is often mistaken for Candida albicans infection. It is not unusual for mothers who have Raynaud's phenomenon of the nipple to be treated inappropriately, often repeatedly, for C. albicans.

### Sleep SAAF: A responsive parenting intervention to prevent excessive weight gain and obesity among African American infants [^111gkkuw]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

- **Feeding**: Intervention staff taught mothers to recognize hunger cues (rooting, mouthing, bringing hand to mouth) and fullness cues (letting go of nipple, falling asleep, turning head away, interest in other things). Expectations for typical feeding frequency during the day and night for breastfed and formula-fed infants were discussed. Mothers were given education on age-appropriate bottle sizes, milk/formula volumes, use of slow-flow bottle nipples for infants under 4 months to prevent overfeeding or choking, and how to use fullness cues, rather than the amount of milk in the bottle, to determine when to terminate a feeding. Mothers were also advised that breast milk or formula is best for infants of this age, to delay the introduction of solid foods and other beverages until age 6 months, and to avoid adding infant cereal to a bottle.

- **Playing**: Lastly, we encouraged mothers to play with their baby every day and to do tummy time with their baby for at least a few minutes each day. We also reviewed strategies to promote mothers' well-being (e.g. sleeping when baby is sleeping, reaching out to friends and family for support).

- **Safety control**: Sleep SAAF's control group received a developmentally-appropriate child safety intervention. The home visits were designed to be equal in length and intensity to the responsive parenting intervention visits and to avoid messages that could impact responsive parenting. At 3 weeks, mothers received an extended version of the safe sleep strategies presentation from NICHD, which provided more detail about the Back to Sleep Campaign and SIDS.

### Prevalence and factors associated with cracked nipples in the first month postpartum [^1131wPH7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

To assess the prevalence and factors associated with the occurrence of cracked nipples in the first month postpartum.

- **Methods**: This was a cross-sectional study nested in a cohort of mothers living in Feira de Santana, state of Bahia, northeastern Brazil. Data from 1,243 mother-child dyads assessed both at the maternity ward and 30 days after delivery were analyzed. The association between cracked nipples as reported by mothers and their possible determinants was analyzed using Poisson regression in a model where the variables were hierarchically organized into four levels: distal (individual characteristics), distal intermediate (prenatal characteristics), proximal intermediate (delivery characteristics), and proximal (postnatal characteristics).

- **Results**: The prevalence of cracked nipples was 32% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 29.4–34.7) in the first 30 days postpartum. The following factors showed a significant association with the outcome: poor breastfeeding technique (prevalence ratio [PR] = 3.18, 95% CI 2.72–3.72); breast engorgement (PR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.46–1.99); birth in a maternity ward not accredited by the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (PR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.15–1.99); cesarean section (PR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.13–1.57); use of a feeding bottle (PR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.06–1.55); and higher maternal education level (PR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.04–1.47).

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of cracked nipples was high in our sample. Most of the factors associated with cracked nipples were related to postnatal characteristics, especially poor breastfeeding technique, which could…

### Perceptions and experiences of using a nipple shield among parents and staff - an ethnographic study in neonatal units [^115F6D7k]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Nipple shields were often used as a rescue remedy for mothers who might otherwise decide to discontinue breastfeeding if things did not progress. One mother mentioned that the nipple shield facilitated breastfeeding, enabling women and their babies to go home earlier. She felt a member of staff had "rescued" them by providing the nipple shield. A nurse shared her perspective:

- **Viewpoint of nursing staff**: If I'm not going to work for a week and I think that a mother would breastfeed exclusively by tomorrow if she gets a nipple shield, I feel that I must save them from a failed breastfeeding because I don't know what will happen if I'm not here. Someone might suggest a bottle. Then it is better if I give her a nipple shield, and with a nipple shield, you often get a revolutionary rapid result. If a mother is sitting there with an infant in week 33 who shows rooting but just sucks a few times, then it is easy to wean. She becomes hesitant to breastfeed because she doesn't get a response. It gives the mother the response she needs when the infant sucks. And then I can walk out of here without anxiety. If we were to take the nipple shields away, a lot of mothers would start bottle feeding instead.

Some mothers described that nipple shields were a step before bottle feeding: "It is perhaps the first step I would take before I would give the bottle". Another mother described the following scenario:

- **Absence of bottles**: There are cups to use for feeding, and there are nipple shields, but there are no bottles to be seen. Bottles are really forbidden. And really, there shouldn't be such a difference. I know that the babies should…

### Breastfeeding experience of postnatal mothers separated from preterm infants after discharge: A phenomenology qualitative approach [^113AREEW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Breastfeeding challenges emerged as a significant theme among postnatal mothers separated from their preterm infants after discharge. These challenges included perceived insufficient milk, bottle preference, and maternal-infant separation, all of which negatively influenced breastfeeding experiences according to the participants.

- **Perceived insufficient milk**: The major challenge for mothers of preterm infants was the belief that their milk was inadequate after their infants were discharged from the hospital. This often led to the use of formula as a supplement: "The baby had formula milk added when he was in the NICU; I still didn't produce enough milk after he was discharged so I have to supplement formula [participant 11]".

- **Nipple confusion/bottle preference**: One mother mentioned complications with bottle preference, where the infant refused to latch onto her nipple. She expressed her concern: "My baby was admitted to the NICU because of premature birth, so he had been bottle-fed. Now my baby was discharged from the hospital, and my breast milk is also sufficient, but I find that the baby always cries when hungry and does not open his mouth at all when he is full. How can I make my baby breastfeed [participant 7]?"

- **Maternal-infant separation**: This was identified as the most significant challenge. Mother-infant separation disrupts the establishment of normal lactation post-childbirth, resulting in serious implications for both the mother and infant. One participant shared, "When I wanted to breastfeed my baby, he was in the NICU and I couldn't make it [participant 7]".

### Human newborns prefer human milk: Conspecific milk odor is attractive without postnatal exposure [^113y6nru]. Child Development (2005). Low credibility.

Behavioral responses of 3- to 4-day-old newborns to the odors of various human milk (HM) and formula milk (FM) were examined in paired-choice tests. When both stimuli were unfamiliar, breast-fed and bottle-fed infants oriented their head and mouthed more vigorously to HM than to FM. When breast-fed infants were exposed to unfamiliar HM along with familiar FM, their head-turning responses were undifferentiated, although they mouthed more frequently to the human stimulus. When unfamiliar HM and familiar FM were equalized in intensity, unfamiliar HM again elicited more head orientation and mouthing responses. These results demonstrate that the odor of HM is more attractive to human newborns than FM and that this preference is independent of postnatal feeding experience.

### Avoidance of bottles during the establishment of breast feeds in preterm infants [^114RA8it]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Preterm infants typically begin milk feeds via gavage tube. As they mature, sucking feeds are gradually introduced. Women who choose to breastfeed their preterm infant may not always be available, necessitating an alternative approach to feeding. Most commonly, milk — either expressed breast milk or formula — is administered by bottle. There is some controversy regarding whether the use of bottles during the establishment of breastfeeding is detrimental to long-term breastfeeding success.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of avoiding bottle feeds during the establishment of breastfeeding on successful breastfeeding and to assess whether alternatives to bottle feeds are safe.

- **Search strategy**: Searches were conducted in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMBASE in any language. This search was updated in July 2008.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing the avoidance of bottles with the use of bottles in women who have chosen to breastfeed their preterm infant.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Whenever necessary, study authors were contacted for additional information. Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group were employed.

- **Main results**: Five trials involving 543 infants were included. Four trials utilized a cup feeding strategy, and one trial employed a tube feeding strategy when supplements to breastfeeds were needed. The single study on tube feeding had a high risk of bias. In the analysis of all five trials, considerable heterogeneity was observed.

### Early additional food and fluids for healthy breastfed full-term infants [^1122HbPZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Widespread recommendations from health organizations encourage exclusive breastfeeding for six months. However, the addition of other fluids or foods before six months is common in many countries and communities. This practice suggests perceived benefits of early supplementation or a lack of awareness of the possible risks.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of supplementation for full-term healthy breastfed infants and to examine the timing and type of supplementation.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (21 March 2014) and reference lists of all relevant retrieved papers.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials in infants under six months of age comparing exclusive breastfeeding versus breastfeeding with any additional food or fluids.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected the trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias.

- **Main results**: We included eight trials (984 randomized infants/mothers). Six trials (n = 613 analyzed) provided data on outcomes of interest to this review. The variation in outcome measures and time points made it difficult to pool results from trials. Data could only be combined in a meta-analysis for one secondary outcome (weight change). The trials that provided outcome data compared exclusively breastfed infants with breastfed infants who were allowed additional nutrients in the form of artificial milk, glucose, water, or solid foods.

### Mechanics of sucking: comparison between bottle feeding and breastfeeding [^115VGbLT]. BMC Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

There is very little evidence of the similarity of the mechanics of maternal and bottle feeding. We assessed the mechanics of sucking in exclusive breastfeeding, exclusive bottle feeding, and mixed feeding. The hypothesis established was that the physiological pattern for suckling movements differs depending on the type of feeding. According to this hypothesis, babies with breastfeeding have suckling movements at the breast that are different from the movements of suckling a teat of babies fed with a bottle. Children with mixed feeding exhibit both types of suckling movements.

- **Methods**: Cross-sectional study of infants aged 21–28 days with only maternal or bottle feeding (234 mother-infant pairs), and a randomized open cross-over field trial in newborns aged 21–28 days and babies aged 3–5 months with mixed feeding (125 mother-infant pairs). Primary outcome measures were sucks and pauses.

- **Results**: Infants aged 21–28 days exclusively bottle-fed showed fewer sucks and the same number of pauses, but of longer duration compared to breastfeeding. In mixed feeding, bottle feeding compared to breastfeeding showed the same number of sucks but fewer and shorter pauses, both at 21–28 days and at 3–5 months. The mean number of breastfeedings in a day (in the mixed feed group) was 5.83 ± 1.93 at 21–28 days and 4.42 ± 1.67 at 3–5 months. In the equivalence analysis of the mixed feed group, the 95% confidence interval for the bottle feeding/breastfeeding ratio lay outside the range of equivalence, indicating 5.9–8.7% fewer suction movements, fewer pauses, and shorter durations.

### WHO recommendations for care of the preterm or low-birth-weight infant [^113dezFS]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2022). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for preterm infants, particularly in the context of feeding, the WHO 2022 guidelines recommend against routine multicomponent fortification of human milk in preterm or low-birth-weight infants. However, they suggest considering this fortification for very preterm or very low-birth-weight infants who are fed with the mother's own milk or donor human milk.

### Clarifying nipple confusion [^1172HARv]. Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Nipple confusion, defined as an infant's difficulty with or preference for one feeding mechanism over another after exposure to artificial nipples, has been widely debated. This debate is partly due to conflicting statements: one by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2005 suggests that infants should be given a pacifier to protect against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and the other by the World Health Organization in 2009 states that breastfeeding infants should never be given artificial nipples. Despite the limited and inconsistent evidence, nipple confusion is widely believed by practitioners. Therefore, there is a unique opportunity to examine the evidence surrounding nipple confusion by assessing the research that supports or refutes the idea that bottle feeding or pacifier use impedes breastfeeding efficacy, success, or duration.

This review examined 14 articles that support and refute nipple confusion. These articles were reviewed using the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Rating Scale. Based on our review, we have found emerging evidence to suggest the presence of nipple confusion only as it relates to bottle usage, with very little evidence to support nipple confusion with regards to pacifier use. The primary difficulty in conclusively studying nipple confusion is establishing causality, namely determining whether the nipples of bottles or pacifiers are causing infants to refuse the breast, or whether they are simply markers of other maternal or infant characteristics. Future research should focus on prospectively examining the causality of nipple confusion.

### Novel feeding system to promote establishment of breastfeeds after preterm birth: a randomized controlled trial [^111cwkSd]. Journal of Perinatology (2016). High credibility.

The importance of human milk for preterm infants cannot be understated and includes less gastrointestinal disease, improved neurodevelopment, higher metabolic protection, as well as both protection from infection and development of the neonatal immune system. Further, the economic benefits of human milk are dose-dependent in both the term and preterm populations. Therefore, it is important to expedite full maternal milk production to not only improve infant health but also increase the chances of successful breastfeeding, thereby reaping the long-term benefits of human milk. However, preterm infants, owing to their developmental immaturity and other co-morbidities, often cannot feed at birth and have difficulty establishing breastfeeding. There is little available information on how best to establish breastfeeding in preterm infants.

Owing to preterm infants' sucking immaturity, the majority of them are fed, at least initially, via an oro- or nasogastric tube as it is imperative that good growth is achieved; this is linked to improved cognitive outcomes. Breastfeeding is introduced as soon as the infant is stable enough; however, in the absence of the mother, the mode of feeding becomes a clinical dilemma. In many units, bottle feeding is practiced to expedite the achievement of full oral feeds, which is often a requirement for discharge from the hospital. Bottles are not recommended during the establishment of breastfeeding due to increased flow rates and teat configurations, which increase the possibility of 'nipple confusion', where the infant refuses to feed from the breast.

### Infant-driven feeding systems: Do they "normalize" the feeding experience of infants with cleft palate [^111EzYW6]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2021). Low credibility.

To examine the feeding skills of infants with cleft palate with or without cleft lip (CP ± L), this study compared infant-driven feeding systems to healthy controls using standard bottles.

- **Design**: Cross-sectional cohort.

- **Setting**: Large pediatric academic medical center in the Midwestern United States.

- **Participants**: Infants with CP ± L (n = 15) using the Dr. Brown's Specialty Feeding System and typically developing infants without CP ± L (n = 15) using the Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Original or Options bottles.

- **Main outcome measures**: Bottle-feeding proficiency, duration, milk transfer, and signs of feeding difficulty.

Results showed that five-minute feeding proficiency differed significantly between groups, with the control group taking 44% of the feed compared to 15% for the CP ± L group on level 1 (P < .001) and 21% on level 2 (P < .001) nipples. The proportion of milk transfer was 96% ± 7% for controls and 75% ± 24% for the CP ± L group (P = 0.013). Feeding duration (minutes) differed between the control group (13 ± 3) and the CP ± L groups on each nipple level (level 1: 29 ± 16, P = 0.003; level 2: 32 ± 11, P = 0.001). The milk transfer rate (mL/min) was 9 ± 3 for control infants compared to 3 ± 1 for infants with CP ± L on level 1 (P < .001) and 5 ± 1 on level 2 (P = 0.007). Coughing occurred in 40% of infants with CP ± L and 27% of controls.

In conclusion, even when using specialty bottles, infants with CP ± L differ from non-cleft infants in feeding proficiency, duration, and overall intake.

### Consistency in infants' behavioural signalling of satiation during bottle-feeding [^112xry7G]. Pediatric Obesity (2015). Low credibility.

Understanding the dynamics of feeding is essential for preventing accelerated weight gain during infancy, a risk factor for obesity.

- **Objectives**: Because infants satiate on larger volumes of cow milk formula (CMF) than CMF enriched with the free amino acid glutamate (CMF+glu), we used this model system to determine whether infants displayed consistent behaviours despite satiating on lower volumes.

- **Methods**: In this laboratory-based, within-subject experimental study of ≤ 4-month-old infants (n = 41) and their mothers, infants were videotaped while feeding to satiation CMF on one test day and CMF+glu on the other, in counterbalanced order. Each video-recording was analysed frame-by-frame for frequency and timing of behaviours.

- **Results**: Infants' behaviours were consistent in types and frequency but were displayed sooner when feeding CMF+glu compared with CMF. The less responsive the mother's feeding style, the less consistent the infant displayed behaviours across the two formula meals (P = 0.05). Infants who spat up (a possible sign of overfeeding) consumed more formula (P = 0.01) and had less responsive mothers (P = 0.04) compared with the other infants.

- **Conclusions**: Infants are consistent in their behavioural displays during feeding at this developmental age. Regulation of intake and signalling of satiation during bottle-feeding are associated with formula composition and maternal feeding style.

### How UK internet websites portray breast milk expression and breast pumps: a qualitative study of content [^114Wg92o]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Some of the sites in our analysis seemed to conflate expressing with bottle feeding and advised against doing either until breastfeeding was established. This may relate to concerns about "nipple confusion" if bottles are used for feeding expressed breast milk, but this is not explicitly referred to, and evidence for a negative impact of bottles on feeding outcomes is limited. There is more robust evidence demonstrating a shorter duration of breastfeeding among breastfed infants who also receive formula milk by bottle, but the causal pathway is uncertain. The effects of any expressing on breastfeeding duration among healthy term infants have therefore not been established.

Several publications have identified women's concerns that their partner or other family members will not be able to bond with their infant if she is breastfeeding. In some cases, women suggest that choosing to breastfeed is selfish, and some may feel uncomfortable when they perceive their partner to be excluded. A partner's lack of opportunity to bond may be perceived as a threat to family well-being. To address this, many women introduce formula milk or express their breast milk. Interestingly, some of the commercial sites we reviewed use this as a reason to own or buy a breast pump. The persuasive arguments put forward in these sites, accompanied by imagery showing partners and family members holding and feeding the infant, could influence women's desires to share feeding. Qualitative research with fathers of breastfed infants reports their desire to experience feeding, with feeding being seen as a positive connection.

### Effect of added free water to enteral tube feeds in children receiving commercial blends [^1176MP6t]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). Low credibility.

To determine the impact of free water administration on clinical outcomes in medically complex patients, particularly focusing on the hypothesis that patients receiving more thin liquids have worse outcomes related to increased risk of gastroesophageal reflux, a retrospective chart review was conducted. This study focused on children who were initiated on commercial blenderized tube feedings from 2010 to 2019.

The percentage of gastrostomy intake that was a thin liquid was determined, with thin liquids including free water or thin formula based on the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) framework. Patients were categorized into those receiving low volumes of thin liquids ("percent thin" ≤ 20%) and those receiving higher volumes ("percent thin" > 20%). Emergency room visits, hospital admissions, and chest X-rays during the year following the initiation of the blend were compared.

Forty-five patients aged between 12 months and 18.7 years (with a median age of 3.7 years) were included in the study. Twenty patients (44%) were receiving a blend with an IDDSI-categorized thin consistency, while 25 patients (56%) were receiving a thicker blend. In addition to the blend, patients received a median of 320 mL of water per day (ranging from 0 to 1000 mL). Notably, patients receiving less than 20% thin liquids were less likely to undergo chest X-rays during follow-up than patients receiving larger amounts of thin liquids (10% in the minimal thin group versus 48% in the greater thin group, P = 0.03). In a multivariable logistic regression, this relationship remained significant after controlling for underlying pulmonary disease, aspiration, and method of feed administration.

### A ducted, biomimetic nipple replicates breastfeeding mechanics through ontogeny in an infant animal model [^117PfHNx]. Pediatric Research (2025). Low credibility.

Although there are known physiological and developmental benefits for breastfed infants, many infants must be bottle-fed for a variety of reasons. We hypothesize that some of these health disparities are caused by biomechanical differences in milk acquisition between breastfeeding and bottle feeding (suction versus expression) that are caused by fundamental structural differences between breast tissue (which has narrow ducts) and bottle nipples (which are hollow).

- **Methods**: To evaluate if a biomimetic, ducted bottle nipple elicits suckling physiology that is more similar to breastfeeding than conventional bottle feeding, we studied suckling in full-term infant pigs, a validated animal model for infant feeding. We raised one group on each nipple type and fed all pigs from both nipple types at the end of infancy. We recorded synchronous videofluoroscopy and intraoral suction and calculated the rate of milk consumption.

- **Results**: Infants raised on ducted nipples generated greater intraoral suction throughout most of infancy. In contrast, infants raised on cisternic nipples compressed the nipples more, swallowed larger boluses, and consumed milk at a faster rate.

- **Conclusions**: These differences mirror those reported between breastfeeding and bottle feeding, suggesting that a biomimetic nipple elicits mechanics that are similar to breastfeeding and can improve feeding outcomes.

- **Impact**: Milk acquisition from ducted, biomimetic bottle nipples mirrored the mechanics of breastfeeding by eliciting greater suction generation, reduced nipple compression, and a slower rate.

### Do infants fed from bottles lack self-regulation of milk intake compared with directly breastfed infants [^114zxiE5]. Pediatrics (2010). High credibility.

Breastfeeding's role in reducing the risk of childhood obesity is still unclear. One hypothesis suggests that it relates to breastfed infants' ability to self-regulate. This study investigated whether infants' self-regulation of milk intake is influenced by feeding mode (bottle versus breast) and the type of milk in the bottle (formula versus expressed breast milk).

Participants in the 2005–2007 Infant Feeding Practices Study II received monthly questionnaires during their infant's first year. Complete data were collected for 1,250 infants. The research tested the impact of feeding mode and type of milk during early infancy on self-regulation during late infancy.

Although only 27% of infants fed exclusively at the breast in early infancy emptied the bottle or cup in late infancy, 54% of infants who were fed both at the breast and by bottle did so. Furthermore, 68% of those who were fed only by bottle emptied the bottle or cup in late infancy. Multivariate regression analysis showed that infants who were bottle-fed more intensively early in life were approximately 71% or 2 times more likely to empty the bottle or cup later in life compared to those who were bottle-fed less intensively ([1/3]–[2/3] or [2/3] of milk feeds given by bottle versus less than [1/3] of milk feeds). When formula and expressed milk were considered separately, similar dose-response relationships were observed.

In conclusion, infants who are bottle-fed in early infancy are more likely to empty the bottle or cup in late infancy than those who are fed directly at the breast. Bottle-feeding, regardless of the type of milk, is distinct from direct breastfeeding.

### Early additional food and fluids for healthy breastfed full-term infants [^114w61ZW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

Health organizations recommend exclusive breastfeeding for six months. However, the addition of other fluids or foods before six months is common in many countries. Recently, research has suggested that introducing solid food at around four months of age while the baby continues to breastfeed is more protective against developing food allergies compared to exclusive breastfeeding for six months. Other studies have shown that the risks associated with non-exclusive breastfeeding are dependent on the type of additional food or fluid given. Given this background, we felt it was important to update the previous version of this review to incorporate the latest findings from studies examining exclusive compared to non-exclusive breastfeeding.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of additional food or fluid for full-term healthy breastfeeding infants and to examine the timing and type of additional food or fluid.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (1 March 2016) and reference lists of all relevant retrieved papers.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials in infants under six months of age comparing exclusive breastfeeding versus breastfeeding with any additional food or fluids.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. Two review authors assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

- **Main results**: We included 11 trials (2542 randomised infants).

### State-of-the-art review of blenderized diets-status and future directions [^116vpvLS]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

What factors influence the administration of blenderized tube feeds?

The unique viscosity and thickness of blenderized tube feeds (BTFs) are thought to relate to improved clinical symptoms but are also associated with administration challenges. BTFs have an increased risk for clogging events and incomplete delivery of prescribed feeds when administered using infusion pumps. Therefore, successful administration of BTFs requires attention to viscosity management, the size of delivery tubing, and whether the delivery method is by manual/gravity bolus or infusion by enteral feed infusion pump. A G-tube size that is at least 14 French (Fr) is recommended for BTFs to prevent clogging and ensure safe administration, although there are reports that smaller tube sizes have been used depending on the blend.

The viscosity and thickness of BTFs vary between and within different home-prepared blenderized tube feeds (HBTFs) and commercial blenderized tube feeds (CBTFs). BTFs with viscosity levels corresponding with moderately thick, according to the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI) Syringe Flow Test, are poorly delivered by routine enteral feed infusion pumps. The IDDSI Syringe Test is a bedside test that standardizes the description and categorization of fluids as "thin liquids", "slightly thick", "mildly thick", and "moderately thick". Moderately thick fluids may need dilution for ease of administration when using an enteral feeding pump. However, overthinning may result in a loss of the clinical benefits imparted by the thicker viscosity and should be done judiciously. Using O-ring syringes, large bore gravity bags, or reusable tube feeding systems may help in managing the administration challenges effectively.

### Exposure to the smell and taste of milk to accelerate feeding in preterm infants [^117EMZjJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). High credibility.

Preterm infants (born before 37 weeks' gestation) are often unable to coordinate sucking, swallowing, and breathing for oral feeding due to their immaturity. In such cases, initial nutrition is provided by orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding. Feeding intolerance is common and can delay attainment of full enteral and sucking feeds, prolonging the need for nutritional support and the hospital stay. Smell and taste play an important role in the activation of physiological pre-absorptive processes that contribute to food digestion and absorption. However, during tube feeding, milk bypasses the nasal and oral cavities, limiting exposure to the smell and taste of milk. Provision of the smell and taste of milk with tube feeds offers a non-invasive and low-cost intervention that, if effective in accelerating the transition to enteral feeds and subsequently to sucking feeds, would bring considerable advantages to infants, their families, and healthcare systems.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether exposure to the smell or taste (or both) of breastmilk or formula administered with tube feeds can accelerate the transition to full sucking feeds without adverse effects in preterm infants.

- **Search methods**: We conducted searches in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Epistemonikos to 26 April 2023. We also searched clinical trial databases and conference proceedings.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized and quasi-randomized studies that evaluated exposure versus no exposure to the smell or taste of milk (or both) immediately before or at the time of tube feeds.

### Prevalence and factors associated with cracked nipples in the first month postpartum [^113sqVtm]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

The prevalence of cracked nipples was 32% (398/1,243; 95% CI 29.4–34.7), but all mothers were still breastfeeding at the 30-day follow-up interview, even in the presence of the outcome. The participation rate was 97.4% (1,309/1,344). Another 66 cases were discarded due to missing information, resulting in a final sample of 1,243 dyads included in the analysis.

- **Factors associated with cracked nipples in the first month postpartum**: According to the analysis, at the first stage of the hierarchical model, maternal education and family income remained in the model. At the second stage, the type of prenatal care was associated with the outcome. At the third stage, the type of delivery and delivery at a Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative-accredited facility were noted. Breastfeeding technique, breast engorgement, and the use of a feeding bottle at 30 days were significant variables at the fourth stage of analysis. All these variables were included in the final model.

Except for family income and type of prenatal care, all variables selected remained associated with the outcome, even after adjustment for other variables. Therefore, following the completion of all analysis stages, the following variables were significantly associated with the presence of cracked nipples in the first month postpartum: higher maternal education level, cesarean section, birth at a Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative non-accredited facility, poor breastfeeding technique, breast engorgement, and use of a feeding bottle.

### State-of-the-art review of blenderized diets-status and future directions [^117TSS6n]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

- **Definition of a blenderized tube feed**: HBTFs consist of whole foods and purees typically mixed in a blender into a homogenous liquid with a fluid texture and consistency that can be administered through an enteral feeding tube as supplemental feeds or the sole source of nutrition. Some families use milk or a CMF as the base and then add blenderized table foods to create their HBTF. CBTFs are commercially manufactured from natural food ingredients and then packaged and labeled as a ready‐to‐use liquid formula. See Table 1 for examples of CBTFs and their composition.

- **Patient and care provider perspectives of blenderized tube feeds**: Patients and caregivers of those who receive BTFs compared to CMFs for home enteral nutrition report improved quality of life perceptions. Adult patients (n = 54) who participated in a cross‐sectional survey of patients on home enteral feeds stated that an interest in nutrition composed of more natural foods, a desire to consume similar meals as family members, a dislike of ingredients present in CMFs, and better GI tolerance compared to CMFs were among their primary reasons for implementing HBTFs. The lack of adequate information on how to use or prepare BTF was one of the main reasons for not using BTF as compared to CMF. Caregivers of children on home enteral nutrition favorably viewed BTFs because nutrition could be personalized based on family and cultural dietary preferences as well as avoiding allergens. Caregivers also felt more empowered and satisfied by the improved parent‐child relationship.

### Neonatal eating assessment tool-bottle-feeding: Norm-reference values for infants less than 7 months old [^112CjCWg]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The Neonatal Eating Assessment Tool (NeoEAT)-Bottle-feeding is a parent-report assessment of bottle-feeding behavior in infants less than 7 months old, with evidence of validity and reliability. The purpose of this study was to establish norm-reference values to guide score interpretation and clinical decision-making. Parents of 478 healthy, typically developing infants completed the NeoEAT-Bottle-feeding. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the following age groups: 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, and 6 to 7 months. NeoEAT-Bottle-feeding total scores decreased with increasing infant age. The Infant Regulation subscale contributed the most to the total score and remained high across the first 6 months of life, then decreased dramatically in the 6- to 7-month age group. The 90th and 95th percentile values for the total score and subscale scores can be used to identify infants with problematic feeding, guide referral, tailor treatment, and assess response to treatment.

### Caregiver influences on eating behaviors in young children: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114oUPLN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

The ability of caregivers to recognize and respond to children's cues of internal hunger or satiation may be influenced by early feeding modality, whether bottle versus breast. Many studies refute an association between breastfeeding and child obesity risk, which are beyond the scope of this review to discuss. However, some studies have shown that breastfeeding is associated with better child eating self-regulation, including better satiety responsiveness and a lower likelihood of emptying a bottle or cup compared to bottle feeding.

Contrary findings have also been shown. A small randomized study using weighted, opaque bottles that removed external cues to bottle fullness resulted in less formula intake and greater maternal responsiveness to infant feeding cues compared with a standard bottle. This effect was seen particularly in mothers who were less responsive to infant satiation cues, defined as highly pressuring. It is theorized that less responsive mothers may be more susceptible to feeding in response to cues other than hunger or satiation from infants, and thus benefit the most from early interventions. Additionally, in-home recorded sessions found that breastfed infants displayed more engagement and disengagement clues than formula-fed infants, perhaps making the hunger or satiation cues from infants fed at the breast easier to "read".

### Infant formula feeding practices and the role of advice and support: An exploratory qualitative study [^114HqrB4]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

This study provides insights into the use of formula and mothers' experiences of receiving advice and support for their formula feeding practices.

Feeding in response to cues of hunger and satiety has become an important focus in obesity prevention in infancy and childhood. Previous work in the United Kingdom, which involved developing a questionnaire on maternal attitudes towards infant growth and milk feeding practices, found that tin labels, growth, and appetite are potential factors used by parents to determine how much formula to offer. However, how external cues, such as advice on the tin or the amount of milk left in the bottle, influence parents' perception of an infant's appetite is unclear. The study found that for some parents, there is an interaction between interpreting their infant's cues and other factors, such as the time between feeds, the amount of milk in the bottle, or whether the infant finishes the bottle. This could potentially lead to the infant receiving more formula than they need. A recent laboratory-based study designed to test the impact of the bottle as a cue for mothers found that mothers with a pressure feeding style were more responsive to their infant's cues when feeding with a weighted opaque bottle compared to a conventional clear bottle. This suggests that some parents may use bottle fullness to inform their view of their child's satiety.

Few studies have assessed how much formula infants are consuming. Findings reveal that infants fed formula often consume more milk than breastfed infants and recommendations. For example, in a study of…

### Outpatient care of the premature infant [^112khDYv]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the follow-up and surveillance for preterm infants, particularly related to outpatient care, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend offering the mother's own breast milk (with multinutrient fortifiers as required for catch-up growth) as the preferred source of nutrition for preterm newborns and infants, followed by pasteurized donor milk and nutrient-enriched formula.

### Bloody nipple discharge in an infant and a proposed diagnostic approach [^116rBJvZ]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Bloody nipple discharge is a rare finding in infants and is most often associated with benign mammary duct ectasia. The rarity of this symptom in infants, combined with its association with breast carcinoma in adults, can lead to unnecessary investigation and treatment. Here, we describe a 4-month-old boy with bilateral bloody nipple discharge that resolved spontaneously without treatment by 6 months of age. Furthermore, we propose a strategic method for the evaluation of such infants.

### Experiences of young Australian mothers with infant feeding [^1175WKiX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Low credibility.

In this study, some young mothers who were bottle-feeding their infants, whether with expressed breast milk or formula, felt they were being judged for using a bottle. The WHO's definitions for exclusive and any breastfeeding specify the receiving of breast milk by the infant, which includes expressed breast milk. A review article reported that mothers who feed their infants with expressed breast milk are not acknowledged nor specifically supported by the customary channels for new mothers, such as infant feeding and government health organizations. Young mothers are an at-risk population for ceasing breastfeeding early and therefore require targeted support strategies to improve their adherence to infant feeding recommendations.

Some mothers reported feelings of disappointment when breastfeeding was not able to be maintained, with some feeling that they were judged for 'giving up' and using infant formula. The perceived judgment may stem from societal values, public health discourses, cultural norms, and ideals of 'good motherhood', which are often reinforced by hospital practices and public health campaigns. While it is essential to support mothers to make informed decisions about infant feeding, it is more important for health professionals to support these mothers in their decisions and reassure them that their value of being a 'mother' is not explicitly linked to their feeding method.

Support from professionals and peers was indicated by the young mothers in this study to positively influence infant feeding decisions and continuation of breastfeeding.

### Association of breastfeeding intensity and bottle-emptying behaviors at early infancy with infants' risk for excess weight at late infancy [^116FWuxr]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Our goal was to test the hypothesis that infants who were breastfed more intensively during early infancy (up to 6 months) have a different risk for excess weight later in infancy. We aimed to examine the independent impact of infant-initiated bottle emptying and mothers' encouragement of bottle emptying on infants' risk for excess weight.

The sample consisted of 1,896 mothers who participated in postpartum surveys of the Infant Feeding Practice Study II and who provided at least one weight measurement of their infants during the second half of infancy. We used multiple logistic regression models to assess the association between infants' risks for excess weight during the second half of infancy and three self-reported feeding practices during the first half of infancy, after adjusting for a series of sociodemographic characteristics. The early feeding practices examined included the percentage of all milk feedings in which infants consumed breast milk (breastfeeding intensity), the frequency of bottle feedings in which infants initiated bottle emptying, and the frequency of bottle feedings in which mothers encouraged bottle emptying.

Infants who were fed breast milk in less than 80% of their total milk feedings had a different risk profile for excess weight. Infants who often emptied bottles in early infancy were 69% more likely than those who rarely emptied bottles to have excess weight during late infancy.

### Avoidance of bottles during the establishment of breastfeeds in preterm infants [^1145B6wT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Preterm infants often begin milk feeds through gavage tubes. As they mature, sucking feeds are gradually introduced. Women with preterm infants may not always be in the hospital to breastfeed and need an alternative approach to feeding. Most commonly, milk (expressed breast milk or formula) is provided by bottle. Whether using bottles during the establishment of breastfeeding is detrimental to breastfeeding success is a topic of ongoing debate.

- **Objectives**: To identify the effects of the avoidance of bottle feeds during the establishment of breastfeeding on the likelihood of successful breastfeeding and to assess the safety of alternatives to bottle feeds.

- **Search methods**: A new search strategy was developed for this update. Searches were conducted without date or language limits in September 2021 in MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL. We also searched the ISRCTN trial registry and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs.

- **Selection criteria**: We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs comparing avoidance of bottles with the use of bottles for preterm infants where their mothers planned to breastfeed.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. When appropriate, we contacted study authors for additional information. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Outcomes included full breastfeeding and any breastfeeding upon discharge home and at three and six months after discharge, as well as the length of hospital stay and episodes of infant infection.
