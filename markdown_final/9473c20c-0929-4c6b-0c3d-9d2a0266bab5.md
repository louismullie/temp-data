## Question

Can you help me with the diagnostic

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for help with the diagnostic process. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical question and context. Then, I should verify the diagnostic framework and how to structure it. Next, I will examine pretest probability and test selection, followed by interpreting results and handling uncertainty. After that, I need to consider special populations and pitfalls, and finally integrate prognosis, safety-netting, and follow-up into a coherent plan with appropriate citations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical question and context, because without a clear target condition, population, and setting, I risk applying evidence incorrectly. I should specify the suspected diagnosis, the patient characteristics, the care setting, and the diagnostic goal, such as ruling in or ruling out disease, staging, or prognostication, since these factors drive test choice and interpretation [^823dfbac] [^f7c448f9].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic framework to ensure I'm not missing steps. A systematic approach includes defining the diagnostic question, estimating pretest probability, selecting tests based on sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios, interpreting results using Bayesian reasoning, and deciding on management or further testing, while continuously reassessing uncertainty and updating probabilities as new data arrive [^260aba93] [^aa53c8a5] [^823dfbac].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about test performance without anchoring on pretest probability. I need to check how prevalence and clinical features modify the meaning of a positive or negative result; a test with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity yields very different post-test probabilities at 10% versus 90% pretest probability, and this is precisely why pretest probability is foundational to interpretation [^260aba93] [^aa53c8a5].

> I will now examine test selection, and I should double-check that I'm choosing tests with the right operating characteristics for the clinical question. For ruling out serious disease, I want high sensitivity; for ruling in, I want high specificity; for undifferentiated presentations, I should prioritize tests that meaningfully shift probability and are likely to change management, keeping in mind that no test is perfect and that composite strategies often outperform single tests [^260aba93] [^f7c448f9].

> Wait, let me verify how to interpret results in practice. I should calculate post-test probability using likelihood ratios or a nomogram, and I must remember that sensitivity and specificity vary with case mix and disease severity, so I should be cautious about generalizing from one study to a different population; if a result conflicts with my clinical judgment, I should reconsider the pretest probability, the test characteristics in this context, and whether a repeat test or an alternate modality would help [^260aba93] [^aa53c8a5].

> I need to ensure I explicitly address diagnostic uncertainty, because failing to acknowledge it leads to errors and overtesting. Uncertainty is subjective, dynamic, and common, and I should communicate it transparently with patients, document my confidence level, and use safety-netting to mitigate harm; importantly, uncertainty does not preclude action when the pretest probability of a serious condition is high enough to warrant empiric treatment or urgent referral [^4452cf30] [^a938eeb2] [^60f92f56].

> Let me consider special populations and common pitfalls, and I should confirm that I'm not overgeneralizing. In older adults with multimorbidity, diagnostic reasoning is complicated by atypical presentations and competing explanations, so I should broaden the differential and avoid anchoring; in pediatrics, age-specific pretest probabilities and the natural history of conditions like BRUE guide judicious testing; in mental health conditions, diagnostic delay is common and emergency presentations are more frequent, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion for serious disease and proactively address barriers to care [^dd59fd56] [^ec3bd620] [^67fb987f].

> But wait, what if the presentation is symptom-based without a clear disease label. I should remember that many common symptoms lack a disease-based explanation after initial evaluation, and that prognosis often matters more than a specific diagnosis for management; in such cases, a prognostic, risk-stratified approach with watchful waiting, targeted testing, and clear return precautions can reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment while protecting patients from missed serious disease [^722cddcf] [^61ebad88].

> Next, I should review how to integrate prognosis into decision-making, because diagnosis alone may not determine outcomes. For example, in COPD, distinguishing COPD from asthma can be challenging yet crucial for prognosis and treatment response; in suspected VTE, pretest probability tools and D-dimer strategies hinge on the likelihood of disease and the consequences of delay; and in cancer, earlier diagnosis is generally beneficial, but the magnitude of benefit varies by cancer type and patient factors, so I should tailor urgency to the clinical context [^f9b1b6d5] [^b910e159] [^f28ac5a3].

> I should double-check my safety-netting plan, because this is where diagnostic errors often manifest. Safety-netting should be explicit, actionable, and documented, specifying red flags, timelines for reassessment, and how to obtain results and follow-up; I should also consider patient activation strategies to improve adherence and early detection of deterioration, especially in vulnerable populations [^60f92f56] [^30fd3f40].

> Let me reconsider the role of emerging tools and systems. While AI and machine learning show promise, I need to ensure I do not over-rely on associative models that lack causal reasoning; instead, I should treat these tools as augmentative, verify outputs against clinical judgment, and remain alert to explainability and bias issues, particularly when data are sparse or populations differ from training sets [^52b62925] [^4a3ecf4f].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan is iterative and feedback-enabled. Diagnosis is rarely a one-time event; documenting reasoning, confidence, and outcomes allows me to learn from discrepancies, refine my thresholds, and reduce repeat errors, aligning with modern quality improvement frameworks for diagnostic excellence [^347f77a1] [^0d6c4bb9].

The diagnostic process is a **stepwise, probabilistic approach** that begins with pretest probability and evolves with new data to refine the working diagnosis [^823dfbac]. Clinicians should **prioritize history and examination** because they provide most diagnostic information, and use tests to shift probability rather than replace clinical judgment [^722cddcf] [^260aba93]. Diagnostic uncertainty is common and should be **communicated clearly**, with safety-netting and follow-up to mitigate harm [^4452cf30] [^60f92f56]. Avoid premature closure, anchor bias, and overtesting by revisiting the differential, integrating new findings, and stopping when further testing won't change management [^57fdbbc0] [^aa53c8a5].

## Key steps in the diagnostic process

| **Step** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| 1. Problem definition | Clarify the chief complaint, onset, duration, and severity; establish the diagnostic question and pretest probability [^823dfbac] [^aa53c8a5]. |
| 2. History and physical examination | Gather detailed history and perform a focused exam; these provide 73–94% of diagnostic information [^722cddcf]. |
| 3. Hypothesis generation | Develop a prioritized differential diagnosis based on prevalence, clinical features, and severity [^14c534c0]. |
| 4. Test selection and interpretation | Choose tests with appropriate sensitivity/specificity; interpret results using likelihood ratios to update probability [^260aba93] [^aa53c8a5]. |
| 5. Diagnostic synthesis | Integrate data into a working diagnosis; remain open to revision as new information emerges [^a62ddcf0]. |
| 6. Communication and documentation | Clearly document reasoning, uncertainty, and the plan; communicate with the patient and team [^347f77a1]. |

---

## Common diagnostic pitfalls and how to avoid them

- **Premature closure**: Avoid anchoring on an early diagnosis; actively consider alternatives and revisit the differential as new data arrive [^14c534c0].
- **Anchoring bias**: Consciously reassess initial impressions when new findings contradict the working diagnosis [^notfound].
- **Availability bias**: Be wary of over-weighting recent or memorable cases; use prevalence and evidence to calibrate judgment [^notfound].
- **Overtesting**: Stop when further testing won't change management; apply threshold models and cost-benefit thinking [^57fdbbc0].

---

## Role of diagnostic uncertainty

Uncertainty is inherent and dynamic; clinicians should **acknowledge, communicate, and manage it** using safety-netting, follow-up, and shared decision-making [^4452cf30] [^60f92f56]. Communicating uncertainty can improve patient understanding and engagement, though it must be balanced with clarity and reassurance [^3728a7e9].

---

## Impact of diagnostic errors

Diagnostic errors are common and consequential, causing harm in about 1 in 3 cases; they often stem from **cognitive biases**, system failures, or communication breakdowns [^52b62925]. Reducing errors requires attention to both cognitive and system factors, including feedback, teamwork, and patient engagement [^9d7760ac].

---

## Emerging trends and technologies

- **Artificial intelligence**: AI and machine learning can augment diagnosis but require careful validation and integration into workflow [^52b62925] [^4a3ecf4f].
- **Genomic medicine**: Next-generation sequencing expands diagnostic yield in complex or unexplained presentations [^24694549].
- **Patient-centered diagnostics**: Emphasis on shared decision-making, patient preferences, and communication of uncertainty [^61ebad88] [^3728a7e9].

---

## Practical tips for clinicians

- **Start with the basics**: Never underestimate the power of a thorough history and physical examination [^722cddcf].
- **Use tests wisely**: Select tests that meaningfully shift probability and avoid low-yield testing [^aa53c8a5].
- **Embrace uncertainty**: Communicate clearly, safety-net appropriately, and follow up diligently [^60f92f56].
- **Learn from errors**: Engage in feedback, reflection, and continuous learning to improve diagnostic accuracy [^347f77a1].

---

The diagnostic process is iterative and probabilistic; clinicians should **integrate evidence, judgment, and patient values** while remaining vigilant for bias and uncertainty. By following a structured approach and communicating transparently, we can improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^e7f24845]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Summary

We propose that prognosis can now provide the framework in which clinicians and researchers organise evidence and information to support decisions about management. This extends calls for a risk-centred approach to many syndromes and chronic conditions and parallels proposals that public health should be organised around achievable outcomes rather than disease categories. Such a framework shifts the focus of clinical practice to improving outcomes for patients in their total biological, psychological, and social environment and away from an exclusive and narrow focus on underlying disease as the determinant of outcome.

Although biomedical diagnosis is often a crucial driver of treatment selection, especially in acute life-threatening illness such as infection and trauma, diagnostic labelling and subgrouping for many ill people is about providing prognostic information to support decisions about targeted individual long-term care. A broader prognostic framework could integrate such information with evidence about other pathophysiological, psychological, behavioural, and environmental factors that affect patient outcomes, to avoid overdiagnosis and support doctors and their patients in probability-based decision-making in clinical practice.

Prognosis is not a panacea for all the problems we have discussed in relation to diagnosis, and there must be continuing debate about the benefits, value, limits, harms, and costs of medicalization and medical care. However, because prognostic classification incorporates a much wider range of information than diagnosis and disease factors alone, and because such information is expanding rapidly in volume and availability, prognosis can provide a realistic, practical, and useful framework for clinical and public health practice.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^645f5f33]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The traditional model of clinical practice incorporates diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Diagnosis classifies the sick patient as having or not having a particular disease. Historically, diagnosis was regarded as the primary guide to treatment and prognosis ("what is likely to happen in the future"), and is still considered the core component of clinical practice.

This traditional model now has to meet the demand for health care to deliver demonstrable quality. Changes in clinical practice must be justified by better outcomes, as valued by patients, or more efficient and safer delivery of health care. The usefulness of diagnostic and treatment decisions, and the value of new tests and interventions, are judged by whether patients classified with diagnosed disease do better and those classified without disease come to no harm.

This requires information about patient prognosis – the likelihood of future outcomes in patients with a given disease or health condition. Prognosis research aims to understand the likelihood of different outcomes, which factors predict these likelihoods, how best to estimate an individual's likelihood of different outcomes, and how this information can be used to target interventions and improve outcomes.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^4bdaf436]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis is the traditional basis for decision-making in clinical practice. Evidence is often lacking about future benefits and harms of these decisions for patients diagnosed with and without disease. We propose that a model of clinical practice focused on patient prognosis and predicting the likelihood of future outcomes may be more useful.

Discussion

Disease diagnosis can provide crucial information for clinical decisions that influence outcome in serious acute illness. However, the central role of diagnosis in clinical practice is challenged by evidence that it does not always benefit patients and that factors other than disease are important in determining patient outcome. The concept of disease as a dichotomous 'yes' or 'no' is challenged by the frequent use of diagnostic indicators with continuous distributions, such as blood sugar, which are better understood as contributing information about the probability of a patient's future outcome. Moreover, many illnesses, such as chronic fatigue, cannot usefully be labelled from a disease-diagnosis perspective. In such cases, a prognostic model provides an alternative framework for clinical practice that extends beyond disease and diagnosis and incorporates a wide range of information to predict future patient outcomes and to guide decisions to improve them. Such information embraces non-disease factors and genetic and other biomarkers which influence outcome.

Summary

Patient prognosis can provide the framework for modern clinical practice to integrate information from the expanding biological, social, and clinical database for more effective and efficient care.

Prognosis provides a natural framework for modern clinical practice

Disease diagnosis is a crucial component of modern medicine but fails to provide a sufficient framework for a modern clinical practice which must incorporate variability in individual patient risk of different outcomes, influences on patient outcome which extend beyond disease, and avoidance of harm; prognosis provides such a framework. Clinicians often think in terms of prognosis, especially the primary care physician who may start by judging if the patient is going to get better or not. Decisions about individual patients in primary care are informed by available evidence about likely future outcomes, and a clinician's own judgement on likely outcome has prognostic value and helps to guide decision-making. Shared exploration and understanding between clinician and patient of which outcomes are wanted or needed, achieved through patients being able to voice their own priorities and goals for care and treatment in the consultation, supports a prognostic framework for the clinical encounter, particularly for the patient with long-term conditions and multimorbidity.

Example: Evidence that clinicians and patients can integrate disease-based explanation within a broader framework of prognosis is provided by back pain. Primary care practitioners undertake initial triage in a diagnostic framework to identify rare underlying conditions which have a poor immediate prognosis unless treated (e.g. cord compression from a tumour). Once these are excluded, the task diverts from diagnosis and considers the clinical problem as the risk of poor long-term outcomes (work loss, persistent pain). Activity limitation, psychological distress, and capacity to cope are used to classify people into prognostic categories that drive treatment decisions. The many at low risk of a poor outcome are managed without referral or investigation, whereas more intense care is targeted at those with poorer prognosis. This exemplifies the principle of 'stratified care'. Use of this prognostic approach to select back pain patients for different treatment programmes was effective and cost effective in a randomised controlled trial.

Such personalised medicine is likely to herald preferential expansion of prognostic modelling of individual risk for future health outcomes over new diagnostic tests of current disease status. However, research to inform and justify a prognostic model of clinical practice is crucial, including the important uncertainties about the application of this model represented by clinical, patient, and public understanding of risk and probability.

Example: Although a person with multiple diseases will benefit from optimal care for each separate condition by disease-based specialists, the multimorbidity state itself contributes to poor prognosis, for example a higher probability of unplanned hospitalisation, and outcomes are improved if there is additional integrated care from generalists. However, much multimorbidity concerns risk-based measures (blood sugar, kidney function, blood pressure), which are more usefully considered as continuous variables rather than disease states. In constructing prognostic models to support decision-making for people with multimorbidity, such biological measures can be integrated with subjective measures, such as mood state, pain severity, and mobility limitation, to create quantitative estimates of prognosis to inform care for people with multiple long-term conditions.

Traditional disease-based classification systems are being challenged by the quest for new ways to classify persons with multimorbidity and to incorporate new information about health, such as genomics, into such systems. This new information is undermining the idea that medicine only starts when there is a diagnostic label. Biomedical diagnoses have also traditionally encouraged isolated disease-based measures of outcome, such as normal blood glucose, to assess the success of health care. The acceptance that patient-focused measures, such as improved or maintained social participation, are realistic and desirable outcomes of health care for patients with long-term conditions is subverting the idea that good prognosis is only judged by disease cure.

### Diagnosis: making the best use of medical data [^aa53c8a5]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

To take the best possible care of patients, physicians must understand the basic principles of diagnostic test interpretation. Pretest probability is an important factor in interpreting test results. Some tests are useful for ruling in disease when positive or ruling out disease when negative, but not necessarily both. Many tests are of little value for diagnosing disease, and tests should be ordered only when the results are likely to lead to improved patient-oriented outcomes.

### Assessing diagnostic performance [^823dfbac]. NEJM Evidence (2024). Medium credibility.

Assessing Diagnostic PerformanceDiagnosis is an action and a goal in medicine. This article is the introduction to a series of review articles on varying facets of diagnosis. Clinical diagnosis is an exercise in classification; that is, placing the patient's condition in the correct diagnostic category. However, consideration must also be given to the performance objective, whether it is technical performance of a test, acquiring diagnostic information with respect to clinical management for an individual or a population's health outcomes, or cost-effectiveness and equity of care.

### The science of clinical practice: disease diagnosis or patient prognosis? Evidence about "what is likely to happen" should shape clinical practice [^e9f68865]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

It can be argued that diagnosis does incorporate variability under the concept of disease severity. The continuous distribution of blood pressure, for example, aligns with severity of the 'disease' (or unhealthy state). The diagnostic paradigm, however, focuses on classification and misclassification of 'hypertension'. The prognostic approach more naturally accommodates the idea of severity by relating increasing levels of blood pressure to contrasting outcomes.

A potential downside of the prognostic approach is whether clinical models in the real world can incorporate the continuous nature and variability of risk of future avoidable outcomes into decision making. Calculation of prognostic likelihoods and treatment responsiveness can combine all relevant information, but validation and translation of prognostic models into practice often relies still on categorisation (high-medium-low risk of a particular outcome) to drive stratified care. Evidence about the clinical usefulness of such new categorisations is essential – prognostic classification for its own sake should not replace diagnosis for its own sake. Nor should individual patient prognosis be a static classification in time – it needs to be updated with recent predictor values, or a profile of values over time, to reflect how clinical practice works in the real world by using new information and repeat consultations to modify treatment.

There are practical challenges to introducing an information-rich prognosis framework for a real-world clinical practice already struggling with volumes of guidelines, decision-aids, and protocols of care. Technological and statistical advances to make calculation and presentation of prognostic information more accessible and research into ways in which health care professionals and patients can better assimilate, use, and share prognostic information could help to meet these challenges.

How long does the diagnostic process take? (Diagnostic interval studies)

The diagnostic interval for an individual patient is the period between first presentation and diagnosis and is a measure of how long it takes for them to be correctly diagnosed. The 'total' interval, from symptom onset to diagnosis or treatment, can be further split into subcomponents, such as the patient interval and the primary care interval (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2

Reused from Weller et al. adapted from Olesen et al.

Considering diagnostic intervals at population-level allows identification of whether patients with the as-yet-undiagnosed condition are likely to experience diagnostic delay, and quantification of the distribution of any delays. Further, examining changes in average diagnostic intervals can support the evaluation of diagnosis improvement initiatives - such as the introduction of clinical guidelines - and can help to compare performance between and across healthcare systems. However, diagnostic intervals should be triangulated with other measures of diagnostic delay to understand whether comorbidities may be artefactually prolonging interval length.

The main limitation of both diagnostic pathway and diagnostic interval studies is that, generally, pathways or intervals alone are not sufficient to determine if anything could have been done differently to ensure a specific patient was diagnosed sooner. However, by examining variation with other factors, they can provide an understanding of which patients are at the highest risk of experiencing diagnostic delay and where in the healthcare system delay is most likely to occur. Depending on the disease and healthcare context, these studies may require linkage of multiple datasets to track patient pathways, determine pathway optimality, or measure intervals.

### An error of self-diagnosis – but what was the real diagnosis? [^66186400]. Practical Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The availability of information on the internet encourages people to explore their own diagnosis. Although more knowledge is usually a good thing, self-diagnosis in this way may not always be correct, and it can even adversely influence the medical diagnosis, as in this patient, where the underlying disorder is still uncertain. The patient illustrates the confusion and difficulty in categorising an usual clinical syndrome.

### How to use an article about a diagnostic test [^15ba9bd2]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Urologists frequently confront diagnostic dilemmas, prompting them to select, perform and interpret additional diagnostic tests. Before applying a given diagnostic test the user should ascertain that the chosen test would indeed help decide whether the patient has a particular target condition. In this article in the Users' Guide to the Urological Literature series we illustrate the guiding principles of how to critically appraise a diagnostic test, interpret its results and apply its findings to the care of an individual patient.

Materials and Methods

The guiding principles of how to evaluate a diagnostic test are introduced in the setting of a clinical scenario. We propose a stepwise approach that addresses the question of whether the study results are likely to be valid, what the results are and whether these results would help urologists with the treatment of their individual patients.

Results

Some of the issues urologists should consider when assessing the validity of a diagnostic test study are how the authors assembled the study population, whether they used blinding to minimize bias and whether they used an appropriate reference standard in all patients to determine the presence or absence of the target disorder. Urologists should next evaluate the properties of the diagnostic test that indicate the direction and magnitude of change in the probability of disease for a particular test result. Finally, urologists should ask a series of questions to understand how the diagnostic test may impact the care of their patients.

Conclusions

Application of the guides presented in this article will allow urologists to critically appraise studies of diagnostic tests. Determining the study validity, understanding the study results and assessing the applicability to patient care are 3 fundamental steps toward an evidence-based approach to choosing and interpreting diagnostic tests.

### Solving the diagnostic challenge: a patient-centered approach [^df1cd6b6]. Annals of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Arriving at an agreed-on and valid explanation for a clinical problem is important to patients as well as to clinicians. Current theories of how clinicians arrive at diagnoses, such as the threshold approach and the hypothetico-deductive model, do not accurately describe the diagnostic process in general practice. The problem space in general practice is so large and the prior probability of each disease being present is so small that it is not realistic to limit the diagnostic process to testing specific diagnoses on the clinician's list of possibilities. Here, new evidence is discussed about how patients and clinicians collaborate in specific ways, in particular, via a process that can be termed inductive foraging, which may lead to information that triggers a diagnostic routine. Navigating the diagnostic challenge and using patient-centered consulting are not separate tasks but rather synergistic.

### Uncertainty-aware large language models for explainable disease diagnosis [^4eade48e]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Definition formulation

Evidence-based diagnosis refers to a diagnosis made by adhering to established diagnostic criteria, utilizing a patient's clinical information as the basis for decision-making. A confident diagnosis builds on an evidence-based diagnosis, signifying a high degree of certainty in the diagnostic decision. Diagnostic uncertainty arises when diagnostic criteria are unmet due to insufficient evidence, such as the absence of definitive symptoms, ambiguous clinical signs, or inconclusive laboratory findings. Uncertainty-aware disease diagnosis involves developing predictive models that leverage clinical information to determine both the most likely diagnosis and the occurrence of diagnostic uncertainty, distinguishing between confident diagnoses (supported by sufficient evidence) and those characterized by insufficient evidence, while providing detailed explanations.

### Diagnostic reasoning in challenging cases [^14c534c0]. Practical Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic reasoning relies on cognitive heuristics to recognise patterns of symptoms and signs in order to arrive at a diagnosis. These rules of thumb allow us to rapidly diagnose common conditions that present in typical ways. However, they may lead us astray when common conditions present atypically or when a patient has a rare condition or multiple conditions causing their constellation of symptoms, signs, and test results, rather than having a single diagnosis to explain them all. This article describes strategies to help counteract diagnostic pitfalls, to expand diagnostic possibilities and to make diagnostic progress with complex, multielement cases.

### Defining and measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medicine: a systematic review [^4452cf30]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

Diagnostic uncertainty, while prevalent, has not been comprehensively evaluated in current literature and medical practice. Although various methods have been used to study diagnostic uncertainty in clinical practice, evidence is limited as to which of these is the most useful or relevant, and no comprehensive measurement framework exists. On the basis of this review, we propose that diagnostic uncertainty be defined as " subjective perception of an inability to provide an accurate explanation of the patient's health problem." As next steps, we need to adopt a uniform definition of diagnostic uncertainty and work toward methodological advances in measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medical practice. The scientific foundation created in this review can inform future interventions aimed at improving the management of diagnostic uncertainty, thereby helping to reduce both under-diagnosis and overuse of health care resources.

### Defining and measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medicine: a systematic review [^a938eeb2]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our review suggests that diagnostic uncertainty has yet to be clearly defined in the literature and lacks a robust measurement framework. This has impeded the design and development of validated instruments for measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medical practice. Based on our findings, we propose that diagnostic uncertainty be defined as a " subjective perception of an inability to provide an accurate explanation of the patient's health problem." The proposed definition aligns well with salient attributes discussed above and the recent National Academies for Science, Engineering and Medicine report on improving diagnosis, and can facilitate future efforts for identification and measurement of diagnostic uncertainty in medical practice.

Operationalizing the Definition of Diagnostic Uncertainty

Several clinical and contextual factors need to be considered to operationalize our proposed definition for measurement. For instance, in the patient–clinician encounter, uncertainty experienced by a specific clinician regarding a patient's health problem is dynamic and should be measured at a particular point in time (e.g. at the end of an encounter). Additionally, the clinician does not need to be absolutely certain about the diagnosis to initiate definitive treatment, but rather needs to reduce the level of diagnostic uncertainty below a certain threshold (Figure in Supplemental File) to narrow options to certain types of conditions.–Thus, measurement should account for situations when the clinician is able to initiate definitive therapeutic care using a broader diagnosis, e.g. initiating symptomatic treatment for an upper respiratory infection of viral etiology in lieu of finding the more specific but clinically irrelevant information about the viral strain causing the infection. Further research will be needed to operationalize this proposed definition and to advance our understanding of diagnostic decision-making during uncertainty. This will expand our understanding of sources of diagnostic uncertainty and help inform robust conceptual frameworks to advance the "basic science" in this area.

### What's in a label? Is diagnosis the start or the end of clinical reasoning? [^a62ddcf0]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic reasoning has received substantial attention in the literature, yet what we mean by "diagnosis" may vary. Diagnosis can align with assignment of a "label", where a constellation of signs, symptoms, and test results is unified into a solution at a single point in time. This "diagnostic labeling" conceptualization is embodied in our case-based learning curricula, published case reports, and research studies, all of which treat diagnostic accuracy as the primary outcome. However, this conceptualization may oversimplify the richly iterative and evolutionary nature of clinical reasoning in many settings. Diagnosis can also represent a process of guiding one's thoughts by "making meaning" from data that are intrinsically dynamic, experienced idiosyncratically, negotiated among team members, and rich with opportunities for exploration. Thus, there are two complementary constructions of diagnosis: 1) the correct solution resulting from a diagnostic reasoning process, and 2) a dynamic aid to an ongoing clinical reasoning process. This article discusses the importance of recognizing these two conceptualizations of "diagnosis", outlines the unintended consequences of emphasizing diagnostic labeling as the primary goal of clinical reasoning, and suggests how framing diagnosis as an ongoing process of meaning-making might change how we think about teaching and assessing clinical reasoning.

### Diagnostic uncertainty in primary care: what is known about its communication, and what are the associated ethical issues? [^a01a7d93]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Clinicians working in primary care experience diagnostic uncertainty routinely. This review has highlighted significant gaps in the existing literature: there is a need for explicit ethical and patient-centred empirical analyses on the effects of communicating diagnostic uncertainty on patient experience and diagnostic testing. Consensus on how diagnostic uncertainty should be defined, and greater research into tools for its measurement, would help to strengthen the existing empirical evidence base. More work is needed in particular to gain insights into patients' perspectives of diagnostic uncertainty; this will help identify which communication and investigation approaches are desired and beneficial to patients.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: under-, over-and misdiagnosis [^383ad52c]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FM) is an enigma. During the past three decades, with the gradual acceptance of the validity of FM, it is variously under-, over and misdiagnosed. Evidence-based interdisciplinary guidelines have suggested a comprehensive clinical assessment to avoid this diagnostic conundrum. Every patient with chronic pain should be screened for chronic widespread pain (pain in four of five body regions) (CWP). Those with CWP should be screened for presence of additional major symptoms of FM: unrefreshed sleep and fatigue. A complete medical (including drug) history and complete physical examination is mandatory in the evaluation of a patient with CWP in order to consolidate the diagnosis of FM or identify features that may point to some other condition that may have a presentation similar to FM. Limited simple laboratory testing is recommended to screen for possible other diseases. The 2016 criteria may be used to further confirm the clinical diagnosis of FM. In consideration of the differential diagnosis of FM, attention should be paid to the presence of other chronic overlapping pain conditions and of mental disorders. FM as a stand alone diagnosis is however rare, as most patients with FM meet criteria for other chronic overlapping pain conditions or mental disorders. The severity of FM should be assessed in order to direct treatment approaches and help inform the likely outcome for an individual patient.

How does the diagnostic process begin? (Prodromal feature studies)

Prodromal features are characteristics that are observed in the as-yet-undiagnosed population at a greater rate than in controls who remain disease-free. Many studies consider prodromal symptoms, but there are other possible prodromal features such as abnormal test results. Analyses of large samples of electronic health records have enabled formal identification and quantification of these early signs and symptoms in recent years, alongside their positive predictive values for cancer.

The main strength of prodromal feature studies is that known prodromal features can be used to guide the diagnostic process, for example in helping to decide whether specialist investigations or referrals are needed. There are several examples of studies estimating the predictive value of symptoms and tests supporting clinical practice guidelines.

A limitation of these studies is the variability in the length of the period during which features associated with the diagnosis are observed. Some of this variation may be appropriate as different features are likely to be predictive over different periods of time, however much literature in the field of cancer early diagnosis research uses 1- or 2-year periods a priori without justification. Formal evidence from diagnostic window studies can be useful in determining risk periods of appropriate length for studies of early signs and symptoms, particularly for conditions characterised by vague or non-specific symptoms. A new approach uses time-to-event analysis to explore how the association of a feature with diagnosis of a condition changes over time.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^b910e159]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Interpretation of strong and conditional recommendations — For patients, a strong recommendation means "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not," whereas a conditional recommendation means "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not" and "Decision aids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent with their individual risk, values, and preferences." For clinicians, strong implies "Most individuals should receive the intervention. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences," while conditional notes "Different choices will be appropriate for individual patients, and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their values and preferences." For policy makers, strong means "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator," whereas conditional states "Policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders. Performance measures should assess if decision-making is appropriate." For researchers, strong indicates "The recommendation is supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation. On occasion, a strong recommendation is based on low or very low certainty in the evidence. In such instances, further research may provide important information that alters the recommendation," while conditional notes "The recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research. An evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determined the conditional rather than strong recommendation will help identify possible research gaps."

### Classification and diagnosis of patients with medically unexplained symptoms [^82fb0e45]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) have little or no demonstrable disease explanation for the symptoms, and comorbid psychiatric disorders are frequent. Although common, costly, distressed, and often receiving ill-advised testing and treatments, most MUS patients go unrecognized, which precludes effective treatment. To enhance recognition, we present an emerging perspective that envisions a unitary classification for the entire spectrum of MUS where this diagnosis comprises severity, duration, and comorbidity. We then present a specific approach for making the diagnosis at each level of severity. Although our disease-based diagnosis system dictates excluding organic disease to diagnose MUS, much exclusion can occur clinically without recourse to laboratory or consultative evaluation because the majority of patients are mild. Only the less common, "difficult" patients with moderate and severe MUS require investigation to exclude organic diseases. By explicitly diagnosing and labeling all severity levels of MUS, we propose that this diagnostic approach cannot only facilitate effective treatment but also reduce the cost and morbidity from unnecessary interventions.

### Differential diagnosis of glomerular disease: a systematic and inclusive approach [^61c92d83]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Glomerular disease is a complex and evolving topic. In evaluating a specific case it is not unusual for the clinician to ask: 'Am I missing something? Should I biopsy? When? Should I treat first, then biopsy?' This work, which is both evidence and experience based, is intended to address each of these concerns and many other issues relevant to the differential diagnosis of glomerular disease.

Summary

The central approach is the use of diagnostic algorithms that are based on quantitative measures routinely obtained early in the course of the diagnostic evaluation. The algorithms are designed to be easy to navigate, systematic, and inclusive. Also provided is a detailed and prioritized list of recommended diagnostic testing, and the rationale for each test.

Key Message

This work is intended to facilitate accurate diagnosis in the individual patient presenting with evidence of glomerular disease.

### Emerging approaches to multiple chronic condition assessment [^0fb1d13f]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). Medium credibility.

Unlike comorbidity measures such as the Charlson index, the MMI is not based on a pre‐determined subset of conditions that are the most significant predictors of mortality. Instead, it considers all diagnoses of the patient, including repeated, similar, and related diagnoses; within these diagnoses it empirically finds the most serious diagnoses. For some patients, if the less severe diagnosis is the only diagnosis, then it is scored and the LR may reduce the probability of mortality. For other patients, less severe diagnoses are ignored when a more serious diagnosis in the same body system exists. The more serious diagnosis has a higher LR and it increases the probability of mortality.

The MMI relies on thousands of diseases within all body systems, and therefore is based on a comprehensive set of diagnoses. The scoring includes rare diseases, which are often ignored by other measures. Rare diseases, however, can radically change the patient's prognosis. In hospitals, patients with one rare disease are 1.80 times and those with two or more rare diseases are 2.78 times more likely to die compared with patients who do not have a rare disease. Rare diseases are almost never part of statistical prognostic indices. One does not need to look at extremely rare diseases. For example, coma is a relatively uncommon condition, that can be fatal. Yet, because coma is uncommon, it is missing in almost all prognostic indices. "Although rare diseases are individually rare by definition, they are collectively common."When thousands of infrequent, but serious, conditions are missing from a prognostic index, the effect may be substantial. MMI can improve accuracy of predictions by including rare but serious diseases in its calculations.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^fee81fee]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID compendium — introduction and scope defines Long COVID as an infection-associated chronic condition (IACC) that occurs after SARS-CoV-2 infection and is present for at least 3 months affecting one or more organ systems, notes that symptoms often do not occur in isolation, and is primarily intended for first-line assessment and management by physiatrists, primary care physicians, and other clinicians. It emphasizes that Long COVID may manifest as a constellation of symptoms without abnormalities on standard diagnostic tests and that when clinical suspicion for other conditions is high, appropriate investigation and management should be pursued. The compendium builds on a series of eight Long COVID consensus guidance statements, incorporates updates from recent evidence, includes sections on health equity, disability considerations, and emerging evidence, and states that fully evidence-based clinical guidelines are yet to be developed; recommendations should guide but not dictate clinical decisions and need to be adjusted based on each patient's specific situation.

American Thoracic Society dyspnea — executive summary epidemiology and prognosis reports that dyspnea is common in both inpatient and ambulatory settings, is strongly prognostic, and that addressing the underlying cause is the preferred management approach. Dyspnea "affects up to 50% of patients admitted to acute, tertiary care hospitals and a quarter of patients seeking care in ambulatory settings," and "The presence of dyspnea is a potent predictor of mortality, often surpassing common physiological measurements in predicting the clinical course of a patient." The statement adds, "Diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of dyspnea is the preferred and most direct approach to ameliorating this symptom, but there are many patients for whom the cause is unclear or for whom dyspnea persists despite optimal treatment."

### Defining disease: determining practice [^06bb2a6b]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2001). Low credibility.

Management of patients traditionally starts with establishing a diagnosis, a process that relies heavily on how diseases are defined. But definitions of disease vary with time and are influenced by, amongst other things, culture, politics, sociology and economics. The ninth annual Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin symposium, 'Defining disease: determining practice', explored the ways disease is defined and how this might affect practice. Here, we summarise the key points raised in the presentations and subsequent discussion.

### Comorbid chronic diseases and cancer diagnosis: disease-specific effects and underlying mechanisms [^ac7d3bc1]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

An earlier diagnosis is a key strategy for improving the outcomes of patients with cancer. However, achieving this goal can be challenging, particularly for the growing number of people with one or more chronic conditions (comorbidity/multimorbidity) at the time of diagnosis. Pre-existing chronic diseases might affect patient participation in cancer screening, help-seeking for new and/or changing symptoms and clinicians' decision-making on the use of diagnostic investigations. Evidence suggests, for example, that pre-existing pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurological and psychiatric conditions are all associated with a more advanced stage of cancer at diagnosis. By contrast, hypertension and certain gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal conditions might be associated with a more timely diagnosis. In this Review, we propose a comprehensive framework that encompasses the effects of disease-specific, patient-related and health-care-related factors on the diagnosis of cancer in individuals with pre-existing chronic illnesses. Several previously postulated aetiological mechanisms (including alternative explanations, competing demands and surveillance effects) are integrated with newly identified mechanisms, such as false reassurances, or patient concerns about appearing to be a hypochondriac. By considering specific effects of chronic diseases on diagnostic processes and outcomes, tailored early diagnosis initiatives can be developed to improve the outcomes of the large proportion of patients with cancer who have pre-existing chronic conditions.

### Improving the accuracy of medical diagnosis with causal machine learning [^52b62925]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Providing accurate and accessible diagnoses is a fundamental challenge for global healthcare systems. In the US alone an estimated 5% of outpatients receive the wrong diagnosis every year. These errors are particularly common when diagnosing patients with serious medical conditions, with an estimated 20% of these patients being misdiagnosed at the level of primary careand one in three of these misdiagnoses resulting in serious patient harm.

In recent years, artificial intelligence and machine learning have emerged as powerful tools for solving complex problems in diverse domains –. In particular, machine learning assisted diagnosis promises to revolutionise healthcare by leveraging abundant patient data to provide precise and personalised diagnoses –. Despite significant research efforts and renewed commercial interest, diagnostic algorithms have struggled to achieve the accuracy of doctors in differential diagnosis –, where there are multiple possible causes of a patients symptoms.

This raises the question, why do existing approaches struggle with differential diagnosis? All existing diagnostic algorithms, including Bayesian model-based and Deep Learning approaches, rely on associative inference — they identify diseases based on how correlated they are with a patients symptoms and medical history. This is in contrast to how doctors perform diagnosis, selecting the diseases which offer the best causal explanations for the patients symptoms. As noted by Pearl, associative inference is the simplest in a hierarchy of possible inference schemes –. Counterfactual inference sits at the top of this hierarchy, and allows one to ascribe causal explanations to data. Here, we argue that diagnosis is fundamentally a counterfactual inference task. We show that failure to disentangle correlation from causation places strong constraints on the accuracy of associative diagnostic algorithms, sometimes resulting in sub-optimal or dangerous diagnoses. To resolve this, we present a causal definition of diagnosis that is closer to the decision making of clinicians, and derive counterfactual diagnostic algorithms to validate this approach.

### Improving diagnostic performance through feedback: the diagnosis learning cycle [^347f77a1]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

As is shown in the Diagnostic Process Capture, certain parts of the diagnostic process are already documented: including collecting data on patient symptoms and documenting a diagnosis in the EHR. What is currently missing is the information artefact that is an external representation of professionals' clinical reasoning processes and their confidence in the decisions made. These two are much more abstract — and likely variable among providers — than documenting symptoms or diagnoses, but just because they are abstract does not mean they cannot be represented externally. Our model proposes representing clinical reasoning and confidence externally in the form of an information artefact so they may be documented in a system, similar to the way symptoms and diagnoses now are. By doing this, clinicians will have a more clear, comprehensive picture of the information and reasoning that went into a diagnosis, thus allowing them to learn from the process by using accurate information, rather than relying on recall alone.

In order to be meaningful, the representations in the Diagnostic Process Capture must have key attributes, including fidelity (how well they represent the context, decision and outcome); persistence (how durable the representations are over time); and specificity (to what degree the outcome is determined by the decision). This Diagnostic Process Capture cycle continues to iterate until some condition is met (number of cases, end of an activity, etc) and then feeds into the Diagnosis Learning Cycle, as illustrated above. Thus, an individual or team could choose to access the repository to compare diagnostic hypotheses and processes, confidence and outcomes after a period of time or accumulation of cases; this likely will be a period of clinical service, a given number of shifts or a period of time (eg, monthly).

### Diagnostic methods I: sensitivity, specificity, and other measures of accuracy [^260aba93]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

For most physicians, use of diagnostic tests is part of daily routine. This paper focuses on their usefulness by explaining the different measures of accuracy, the interpretation of test results, and the implementation of a diagnostic strategy. Measures of accuracy include sensitivity and specificity. Although these measures are often considered fixed properties of a diagnostic test, in reality they are subject to multiple sources of variation such as the population case mix and the severity of the disease under study. Furthermore, when evaluating a new diagnostic test, it must be compared to a reference standard, although the latter is usually not perfect. In daily practice diagnostic tests are not used in isolation. Several issues will influence the interpretation of their results. First, clinicians have a prior assumption about the patient's chances of having the disease under investigation, based on the patient's characteristics, symptoms, and the disease prevalence in similar populations. Second, diagnostic tests are usually part of a diagnostic strategy. Therefore, it is not sufficient to determine the accuracy of a single test; one also needs to determine its additional value to the patient's diagnosis, treatment, or outcome as part of a diagnostic strategy.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^8172686c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale

It is essential to understand the accuracy of diagnostic tests including signs and symptoms to identify the best way they can be used in different settings to develop effective diagnostic and management pathways. We are producing a suite of Cochrane 'living systematic reviews', which will summarise evidence on the clinical accuracy of different tests and diagnostic features, grouped according to present research questions and settings, in the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease. Summary estimates of accuracy from these reviews will help inform diagnostic, screening, isolation, and patient management decisions.

New tests are being developed and evidence is emerging at an unprecedented rate during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We will aim to update these reviews as often as is feasible to ensure that they provide the most up‐to‐date evidence about test accuracy.

These reviews are being produced rapidly to assist in providing a central resource of evidence to assist in the COVID‐19 pandemic, summarising available evidence on the accuracy of the tests and presenting characteristics.

### A taxonomy of early diagnosis research to guide study design and funding prioritisation [^d5f2d9e4]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

The study families we have described focus on earlier diagnosis as a process measure (achieving diagnosis earlier in time), rather than as a patient/disease outcome (achieving diagnosis at an earlier disease stage). Whilst shorter intervals in the diagnostic process are associated with improved patient outcomes in general, Tørring et al. have illustrated that this association varies between patient groups. For cancer, staging classifications are well-developed, but for other conditions disease stage or severity may not be well-defined. Furthermore, we have not considered research concerning overdiagnosis. At present, defining and quantifying overdiagnosis is challenging and generally only possible for patient groups as opposed to individual patients. Nevertheless, consideration of potential overdiagnosis is required when carrying out any of the research we have described.

In developing the taxonomy, we have focused on research using electronic health records. Other possible research methods – such as surveys or qualitative research have not been considered in detail. There may be some overlap in the purposes of the families we describe; for example, both diagnostic windows and intervals could be used to identify conditions where diagnostic delay is a concern. When designing diagnostic quality and safety research, it may be useful to consider the differences between families and how they can address specific questions being asked (Supplementary Table 1).

Finally, the examples we give to support our taxonomy were sourced from the literature on cancer diagnosis, and some of the research we have described may not be possible for certain other health conditions. For example, endometriosis diagnosis and management are entwined and cannot be separated, so defining a date of diagnosis may not always be possible. Without a diagnosis date carrying out diagnostic window studies, for example, would be very challenging.

Implications

This taxonomy provides a structure against which existing evidence can be compared and organised, helping to elucidate promising targets for further research and improvement efforts. This allows us to borrow methods and adapt findings from diagnostic quality and safety research into other, seemingly unrelated, diseases. This is particularly relevant for conditions where existing evidence may be sparse, such as schizophrenia and rheumatoid arthritis.

The proposed framework can guide research in a sequential fashion; for example, if we want to explore how a specific condition is diagnosed in a specific healthcare system, then we can methodologically work through the families distinguished here (as applicable to the condition) to build the knowledge base, from population- to patient-level.

### Defining and measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medicine: a systematic review [^7dfd06bd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians routinely encounter diagnostic uncertainty in practice. Despite its impact on health care utilization, costs and error, measurement of diagnostic uncertainty is poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review to describe how diagnostic uncertainty is defined and measured in medical practice.

Methods

We searched OVID Medline and PsycINFO databases from inception until May 2017 using a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Additional search strategies included manual review of references identified in the primary search, use of a topic-specific database (AHRQ-PSNet) and expert input. We specifically focused on articles that (1) defined diagnostic uncertainty; (2) conceptualized diagnostic uncertainty in terms of its sources, complexity of its attributes or strategies for managing it; or (3) attempted to measure diagnostic uncertainty.

Key Results

We identified 123 articles for full review, none of which defined diagnostic uncertainty. Three attributes of diagnostic uncertainty were relevant for measurement: (1) it is a subjective perception experienced by the clinician; (2) it has the potential to impact diagnostic evaluation-for example, when inappropriately managed, it can lead to diagnostic delays; and (3) it is dynamic in nature, changing with time. Current methods for measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medical practice include: (1) asking clinicians about their perception of uncertainty (surveys and qualitative interviews), (2) evaluating the patient-clinician encounter (such as by reviews of medical records, transcripts of patient-clinician communication and observation), and (3) experimental techniques (patient vignette studies).

Conclusions

The term "diagnostic uncertainty" lacks a clear definition, and there is no comprehensive framework for its measurement in medical practice. Based on review findings, we propose that diagnostic uncertainty be defined as a "subjective perception of an inability to provide an accurate explanation of the patient's health problem". Methodological advancements in measuring diagnostic uncertainty can improve our understanding of diagnostic decision-making and inform interventions to reduce diagnostic errors and overuse of health care resources.

### When do symptoms become a disease? [^20e3ac8d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

When do symptoms become a disease? Are there rules or norms, currently or in the past, that tell us when a particular collection of largely symptom-based criteria has enough specificity, utility, or plausibility to justify the appellation disease? The history of numerous symptom-based diagnoses in use today suggests partial answers to these questions. The 19th-century shift to understanding ill health as a result of specific diseases, increasingly defined more by signs than symptoms, led to a loss of status for illnesses that possessed little clinical or laboratory specificity. Nevertheless, clinicians then and now have used symptom-based diagnoses. Some of these diagnoses owe their existence as specific diseases to the norms and practices of an older era much different from our own. Others have not only thrived but have resisted plausible redefinition done by using more "objective" criteria. Many strategies, such as response-to-treatment arguments, quantitative methods (for example, factor analysis), and consensus conferences, have been used to find or confer specificity in symptom-based diagnoses. These strategies are problematic and have generally been used after symptom-based diagnoses have been recognized and defined. These historical observations emphasize that although biological and clinical factors have set boundaries for which symptoms might plausibly be linked in a disease concept, social influences have largely determined which symptom clusters have become diseases.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^14a259a8]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID — diagnosis and initial assessment emphasize that holistic assessment should include a traditional history, physical examination, and additional diagnostic testing, as indicated, and that a positive COVID-19 test during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is not required to diagnose Long COVID because there is no single laboratory finding that is definitively diagnostic for confirming or ruling out the diagnosis. A basic laboratory assessment is recommended for all patients with possible Long COVID, with consideration for additional labs and diagnostic procedures guided by the patient's specific symptoms.

### Role of communicating diagnostic uncertainty in the safety-netting process: insights from a vignette study [^60f92f56]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Diagnostic error — missed, delayed or incorrect diagnosis — occurs frequently: from < 5% in 'perceptual' specialties (eg, radiology) to up to 10%–15% in other specialties. In specialties seeing undifferentiated patients (primary care or emergency medicine), some diagnostic error is inevitable. Not all errors reflect failure in the diagnostic process: some diseases may present atypically, or be undetectable in the early stages.

'Safety-netting' is one strategy for mitigating against harms associated with diagnostic error. Edwards et al defined safety-netting as: 'Information shared with a patient or carer, designed to help them identify the need to seek further medical help if their condition fails to improve'. Safety-netting helps to manage uncertainty in diagnosis and/or prognosis, protecting against harms arising if the initial diagnosis or predicted illness trajectory proves incorrect: it aims to 'handle the 'what ifs' arising from patient reported symptoms that could, potentially, indicate a serious illness'. Safety-netting may also reduce unnecessary reattendance and the associated costs.

### The end of diagnosis: when to stop testing [^57fdbbc0]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Defining the end of diagnosis and deciding when to stop further testing represent crucial features of many medical pursuits. The aim of this article is to analyze the principles that govern the decision to discontinue a chain of consecutive diagnostic tests. Using Bayes formula and threshold analysis, four common "stop rules" of medical diagnostics can be derived. The first rule relates to a lack of therapeutic consequence associated with continued testing. The second rule concerns empirical therapy, that is, the use of a benign, effective, and specific type of therapy to cap a diagnostic chain and use therapeutic success as confirmation for a diagnostic suspicion. The third rule states that the benefit of a suspected diagnosis should stay higher than the costs of a test invested in confirming its presence. Lastly, as the fourth rule, the cumulative test costs should not exceed the expected risks of a missed diagnosis. Although in clinical practice the ambiguities and variations among patients may compromise the calculation of exact stop values for each rule, knowledge of these underlying general principles may be sufficiently helpful in managing the individual patient.

### A practical and evidence-based approach to common symptoms: a narrative review [^722cddcf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Physical symptoms account for more than half of all outpatient visits, yet the predominant disease-focused model of care is inadequate for many of these symptom-prompted encounters. Moreover, the amount of clinician training dedicated to understanding, evaluating, and managing common symptoms is disproportionally small relative to their prevalence, impairment, and health care costs. This narrative review regarding physical symptoms addresses 4 common epidemiologic questions: cause, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Important findings include the following: First, at least one third of common symptoms do not have a clear-cut, disease-based explanation (5 studies in primary care, 1 in specialty clinics, and 2 in the general population). Second, the history and physical examination alone contribute 73% to 94% of the diagnostic information, with costly testing and procedures contributing much less (5 studies of multiple types of symptoms and 4 of specific symptoms). Third, physical and psychological symptoms commonly co-occur, making a dualistic approach impractical. Fourth, because most patients have multiple symptoms rather than a single symptom, focusing on 1 symptom and ignoring the others is unwise. Fifth, symptoms improve in weeks to several months in most patients but become chronic or recur in 20% to 25%. Sixth, serious causes that are not apparent after initial evaluation seldom emerge during long-term follow-up. Seventh, certain pharmacologic and behavioral treatments are effective across multiple types of symptoms. Eighth, measuring treatment response with valid scales can be helpful. Finally, communication has therapeutic value, including providing an explanation and probable prognosis without "normalizing" the symptom.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 [^69127a11]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) virus and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection and immunity.

This review is part of a suite of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. The key target conditions for this suite of reviews are current SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, current COVID‐19, and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

For current infection, the severity of the disease is important. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate (symptoms such as fever, cough, aches, lethargy but without difficulty breathing at rest); severe (symptoms with breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with severe or critical disease require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between them.

Thus, there are three target conditions for current infection:

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (asymptomatic or symptomatic of any severity);
mild or moderate COVID‐19;
severe or critical COVID‐19.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping (which is a subset of the above):

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

Here we summarise the evidence on signs and symptoms; as a result asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 and past SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are out of scope for this review.

### Decision making for diagnosis and management: a consensus comes to life [^26681f84]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and treatment of head and neck cancer is extremely complex. As a result, multiple medical providers are involved in a patient's care, and the multidisciplinary tumor boards provide a forum whereby they can share and discuss the intricacies of each individual patient's case. When recommendations are presented to the patient and decisions are to be finalized, the patient should benefit from the collective wisdom of a team of providers to achieve and implement a patient-centric and clinically sound consensus.

### Patient-reported experience of diagnosis, management, and burden of neuroendocrine tumors: results from a large patient survey in the United States [^df7e1281]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Delays in the Diagnosis of NETs

Few patients (131/758; 17%) suspected that the symptoms they were experiencing could be the result of a cancer. The mean patient-reported time from first symptom onset to clinical diagnosis was 59 months; 34% (259/758) of patients required 5 years or more for a NET diagnosis, and at diagnosis 57% (434/758) had metastatic disease. Patients saw a mean of 5.7 health care professionals before their NET diagnosis, across a mean of 12.7 doctor visits, and only 9% (69/758) of patients were diagnosed at a NET specialist center. The likelihood of being diagnosed at a NET specialist center has increased in recent years; diagnosis occurred at a NET specialist center in 11% (49/438) of patients diagnosed less than 5 years ago versus only 6% (20/320) of patients diagnosed 5 or more years ago. After initial symptoms and tests, 49% (368/758) of patients were initially diagnosed with another condition before receiving a NET diagnosis, with the most common other diagnoses received including irritable bowel syndrome (182/368; 49%), gastritis or another gastric disorder (169/368; 46%), and anxiety or a psychosomatic-type condition (97/368; 26%) (Fig. 1). Twenty-two percent (168/758) of respondents received a NET diagnosis as an incidental finding while being tested for another condition, and this occurrence has increased significantly in recent years, with 27% (117/438) of patients being diagnosed with NET in this manner in the last 5 years compared with only 16% (51/320) of patients who were diagnosed 5 or more years ago.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^eb46c218]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnostic workflow — steps: 1) form a hypothesis and estimate its likelihood, 2) decide how certain the HP diagnosis must be in the context of disease severity and behavior, 3) reassess the a priori probability of HP and choose an appropriate diagnostic test, 4) determine the posttest confidence of HP, and 5) determine if further testing or treatment is needed. This approach integrates the steps into the multidisciplinary assessment to establish the level of diagnostic confidence, and uses a provisional diagnosis reviewed at regular intervals, with recognition that the provisional diagnosis might change and that multidisciplinary team consultation can help confirm or reject the working diagnosis; the process is iterative and should be re-visited as additional data become available. The terms high or low confidence are used, with the goal of preventing inappropriate testing such as overutilization of TBC or VATS for diagnosis verification in patients with a provisional high confidence diagnosis. The diagnostic algorithm does not supersede clinical judgment regarding when to stop investigations and start treatment. The presented imaging and histopathological categories and the diagnostic approach do not capture each and every HP case and should be viewed as conditional and will evolve as new evidence becomes available.

### To what extent should doctors communicate diagnostic uncertainty with their patients? An empirical ethics vignette study [^3728a7e9]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2025). Medium credibility.

A lack of patient-focused research in this area means that there is little empirical evidence to confirm or refute beliefs about the consequences of diagnostic uncertainty communication. While some evidence suggests that communicating uncertainty regarding treatment options may be associated with lower patient satisfaction, little research has directly examined the effects of communicating diagnostic uncertainty. One study in paediatrics found that explicit expression of diagnostic uncertainty was associated with lower perceived competence, less trust and confidence, while another study involving patients with endometriosis demonstrated a patient preference for clear communication of diagnostic uncertainty to facilitate informed decision-making.

Questions also remain regarding the role of communicating diagnostic uncertainty when 'safety-netting' (giving advice to patients to help them identify when to seek further medical help if their symptoms worsen/do not improve). Some have suggested that sharing uncertainty is an important component of effective safety-netting, and there is evidence that some doctors explicitly share diagnostic uncertainty to encourage appropriate attendance and protect against diagnostic errors. However, whether communicating diagnostic uncertainty actually makes safety-netting more effective in encouraging patients to reattend in the event of worsening/non-resolving symptoms remains unclear.

What does the current study add?

In summary, doctors have differing opinions about whether communicating diagnostic uncertainty to patients causes harm (eg, by causing worry or by overwhelming patients with complex details) or benefit (eg, by encouraging appropriate reattendance through effective safety-netting or by fostering a more trusting doctor-patient relationship). A dearth of relevant patient-focused research makes it difficult to establish which assumptions about the impact of diagnostic uncertainty communication are correct. As ethical analyses often rely on such assumptions, the lack of empirical evidence is problematic.

This study begins to address this research gap. We aimed to (1) determine patient preferences for the communication of diagnostic uncertainty and (2) examine the effects of communicating diagnostic uncertainty on patients. By exploring the impact of communicating high or low diagnostic uncertainty on a range of outcomes, this study helps to address the normative question of how doctors should communicate diagnostic uncertainty to their patients.

### The impact of patient comorbidity on cancer stage at diagnosis [^bb94ceca]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

The presence of non-cancerous chronic conditions provides a clinical opportunity for earlier cancer diagnosis and referral for efficacious (and evidence-based) screening. Our observations suggest that it is possible that in some instances we may be missing this opportunity.

We also found strong evidence that the presence of comorbidity, particularly a high overall burden, makes it less likely that a patient will be recorded as staged at diagnosis. This observation is consistent with earlier work. A possible explanation for this association is that the clinician may decide not to put a patient with severe comorbidity through diagnostic investigation, particularly where that investigation may place the patient at high risk of complication and/or the patient has poor prognosis (as is the case in upper GI cancer, for example). This is, however, speculative.

A major strength of this study is the high-quality nature of the national-level data used. However, there are inherent weaknesses with using administrative data to identify comorbidity. Data may be missing or inaccurate; it can be difficult to differentiate complications of disease from pre-existing conditions; and there may be biases inherent in coding practices. These errors are likely to be non-differential in relation to stage at diagnosis, and are unlikely to account for the associations seen. It is also possible that there may be some differential measurement error, for example, those with later-stage of a given cancer may have been be more likely to have been hospitalised in the period before their diagnosis, resulting in a higher likelihood of their comorbid conditions being recorded. However, we do not believe that this is likely to be a strong effect and thus would be unlikely to have a substantial impact on the general patterns of associations observed here.

### Disease, diagnosis or syndrome? [^c8580415]. Practical Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

The advance of medical semantics is, in general, towards causation. As knowledge increases, the common consequence is the re-definition of disease. This starts with symptoms then a disorder of structure or function, abnormalities of images, genetics or biochemistry, the ultimate aim being a specific aetiological mechanism which replaces broader descriptions. But medical terminology of diseases, diagnoses and syndromes is inherently imprecise. Careless nomenclature causes confused dialogue and communication. Symptoms of uncertain cause are commonly lumped together and given a new 'diagnostic' label which also may confuse and produce false concepts that stultify further thought and research. Such medicalisation of non-specific aggregations of symptoms should be avoided. The defining characteristics of diseases and diagnoses should be validated and agreed. The pragmatic diagnoses of 'symptom of unknown cause' or 'non-disease' are preferable to falsely labelling patients with obscure or non-existent diseases. "I tried to unveil the stillness of existence through a counteracting murmur of words, and, above all, I confused things with their names: that is belief". Jean-Paul Sartre (The Words, 1964).

### Getting the evidence straight in emergency diagnostics [^bca2777a]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The interpretation and optimal application of the myriad of diagnostic modalities at the emergency physician's (EP's) disposal is a core challenge of clinical practice. Connecting the wealth of scientific literature that informs our understanding of test performance, including elements of the history and the physical examination, is a daunting task. Translating this knowledge into improved patient outcomes requires two fundamentals; the first involves getting the evidence "straight" through systematic approaches that highlight quality work and methods for getting evidence to the point of need. This commentary discusses the potential impact of the first installment in the "evidence-based diagnostics" series of the journal, highlighting how this work complements existing resources of evidence-based medicine. In addition, a vision is presented for how the insight from this series can achieve integration into the clinical and academic mission of emergency medicine.

### The trivialization of diagnosis [^839291df]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is widely recognized that diagnosis plays a central role in clinical medicine, in recent years the primacy of diagnosis has come under attack from several sources. 1. "Billable terms" are replacing traditional medical diagnoses. The former are based on International Classification of Diseases lists, which include many non-diagnoses such as symptoms and signs. 2. Diagnosis often gets short shrift because of the perceived urgency of discharge. 3. The problem oriented record, in practice, has frequently led to a shift in emphasis from synthesis of findings to fragmentation of problems. 4. Presumptive diagnoses frequently metamorphose into established diagnoses in medical records, even if incorrect. 5. A number of authors have apparently disparaged the importance of diagnosis. Nonetheless, it is clear that diagnosis must continue to play a central role in clinical medicine. We propose several ways by which we can resist these forces and assure that diagnosis retains its appropriate position of primacy.

### How to perform a critical appraisal of diagnostic tests: 7 steps [^f155fd78]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The critically appraised topic (CAT) is a format in evidence-based practice for sharing information. A CAT is a standardized way of summarizing the most current research evidence focused on a pertinent clinical question. Its aim is to provide both a critique of the most up-to-date retrieved research and an indication of the clinical relevance of results. A clinical question is initially generated following a patient encounter, which leads to and directs a literature search to answer the clinical question. Studies obtained from the literature search are assigned a level of evidence. This allows the most valid and relevant articles to be selected and to be critically appraised. The results are summarized, and this information is translated into clinically useful procedures and processes.

### Definitions of chronic disease need to be more patient centred [^137883e0]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Effect on patients

Another important consequence of defining an abnormal test or examination result as disease is that patients will lose, and in fact have often already lost, their say in whether they are sick, whether they need a treatment, and whether the treatment is effective. This loss is of no small matter. As a result, their health and rights cannot be adequately protected partly because of the competing interests of other stakeholders in the business of healthcare. Furthermore, interventions cannot make patients truly satisfied if they cannot sense what is wrong with their body and the benefit of interventions on it. Lastly, making small abnormal changes a disease may also increase overdiagnoses, cause health inequity, and compromise care quality and safety. Even the best evidence based policies will fail if clinicians do not have sufficient time to follow them, not to say the unsubstantiated recommendations, as clinicians have already been overloaded.

It is now evident that disease is not a black and white entity and ever earlier or smaller forms always exist. Undoubtedly, health technology will continue to advance so that in the future we can see even smaller changes in the body. Early detection and treatment are certainly beneficial for many diseases. The question is whether we should make a small abnormality a disease for which early diagnosis has little or no benefit and how much further we should go in this direction. Given the widely existent overdiagnosis and ever increasing health expenditure, we argue, for the purpose of patient care that is medicine's fundamental goal, we should rethink the way we define chronic diseases and make early, small abnormal changes a disease only if there are effective interventions that can make a clinical difference that is worthwhile to patients. To this end, the interventions' absolute benefit and cost effectiveness in the newly labelled patients should be highly emphasised and carefully evaluated before changing a diagnostic cut-off point or modifying a disease definition.

### The family history: the first genetic test, and still useful after all those years? [^8963f017]. Genetics in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The family history has its origins in genealogy and over the past century has become embedded in clinical practice. Its importance in specialized circumstances is unquestioned but largely untested. Moreover, the relevance of the family history to common diseases, especially in an era of genomic markers that convey risk and the emphasis on "personalized medicine", must be given careful scrutiny. Given the time and expertise needed to obtain and interpret the family history, without a clearer sense of clinical validity and utility, its role will likely diminish. The time to perform the requisite investigations is now.

### Improving early diagnosis of symptomatic cancer [^aa9eb31b]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Much time, effort and investment goes into the diagnosis of symptomatic cancer, with the expectation that this approach brings clinical benefits. This investment of resources has been particularly noticeable in the UK, which has, for several years, appeared near the bottom of international league tables for cancer survival in economically developed countries. In this Review, we examine expedited diagnosis of cancer from four perspectives. The first relates to the potential for clinical benefits of expedited diagnosis of symptomatic cancer. Limited evidence from clinical trials is available, but the considerable observational evidence suggests benefits can be obtained from this approach. The second perspective considers how expedited diagnosis can be achieved. We concentrate on data from the UK, where extensive awareness campaigns have been conducted, and initiatives in the primary-care setting, including clinical decision support, have all occurred during a period of considerable national policy change. The third section considers the most appropriate patients for cancer investigations, and the possible community settings for identification of such patients; UK national guidance for selection of patients for investigation is discussed. Finally, the health economics of expedited diagnosis are reviewed, although few studies provide definitive evidence on this topic.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^e9cb10b1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) and resulting COVID‐19 pandemic present important diagnostic evaluation challenges. These range from, on the one hand, understanding the value of signs and symptoms in predicting possible infection, assessing whether existing biochemical and imaging tests can identify infection and recognise patients needing critical care, and on the other hand, evaluating whether new diagnostic tests can allow accurate rapid and point‐of‐care testing. Also, the diagnostic aims are diverse, including identifying current infection, ruling out infection, identifying people in need of care escalation, or testing for past infection.

This review is part of a cluster of reviews on the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19 disease, and deals solely with the diagnostic accuracy of presenting clinical signs and symptoms for diagnosing COVID‐19 disease.

Target condition being diagnosed

COVID‐19 is the disease caused by infection with the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is diagnosed with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), which is a test that detects the virus' genetic material, with imaging to identify lung abnormalities and with clinical signs and symptoms.

SARS‐CoV‐2 infection can be asymptomatic (no symptoms); mild or moderate; severe (causing breathlessness and increased respiratory rate indicative of pneumonia and oxygen need); or critical (requiring intensive support due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock or other organ dysfunction). People with COVID‐19 pneumonia (severe or critical disease), require different patient management, which makes it important to distinguish between mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In this review, we will examine the diagnostic value of signs and symptoms for symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, which includes mild or moderate COVID‐19 disease and COVID‐19 pneumonia.

In planning review updates, we will consider the potential addition of another grouping, which is a subset of the above:

whether tests exist that identify people requiring respiratory support (SARS or ARDS) or intensive care.

### Defining and measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medicine: a systematic review [^b8b89cfa]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

METHODS

Data Sources and Search Strategy

We used multiple search strategies to identify candidate articles describing uncertainty pertaining to diagnosis in medical practice. We conducted a systematic search of the OVID Medline and PsycINFO databases using a combination of keyword searches and medical subject headings (MeSH); see full list in supplemental files. Our search included all publications through May 29 2017, with no restrictions on publication type (journal articles, books, etc.) or geography. We limited our search to English-language publications that focused on humans and had abstracts that could be used for initial screening. Our primary search yielded 7024 articles.

To ensure that we did not miss any published literature, we used multiple secondary search strategies to locate additional relevant articles for review. First, we manually reviewed the references of the articles identified in the primary search. Second, we searched a topic-specific database (Agency for Health Care Research and Quality's PSNet) with a subset of terms listed in the supplemental file. Third, we identified additional references by contacting authors and several experts in the field of diagnostic error, diagnostic uncertainty and clinical reasoning. Together, these secondary search methods yielded an additional 131 articles.

### Evidence-based medicine, systematic reviews, and guidelines in interventional pain management: part 7: systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy studies [^9e0a6cba]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Appropriate diagnosis is essential in providing proper and effective therapy. The field of diagnostic accuracy tests is dynamic with new tests being developed at a fast pace along with improvement in technology of existing tests on a continuous basis. Well-designed diagnostic test accuracy studies can help in making appropriate health care decisions, provided that they transparently and fully report their participants, tests, methods, and results. Exaggerated and biased results from poorly designed and reported diagnostic test studies can trigger their premature dissemination and lead physicians into making incorrect treatment decisions. Consequently, a diagnostic test is useful only to the extent that it distinguishes between conditions or disorders that might otherwise be confused. Since it is unlikely that clinicians, patients, and policy makers have the time, skills, and resources to find, appraise, and interpret the evidence and incorporate it into their health care decisions, systematic reviews and meta-analysis provide an accurate and reliable synthesis of vast quantities of data. A systematic review can identify what is known and what is unknown, giving guidance for future research. Systematic reviews have been considered as a vital link in the great chain of evidence that stretches from the laboratory to the bedside by helping to separate the insignificant, unsound, or redundant deadwood from the salient and critical studies that are worthy of reflection. A dangerous discrepancy exists between experts and evidence with all types of evidence. Historically, it has been reported that in only 15% of all cases can a pathoanatomical explanation be found for patients with chronic low back pain of more than 3 months resulting in the assumption that very little can be done in our present state of ignorance to treat these patients and improve their natural histories. On the other end of the spectrum, due to lack of sound diagnostic information, excessive health care is utilized with exploding costs. The validity of all diagnostic techniques has been described with variable accuracy and reliability. Lack of understanding of reference standards and their unavailability with interventional diagnostic techniques and misinterpretation secondary to interpretation bias may adversely influence the applicability of diagnostic interventions. This manuscript provides a review of the literature, a checklist, and a flow diagram describing the preferred way to present the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of the report of an analysis in a systematic review of diagnostic accuracy studies.

### A taxonomy of early diagnosis research to guide study design and funding prioritisation [^b9e726eb]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Could anything have been done differently to reach the correct diagnosis sooner? (Missed diagnostic opportunity studies)

Missed diagnostic opportunities are pre-diagnosis healthcare contacts where post-hoc judgement indicates that alternative decisions or actions could have led to more timely diagnosis. The majority of missed diagnostic opportunities are expected to occur within the diagnostic window and relate to patients with suboptimal diagnostic pathways and prolonged diagnostic intervals. However, there is little empirical research currently demonstrating this.

A current challenge is the unresolved balance between identifying missed diagnostic opportunities both accurately and objectively. One method of identifying missed diagnostic opportunities is manual clinical review, but this requires resources that limit scalability beyond clinical audit projects.

A second method is to define markers of missed diagnostic opportunities in EHR data. Such phenotypic rules – also termed 'e-triggers' - typically incorporate the documented occurrence of an event, combined with a time period during which a subsequent action ought to have followed. This allows estimation of the prevalence of a specific missed diagnostic opportunity, but requires prior knowledge of relevant markers.

A third approach is to consider any contacts within the diagnostic window where relevant symptoms have occurred - above those expected coincidentally - as missed diagnostic opportunities. This gives a proxy marker for missed opportunities and still requires manual clinical review to determine whether any individual instance was truly a missed diagnostic opportunity.

Identifying missed diagnostic opportunities can provide both patient- and population- level insight into diagnostic quality and safety incidents that are taking place and their frequency. This could allow for fast and targeted action to improve the diagnostic process. However, any approach incorporating a clinical review component may be subject to hindsight bias – that is, the clinician's awareness of the patient's outcome may affect their judgement of whether a missed diagnostic opportunity occurred.

### The importance of natural history [^b053e835]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

In a traditional view, the natural history of a condition or a disease tells us of the adult consequences of that entity, be it benign or otherwise. This knowledge then provides guidance as to who needs treatment, and allows us to assess whether our treatments alter an otherwise adverse natural history in a positive way without introducing iatrogenic complications. However, in the new paradigm for health care delivery of value-based care, we need to be able to express natural history in additional terms of burden of disease. This is something that lawmakers and people who pay for health care can understand and has a comparative value. It also serves as a benchmark to show the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing disease burden. In this paper, I will discuss why this POSNA symposium is important and make some recommendations on directions where we as individuals and as a professional society should be putting in our efforts and resources.

### A retrospective review of multiple findings in diagnostic exome sequencing: half are distinct and half are overlapping diagnoses [^24694549]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

How can patients with multiple molecular conditions have an average number of affected organ systems so similar (i.e. 4.4 vs. 3.9 organ systems affected) to patients with only one Mendelian condition? One possibility is that the two Mendelian conditions affect the same organ systems, causing overlapping clinical features. Partial overlap of phenotypes from multiple Mendelian conditions can appear to be a phenotype expansion of a single condition or it can indicate the presence of multiple Mendelian conditions. In organs affected by multiple Mendelian conditions, the molecular pathways may interact to produce an oligogenic phenotype. In the present cohort, about half of the patients who received multiple diagnoses had some clinical features that could be explained by either diagnosis, suggesting that the comorbid conditions cause overlapping phenotypes. Additionally many of the nonoverlapping diagnoses presented in only one organ system in the proband at the time of diagnosis, such as PKD1 (renal), ANK2 (neurological), NOTCH1 (cardiovascular), LRP5 (ophthalmologic), INSL3 (genitourinary), WNT10A and WDR72 (dental), ELN (cardiovascular), HBB (hematologic), CFTR (pulmonary), NF1 (dermatologic), and TYR (dermatologic). Therefore additional conditions do not double the number of organ systems involved for two reasons: both conditions affect the same organ system, and at least one condition affects only one organ system.

New information about gene–disease relationships is published continuously, so reanalyzing previous patients can help identify new diagnoses and can increase diagnostic yield. On the other hand, better defining the phenotypic spectrum of a specific Mendelian condition can allow elimination of a competing diagnosis. We reviewed reclassification reports to determine both how often new diagnoses were added to previous findings and how often initial diagnoses were ruled out. Because fewer than 4% of reclassification reports for MPRF patients removed a previous diagnosis, it appears that the majority of the time (more than 96%) MPRF likely reflect true coexisting Mendelian conditions in the proband. In a similar vein, a patient's phenotypic presentation may diverge from the course expected for the initial genetic diagnosis and indicate an additional Mendelian condition in the patient, as recently reported. Emergence of new clinical features is an excellent time to reanalyze previous exome data, whether the patient already has a diagnosis or not. This may lead to identification of an (additional) genetic diagnosis that was initially ruled out as clinically irrelevant.

### Guidelines for diagnostic next-generation sequencing [^cb00b88b]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Reporting

It is essential that NGS results are reported in a clear and consistent manner, as laboratory reports may be read by both experts and non-experts. From a practical standpoint, the clinically significant conclusions and the relevant test and test quality data should feature on the first page.

STATEMENT 26: The report of a NGS assay should summarize the patient's identification and diagnosis, a brief description of the test, a summary of results, and the major findings on one page.

Four examples of reports, with and without annexes, are included in the supplementary information to the guidelines.

All pathogenic (class 5) and likely pathogenic (class 4) variants have to be reported. Whether or not Unclassified Variants (UVs – class 3) are reported will depend on local practice. The latter has to be clear for the laboratory scientists, as well as for the referring clinicians.

STATEMENT 27: A local policy, in line with international recommendations, for reporting genomic variants should be established and documented by the laboratory prior to providing analysis of this type.

STATEMENT 28: Data on UVs have to be collected, with the aim to eventually classify these variants definitively.

A community activity is needed to collect and share the available information, with the aim to definitely classify the variants into pathogenic (class 5) or benign (class 1).

The policy that has been adopted by the laboratory or institute, with respect to unsolicited and secondary findings, has to be reflected in the laboratory practice and in the report.

STATEMENT 29: Laboratories should have a clearly defined protocol for addressing unsolicited and secondary findings prior to launching the test.

A diagnostic laboratory should not become overloaded with requests to analyze 'old' data in the view of new findings and progress in the fields. A diagnostic request is a contract at a certain point in time. A laboratory will only be able to offer what is known, and validated, at a given point in time.

### Uncertainty-aware large language models for explainable disease diagnosis [^4a3ecf4f]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Explainable disease diagnosis, which leverages patient information (e.g., symptoms) and computational models to generate probable diagnoses and reasoning, holds strong clinical promise. Yet, when clinical notes lack sufficient evidence for a definitive diagnosis, such as the absence of definitive symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty commonly arises, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. Despite its importance, the explicit identification and explanation of diagnostic uncertainty remain under-explored in artificial intelligence-driven systems. To fill this gap, we introduce ConfiDx, an uncertainty-aware large language model fine-tuned with diagnostic criteria. We formalized the task of uncertainty-aware diagnosis and curated richly annotated datasets that reflect varying degrees of diagnostic ambiguity. Evaluating on real-world datasets demonstrated that ConfiDx excelled in identifying diagnostic uncertainties, achieving superior diagnostic performance, and generating trustworthy explanations for diagnoses and uncertainties. Moreover, ConfiDx-assisted experts outperformed standalone experts by 10.7% in uncertainty recognition and 26% in uncertainty explanation, underscoring its substantial potential to improve clinical decision-making.

### Improving diagnostic performance through feedback: the diagnosis learning cycle [^0d6c4bb9]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

Testing this new model (ie, testing how to best externalise and preserve clinical reasoning and outcomes for comparison) can be achieved in a variety of ways by considering a multiplicity of factors that contribute to the success and challenges of implementation. The experts from our convening concluded that testing the feasibility of this model could begin with certain symptoms and associated diagnoses, such as paediatric abdominal pain (appendicitis, constipation, urinary tract infection), adult chest pain (aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndrome) or loss of consciousness (syncope, seizure). Relevant symptoms and diagnoses will vary across specialties and care settings. Another theme that emerged from the convening is that it is critical that collecting and retrieving this information fit within the healthcare workflow so time and pressure would not be added to providers' already time-crunched schedules. Recording 'think-alouds' while the patient is in the room, or after immediately leaving the room, was one suggestion for how reasoning and confidence could be captured in a working diagnosis without adding more work to a clinician's schedule.

Capturing diagnostic outcomes is challenging and likely also context-dependent, and implementation must consider this. For example, some care settings, such as emergency medicine and urgent care, are primarily focused on not missing severe or life-threatening conditions versus absolute diagnostic accuracy. Further, short-term diagnoses (within a few days of presentation) are different from long-term diagnoses (months to years after presentation) — diagnosis evolves over time, and receiving short-term feedback (eg, during the first few days of a hospitalisation) may provide different insights from long-term feedback (eg, based on diagnoses months to years after an encounter). Feedback based on longer-term outcomes is likely to be more logistically challenging. Clinicians may be less likely to remember specific details if a long time has elapsed between decision and outcome; however, developing reliable means to capture representations will obviate some of this difficulty. In order to compare the hypothesis with the outcome, a software system could be created where this information could be easily accessed by providers so they could see if their diagnostic hypothesis matched the outcome. Testing this model may also look different based on provider specialty and condition; therefore, the model is constructed to be flexible and amenable for use for a variety of specialties.

### Medical imaging and diagnostics program: research on… [^eaceb42f]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Medical Imaging and Diagnostics and Medical Devices Advances in medical imaging and diagnostics are resulting in new minimally invasive procedures and applications for medical devices in areas such as early breast cancer detection, brain imaging, retinal imaging, skin wound evaluation, modern endoscopy, diagnostic ultrasound imaging, and photoacoustic imaging. The FDA has seen substantial growth in the number of submissions and technical consults related to medical imaging and diagnostics over the last few years; for example, OSEL has conducted about 600 consults on novel endoscopes for seven review branches in CDRH since 2013. However, because emerging devices are different from a functional standpoint than traditional imaging and diagnostic technologies, the technological and regulatory considerations are unique to these emerging platforms.

Despite its increased use, currently there are few or no regulatory tools specific for evaluating common risks associated with novel medical imaging and diagnostics devices. Regulatory Science Gaps and Challenges Major regulatory science gaps and challenges that drive the Medical Imaging and Diagnostics Program are:

- Insufficient guidance to evaluate existing and emerging technologies.
- Lack of modern, systematic, universal and least-burdensome test methods and technical guidance for hysteroscopes.
- Expensive and time-consuming clinical trials which involve additional radiation risk to the patient.
- Lack of universal testing methods to evaluate image quality that better reflects clinical diagnostic utility.
- Lack of simple imaging phantoms that work with new images and complex tissues.
- Lack of fully validated, standardized, hydrophone-spatial-averaging correction methods that work with most common diagnostic ultrasound applications.
- Lack of standardized performance test methods for emerging photoacoustic imaging. The Medical Imaging and Diagnostics Program is intended to fill these knowledge gaps by fostering the development of predictable methods to evaluate existing and emerging technologies, least burdensome alternatives, and complements to clinical studies such as modeling and simulation, bench-top testing methods, and phantom development. Medical Imaging and Diagnostics Program Activities The Medical Imaging and Diagnostics Program focuses on regulatory science research in these areas:

- Advanced X-ray Imaging Methods
- Magnetic Resonance Imaging
- Optical Spectroscopy and Spectral Imaging
- Endoscopy
- Ultrasound Imaging
- Ultrasound Imaging Safety
- Photoacoustic Imaging
- Remote Vital Signs Detection
- Statistical Assessment For more information, email OSEL_imaging_diagnostics@fda. hhs. gov.

### Do diagnostic delays in cancer matter? [^5dee5a35]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Background:

The United Kingdom has poorer cancer outcomes than many other countries due partly to delays in diagnosing symptomatic cancer, leading to more advanced stage at diagnosis. Delays can occur at the level of patients, primary care, systems and secondary care. There is considerable potential for interventions to minimise delays and lead to earlier-stage diagnosis.

Methods:

Scoping review of the published studies, with a focus on methodological issues.

Results:

Trial data in this area are lacking and observational studies often show no association or negative ones. This review offers methodological explanations for these counter-intuitive findings.

Conclusion:

While diagnostic delays do matter, their importance is uncertain and must be determined through more sophisticated methods.

### FDA and CMS: Americans deserve accurate and reliable diagnostic… [^9eefb9b7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Physicians heavily rely on laboratory tests to make critical decisions about their patients' care — roughly 70% of healthcare decisions depend on laboratory test results according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For example, results from laboratory tests can be the sole determinant of whether a patient with cancer gets a particular therapy, potentially risking the patient's life with an inaccurate test result. Because of the important role of laboratory tests in healthcare decisions, it is essential to ensure these tests work. 1, 2 Other evidence, including published literature 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and the FDA's experience with tests to diagnose COVID-19, 9 suggests that the situation is getting worse. Therefore, in October of this year, the FDA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to help ensure the safety and effectiveness of LDTs by phasing out the FDA's current approach to LDTs.

If finalized, LDTs would generally fall under the same enforcement approach as other tests. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services supports the FDA's proposal. Both CMS and the FDA believe that patients and their doctors need to know that LDTs are valid. The FDA and CMS both provide oversight to help assure the accuracy of test results, however, they have different roles. CMS regulates laboratories that perform testing on individuals in the U. S. through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 by establishing quality standards for all laboratory testing to help ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. The FDA and CMS have long stood together in mutual support of FDA oversight of the analytical and clinical validity of LDTs. LDTs play an important role in healthcare, but when they perform poorly or are not supported by science, they put patients at risk.

The current approach has enabled some tests to enter the market with unfounded claims of innovation. We are now emerging from a global pandemic that has underscored the importance of accurate and reliable tests. Patients and providers need to have confidence that laboratory tests work. We believe the complementary FDA and CMS frameworks are both critical to assuring patients can rely on the clinical accuracy of their test results.

### How to write an interpretation [^3d74107f]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

Every day we interpret examination findings and clinical tests with the aim of coming to a diagnosis. But how well do we interpret these tests? Whether it is a traditional examination technique used by doctors for centuries or a new cutting edge biomarker, the diagnostic landscape shifts over time. The aim of interpretations is to produce a library of evidence-based resources directing the use of clinical tests including examination techniques. In this article we discuss how best to tackle writing an interpretation. Interpretations are succinct evidence-based summaries that draw together research findings to provide practical answers for clinicians.

### Radiation enteritis: from diagnosis to management [^2f99ecda]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As cancer treatments improve more patients than ever are living for longer with the side effects of these treatments. Radiation enteritis is a heterogenous condition with significant morbidity. The present review aims to provide a broad overview of the condition with particular attention to the diagnosis and management of the condition.

Recent Findings

Radiation enteritis appears to be more prevalent than originally thought because of patient underreporting and a lack of clinician awareness. Patient-related and treatment-related risk factors have now been identified and should be modified where possible. Medical and surgical factors have been explored, but manipulation of the gut microbiota offers one of the most exciting recent developments in disease prevention. Diagnosis and treatment are best approached in a systematic fashion with particular attention to the exclusion of recurrent malignancy and other gastrointestinal conditions. Surgery and endoscopy both offer opportunities for management of the complications of radiation enteritis. Experimental therapies offer hope for future management of radiation enteritis but large-scale human trials are needed.

Summary

Radiation enteritis is an important clinical problem, but awareness is lacking amongst patients and physicians. Clinical guidelines would allow standardised management which may improve the burden of the disease for patients.

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^1c30d85c]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Because of substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions, fibromyalgia is difficult to detect and diagnose. The hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, but patients often complain of only specific or localized pain symptoms, complicating the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia allow primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and, instead, use assessment tools.

Questions to ask your provider to reduce diagnostic problems

What are my primary concerns and symptoms?
How confident are you about the diagnosis?
What further tests might be helpful to improve your confidence?
Will the tests you are proposing change the treatment plan?
Are there findings/symptoms that do not fit your diagnosis?
What else could it be?
Can you facilitate a second opinion by providing me with my medical records?
When should I expect to see my test results?
What resources can you recommend for me to learn more about diagnosis?

Other approaches for involving patients in healthcare decisions regarding treatment might also be applicable when patients first meet with their providers, seeking diagnosis. For example, educational training efforts to improve physician–patient communication often focus on the physician, but can materials be developed to help train patients to initiate questions and communicate more effectively? Can educators and advocacy groups develop simulation exercises — that is, immersive experiences that help familiarise patients and their families with the healthcare system? How can health coaches or patient facilitators help patients become engaged effectively in the diagnostic process?

### Taking a history in neurocritically ill patients [^87cf7e20]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

A clinical history leads to an examination, tests and a diagnosis. This time-honored sequence in medicine remains valid in critical illness, but in the heat of the moment there is a quickly appearing inevitable sketchiness. Intensivists should never be too unquestioning, too comfortable with incomplete information, or too unwilling to start over if information is muddled or contradictory. No scale in neurology looks at history. There is no tool or requirement to provide a standard system of communication. I review the essentials of history taking in a neurocritically ill patient. Examples of the value of a good medical history are shown but also the familiar biases when asking questions. There are obstacles, errors of commission and omission, and the importance of recognition of a clinical trajectory.

### Evidence-based pathology: systematic literature reviews as the basis for guidelines and best practices [^974a17da]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Context

Evidence-based medicine has been proposed as a new paradigm for the identification and evaluation of medical information. Best available evidence or data are identified and used as the basis for the diagnosis and treatment of individual patients. Evidence-based pathology has adapted basic evidence-based medicine concepts to the specific needs of pathology and laboratory medicine.

Objectives

To briefly review the history and basic concepts of evidence-based medicine and evidence-based pathology, describe how to perform and interpret systematic reviews, and discuss how to integrate best evidence into guidelines.

Data Sources

PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Washington, DC) and Web of Science (Thompson Reuters, New York, New York) were used.

Conclusions

Evidence-based pathology provides methodology to evaluate the quality of information published in pathology journals and apply it to the diagnosis of tissue samples and other tests from individual patients. Information is gathered through the use of systematic reviews, using a method that is less biased and more comprehensive than ad hoc literature searches. Published data are classified into evidence levels to provide readers with a quick impression about the quality and probable clinical validity of available information. Best available evidence is combined with personal experience for the formulation of evidence-based, rather than opinion-based, guidelines that address specific practice needs.

### Defining and measuring diagnostic uncertainty in medicine: a systematic review [^f0950e17]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Limitations

Our review has some limitations. We limited our key-word search strategy to two commonly used databases — Ovid Medline and PsycInfo — and only included articles in English, due to logistical limitations. We also limited the review to defining diagnostic uncertainty for the purpose of measurement in medical practice. As a result, we might have missed articles in which alternative means or methods were used to describe diagnostic uncertainty. However, we used a broad primary search strategy along with secondary search strategies to help capture key decision-making literature. We were also limited in our ability to assess the quality of each study. As with other reviews, the possibility of selective reporting and publication bias cannot be excluded.

### Advancing the research agenda for diagnostic error reduction [^9d7760ac]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

Directions for future research to improve diagnosis
**1. Patient engagement**: strategies to promote shared decision making and patient engagement in healthcare hold great promise for reducing errors and error-related harm. The patient is key stakeholder at every step in the diagnostic process and serves as the main source of information during the diagnostic process. The patient also has access to information that can help the physicians maintain and regain situation awareness. For example, patients may support physicians by accurately informing them in a timely fashion about changes in their clinical situation. Patients are uniquely suited to detect and report errors that occur during their care processes. Thus patients are an enormous and virtually untapped resource for reducing diagnostic error; research studies that examine this potential are few. Therefore, studies are warranted to examine ways in which patients can influence their physicians' decisions by providing more accurate or focused information, asking questions, questioning diagnoses and discussing medical tests and diagnoses they may be concerned about. To be able to involve the patient in their medical process, the physician's role is changing as well. The physician needs to facilitate patient involvement by creating an environment in which patients can contribute, without shifting responsibility for accurate diagnosis to the patient. Specifically, the physician needs to create opportunities for patient involvement, for example, provide the possibility for patients to upload the patient history (eg, family history) online in advance as well as creating an atmosphere in which the patient feels comfortable to ask questions. Furthermore, research should explore the potential diagnostic benefits of patients' critical review of their own medical record.
2. EHRs: EHRs are now being developed and implemented in many countries, and the focus on improving the diagnostic process through the use of EHRs is timely. Research has already shown that the EHRs can be used for detection of diagnostic error, and the next step is to apply these methods to the implementation and evaluation of interventions to improve the diagnostic process. Schiff and Bates created a conceptual model and made several suggestions for preventing or minimising diagnostic error with use of EHRs and other health information technologies. Some of the most promising suggestions are:

### Conceptual framework to guide early diagnosis programs for symptomatic cancer as part of global cancer control [^17db8e97]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosing cancer earlier can enable timely treatment and optimize outcomes. Worldwide, national cancer control plans increasingly encompass early diagnosis programs for symptomatic patients, commonly comprising awareness campaigns to encourage prompt help-seeking for possible cancer symptoms and health system policies to support prompt diagnostic assessment and access to treatment. By their nature, early diagnosis programs involve complex public health interventions aiming to address unmet health needs by acting on patient, clinical, and system factors. However, there is uncertainty regarding how to optimize the design and evaluation of such interventions. We propose that decisions about early diagnosis programs should consider four interrelated components: first, the conduct of a needs assessment (based on cancer-site-specific statistics) to identify the cancers that may benefit most from early diagnosis in the target population; second, the consideration of symptom epidemiology to inform prioritization within an intervention; third, the identification of factors influencing prompt help-seeking at individual and system level to support the design and evaluation of interventions; and finally, the evaluation of factors influencing the health systems' capacity to promptly assess patients. This conceptual framework can be used by public health researchers and policy makers to identify the greatest evidence gaps and guide the design and evaluation of local early diagnosis programs as part of broader cancer control strategies.

### Characteristics of disease-specific and generic diagnostic pitfalls: a qualitative study [^61772f81]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Coding using the RDC taxonomy (Figure 2 B) revealed that 59% of 1041 errors were associated with testing challenges (n = 314) and challenging disease presentation (n = 305). The most frequent RDC subcategories assigned were test follow-up issues (n = 131), challenges in recognition of acuity or severity of illness (n = 82), test performance or interpretation (n = 69), masking or mimicking diagnosis (n = 64), and failure to diagnose the underlying cause (n = 62).

Most specialists were able to offer a number of specific examples of diagnosis failures that they considered to represent recurring pitfalls. These examples generally clustered into (1) more serious specialty diagnoses that were missed or delayed as a result of misdiagnosis upstream by the primary care physician; (2) instances of misdiagnosis or overdiagnosis in which patients were labeled as having a specialty diagnosis (eg, multiple sclerosis) that did not meet diagnostic criteria and/or where an alternate diagnosis (usually more benign, nonspecific, or psychiatric in nature) was more likely; and (3) generic pitfalls in clinical examination or testing relevant to that specialty (see eTable 3 in the Supplement for diagnostic pitfalls associated with neurologic conditions).

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^4171d10f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing — Recommendation 6 states that for individuals who have clinical or epidemiologic reasons that might make testing desirable, the IDSA panel suggests SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing in asymptomatic individuals who are either known or suspected to have been exposed to COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence). Remarks note limited evidence and no EUA-approved therapy for asymptomatic COVID-19 but allow that individual clinical scenarios may lead clinicians toward testing and consideration of treatment, and individuals with high-risk conditions or in close contact with immunocompromised individuals may be considered for testing. Testing should be done at least 5 days after the exposure, and if symptoms develop before 5 days the exposed individual should get tested immediately. Known exposures are defined as close contact for at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period with someone with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, while suspected exposures may include working or residing in congregate settings experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak. The decision to test asymptomatic persons should depend on availability of testing resources, knowledge of infection can inform appropriate isolation, risk varies by exposure conditions with household contacts especially high-risk, and the recommendation assumes the exposed individual was not wearing appropriate PPE.

### How to: evaluate a diagnostic test [^f7c448f9]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The development of an in vitro diagnostic test from a good idea to a clinically relevant tool takes several steps, with more stringent requirements at every step.

Objectives

This article aims to summarize the necessary questions to be asked about a test and to illustrate study designs answering these questions. We also aim to relate Regulation (EU) 2017/746 to the needs of evidence-based diagnostic testing, where applicable.

Sources

We used literature on evidence-based diagnostics, a text book on clinical trials in the development and marketing of medical devices and the English version of Regulation 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council on in vitro diagnostic medical devices.

Content

The combination of different test uses and different stages of development determine the required test characteristics and suitability of study designs. In an earlier stage of test development it may be crucial to know whether a test can differentiate diseased persons from healthy controls, although this tells us little about how a test will perform in practice. Later stages focus on the diagnostic accuracy of a test in a clinically relevant situation. However, a test that perfectly distinguishes between patients with and without a certain condition may still have little effect on patient outcomes. Therefore, randomized controlled trials of testing may be needed, as well as post-marketing monitoring.

Implications

Both researchers and users of tests need to be aware of the limitations of diagnostic test accuracy and realize that accuracy is only indirectly linked to people's health status.

### Systematic analysis of chatGPT, google search and llama 2 for clinical decision support tasks [^d34410be]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Querying Google

Symptoms were searched and the most likely diagnosis was determined based on the first 10 hits reported by Google. Search, extraction and interpretation was performed by a non medical expert, mimicking the situation of a patient.

Based on medical history of every case, search strings were defined: baby(opt.) child(opt.) diagnosis < symptoms > previous < previous illness > (opt.) known < known disease > (opt.) < additional information > (opt.).

Symptoms were extracted based on the information provided in medical history. Optionally, if a previously resolved illness existed and was considered relevant by the non medical expert, the word "previous" was added, followed by information on the disease. If a known condition, e.g. hay fever, existed and was considered relevant, the word "known" was added, followed by information on the disease.

The search was performed in incognito mode using. For every case, the first 10 websites were evaluated. Websites were scanned for possible diagnoses. The non medical expert compared the symptoms characterizing each diagnosis on the search results to those provided by the medical history. Information on e.g. age or sex – available in the medical history but not by the search string – was additionally taken into account. For example, ectopic pregnancy is not considered possible for a male case with abdominal pain. For cases considering children below the age of 1, "baby" was added to the search string. For cases considering children below the age of 16, "child" was added to the search string.

Solely information available on the websites was evaluated. No further detailed search on a specific diagnosis was performed if, e.g. only limited information on a disease's characteristics was provided by a website.

A maximum of five most likely diagnoses were determined. If more than five diagnoses appear equally likely, the most frequently reported diagnoses were selected. The Google search strings as well as identified five diagnoses are available in Supplementary Data 1.

### Diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^51175fea]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia diagnosis — testing recommendation: In patients presenting with a strong clinical phenotype for PCD, we suggest using an extended genetic panel as a diagnostic test over TEM ciliary testing and/or standard (≤ 12 genes) genetic panel testing (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence in test accuracy but very low certainty in the overall evidence). This recommendation encourages the use of extended genetic panel testing for diagnosis of PCD as a replacement for standard genetic panels (≤ 12 genes) and/or TEM ciliary testing, was voted by consensus, and was based on a very low certainty in the overall evidence for improved long-term, patient-important outcomes; the committee cited higher test sensitivity in actual clinical practice and overestimation of TEM performance in research as critically important factors.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^453f20bb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular testing — Recommendation 5 states: The IDSA panel suggests performing a single NAAT and not repeating testing routinely in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19 whose initial NAAT result is negative (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel considered symptomatic patients to have at least one of the most common symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (Table 1). While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24–48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

Background

Our understanding of all aspects of coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is evolving. Some aspects already appear clear: children are significantly less likely to be diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 than adults and those who are have less likelihood of being severely affected. Nevertheless, significant concerns remain about the small number of children reported as requiring ventilatory support and who have died as a result of COVID-19.

### FDA launches pilot program to help reduce risks associated with… [^832d79aa]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration announced a new voluntary pilot program for certain oncology drug products used with certain corresponding in vitro diagnostic tests to help clinicians select appropriate cancer treatments for patients. "We believe this guidance and the launch of the pilot program are important steps towards addressing safety risks posed by the use of poorly performing laboratory developed tests, " said Jeff Shuren, M. D. J. D., director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. "The pilot aims to help by making transparent performance recommendations for diagnostic tests used to select certain oncology drug treatments". Under current FDA policy, an in vitro companion diagnostic test is one that provides information essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding treatment.

In oncology, for example, specific tests may be used to identify patients, such as those with a particular genetic mutation, who may or may not benefit from certain cancer treatments. The current policy also provides that, in certain limited circumstances, the FDA may decide to approve a life-saving treatment that requires use of an in vitro companion diagnostic even if a corresponding in vitro companion diagnostic has not yet received marketing authorization. In these cases, tests offered as laboratory developed tests are being used for patient treatment decisions. Through the pilot program, the FDA will request, from drug manufacturers, performance information for the tests used to enroll patients into the clinical trials that support drug approval. Based on an assessment of that information, the FDA will post to the FDA website the minimum performance characteristics recommended for similar tests that may be used to select patients for treatment with the approved drug.

Laboratories may use this information to guide their development of LDTs to identify specific biomarkers used for selecting cancer treatment. This transparency aims to help facilitate better and more consistent performance of these tests, resulting in better drug selection and improved care for patients with cancer. "Today's pilot program launch, and corresponding guidance publication, is a step forward in improving cancer care for patients, " said Richard Pazdur, M. D., director of the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "This pilot program demonstrates the FDA's commitment to collaborating with the pharmaceutical industry and other key stakeholders to address concerns and questions around the use of unauthorized diagnostics".

### Progress and priorities in reducing the time to cancer diagnosis [^f28ac5a3]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

The systematic review by Neal et al. "Is increased time to diagnosis and treatment associated with poorer outcomes" published in the 2015 early diagnosis BJC supplement has become one of the most highly cited papers in the field with 470 Web of Science citations by September 2022. While Neal et al. dissect methodological shortcomings in the evidence they have reviewed, they posit that shortening the time to cancer diagnosis and treatment does convey prognostic benefits, particularly for certain cancers and patient groups. Building on this conclusion, we overview key developments in policy and evidence for early diagnosis that have ensued since the publication of this seminal paper.

The publication of the NICE guidelines 'Suspected cancer: Recognition and referral" in the same year as the Neal et al. review (2015) represents an important milestone in efforts to improve diagnosis of as-yet-undiagnosed cancer in symptomatic patients. A unique feature of these guidelines is the endorsement of an explicit 3% cancer risk threshold at which patients ought to be investigated. Like all social value judgements, this threshold represents the assessment of benefits, risks, and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic technologies available at that time. We now know that it may be possible to lower referral thresholds for some patients without being overly demanding of resources, whilst effectively increasing them when positive triage tests identify higher-risk symptomatic patients. There has been a continuous and inexorable rise in urgent referrals for suspected cancer since 2009–10. Using the latest reported data (12-month period to July 2022), there are more than 2.7 m referrals for suspected cancer each year in England. The increasing proportion of cancer patients detected via this route has been credited for welcome reductions in diagnoses through emergency presentation, associated with worse prognosis. However, these positive developments come at a cost as only around one in 15 patients referred is found to have cancer. For cancers with few, variable, or low-risk symptoms and no primary care tests, there are still limited options to improve early diagnosis.

### Panel testing for the molecular genetic diagnosis of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism-a clinical perspective [^4d8b050b]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical diagnosis and management of CHH

Unlike with many other rare diseases, CHH is amenable to treatment with replacement of either GnRH, gonadotropin or sex steroid hormones. Whilst early intervention is optimal, even with treatment in adult life interventions can result in restoration of fertility in both men and women in approximately 75% of patients. However, both delayed presentation and diagnosis are common in this condition, as clinical assessment can be challenging with subtle symptoms and signs of hypogonadism that can be missed. There are many instances of first diagnosis in adult life, when patients present with hypogonadism, lack of libido and reduced energy levels and bone density, or are diagnosed during investigations for infertility. In women, where the condition is less prevalent it is also less frequently considered, and, without the red flag features of micropenis, cryptorchidism and small volume testes that may be diagnostic clues in men, can present an even more elusive clinical picture.

This diagnostic challenge is particularly pertinent for paediatric endocrinologists looking after adolescents with delayed puberty. In these patients, the presentation of isolated or constitutional delay in puberty – a common and usually self-limiting condition - may be indistinguishable from CHH by traditional biochemical investigations. Both conditions will present with low sex steroid and gonadotropin concentrations, and even recently adopted biomarkers (such as inhibin B) do not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to discriminate GnRH deficiency from constitutional delay. Additionally, patients with partial CHH may enter puberty but then stall, lending further complexity to the diagnostic algorithm.

Therefore, the potential for genetic testing to investigate a patient with suspected CHH or KS, in order to make a clear diagnosis where clinical phenotypic and biochemical features have not provided one, is an attractive avenue to pursue. The imperative to make this diagnosis in a timely manner in adolescence is driven not only by the need to reduce invasive and costly investigations and uncertainty for the patient, but also because the timing and nature of treatment differs depending on the underlying condition. For patients with CHH, therapy to induce puberty will be given promptly and at an earlier age and male patients can be offered treatment with gonadotropins to increase their potential for future fertility. Delays in diagnosis have also been shown to lead to significant psychological and emotional distress for the patients and their families.

### Managing functional neurological disorder: treatment recommendations for health professionals in Australia [^9a68561b]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Functional Neurological Disorder (FND) can present significant management challenges due to its sometimes-complex presentation and the historical stigma attached to this diagnosis. Recent advances have improved understanding and management of FND, emphasising the benefit of a multidisciplinary approach to management. The prognosis of FND varies but evidence-based treatments offer the potential of remission to many people for whom FND might otherwise cause long-term disability, and meaningful symptomatic and functional improvement for many more. Despite this, limited and inequitable access to treatment means that many people with FND in Australia continue to experience treatable disability due to the condition. Diagnosis: FND should be diagnosed based on positive signs rather than exclusion. This includes identifying inconsistencies and incongruencies in symptoms that differentiate them from other neurological conditions. Communication: The diagnosis of FND should be communicated to patients promptly and clearly upon diagnosis of the condition. Information provided should include the name of the condition, the basis on which the diagnosis has been made, key principles that can aid self-management, and shared planning of next steps in treatment or accessing treatment. Multidisciplinary Management: Across healthcare service models, treatment should involve a multidisciplinary team to address the multifaceted, and sometimes complex symptoms of FND. Role of General Practitioners (GPs): GPs are integral in the long-term management of FND, providing continuity of care, patient support and education, and facilitating access to specialist services. An informed GP can provide the patient with confidence and agency to be pro-active in their symptoms.

### Emergency colon cancer diagnosis in people with mental health conditions: a population-based cohort study in Northern Italy [^67fb987f]. BMJ Mental Health (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Summary of key findings

Patients with mental health conditions were significantly less likely to have a screening-detected cancer and more likely to have an emergency cancer diagnosis, with higher mortality, independently of physical comorbidities and sociodemographic characteristics. At least one-in-two patients with dementia and related cognitive conditions, substance use/behavioural/personality-related conditions, or anxiety received a cancer diagnosis following EP. At the same time, this occurred in one-third of individuals with no mental health conditions. This population-based evidence highlights the need for appropriate support and improved pathways for vulnerable patients, to reduce disparities in cancer diagnosis and to improve health outcomes.

Comparison with the existing literature

Despite the increasing multimorbidity burden among Western populations, with mental health conditions and cancer being among the most common conditions, there is limited research exploring the interplay between them and the impact on diagnostic pathways. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies providing population-level evidence, utilising linked electronic health records, on routes to cancer diagnosis by mental health conditions in Europe. Studies on emergency cancer diagnosis in this population have previously been conducted in New Zealandand the USA.

The lower likelihood of screening-detected cancer and increased risk of EP among individuals with mental health conditions found in our study is consistent with international evidence documenting systemic barriers to healthcare in psychiatric patients.

Despite the availability of population-wide screening programmes for colorectal cancer, the most common RtD is following symptomatic presentation, accounting for 85%–90% of all colorectal cancer diagnoses in the UK. Individuals with mental health conditions may experience difficulties in identifying new symptoms, interpreting them as potential indicators of cancer, appreciating their clinical significanceand communicating them effectively. Although insufficient or delayed help-seeking for cancer symptoms is likely a significant contributor to EPs, limited research has specifically addressed this issue in individuals with mental health conditions.

Brief resolved unexplained events (BRUE) — guideline scope and intent emphasize that the guideline may be of interest to payers, but it is not intended to be used for reimbursement or to determine insurance coverage, and it is not intended as the sole source of guidance in the evaluation and management of BRUEs and specifically does not address higher-risk BRUE patients. It is intended to provide a patient- and family-centered approach to care, reduce unnecessary and costly medical interventions, and improve patient outcomes, and includes recommendations for diagnosis, risk-based stratification, monitoring, disposition planning, effective communication with the patient and family, guideline implementation and evaluation, and future research. It aims to help clinicians determine the presence of a serious underlying cause and a safe disposition by alerting them to the most significant features of the clinical history and physical examination on which to base an approach for diagnostic testing and hospitalization.

### Evaluation of vaginal complaints [^5ba24c45]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Vaginal symptoms are one of the most common reasons for gynecological consultation. Clinicians have traditionally diagnosed vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis using some combination of physical examination, pH, the wet mount, and the whiff test.

Objectives

To evaluate the role of the clinical examination and determine the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) for the diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis.

Data Sources

Using a structured literature review, we abstracted information on sensitivity and specificity for symptoms, signs, and office laboratory procedures. We chose published (1966 to April 2003) articles that appeared in the MEDLINE database and were indexed under the combined search terms of diagnosis with vaginitis, vaginal discharge, candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis.

Study Selection

Included studies of symptomatic premenopausal women seen in primary care settings. Tests were evaluated only if they would provide diagnostic information during the office visit and were compared with an acceptable criterion standard.

Data Extraction

All 3 authors extracted the data and computed sensitivity and specificity from each article independently. The absence of standard definitions for symptoms and signs made it impossible to combine results across studies.

Data Synthesis

Symptoms alone do not allow clinicians to distinguish confidently between the causes of vaginitis. However, a patient's lack of itching makes candidiasis less likely (range of LRs, 0.18 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05–0.70] to 0.79 [95% CI, 0.72–0.87]) and lack of perceived odor makes bacterial vaginosis unlikely (LR, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01–0.51]). Similarly, physical examination signs are limited in their diagnostic power. The presence of inflammatory signs is associated with candidiasis (range of LRs, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.5–2.8] to 8.4 [95% CI, 2.3–31]). Presence of a "high cheese" odor on examination is predictive of bacterial vaginosis (LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 2.1–4.7]) while lack of odor is associated with candidiasis (LR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.4–5.0]). Office laboratory tests, particularly microscopy of vaginal discharge, are the most useful way of diagnosing these 3 conditions.

Conclusions

The cause of vaginal complaints may be easily diagnosed when typical findings appear in microscopy. However, the poor performance of individual symptoms, signs, and office laboratory tests often makes it problematic to identify the cause of vaginal symptoms.

### The role of chest imaging in patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner society [^375e84af]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Overview of clinical scenarios — scenarios apply only to patients presenting with features consistent with COVID-19 infection, with severity of respiratory disease and pretest probability specified along with key considerations such as risk factors for disease progression, evidence of disease progression, and substantial critical resource constraints. Pretest probability is defined by background prevalence and estimated by observed transmission patterns — low with sporadic transmission, moderate with clustered transmission, and high with community transmission — and is further modified if there is known exposure through contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19.
