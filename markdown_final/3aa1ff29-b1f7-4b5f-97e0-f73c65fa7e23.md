## Question

clinical manifestation, pathophysiology, risk factors and prognosis of adult growth hormone deficiency

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about adult growth hormone deficiency, covering clinical manifestations, pathophysiology, risk factors, and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining AGHD and its epidemiology. Then, I should verify the core clinical manifestations across organ systems. Next, I will examine the underlying pathophysiology and etiologies. After that, I need to identify risk factors and high-risk populations. Finally, I will assess prognosis and mortality, including the impact of GH therapy, and close with a concise synthesis that acknowledges uncertainties and guideline-based nuances.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't gloss over basics. Adult growth hormone deficiency is a syndrome of inadequate GH production in adults, with an incidence around 2–3 per 100,000 person-years; prevalence estimates suggest roughly 200–300 per million adults, though ascertainment varies by cohort and diagnostic criteria, so I should be cautious about overgeneralization [^111h4Zgn] [^112aDF2s].

> Now, I will examine the clinical manifestations, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these features are nonspecific and must be interpreted in the right clinical context. The most consistent findings include increased fat mass (especially visceral), decreased lean mass, reduced muscle strength and exercise capacity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, low bone mineral density with increased fracture risk, and impaired quality of life with fatigue, anxiety, and reduced vitality; importantly, many of these abnormalities improve with GH therapy, though not all reverse completely and some evolve slowly, particularly skeletal endpoints [^111h4Zgn] [^11476SD6] [^113S5kdn] [^1139AiPn].

> Wait, let me verify the skeletal and cardiovascular specifics because they're often misstated. Bone mineral density in severe AGHD is about 1 SD below the mean, with osteoporosis-level T-scores in a substantial minority; fracture risk is increased 2–5 fold, and early treatment response can be biphasic with transient decreases before gains emerge, so I should counsel patients accordingly and avoid premature judgment at 6 months [^113S5kdn]. For cardiovascular risk, AGHD is linked to adverse lipids, endothelial dysfunction, low-grade inflammation, and higher vascular event rates; GH therapy improves several surrogate cardiovascular outcomes but tends to increase insulin resistance, so I need to balance lipid and QoL gains against glycemic risk and monitor closely [^1139AiPn] [^111AcJxr].

> Next, I should review pathophysiology and etiologies, and I need to ensure I separate acquired from congenital causes. The proximate defect is impaired hypothalamic GHRH signaling or pituitary somatotroph dysfunction, leading to reduced GH pulsatility and downstream IGF-1 deficiency; acquired causes predominate in adults, including pituitary adenomas and their treatment (surgery, radiotherapy), infiltrative disease, hypophysitis, head trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and CNS infections, whereas congenital forms include mutations in GH1, GHRHR, and transcription factors causing isolated or combined pituitary hormone deficiencies [^111h4Zgn] [^111FaYBi] [^113wBAQg].

> Hold on, I should verify the relative contributions of tumors versus other acquired causes so I don't over-attribute. Multiple series and guidelines consistently identify pituitary adenomas and their treatment as the most common cause of adult-onset GHD, with cranial irradiation conferring a time- and dose-dependent risk of hypopituitarism; traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid hemorrhage are increasingly recognized but testing should be delayed to avoid transient deficits, and idiopathic adult GHD is rare and requires stringent diagnostic criteria [^111vvPj8] [^1128YZ2T] [^113wBAQg] [^115X3nRt].

> I will now examine risk factors and high-risk populations, and I should double-check that I include both disease-related and demographic modifiers. Key risks include structural hypothalamic–pituitary disease, prior pituitary surgery or radiotherapy, multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, head trauma, and a history of childhood-onset GHD; emerging risks include TBI, SAH, and ischemic stroke, though testing timing matters given potential recovery, and age-related decline in GH complicates interpretation, necessitating age-appropriate cut-points on stimulation tests [^116fJfUi] [^113wBAQg] [^113yYY7e].

> But wait, what about malignancy and family history — do they preclude GH therapy outright? I should confirm guideline nuances. Active malignancy is a contraindication, yet after remission, particularly beyond 5 years and in coordination with oncology, GH may be considered case-by-case; there is insufficient evidence that GH increases new malignancy risk in appropriately selected adults, though vigilance is warranted, especially after cranial irradiation where secondary neoplasia risk is already elevated [^11486XVZ] [^112bSkwZ] [^114z45eq].

> Next, I should review prognosis and mortality, and I need to be careful not to overstate causality. Untreated AGHD is associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in hypopituitarism cohorts, with Swedish data showing nearly twofold higher cardiovascular mortality; however, GH therapy improves body composition, lipids, endothelial function, and quality of life, and may normalize some surrogate cardiovascular markers, but it has not been proven to reduce mortality or hard cardiovascular events in randomized trials, so expectations must be tempered [^114DwPgt] [^11476SD6] [^1132q6io] [^111AcJxr].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought GH therapy might directly reduce mortality — let me reconsider and verify the strength of evidence. The Endocrine Society explicitly notes that while mortality is increased in hypopituitarism with GHD, GH has not yet been shown to improve mortality, so I should avoid implying mortality benefit and instead emphasize symptomatic and surrogate improvements alongside individualized risk–benefit assessment and longitudinal monitoring [^1132q6io] [^115V4ZF1].

> I should also confirm the magnitude of fracture risk and bone outcomes because patients often ask about skeletal safety. Fracture risk is increased 2–5 fold in untreated AGHD, and GH replacement improves bone turnover and BMD over time, though gains can be slow and may require years to manifest; early transient decreases in BMD can occur, so persistence with therapy and fall-risk mitigation are important [^113S5kdn].

> Let me synthesize and ensure internal consistency. AGHD presents with a multisystem phenotype driven by reduced GH–IGF-1 activity, most commonly from acquired hypothalamic–pituitary disease or its treatment; manifestations span altered body composition, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, low BMD, and impaired QoL, many of which improve with GH therapy even if mortality benefit remains unproven; prognosis hinges on the underlying etiology, severity of deficiency, comorbid pituitary deficits, and access to comprehensive endocrine care, with cardiovascular disease as the dominant driver of excess mortality in untreated cohorts [^111h4Zgn] [^11476SD6] [^114DwPgt].

> Finally, I need to ensure the diagnostic and therapeutic caveats are explicit so we don't overdiagnose or overtreat. Because symptoms are nonspecific, provocative testing is usually required except in high-probability contexts, and idiopathic adult GHD should be diagnosed with caution; treatment decisions should be individualized, with low starting doses, IGF-1–guided titration, and close monitoring for side effects, glycemic changes, and tumor surveillance, aligning with Endocrine Society and AACE/ACE guidance [^114rn5T8] [^114W8c9K] [^111aCNEu].

Adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) presents with **increased fat mass** (especially visceral), **decreased lean mass**, reduced exercise capacity, fatigue, anxiety/depression, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, low bone mineral density, and higher fracture risk [^112aDF2s] [^113S5kdn]. It results from **pituitary or hypothalamic disease** (tumors, surgery, radiation, trauma, infiltrative or genetic causes) or is idiopathic [^111FaYBi] [^114ScP39]. Risk factors include pituitary adenomas, prior surgery or radiation, head trauma, and multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies [^116fJfUi] [^113wBAQg]. AGHD is associated with **increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality** and reduced quality of life; GH therapy improves body composition, bone density, and quality of life, but mortality benefit remains unproven [^1138s3cY] [^11476SD6] [^1132q6io].

---

## Clinical manifestations

AGHD has **multisystem effects** [^111h4Zgn]; the most common manifestations include:

- **Body composition**: Increased fat mass (especially visceral), decreased lean mass, reduced muscle strength [^113f73WW] [^112aDF2s] [^111rQQjP].
- **Cardiovascular**: Dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, increased cardiovascular risk [^1139AiPn] [^112aDF2s].
- **Bone health**: Reduced bone mineral density, increased fracture risk [^113S5kdn].
- **Quality of life**: Fatigue, anxiety, depression, reduced vitality and social functioning [^113y8MfZ].
- **Exercise capacity**: Reduced exercise tolerance and physical performance [^111rQQjP].

---

## Pathophysiology

AGHD results from **insufficient GH secretion** due to hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction [^111h4Zgn]. GH is secreted in pulses, so deficiency reflects impaired pulsatile release rather than a constant reduction. GH deficiency reduces hepatic IGF-1 production, which mediates many growth and metabolic effects; low IGF-1 contributes to altered body composition, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and reduced bone density [^111rQQjP].

---

## Risk factors and causes

AGHD can be **congenital or acquired**; the most common causes are pituitary adenomas and their treatment (surgery, radiotherapy) [^114ScP39] [^111vvPj8]. Other causes include:

- **Tumors**: Craniopharyngiomas, germinomas, metastases [^111FaYBi].
- **Trauma**: Head injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic stroke [^113wBAQg].
- **Infiltrative diseases**: Sarcoidosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphocytic hypophysitis [^111FaYBi].
- **Genetic**: Mutations in GH1, GHRHR, PROP1, POU1F1 [^112mhrim].
- **Idiopathic**: Rare, requiring stringent diagnostic criteria [^115X3nRt].

Risk factors include a history of **pituitary or hypothalamic disease**, prior pituitary surgery or radiation, head trauma, and multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies [^116fJfUi] [^113wBAQg].

---

## Prognosis

AGHD is associated with **increased morbidity and mortality**, particularly from cardiovascular disease [^114DwPgt]. Untreated patients have higher rates of cardiovascular events, metabolic syndrome, and reduced quality of life [^112aDF2s]. GH replacement therapy improves body composition, bone density, lipid profile, and quality of life, but evidence for reduced mortality is limited and conflicting [^1132q6io] [^1167Ys5y]. Prognosis depends on the underlying cause, severity of deficiency, and adherence to therapy [^117Fx1Fs] [^116yfTXL].

---

AGHD is a clinically significant condition with **multisystem manifestations** due to GH deficiency. It is caused by pituitary or hypothalamic disease or is idiopathic, and is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and reduced quality of life. GH therapy improves many outcomes, but mortality benefit remains unproven [^1132q6io].

### Pathogenesis and diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency in adults [^111h4Zgn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on adult growth hormone deficiency:

- **Definition**: AGHD is a condition characterized by the inadequate production of GH in adults.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of AGHD often involves dysfunction in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, which are responsible for the production and release of GH. The most common causes are isolated idiopathic GHD and hypothalamic-pituitary tumors and/or their treatment regimens.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of AGHD is estimated at around 2–3 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for AGHD include a history of hypothalamic-pituitary disease, brain tumors, and exposure to radiation therapy.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, AGHD manifests with a range of symptoms including neuropsychiatric-cognitive, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, metabolic, and skeletal abnormalities. Most of these can be reversed with GH therapy.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: AGHD is associated with increased mortality. The prognosis can be improved with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Growth hormone therapy in adults with growth hormone deficiency: a critical assessment of the literature [^1167Ys5y]. Pituitary (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Growth hormone (GH) therapy has been studied as treatment for clinical manifestations of adult-onset growth hormone deficiency (AO-GHD), including cardiovascular risk, bone health, and quality of life. Patients with AO-GHD typically also have significant history of pituitary pathology and hypopituitarism, which raises the question of what proportion of their clinical presentation can be attributed to GHD alone. Currently, much of the existing data for GH therapy in AO-GHD come from uncontrolled retrospective studies and observational protocols. These considerations require careful reassessment of the role of GH as a therapeutic agent in adult patients with hypopituitarism.

Methods

We contrast results from placebo-controlled trials with those from uncontrolled and retrospective studies for GH replacement in patients with hypopituitarism. We also examine the evidence for the manifestations of AO-GHD being attributed to GHD alone, as well as the data on adults with congenital, life-long untreated isolated GHD.

Results

The evidence for increased morbidity and mortality in hypopituitary patients with GHD, and for the benefits of GH therapy, are conflicting. There remains the possibility that the described clinical manifestations of AO-GHD may not be due to GHD alone, but may also be related to underlying pituitary pathology, treatment history and suboptimal hormone replacement.

Conclusions

In the setting of inconsistent data on the benefits of GH therapy, treatment of AO-GHD remains an individualized decision. There is a need for more randomized, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the long-term outcomes of GH therapy in adults with hypopituitarism.

### Diagnosis and management of growth hormone deficiency in adults [^113f73WW]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

In adults, GHD is a clinical syndrome that occurs in patients with pituitary or hypothalamic disease. It may be asymptomatic or present with relatively nonspecific constitutional symptoms. Most patients have abnormal body composition, consisting of increased fat mass and decreased lean mass. Life expectancy is significantly decreased in hypopituitary patients with GHD, with cardiovascular disease a common cause of death. Treatment with growth hormone reverses abnormalities in body composition and may reduce cardiovascular risk factors; however, the long-term treatment outcomes regarding mortality, the incidence of cardiovascular disease, bone fractures, tumor development, and recurrence are not known. Longer prospective clinical studies are needed. The major manufacturers of growth hormone have initiated postmarketing surveillance databases to monitor the safety of growth hormone treatment.

### Evaluation and treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115ibzWM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone therapy in adults — All growth hormone (GH) in clinical use is biosynthetic human GH with a biopotency of 3 IU/mg, using the World Health Organization reference preparation 88/624, and GH treatment of GH-deficient adults has been approved since 1996. GH is currently approved by regulatory agencies for treatment of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in children and also for short stature due to causes other than GHD, while GH treatment has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an antiaging treatment. Although treatment appears to be safe overall, certain areas continue to require long-term surveillance, and benefits of GH treatment of GH-deficient adults have been found in body composition, bone health, cardiovascular risk factors, and quality of life; however, reductions in cardiovascular events and mortality have yet to be demonstrated, the decision to treat adults with GHD requires a thoughtful and individualized evaluation of the benefits and risks, and periodic reevaluation of treatment is warranted.

The transition through adolescence into adult life is fraught with physical, psychological, and social issues, even for the individual without underlying medical conditions. For the patient with childhood-onset growth hormone deficiency, this transition represents a critical phase, as an increasing body of evidence supports the concept that growth hormone treatment should be continued throughout adult life. Major issues include the need for confirmation of the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency, the appropriate dosage of growth hormone during the transitional phase, dose titration during treatment, monitoring of therapeutic benefit and potential adverse effects, and optimization of compliance.

### Diagnosis and treatment of growth hormone deficiency in adults [^117KRX2h]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

The availability of synthetic recombinant human growth hormone (GH) in potentially unlimited quantities since the 1980s has improved understanding of the many nonstatural effects of GH on metabolism, body composition, physical and psychological function, as well as the consequences of GH deficiency in adult life. Adult GH deficiency is now recognized as a distinct if nonspecific syndrome with considerable adverse health consequences. GH replacement therapy in lower doses than those used in children can reverse many of these abnormalities and restore functional capacities toward or even to normal; if dosed appropriately, GH therapy has few adverse effects. Although some doubts remain about possible long-term risks of childhood GH therapy, most registries of adult GH replacement therapy, albeit limited in study size and duration, have not shown an increased incidence of cancers or of cardiovascular morbidity or mortality.

Objective

The aim was to update The Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline on Evaluation and Treatment of Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) previously published in 2006.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions through a series of conference calls and e-mails. An initial draft was prepared by the Task Force, with the help of a medical writer, and reviewed and commented on by members of The Endocrine Society. A second draft was reviewed and approved by The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated substantive changes.

Conclusions

GHD can persist from childhood or be newly acquired. Confirmation through stimulation testing is usually required unless there is a proven genetic/structural lesion persistent from childhood. GH therapy offers benefits in body composition, exercise capacity, skeletal integrity, and quality of life measures and is most likely to benefit those patients who have more severe GHD. The risks associated with GH treatment are low. GH dosing regimens should be individualized. The final decision to treat adults with GHD requires thoughtful clinical judgment with a careful evaluation of the benefits and risks specific to the individual.

### Effects of adult growth hormone deficiency and replacement therapy on the cardiometabolic risk profile [^1139AiPn]. Pituitary (2022). Medium credibility.

Adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) is considered a rare endocrine disorder involving patients with childhood-onset and adult-onset growth hormone deficiency (AoGHD) and characterized by adverse cardiometabolic risk profile. Besides traditional cardiovascular risk factors, endothelial dysfunction, low-grade inflammation, impaired adipokine profile, oxidative stress and hypovitaminosis D may also contribute to the development of premature atherosclerosis and higher cardiovascular risk in patients with AGHD. Growth hormone replacement has been proved to exert beneficial effects on several cardiovascular risk factors, but it is also apparent that hormone substitution in itself does not eliminate all cardiometabolic abnormalities associated with the disease. Novel biomarkers and diagnostic techniques discussed in this review may help to evaluate individual cardiovascular risk and identify patients with adverse cardiometabolic risk profile. In the absence of disease-specific guidelines detailing how to assess the cardiovascular status of these patients, we generally recommend close follow-up of the cardiovascular status as well as low threshold for a more detailed evaluation.

### Long-term safety of growth hormone in adults with growth hormone deficiency: overview of 15 809 GH-treated patients [^111rQQjP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) observed in adults either presents in childhood and persists into adulthood (childhood-onset GHD [CO-GHD]) or arises in adulthood (adult-onset GHD [AO-GHD]). Based on postmarketing surveillance studies, GHD in adults is most frequently caused by hypothalamic/pituitary lesions, often due to a pituitary adenoma or its associated treatments by surgery or radiotherapy. Adult GHD is linked to a wide spectrum of clinical features, including abnormal body composition, reduced bone mineral density, decreased muscle strength and exercise capacity, unfavorable metabolic profile, and impaired physiological well-being and quality of life. As symptoms of GHD in adults are nonspecific and secretion of growth hormone (GH) is pulsatile, biochemical tests measuring peak GH levels in response to GH simulation are usually needed to confirm GHD. Data from some studies also suggest that hypopituitary patients with untreated GHD may be predisposed to decreased life expectancy due to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, although an association between GHD and increased mortality has not been definitively proven.

### Adult growth hormone deficiency: current trends in diagnosis and dosing [^113y8MfZ]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Only approximately 20% of adults with GH deficiency (GHD) have a history of childhood-onset GHD; the remainder acquire GHD in adult life, usually through acquired damage to the pituitary-hypothalamic region. Diagnosis of GHD in adults is more difficult than in children and is made first from the clinical context, reinforced by signs and symptoms, and then confirmed by biochemical testing. The signs and symptoms, however, including altered body composition, reduced energy, and mild depression, are too common to have diagnostic value without a suggestive clinical context. Furthermore, biochemical tests for GH or IGF-I levels are imperfect, characterized by significant false-positive and -negative rates. GH dosing in adults has shifted to an individualized dose-titration approach, in which treatment is begun at a fixed dose and then titrated upward until IGF-I levels normalize, significant side effects develop, or beneficial effects plateau. Generally, women require higher GH doses than do men. Reflecting age-related differences in normal GH secretion, GH doses may be higher in young adults and lower in older patients.

### Growth hormone deficiency in the adult [^1161qcX6]. Pituitary (2006). Low credibility.

Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults may be of either adult or childhood onset and may occur as isolated GHD or as multiple hormone deficiencies. Adult-onset GHD (AoGHD) usually results from damage to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus. GH is frequently undetectable in normal subjects and thus GHD cannot be distinguished from the normal state using a single random GH measurement. In general, a stimulation test is required to recognize GHD. Insulin tolerance test (ITT) has been considered the gold standard by the most important scientific societies, although alternative tests, in particular GHRH plus arginine have been proposed as valuable alternative to ITT. The clinical syndrome associated with AoGHD is characterized by a wide array of symptoms and important chronic complications, such as cardiovascular complications, which may be responsible for an increased mortality. The rationale for GH replacement in adults GHD patients is justified by the beneficial effects on some clinical end-points, such as quality of life (QoL) and cardiovascular risk factors, whereas the effects on mortality risk are still controversial. Over the recent years, guidelines on the use of rhGH as a substitution treatment in adult hypopituitarism have been issued by international (Growth hormone research society-GRS, Endocrine Society) and relevant national (National Institute of Clinical Excellence-UK, NICE) institutions. The aim of the paper is to review and discuss these guidelines.

### Growth hormone therapy for adults: not ready for prime time? [^113SgZAm]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Human growth hormone is now readily available and approved for treatment of the growth hormone deficiency syndrome in adults. However, physicians have been slow to adopt this therapeutic modality. Reasons for skepticism about the use of growth hormone for the growth hormone deficiency syndrome include doubts about whether growth hormone deficiency causes increased morbidity and mortality in patients with hypopituitarism; availability of highly efficacious, easier to use, and less expensive agents for certain aspects of the growth hormone deficiency syndrome, especially cardiovascular disease; and concerns about possible toxicity in adults. Long-term studies in patients receiving appropriate comprehensive management for other hormonal deficiencies and for concomitant abnormalities will be required to convince physicians of the utility and safety of growth hormone replacement therapy.

### Efficacy and safety of growth hormone treatment in adults with growth hormone deficiency: a systematic review of studies on morbidity [^1153xVC6]. Clinical Endocrinology (2014). Low credibility.

Due to the positive effects demonstrated in randomized clinical trials on cardiovascular surrogate markers and bone metabolism, a positive effect of growth hormone (GH) treatment on clinically relevant end-points seems feasible. In this review, we discuss the long-term efficacy and safety of GH treatment in adult patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) with emphasis on morbidity: fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke, fractures, fatal and nonfatal malignancies and recurrences, and diabetes mellitus. A positive effect of GH treatment on CVD and fracture risk could be concluded, but study design limitations have to be considered. Stroke and secondary brain tumours remained more prevalent. However, other contributing factors have to be taken into account. Regrowth and recurrences of (peri)pituitary tumours were not increased in patients with GH treatment compared to similar patients without GH treatment. All fatal and nonfatal malignancies were not more prevalent in GH-treated adults compared to the general population. However, follow-up time is still relatively short. The studies on diabetes are difficult to interpret, and more evidence is awaited. In clinical practice, a more individualized assessment seems appropriate, taking into consideration the underlying diagnosis of GHD, other treatment regimens, metabolic profile and the additional beneficial effects of GH set against the possible risks. Large and thoroughly conducted observational studies are needed and seem the only feasible way to inform the ongoing debate on health care costs, drug safety and clinical outcomes.

Adult GHD testing — indications, exceptions, and retesting timing: Because symptoms are nonspecific, clinicians should perform a comprehensive evaluation, including performing GH–stimulation testing in patients with a reasonable probability of GHD and with intent to initiate rhGH if confirmed. An exception is that GH–stimulation testing is not required in certain patients meeting high-specificity criteria, including organic hypothalamic-pituitary disease with low serum IGF-1 levels (< −2.0 SDS), for whom the probability of documenting GHD on stimulation testing is > 95%, as well as patients with genetic defects and those with hypothalamic-pituitary structural brain defects. In transition patients with idiopathic IGHD and specified risk features, retesting for GHD should be performed after at least 1 month following discontinuation of rhGH therapy. The number of GH–stimulation tests needed in transition patients is dependent on the level of the clinician's suspicion.

Diagnosis of GHD — because clinical features are nonspecific, a workup for GH deficiency should not be undertaken except in the context of "probable cause" — either a childhood history of GHD or a clinical context making GHD likely. We recommend that the ITT and the GHRH-arginine test have sufficient sensitivity and specificity to establish the diagnosis of GHD, but in those with clearly established recent (within 10 yr) hypothalamic causes of suspected GHD, e.g. irradiation, testing with GHRH-arginine may be misleading (1⊕⊕⊕⊕).

Adult growth hormone deficiency — consequences and benefits of treatment are summarized as follows: We recommend that GH therapy of GH-deficient adults offers significant clinical benefits in body composition and exercise capacity. We suggest that GH therapy of GH-deficient adults offers significant clinical benefits in skeletal integrity. We recommend after documentation of persistent GHD that GH therapy be continued after completion of adult height to obtain full skeletal/muscle maturation during the transition period. We suggest that GH therapy of GH-deficient adults improves several cardiovascular surrogate outcomes, including endothelial function, inflammatory cardiovascular biomarkers, lipoprotein metabolism, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), and aspects of myocardial function, but tends to increase insulin resistance. We suggest that, although mortality is increased in patients with hypopituitarism and GHD has been implicated in this, GH has not yet been shown to improve mortality. We suggest that GH therapy of GH-deficient adults improves the quality of life of most patients.

Adult growth hormone deficiency (GHD) diagnostic approach: The diagnosis is often challenging due to lack of a single biologic endpoint and age-related physiologic declines in GH levels that must be differentiated from pathologic GHD. Because GH secretion is episodic and modified by age, gender, and BMI, and serum IGF-I can be lowered by comorbidities, random serum GH and IGF-I levels cannot be used alone and GH–stimulation tests may be performed to establish the diagnosis in most patients, with exceptions for subpopulations with organic hypothalamic–pituitary disease such as a suprasellar mass with previous surgery and cranial irradiation who have MPHD.

Definition of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in adults and retesting recommendation — Adults with GHD can be grouped into those who had prior childhood GHD, those who acquire GHD secondary to structural lesions or trauma, and those with idiopathic GHD, and childhood GHD is generally further divided into those with organic causes and those in whom the cause is not known. We recommend that patients with childhood-onset GHD who are candidates for GH therapy after achievement of adult height be retested for GHD as adults unless they have known mutations, embryopathic lesions causing multiple hormone deficits, or irreversible structural lesions/damage. Supporting evidence notes that mutations in early-appearing transcription factors tend to cause multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (MPHD), whereas others can cause isolated deficiencies; Four types of Mendelian disorders of the GH gene have been described, and isolated GHD (IGHD) IA and IB are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner resulting in undetectable or very low GH levels, IGHD II is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with variable clinical severity, and IGHD III is an X-linked disorder often associated with hypogammaglobulinemia; GHD has also been reported due to mutations of the gene encoding the GHRH receptor, mutations in the GSa gene leading to GHRH resistance, and mutations in the gene for the GH secretagogue receptor; GHD is occasionally associated with congenital anatomical changes in the pituitary region or other structures of the brain, and congenital GHD is often associated with hypothalamic-stalk-pituitary anatomical abnormalities in which the posterior pituitary may appear "ectopically" located adjacent to the hypothalamus.

Regarding medical management for adult growth hormone deficiency, more specifically with respect to GH therapy, monitoring, AACE/ACE 2019 guidelines recommend to recognize that treatment-related side effects are mainly related to fluid retention effects and are typically seen during initiation and dose escalation of recombinant human GH and generally respond to dose reductions or cessation of therapy. Initiate lower doses of recombinant human GH in patients with obesity and in older patients generally being more susceptible to the side effects of recombinant human GH replacement.

Aging and phenotype differences in CO-GHD versus AO-GHD — Endogenous GH secretion declines with age, making differentiation from normal aging difficult and creating the need to use GH–stimulation tests in most patients with adoption of appropriate GH cut-points; compared with AO-GHD, adults with CO-GHD tend to have lower BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, serum IGF-1 levels, and poorer social outcomes, and CO-GHD due to organic hypothalamic-pituitary disease is associated with more severe long-term consequences, particularly decreased muscle mass, bone mineral density (BMD), and cardiac function.

Adult growth hormone deficiency — diagnostic evaluation includes the following guidance: We suggest that when GHRH is not available and performance of an ITT is either contraindicated or not practical in a given patient, the glucagon stimulation test can be used to diagnose GHD. We recommend that because of the irreversible nature of the cause of the GHD in children with structural lesions with multiple hormone deficiencies and those with proven genetic causes, a low IGF-I level at least 1 month off GH therapy is sufficient documentation of persistent GHD without additional provocative testing. We recommend that a normal IGF-I level does not exclude the diagnosis of GHD but makes provocative testing mandatory to make the diagnosis of GHD. We recommend that the presence of deficiencies in three or more pituitary axes strongly suggests the presence of GHD, and in this context provocative testing is optional.

### Effects of adult growth hormone deficiency and replacement therapy on the cardiometabolic risk profile [^112aDF2s]. Pituitary (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) is a distinct clinical syndrome affecting 200–300 people per million of the population. The disease is characterized by reduced quality of life (QoL) and physical performance, osteoporosis and a coexistence of several cardiovascular risk factors including visceral obesity, adverse lipid profile, endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance which together with other factors contribute to the higher rates of vascular events as well as excess mortality in hypopituitarism. Extensive research of the past decades has shown that AGHD is associated with a low-grade inflammation, oxidative damage, thrombotic tendency, impaired adipokine profile, subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and high prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Growth hormone replacement therapy (GHRT) is now considered a safe treatment with beneficial effects on several cardiovascular risk factors, regardless of the underlying cause of GHD. Even though the impact of growth hormone therapy on the cardiovascular mortality of hypopituitarism is still far from being fully elucidated, complex hormone replacement including GH substitution is suggested to result in a mortality that is close to normal. Despite GHRT has been available for more than two decades, disparities regarding the management of AGHD are still substantial indicating that raising the awareness towards the deleterious consequences of the disease as well as the effects of replacement therapy may benefit the patients and may also benefit healthcare professionals.

The aim of this review is to deepen the understanding of the cardiovascular aspects of AGHD, to evaluate the effects of growth hormone replacement on the conventional and novel cardiovascular risk factors, to summarize possible modalities of cardiovascular assessment and to encourage further research in the field.

### Consequence of lifetime isolated growth hormone deficiency… [^1177AyFM]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Consequence of Lifetime Isolated Growth Hormone DeficiencyClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Growth hormone deficiency in adulthood has been associated with changes in body composition, in organ functions, in metabolic parameters linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and with reduced bone density. We have identified a very large homogeneous population of patients who have IGHD due to a homozygous mutation in the GHRH-receptor gene that resides in a rural area of Brazil. None of the adult dwarf patients has ever been treated with hGH replacement. This population represents a unique model to study the effect of isolated lifetime lack of GH.

We propose studies of physiological and metabolic parameters in subjects who are homozygous for this mutation and compare them with normal subjects residing in the same community. The primary goal of this proposal is to determine the consequences of life-long lack of GH on body composition, muscle strength, cardiovascular status, cardiovascular risk factors, thyroid status and bone density and metabolism, and to test which of these parameters are reversed by a 6-month course of GH replacement therapy. In addition, we want to test the hypothesis that heterozygosity for this GHRHR mutation causes a phenotype that may be intermediate between the one present in homozygous normal subjects and in homozygous affected GHD patients.

This is relevant because inactivating mutations in the GHRHR are being described with increasing frequency in populations of different genetic background, suggesting that individuals with faulty single GHRHR alleles may be present in significant numbers in the general population. SPECIFIC AIM 1: To study anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular and metabolic status and cardiovascular risk profile, including inflammatory markers of cardiovascular relevance, muscle strength, bone density and bone metabolism, and thyroid status of twenty GH-naïve adult GHD subjects who are homozygous for a null GHRHR mutation and to compare them with twenty age- and sex- matched normal controls from the same population. Together, these studies will determine the effect of lifetime absence of GH on multiple organ functions and their response to hGH therapy, and will tell if heterozygosity for mutations in the GHRHR gene is associated with a detectable phenotype.

### FDA approves weekly therapy for adult growth hormone deficiency… [^1149hX6w]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Sogroya was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 300 patients with growth hormone deficiency who had never received growth hormone treatment or had stopped treatment with other growth hormone formulations at least three months before the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive injections of weekly Sogroya, weekly placebo, or daily somatropin, an FDA-approved growth hormone. The effectiveness of Sogroya was determined by the percentage change of truncal fat, the fat that is accumulated in the trunk or central area of the body that is regulated by growth hormone and can be associated with serious medical issues. At the end of the 34-week treatment period, truncal fat decreased by 1. 06%, on average, among patients taking weekly Sogroya while it increased among patients taking the placebo by
0. 47%. In the daily somatropin group, truncal fat decreased by 2. 23%.

Patients in the weekly Sogroya and daily somatropin groups had similar improvements in other clinical endpoints. The most common side effects of Sogroya include: back pain, joint paint, indigestion, a sleep disorder, dizziness, tonsillitis, swelling in the arms or lower legs, vomiting, adrenal insufficiency, hypertension, increase in blood creatine phosphokinase, weight increase, and anemia. Sogroya should not be administered to patients with a history of hypersensitivity to the drug. Sogroya should also not be used in patients with active malignancy, any stage of diabetic eye disease in which high blood sugar levels cause damage to blood vessels in the retina, acute critical illness, or those with acute respiratory failure, because of the increased risk of mortality with use of pharmacologic doses of Sogroya in critically ill patients without growth hormone deficiency.

Health care providers should perform an eye examination before starting Sogroya, and periodically thereafter, to exclude pre-existing papilledema. Papilledema may be a symptom of intracranial hypertension. Growth hormones may induce or worsen pre-existing intracranial hypertension. FDA granted the approval to Novo Nordisk, Inc.

### The glucagon stimulation test for evaluation of adult growth hormone deficiency and adrenocorticotropic axis (GST) [^115wJK69]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Study Overview Growth hormone is a protein that is produced by the pituitary gland and influences the metabolism of other proteins, carbohydrates, and fats in the body. This allows the growth hormone to help humans keep a healthy balance between fat, muscle and bone throughout their life. Some people have what is called Growth Hormone Deficiency, which means that they do not produce enough growth hormone. GHD may lead to a tendency to be fat, a reduced ability to exercise, heart disease, an increased possibility of breaking bones, and a general reduced quality of life. There are side effects of the ITT including hypoglycemia which can be unpleasant. ITT can not be performed in patients older than 65 years of age and in those with certain medical conditions such as history of heart disease, seizure disorder or stroke.

At the same time, the ITT needs to be done by an experienced clinician and requires trained staff to perform. For this reason there is a need for an alternative reliable test for evaluation of GHD. Glucagon is readily available, relatively inexpensive and generally well tolerated; the major side effects include upset stomach that can lead to vomiting and headaches. It can be used in patients with diabetes and those older than 65 years of age.

### Are we ready for growth hormone therapy in adults? [^113Q1rkG]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Human growth hormone is now readily available, thanks to recombinant DNA technology. Growth hormone therapy is being advocated by some physicians for adults with growth deficiency. To determine the validity of this treatment, the following four questions must be addressed: Does a growth hormone deficiency syndrome in adults exist. Does growth hormone deficiency actually cause the signs and symptoms of this syndrome. Is growth hormone safe and does it reduce morbidity and mortality from this syndrome. Is growth hormone treatment cost-effective. Isley reviewed the current knowledge about growth hormone deficiency syndrome in adults and offers thoughts about the questions involved in adult therapy. Hypopituitarism has been associated with increased mortality, especially from cardiovascular disease. Patients with growth hormone deficiency syndrome generally have increased fat mass and decreased lean body mass.

Insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and other factors associated with increased atherogenesis have also been associated with this syndrome. Thus, a clinical growth hormone deficiency syndrome does seem to exist. It is less clear whether this syndrome is specifically due to growth hormone deficiency or results from hypopituitarism generally. Other hormonal deficiencies and hormone replacement issues may have an impact on this syndrome and increased resultant mortality. Overtreatment of multiple hormonal imbalances can cause central obesity and atherogenic and metabolic abnormalities. It is premature to conclude that growth hormone deficiency alone is responsible for growth hormone deficiency syndrome. The author concludes that although growth hormone deficiency syndrome probably exists, it is uncertain that growth hormone deficiency is primarily the cause of the syndrome.

Further studies are needed to determine the safety of treatment and whether more cost-effective approaches to the treatment of this syndrome can be identified. In a related article in the same journal, Cook discusses the positive value of growth hormone treatment for hypopituitarism in improving bone density and the immune system, enhancing quality of life, and improving exercise tolerance. Effort on the part of the physician is required to determine testing, dosing, and monitoring guidelines for growth hormone therapy. In an editorial in the same journal, Frohman points out some of the remaining questions and encourages further long-term research on the efficacy of growth hormone supplementation in reducing morbidity and mortality. He concludes that growth hormone therapy is probably indicated for use in patients with severe growth hormone deficiency, but other treatments may initially be more appropriate for use in patients with less severe signs and symptoms.
