## Question

Pathophysiology of persecutory delusions in very late onset psychosis vs neurocognitive disorders; role of antipsychotics in tx of both

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pathophysiology and treatment of persecutory delusions in very late-onset psychosis compared with neurocognitive disorders, including the role of antipsychotics in both [^116JD6U2] [^113tvv4f] [^111Sq3WX].

> Let's break this down step-by-step, and let me outline my approach before I proceed: First, I need to define the clinical entities, including very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP) and psychosis associated with neurocognitive disorders, to ensure we are anchoring the comparison in precise diagnostic constructs; then, I should review neurochemical and structural mechanisms that plausibly generate persecutory delusions in each condition; next, I need to examine epidemiology, risk factors, and temporal evolution, especially the conversion risk from VLOSLP to dementia; after that, I will appraise antipsychotic treatment evidence and safety for VLOSLP versus dementia-related psychosis; finally, I will synthesize a practical diagnostic and treatment workflow, while double-checking all steps against guideline-level recommendations and the cited trials to avoid overreach [^116JD6U2] [^113tvv4f] [^111yGJvB].

> Let me first confirm the key definitions and core clinical profiles so I do not jump to conclusions: VLOSLP is defined by onset of non-affective psychotic symptoms, typically delusions and/or hallucinations, at age 60 years or older, without dementia or other neurodegenerative disease at presentation, and it is the third most common group in older adult mental health services after dementia and depression, with a female-predominant incidence of approximately 27 per 100,000 men and 48 per 100,000 women and core presentations centered on persecutory delusions with or without multimodal hallucinations and a persistent, burdensome course [^116JD6U2].

> Next, I should review the contrasting psychosis phenotypes in neurocognitive disorders to contextualize persecutory content and associated features: in Alzheimer's disease, paranoid ideation and somatic preoccupations are common; in dementia with Lewy bodies, misidentification delusions and complex visual hallucinations are frequent and can predate dementia diagnosis by years; in frontotemporal dementia, paranoid ideas occur but behavioral dyscontrol and language phenotypes often dominate the early picture, which matters when persecutory delusions are under consideration as a leading symptom in late life [^113tvv4f] [^111Sq3WX] [^111eHUnW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to mechanistic assumptions before we clarify neurochemical models of delusion formation: for VLOSLP conceptualized as functional psychosis, dopamine dysregulation driving aberrant salience remains a leading explanatory framework, wherein dysregulated midbrain dopaminergic firing interacts with reasoning biases to generate high-conviction persecutory beliefs, consistent with phenomenological accounts of loss of contextualization at delusion onset, while historically VLOSLP has been considered non-neurodegenerative at the outset, even as this boundary has become increasingly blurred by later conversion data [^1124mWE8] [^115tDz9c] [^116JD6U2].

> I need to check the corresponding mechanistic anchors for neurocognitive disorders to prevent conflating primary psychosis with secondary psychosis due to proteinopathy: in DLB, alpha-synuclein pathology with secondary dopaminergic changes contributes to psychosis, and dopaminergic therapy can exacerbate delusions; in AD, amyloid-tau pathology is primary and the ApoE ε4 allele has been specifically associated with increased delusion risk; in FTD, tau or TDP-43 pathology disrupts frontotemporal circuits, highlighting that persecutory delusions in NCDs are typically downstream expressions of neurodegeneration rather than primary dopaminergic dysregulation per se [^1146jgJ8] [^115Q7kbP] [^111eHUnW].

> Let me now examine structural brain correlates to see if there are anatomy-level clues that refine the differential: in VLOSLP, voxel-based morphometry demonstrates gray matter reductions in the thalamus, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left insula, with thalamic volumes correlating with memory function, and meta-analytic work suggests later-onset hallucinations may track a more neurodegenerative pattern with occipital, medial temporal, and thalamic changes, whereas in NCDs, early medial temporal atrophy characterizes AD, frontal/anterior temporal degeneration typifies FTD, and relative sparing of medial temporal structures early in DLB helps orient the differential when psychosis is prominent [^112UDmMo] [^114emNLe] [^111eHUnW].

> Before I proceed, I should double-check risk factor patterns that might cue the clinician toward VLOSLP versus NCD psychosis when persecutory delusions are central: VLOSLP shows female predominance, strong associations with sensory impairment and migrant status, and lacks a clear familial genetic signal, whereas NCD psychosis risk is largely age and neuropathology driven with disease-specific genetics such as ApoE ε4 for AD, and persecutory content in AD and DLB is often embedded within broader cognitive and perceptual changes rather than standing alone as an isolated late-life delusional syndrome [^116JD6U2] [^115Q7kbP] [^113tvv4f].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should verify the longitudinal overlap, because this is where misclassification risk is high: large population-based data show VLOSLP is associated with substantially elevated incident dementia risk, with hazard ratios persisting even after washout and ascertainment adjustments, and several cohorts link shorter psychosis-to-dementia intervals to a prodromal neurodegenerative process; moreover, in cohorts of very late-onset psychosis, the presence of two or more core DLB features or early, complex visual hallucinations at psychosis onset predicts progression to DLB with specificity exceeding 80 percent, arguing that a meaningful fraction of VLOSLP presentations are actually prodromal NCD [^115UbSLq] [^112XqdkB] [^111YpMQJ] [^112L7fc4].

> Let me reconsider phenomenology to refine persecutory delusion profiling in late life: late-onset schizophrenia cohorts show more severe systematic persecutory delusions and fewer negative symptoms than earlier-onset schizophrenia, while in DLB misidentification delusions and Capgras occur alongside multimodal or complex visual hallucinations and fluctuating cognition, and in AD persecutory and theft delusions are common but often ride with progressive mnemonic and spatial impairments, so persecutory content alone cannot adjudicate etiology without attention to the surrounding syndrome and its tempo [^113Bs7xA] [^1146jgJ8] [^113tvv4f].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic pathway with explicit exclusion of secondary causes to avoid premature treatment decisions: in late-life psychosis, primary psychosis is a diagnosis of exclusion and up to 60 percent of new-onset psychosis is secondary, so I need to systematically evaluate the "six D's" (delirium, disease, drugs, dementia, depression, delusions), obtain thorough history and mental/physical exams, and follow guideline-based initial assessment steps before labeling VLOSLP or NCD psychosis, especially when persecutory delusions dominate the presentation [^112yVCMB] [^111yGJvB].

> I should confirm pretreatment medical safety steps because older adults have higher cardiometabolic and conduction risks: pretreatment labs including electrolytes and liver function tests and an ECG are recommended to screen for conduction disease and QTc risk, with preference for lower arrhythmogenesis antipsychotics when feasible, and baseline cardiovascular risk screening should be routine given the interaction of illness, age, and medication effects in this population [^116jjxXy] [^112LfKJB].

> Now, I will examine treatment efficacy for VLOSLP specifically, but I need to be careful with dosing assumptions in the elderly: the ATLAS randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that amisulpride 100 mg/day produced significant reductions in psychosis symptoms over 12 and 24 weeks with sustained benefit despite suboptimal adherence, providing the first high-quality efficacy signal for antipsychotic treatment in VLOSLP and supporting a low-dose strategy tailored to late-life pharmacodynamics [^1142c4db] [^116udGfS] [^116JD6U2].

> Hold on, I should verify tolerability and mechanistic dosing considerations rather than extrapolate from early-onset schizophrenia: in ATLAS, discontinuation for side effects was similar to placebo, though extrapyramidal symptoms were modestly increased even at 100 mg/day, and pharmacodynamic data suggest older adults may have higher dopaminergic receptor occupancy at lower doses, implying that higher doses would disproportionately raise EPS, mobility, and complication risk in this age group, which reinforces using the minimum effective dose with close monitoring [^1142c4db] [^115Qng7X].

> I will now examine the role of antipsychotics in dementia-related psychosis, but I should proceed cautiously: in DLB, antipsychotics can cause severe sensitivity reactions with increased morbidity and mortality, and early recognition of psychiatric-onset DLB is crucial precisely to avoid harmful antipsychotic exposure; in general late-life psychosis care, non-pharmacological strategies are first-line for dementia-related behavioral and psychotic symptoms, and in Parkinson disease, minor hallucinations or delusions that are well tolerated should often be observed rather than medicated, reflecting a conservative risk–benefit calculus in neurodegenerative contexts [^1146jgJ8] [^111Sq3WX] [^112yVCMB] [^112Yu8fN].

> But wait, I initially thought there were multiple robust randomized trials specifically for dementia-related psychosis paralleling ATLAS; let me verify and correct that impression: within the provided sources, there are no equivalent RCTs demonstrating clear antipsychotic efficacy for dementia-related psychosis that match the design and signal of ATLAS in VLOSLP, which underscores why guidelines emphasize non-pharmacological measures and extreme caution with antipsychotics in DLB and related syndromes, even if clinical practice sometimes resorts to off-label use out of necessity [^113tvv4f] [^112yVCMB] [^1146jgJ8].

> Putting this together into a practical workflow for persecutory delusions in late life, I need to ensure each decision node is evidence-linked: first, screen rigorously for secondary causes and early neurodegenerative features such as visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and cognitive fluctuations; second, if VLOSLP is likely with no cognitive impairment and no red flags for DLB, consider low-dose amisulpride 100 mg/day with close EPS and metabolic monitoring; third, if NCD features are present or suspected, prioritize environmental and psychosocial strategies, caregiver education, and avoid antipsychotics where possible, especially in DLB, while applying Parkinson and dementia care principles that favor non-pharmacological management and watchful waiting for tolerable symptoms; throughout, obtain baseline labs and ECG, monitor cardiovascular risk, and counsel regarding heightened future dementia risk and the need for longitudinal cognitive follow-up [^111yGJvB] [^116jjxXy] [^1142c4db] [^111Sq3WX] [^112Yu8fN] [^115UbSLq] [^112XqdkB].

> Finally, I should double-check that the overarching conceptual takeaway remains consistent with the data: persecutory delusions in VLOSLP often reflect a functional psychosis with dopaminergic aberrant salience mechanisms and respond to carefully dosed antipsychotics, yet a substantial subset represent an at-risk prodromal neurodegenerative state, particularly DLB or AD, where antipsychotic harm can outweigh benefit, meaning that the clinician must continually re-evaluate for emergent cognitive and parkinsonian features over time and recalibrate the treatment plan accordingly [^1124mWE8] [^115tDz9c] [^1142c4db] [^112L7fc4] [^115UbSLq].

Persecutory delusions in very late-onset psychosis (VLOP) are largely driven by **dopamine dysregulation and reasoning biases** (e.g. jumping to conclusions, personalizing attributions) [^1124mWE8] [^115tDz9c]. In contrast, delusions in neurocognitive disorders (NCDs) arise from **neurodegeneration and neurotransmitter loss** (cholinergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic) and are often accompanied by misidentification and visual hallucinations [^113tvv4f] [^1146jgJ8] [^111eHUnW]. Antipsychotics are effective and generally well tolerated at low doses in VLOP (e.g. amisulpride 100 mg/day) [^1142c4db] [^116JD6U2]. In NCDs, they offer modest benefit but carry higher risks (e.g. mortality, cerebrovascular events), so **use the lowest effective dose and monitor closely**.

## Pathophysiology of persecutory delusions in very late-onset psychosis

### Neurobiological mechanisms

- **Dopamine dysregulation**: Aberrant salience from midbrain dopamine dysregulation underpins delusion formation in VLOP [^1124mWE8].

- **Structural brain changes**: Thalamic, inferior frontal, and insular atrophy correlate with cognitive deficits and delusions in VLOP.

- **Neurodevelopmental factors**: Subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities may predispose to late-onset psychosis [^1151jU6n].

---

### Cognitive and emotional processes

In very late-onset psychosis, **reasoning biases** — jumping to conclusions and personalizing attributions — maintain persecutory delusions [^116pR5Sb], while **emotional dysregulation** — including anxiety, depression, and worry — amplifies threat perception and delusional conviction [^1112gJ8U] [^114MFYH2].

---

## Pathophysiology of persecutory delusions in neurocognitive disorders

### Neurobiological mechanisms

- **Neurodegeneration**: Progressive cortical and subcortical degeneration (e.g. temporal, parietal, frontal) drives delusions in NCDs [^113tvv4f] [^111eHUnW].

- **Neurotransmitter deficits**: Cholinergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic losses contribute to psychosis in NCDs [^1146jgJ8].

- **Genetic factors**: APOE ε4 increases delusion risk in Alzheimer's disease [^115Q7kbP].

---

### Cognitive and emotional processes

In NCDs, **cognitive impairment** — with memory, executive, and visuospatial deficits — fosters misinterpretation and delusions [^113tvv4f], while **emotional dysregulation** — including anxiety, depression, and agitation — often co-occurs with delusions [^113tvv4f].

## Comparative summary of pathophysiological mechanisms

| **Mechanism** | **Very late-onset psychosis** | **Neurocognitive disorders** |
|-|-|-|
| Neurotransmitter dysfunction | Dopamine dysregulation [^1124mWE8] | Cholinergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic deficits [^1146jgJ8] |
| Structural brain changes | Thalamic, frontal, insular atrophy [^112UDmMo] | Widespread cortical and subcortical degeneration [^113tvv4f] |
| Cognitive impairment | Reasoning biases, mild cognitive deficits [^116pR5Sb] | Severe memory, executive, visuospatial deficits [^113tvv4f] |
| Emotional dysregulation | Anxiety, depression, worry [^1112gJ8U] | Anxiety, depression, agitation [^113tvv4f] |
| Genetic factors | Limited evidence [^116JD6U2] | APOE ε4, other genetic risks [^115Q7kbP] |

## Role of antipsychotic medications in treatment

| **Attribute** | **Very late-onset psychosis** | **Neurocognitive disorders** |
|-|-|-|
| Efficacy | Low-dose antipsychotics (e.g. amisulpride 100 mg/day) reduce delusions and are generally well tolerated [^116JD6U2] [^1142c4db] | Antipsychotics have modest benefit for severe delusions and hallucinations [^1146jgJ8] [^112Yu8fN] |
| Risks | Monitor for extrapyramidal symptoms, metabolic effects, and cardiovascular events [^116JD6U2] [^112LfKJB] | Higher mortality, cerebrovascular events, and cognitive decline warrant cautious use [^1146jgJ8] [^112Yu8fN] |
| Clinical guidelines | Use the lowest effective dose with regular monitoring and psychosocial support | Reserve for severe distress or danger; use the lowest effective dose, monitor closely, and consider alternatives (e.g. cholinesterase inhibitors, psychosocial interventions) |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Differential diagnosis**: Distinguish VLOP from NCDs via cognitive testing, neuroimaging, and clinical course [^112yVCMB].

- **Individualized treatment**: Tailor antipsychotic use to diagnosis, symptom severity, and comorbidities [^111yGJvB].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess efficacy, side effects, and cognitive status [^116jjxXy].

- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Use psychosocial and cognitive strategies to reduce delusional distress and improve function [^111A7uWq].

---

Persecutory delusions in VLOP are driven by dopamine dysregulation and reasoning biases [^1124mWE8], whereas in NCDs they reflect neurodegeneration and neurotransmitter deficits [^113tvv4f]. Antipsychotics are effective in VLOP [^115Qng7X] but have limited benefit and higher risks in NCDs; therefore, **use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring** alongside adjunctive psychosocial care.

### The emerging biology of delusions [^1124mWE8]. Psychological Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

This article examines a model of how delusions may arise, not only in schizophrenia but also in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. It suggests that a combination of dysregulated dopamine release from ascending midbrain pathways and reasoning bias can contribute to the development of delusions. Negative symptoms may also be related to dopamine dysregulation, with the mix of positive and negative symptoms depending on the specific degree of dopamine dysregulation in particular mesocorticolimbic circuits. The article examines evidence supporting this model and describes predictions that arise from it.

### Psychosis in neurodegenerative dementias: A systematic comparative review [^113tvv4f]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

Psychosis, characterized by delusions and/or hallucinations, is frequently observed during the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative dementias (ND), such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These symptoms cause diagnostic and management difficulties.

- **Objective**: This review aims to present a concise and up-to-date overview of psychotic symptoms that occur in patients with ND using a comparative approach.

- **Methods**: A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. A total of 98 original studies investigating psychosis phenotypes in neurodegenerative dementias were identified, including 40 cohort studies and 57 case reports.

- **Results**: Psychosis is a frequently observed phenomenon during the course of ND, with reported prevalence ranging from 22.5% to 54.1% in AD, 55.9% to 73.9% in DLB, and 18% to 42% in FTD. Noticeable patterns emerge throughout all stages of these diseases, depending on their underlying causes. Misidentification delusions (16.6–78.3%) and visual hallucinations (50–69.6%) are frequently observed in DLB, while paranoid ideas and somatic preoccupations seem to be particularly common in AD and FTD, at 9.1–60.3% and 3.10–41.5%, respectively. Limited data were found regarding psychosis in the early stages of these disorders.

- **Conclusions**: Literature data suggest that different ND are associated with noticeable variations in psychotic phenotypes, reflecting disease-specific tendencies. Further studies focusing on the early stages of these disorders are necessary to enhance our understanding of early psychotic symptoms.

### Antipsychotic treatment of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (ATLAS): A randomised, controlled, double-blind trial [^116JD6U2]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

The onset of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis most commonly occurs in late adolescence or early adult life. However, a late-onset variant, aged 60 years or older, of non-affective functional psychosis without dementia has long been recognized and is classified as very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. After dementia and depression, very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis constitutes the largest diagnostic group seen by older people's mental health services, with a reported annual incidence of 27 per 100,000 men and 48 per 100,000 women. Risk factors include female sex, increasing age, sensory impairment, and migrant status. In contrast to schizophrenia, genetic factors have not been implicated in the etiology of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. Older individuals with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis typically present with positive psychosis symptoms, such as persecutory delusions with or without multimodal hallucinations. These symptoms are distressing, persist for many years, and are associated with increased risks of social dysfunction, institutionalization, and death.

- **Research in context**:
	- **Evidence before this study**: We searched PubMed and the Cochrane database on January 13, 2017, for relevant articles, using the search terms "late-onset schizophrenia", "very late-onset schizophrenia-like", "clinical trial", and "treatment", with no date or language restrictions. We did not find any randomized, controlled, double-blind trials in this patient group with onset of a schizophrenia-like illness at age 60 years or older. Available evidence for the use of antipsychotics in this population remains limited.

### Why do bad things happen to me? Attributional style, depressed mood, and persecutory delusions in patients with schizophrenia [^116pR5Sb]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Theoretical models postulate an important role of attributional style (AS) in the formation and maintenance of persecutory delusions and other positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, research has gathered conflicting findings. In a cross-sectional design, patients with persistent positive symptoms of schizophrenia (n = 258) and healthy controls (n = 51) completed a revised version of the Internal, Personal and Situational Attributions Questionnaire (IPSAQ-R) and assessments of psychopathology. In comparison to controls, neither patients with schizophrenia in general nor patients with persecutory delusions (n = 142) in particular presented an externalizing and personalizing AS. Rather, both groups showed a "self-blaming" AS and attributed negative events more toward themselves.

Persecutory delusions were independently predicted by a personalizing bias for negative events (beta = 0.197, P = .001) and by depression (beta = 0.152, P = .013), but only 5% of the variance in persecutory delusions could be explained. Cluster analysis of IPSAQ-R scores identified a "personalizing" (n = 70) and a "self-blaming" subgroup (n = 188), with the former showing slightly more pronounced persecutory delusions (P = .021). Results indicate that patients with schizophrenia and patients with persecutory delusions both mostly blamed themselves for negative events. Nevertheless, a subgroup of patients could still be identified who presented a more pronounced personalizing bias and more severe persecutory delusions. Thus, AS in patients with schizophrenia might be less stable but more delineated over time.

### Psychosis as a treatment target in dementia: A roadmap for designing interventions [^1146jgJ8]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

In Lewy body disease (LBD) syndromes, psychosis is usually more intense than in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hallucinations may be present in more than 80% of patients, while systematized delusions might affect up to 55%. Dopaminergic therapy may increase these numbers, particularly regarding delusional jealousy. The prevalence of delusions and hallucinations tends to be dissociated; in AD, delusions are more common than hallucinations, whereas in LBD, hallucinations are more common. Pareidolia is not unusual in LBD syndromes; however, one study showed that multimodal hallucinations are infrequent. Little more than 20% of those who presented with visual hallucinations (VH) also had tactile and verbal auditory hallucinations, while less than 6% had olfactory or gustatory hallucinations. Persistent musical hallucinations, often religious and patriotic, are more common in LBD than in other dementia syndromes.

In LBD syndromes, patients with delusions and agitation usually have a higher frequency of VH. Complex VH are the most distinguishing neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in mildly impaired patients. One cross-sectional study showed a point prevalence of 96% in comparison with 71% in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and 28% in late-onset APOE ɛ3/ɛ3 AD. Additionally, psychosis is more prevalent in association with REM sleep behavior disorder.

Capgras delusions may occur in up to 10% of patients with DLB, but they have not been described in PDD. However, paranoid delusions (delusions of theft and persecution) are more frequent than Capgras delusions in DLB. Fluctuating cognition and excessive daytime somnolence tend to cluster with hallucinations.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^111yGJvB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, BAP 2020 guidelines recommend eliciting appropriate history, performing mental state and physical examinations, and evaluating psychiatric and physical comorbidities during the initial assessment of schizophrenia in secondary care.

### Characteristics associated with progression to probable dementia with Lewy bodies in a cohort with very late-onset psychosis [^111YpMQJ]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Our findings suggest that DLB may be overrepresented where individuals with VLOP develop incident dementia, but the causal nature of this relationship is not clear. Several studies have noted that the risk of dementia is greatest in individuals with the shortest duration of psychosis, less than one year after VLOP. This suggests these psychotic symptoms may be an early manifestation of neurodegenerative disease [Almeida et al; Stafford et al.]. Further supporting this, neuropathological change was more commonly found in individuals with late-onset schizophrenia, and early psychotic symptoms have been associated with both the greatest risk of progression to AD and the fastest speed of decline [Ismail et al; Krell-Roesch et al; Nagao et al; Ruthirakuhan et al.].

However, the risk of incident dementia is also increased in individuals with early-onset psychosis and in those with prolonged follow up, suggesting psychotic disorders could also represent a causal factor for dementia [Miniawi et al.]. The overlapping comorbidities and risk factors — such as cardiovascular disease, alcohol and substance misuse, and smoking — the use of antipsychotic medication, and physiological changes associated with psychotic disorder may increase the risk of dementia in this population. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis found that individuals with cognitive decline in schizophrenia had similar rates of AD pathology to controls, suggesting there may be distinct mechanistic processes driving the late cognitive change associated with chronic psychotic illnesses and psychosis occurring in the prodromal stages of neurodegeneration.

### Schizophrenia [^1151jU6n]. Lancet (2016). Low credibility.

Schizophrenia is characterized by diverse psychopathology, which includes core features such as positive symptoms (delusions and hallucinations; so-called psychotic symptoms in which there is a loss of contact with reality), negative symptoms (particularly impaired motivation, reduction in spontaneous speech, and social withdrawal), and cognitive impairment. As a group, patients with schizophrenia perform more poorly than controls over a wide range of cognitive functions, though there is much individual variability.

- **Positive symptoms**: These tend to relapse and remit, though some patients experience residual long-term psychotic symptoms.
- **Negative and cognitive symptoms**: These tend to be chronic and are associated with long-term effects on social function.

The first episode of psychosis usually occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood but is frequently preceded by a prodromal phase or "at risk mental state". In some instances, premorbid impairments in cognition and/or social functioning go back many years. However, in other instances, onset is sudden in previously well-functioning individuals.

### Identifying specific clinical symptoms of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia versus differential psychiatric disorders in patients presenting with a late-onset frontal lobe syndrome [^111oSaYD]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Early differentiation between psychiatric disorders and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is of paramount importance in patients with a late-onset frontal lobe syndrome, as bvFTD will deteriorate, whereas psychiatric disorders are treatable at the time of diagnosis. Misdiagnosis often occurs due to an overlap of symptoms and lack of specific biomarkers. The aim of our study was to investigate whether specific symptoms could separate bvFTD from psychiatric disorders.

In a naturalistic, prospective, multicenter study, 137 patients (aged 45–75 years, 72% male) with a late-onset frontal lobe syndrome were included based on their scores on the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) and the Stereotypy Rating Inventory (SRI) from April 2011 to June 2013. In a multidisciplinary consensus meeting, diagnoses were established through elaborate neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging, fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical examinations by a neurologist and a psychiatrist based on the International bvFTD Criteria Consortium for bvFTD and DSM-IV-TR criteria for psychiatric disorders.

Forty-four subjects (32.8%) were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, 10 (7.3%) with possible bvFTD, and 45 (32.8%) with probable bvFTD. A logistic regression analysis was performed with "psychiatry or bvFTD" as the dependent variable and clinical variables (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], SRI, FBI) and demographics as independent variables.

### Exploring delusional themes and other symptoms in first episode psychosis: A network analysis over two timepoints [^1177e7UN]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Low credibility.

Delusions are a defining feature of psychosis and play an important role in the conceptualization and diagnosis of psychotic disorders; however, the particular role that different delusions play in the prognosis of these disorders is not well understood. This study explored relationships between delusions and other symptoms in 674 first episode psychosis (FEP) individuals by comparing symptom networks between baseline and 12 months after intake to an early intervention service.

- **Methods**: We estimated regularized partial correlation networks at baseline and month 12, identified the most central symptoms in each network, identified clusters of highly connected symptoms, and compared networks to examine changes in structure and connectivity.

- **Results**: At baseline, the most central symptoms were depression, delusions of mind reading, and delusions of thought insertion. At month 12, they were hallucinations, persecutory delusions, and delusions of thought insertion. A symptom cluster was identified at both timepoints comprising of five delusions corresponding to passivity experiences. While network structures did not differ significantly, the month 12 network was significantly more highly connected.

Our study captures a shift in illness trajectory over time, wherein transdiagnostic symptomatology at baseline becomes more consolidated around psychotic symptoms by month 12.

### Psychotic PTSD? Sudden traumatic loss precipitating very late onset schizophrenia [^114wHZyp]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

It is known that post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can manifest with secondary psychotic symptoms; for example, flashbacks and hypervigilance can be associated with persecutory delusions. However, in clinical practice, hallucinations and delusions that are readily understood as reactions to stress are liable to be labeled 'pseudo-psychotic'. To draw attention to the putative role of trauma in the etiology of psychosis, we describe a case in which a more generalized psychotic illness, with features of PTSD, followed a severe traumatic loss event in later life.

### Antipsychotic treatment of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (ATLAS): a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial [^1142c4db]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial provides the first reliable evidence that an antipsychotic drug (amisulpride 100 mg daily) is superior to placebo in reducing psychosis symptoms over 12 weeks and 24 weeks in patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. The treatment effect size from 24 weeks of amisulpride was large despite suboptimal compliance. Treatment was well tolerated with similar discontinuation rates for side-effects with amisulpride and placebo, despite a modest increase in extrapyramidal symptoms in patients given amisulpride.

- **Implications of all the available evidence**: Psychosis symptoms in patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis show a good and sustained response to amisulpride (100 mg/day) and this treatment is well tolerated. This randomised controlled trial is the first to show evidence of clear benefits from antipsychotic treatment in a situation where physicians might previously have shared the reluctance or ambivalence of their patients about such treatment.

Although atypical antipsychotics are used to treat very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis, their benefits and risks have not been properly evaluated. To our knowledge, the only evidence for efficacy is from a retrospective review of case notes and one single-arm, 5-week trial of amisulpride that reported improvements in psychosis without worsening of extrapyramidal symptoms. No randomised placebo-controlled trial data are available to guide antipsychotic treatment in very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.

### Psychopathology of early-onset versus late-onset schizophrenia revisited: an observation of 473 neuroleptic-naive patients before and after first-admission treatments [^113Bs7xA]. Schizophrenia Research (2004). Low credibility.

Reports of potential differences in psychopathological presentations between early and late-onset schizophrenia have been controversial. However, such differences in first-episode neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients have not been discussed. The authors evaluated symptom profiles in 473 neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients before and after first-admission treatments. Both before and after treatment:

- **Late-onset schizophrenia**: Had a lower score on affective flattening/social withdrawal than the earlier-onset counterpart of the illness, even after controlling for potential secondary sources of negative symptoms.
- **Systematic persecutory delusion**: Was more severe in patients with late-onset schizophrenia.
- **Overall effect of age of onset**: Was greater than the gender-related effects, including the interaction between age of onset and gender.

Consideration of late-onset schizophrenia may be important in order to develop an etiologically and clinically reasonable conceptualization of the subtypes of schizophrenia. A factor-analytical study that attempts to compare directly the structure of broad psychopathological presentations in early and late-onset schizophrenia may be a reasonable approach to investigate the longstanding unsolved controversy as to whether or not the neurobiological backgrounds underlying the psychopathological presentations are comparable.

### Antipsychotic treatment of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (ATLAS): A randomised, controlled, double-blind trial [^116udGfS]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

- **Summary**
- **Background**: Very late (aged ≥ 60 years) onset schizophrenia-like psychosis occurs frequently, but no placebo-controlled, randomised trials have assessed the efficacy and risks of antipsychotic treatment. We investigated whether low-dose amisulpride (100 mg daily) is superior to placebo in reducing psychosis symptoms over 12 weeks and whether any benefit is maintained by continuing treatment after 12 weeks.

- **Methods**: The ATLAS double-blind controlled trial enrolled participants from 25 old age psychiatry services in the UK. Eligible participants, those with a diagnosis of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis and a Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score of ≥ 30 without cognitive impairment, were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to one of three groups in a two-stage trial:
	- Amisulpride in stage 1 and 2 (Group A)
	- Amisulpride then placebo (Group B)
	- Placebo then amisulpride (Group C)

Treatment (100 mg oral amisulpride daily vs placebo) was administered for 12 weeks in stage 1, and for 24 weeks initially, then reduced to 12 weeks in stage 2. Participants, investigators, and outcome assessors were masked to treatment allocation. Primary outcomes were psychosis symptoms assessed by the BPRS at 4, 12, and 24, or 36 weeks, and trial treatment discontinuation for non-efficacy. The primary, secondary, and safety endpoints were all analysed in participants given at least one dose of study treatment in modified intention-to-treat analyses.

- **Findings**: Between Sept 27, 2012, and June

### Interventions for prodromal stage of psychosis [^116fhUgR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Psychosis is a serious mental condition characterized by a loss of contact with reality. There may be a prodromal period, or stage, of psychosis where early signs of symptoms indicating the onset of first episode psychosis (FEP) occur. A number of services, incorporating multimodal treatment approaches such as pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and psychosocial interventions, have been developed worldwide. These services now focus on this prodromal period with the aim of preventing psychosis in people at risk of developing FEP.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of early interventions for people in the prodromal stage of psychosis. The secondary objective is, if possible, to compare the effectiveness of the various different interventions.

- **Search methods**: We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's study-based register of studies, including trials registers, on 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions for participants older than 12 years who had developed a prodromal stage of psychosis were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality.

- **Main results**: We included 20 studies with 2,151 participants. The studies analyzed 13 different comparisons. Group A comparisons explored the absolute effects of the experimental intervention. Group B were comparisons within which we could not be clear whether differential interactive effects were also ongoing. Group C comparisons explored differential effects between clear…

### Neurocognitive features in subgroups of bipolar disorder [^111kicjm]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

To examine which subgroups of DSM-IV bipolar disorder (BD) [BD type I (BD-I) or BD type II (BD-II)] and subgroups based on history of psychosis, presenting polarity, and age at onset differentiate best regarding neurocognitive measures, a total of 199 patients with BD were characterized by clinical and neurocognitive features. The distribution of subgroups in this sample was 64% BD-I and 36% BD-II. Additionally, 60% had a history of psychosis, 57% had depression as the presenting polarity, 61% had an early onset of BD, 25% had a mid onset, and 14% had a late onset. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess relationships between neurocognitive variables and clinical subgroups.

Both BD-I diagnosis and elevated presenting polarity were related to impairments in verbal memory, with elevated presenting polarity explaining more of the variance in this cognitive domain (22.5%). History of psychosis and BD-I diagnosis were both related to impairment in semantic fluency, with history of psychosis explaining more of the variance (11.6%).

In conclusion, poor performance in verbal memory appears to be associated with an elevated presenting polarity, and poor performance in semantic fluency appears to be associated with a lifetime history of psychosis.

### Characteristics associated with progression to probable dementia with Lewy bodies in a cohort with very late-onset psychosis [^111Sq3WX]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, are associated with an increased risk of dementia, particularly when the onset of psychosis occurs after the age of 60 in very late-onset psychosis (VLOP). The causal mechanisms underpinning this association remain unclear; however, recent epidemiological and neuropathological evidence suggests that neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), including psychosis, can be early manifestations of neurodegenerative disease, indicating an 'at-risk' state for progression to dementia. The emergence of NPS after the age of 50 and persisting for more than six months in advance of dementia is now termed mild behavioral impairment; a psychiatric-onset prodrome is also recognized in recent research criteria for prodromal DLB.

- **Improved detection of psychosis**: With the increasing recognition of a psychiatric prodrome in neurodegenerative dementia, the improved detection of psychosis as the index manifestation is critical for early diagnosis and intervention while the pathological and symptomatic burden is limited. This is of particular importance in DLB, where the use of antipsychotic medications is associated with morbidity and mortality.

### The phenomenology and neurobiology of delusion formation during psychosis onset: Jaspers, Truman symptoms, and aberrant salience [^115tDz9c]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Following the publication of Karl Jaspers' *General Psychopathology* (1913), delusions have been characterized as nonunderstandable in terms of the person's biography, motivations, and historical-cultural context. According to Jaspers, this loss of understandability is due to an underlying neurobiological process, which has interrupted the normal development of the individual's personality.

Inheriting the 19th-century division between the natural- and human-historical sciences, Jaspers emphasizes the psychological understanding of mental disorders as narrative-based, holistic, and contextual. By doing so, he embraces cultural, ethnic, and individual differences and anticipates a person-centered medicine. However, he also affirms the value of explanatory neurobiological approaches, especially in the research and diagnosis of delusions. The phenomenological approach leads to neurobiological hypotheses, which can be tested experimentally.

The present article addresses these issues by illustrating Jaspers' fundamental contribution to neurobiological research concerning the formation of delusions during early phases of psychosis. Specifically, we present delusional mood and Truman symptoms as core phenomenological features at the origin of psychosis onset and discuss their neurobiological substrate with the aberrant salience and dopamine dysregulation models. Jaspers and his successors' phenomenological approach suggests that delusion is formed through loss of context in its experiential-perceptual origins, which is consistent with the more recent neurobiological hypotheses.

### Genotype-phenotype studies in bipolar disorder showing association between the DAOA/G30 locus and persecutory delusions: A first step toward a molecular genetic classification of psychiatric phenotypes [^115eDpGD]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

The authors previously reported an association between the D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA)/G30 locus and both schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder. Given the presumed role of DAOA/G30 in the neurochemistry of psychosis and its localization in a schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder linkage region (13q34), it was hypothesized that the bipolar affective disorder finding would be mainly due to an association with psychotic features.

The marker/haplotype associations obtained in a subset of 173 bipolar affective disorder patients with psychotic features were similar to those in the overall patient group, suggesting that stratification on the basis of psychotic features in general might be too crude a procedure. The authors therefore tested whether confining caseness to specific psychotic features would improve detection of genotype-phenotype correlations.

In a logistic regression, "persecutory delusions" were found to be the only significant explanatory variable for the DAOA/G30 risk genotype among 21 OPCRIT symptoms of psychosis. The authors therefore tested for association between DAOA/G30 and bipolar affective disorder in the 90 cases with a history of persecutory delusions. Whereas this subset showed strong association (odds ratio = 1.83 for the best marker), the remaining larger sample of 165 patients with no such history did not differ from comparison subjects, suggesting that the association between DAOA/G30 and bipolar affective disorder is due to persecutory delusions.

### Association between risk of dementia and very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis: A Swedish population-based cohort study [^112XqdkB]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Conversely, it is possible that VLOSLP symptoms could represent an early marker of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, given that amyloid-β has been found to accumulate in the brain over several decades before dementia onset (Villemagne et al.), and these neuropathological changes may lead to the emergence of cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms of dementia prior to the diagnostic threshold being reached. In line with this, the concept of mild behavioural impairment posits that late-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms, including apathy, emotion dysregulation, reduced impulse control, agitation, social inappropriateness, and psychotic symptoms, reflect possible early markers of preclinical dementia neuropathology (Ismail et al.).

Further, depression has consistently been found to be associated with subsequent dementia (Diniz, Butters, Albert, Dew, & Reynolds; Ownby, Crocco, Acevedo, John, & Loewenstein), and several cohort studies have demonstrated stronger associations between late-onset depression and dementia relative to early or mid-life depression (Heser et al; Karlsson et al; Li et al.). A recent cohort study with 28 years of follow-up demonstrated that the association between dementia and depression symptoms became apparent 11 years before dementia diagnosis, potentially reflecting prodromal dementia albeit more than a decade before diagnosis (Singh-Manoux et al.). It is clear that psychiatric symptoms with a late age-at-onset, including psychosis, are a marker of increased risk of dementia during the pre-cognitive impairment phase, and this group may be a priority group.

### Late-life psychosis: Diagnosis and treatment [^112yVCMB]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Psychosis is one of the most common conditions in later life, with a lifetime risk of 23%. Despite its high prevalence, late-onset psychosis remains a diagnostic and treatment dilemma. There are no reliable pathognomonic signs to distinguish primary from secondary psychosis. Primary psychosis is a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring the clinician to rule out secondary causes. Approximately 60% of older patients with newly incident psychosis have a secondary psychosis.

In this article, we review current, evidence-based diagnostic and treatment approaches for this heterogeneous condition, emphasizing a thorough evaluation for the "six D's" of late-life psychosis: delirium, disease, drugs, dementia, depression, and delusions. Treatment is geared towards the specific cause of psychosis and tailored based on comorbid conditions. Frequently, environmental and psychosocial interventions are first-line treatments, with the judicious use of pharmacotherapy as needed.

There is an enormous gap between the prevalence of psychotic disorders in older adults and the availability of evidence-based treatment. The dramatic growth in the elderly population over the first half of this century creates a compelling need to address this gap.

### Characteristics associated with progression to probable dementia with Lewy bodies in a cohort with very late-onset psychosis [^11545q72]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Psychosis is a common early clinical manifestation of DLB, with visual hallucinations identified up to five years prior to diagnosis and in almost 25% of cases two years prior to diagnosis (Fei et al; Wyman-Chick et al.). However, while very late-onset psychosis (VLOP) with significant functional impairment is increasingly recognized as a prodromal presentation of DLB, distinct from the construct of mild behavioral impairment, the typical clinical phenotype of psychiatric-onset prodromal DLB has yet to be characterized (Fei et al; Gunawardana et al; Kanemoto et al; McKeith et al; Urso et al.). Studies have suggested that up to one-third of patients with VLOP may have neurodegenerative changes, but this is likely an overestimate because the sample sizes were small, and only those with signs suspicious of AD or DLB underwent testing for indicative biomarkers (Kanemoto et al; Nagao et al; Satake et al.).

### Cognitive performance at first episode of psychosis and the relationship with future treatment resistance: Evidence from an international prospective cohort study [^111jSUsA]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Low credibility.

If treatment resistance is more neurodevelopmentally rooted than treatment-responsive schizophrenia, then it stands to reason that it should be identifiable prior to clinical onset. Early detection or prediction can aid in the initiation of more timely, personalized, and appropriate treatment. The gold-standard treatment for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is clozapine, as it is the only licensed pharmacotherapy for TRS. Early pharmacological intervention with clozapine improves functional outcomes, with response rates of up to 80% in those treated within the first 2.8 years of illness onset, but only 30% for those with delayed treatment. Despite recommendations in treatment guidelines that delay in starting clozapine for TRS should be avoided, antipsychotic polypharmacy and high dosage are commonly used prior to clozapine, which has been shown to be initiated, on average, 4 years following a diagnosis of TRS.

However, response to clozapine is varied, with an estimated 32 to 39% of those with a TRS diagnosis also showing non-response to clozapine, termed ultra-treatment resistant (UTR). Add-on and augmentation strategies, such as combining clozapine treatment with several antipsychotic agents (e.g. aripiprazole, risperidone, and haloperidol), as well as using alternative drugs that target specific symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g. mood stabilizers and antidepressants for negative symptoms), have been recommended for treating this subgroup. However, research concerning this has been largely inconsistent in findings.

### Neurocognitive deficits in the (putative) prodrome and first episode of psychosis [^116sJWQg]. Schizophrenia Research (2007). Low credibility.

International research programs have contributed to the creation of operationally defined criteria to identify individuals at risk for schizophrenia. Although there has been substantial progress in the prospective study of the schizophrenia prodrome, the utility of diagnostic criteria remains questionable because of the relatively low base rates of incident psychoses, the high false-positive rate, and ethical concerns regarding the treatment of individuals at risk. The identification of brain-based neurocognitive vulnerability markers for schizophrenia may contribute to the development of an at-risk algorithm with greater predictive accuracy.

Forty subjects at risk (AR) for schizophrenia, 15 in their first episode (FE) of schizophrenia, and 36 healthy comparison (HC) subjects were administered a neurocognitive battery that assessed the domains of processing speed, working memory, verbal episodic memory, executive functioning, and general intelligence.

At baseline, AR subjects showed neurocognitive deficits across all domains compared to HC subjects that were less severe than those observed in the FE sample. In preliminary analyses, AR subjects who later converted to psychosis (N = 5) had greater neurocognitive impairment at baseline evaluation compared to those individuals who remained "at risk" at follow-up.

Neurocognitive deficits may be important in the pathogenesis of early psychosis and could help to define individuals at greatest risk for schizophrenia. Continued research in larger cohorts is needed to test the validity.

### Which came first, delusions or hallucinations? An exploration of clinical differences among patients with first-episode psychosis based on patterns of emergence of positive symptoms [^116XeGgd]. Psychiatry Research (2012). Low credibility.

Remarkably little is known about patterns of emergence of specific symptoms in the early course of nonaffective psychotic disorders. Some 159 well-characterized first-episode psychosis patients were categorized into four groups: (1) delusions only (n = 29, 18.2%); (2) delusions that emerged at least 1 month before hallucinations (n = 31, 19.5%); (3) hallucinations that began at least 1 month before delusions (n = 26, 16.4%); and (4) delusions and hallucinations that emerged concomitantly, within the same month (n = 73, 45.9%). These groups were compared across a number of clinical features, including the duration of untreated psychosis, symptom severity, insight, and functioning, while controlling for potential confounders.

Patients with delusions and hallucinations emerging within the same month had a shorter duration of untreated psychosis than those in whom one psychotic symptom emerged more than one month before the other. The delusions-only group had significantly less severe positive, negative, and general psychopathology symptom scores, as well as better social and occupational functioning. Replication and further elucidation of specific patterns of symptom emergence would deepen the field's understanding of early-course phenomenology and may inform efforts to improve upon nosology, prognostication, and treatment selection.

### Early treatment-induced improvement of negative symptoms predicts cognitive functioning in treatment-naive first episode schizophrenia: a 2-year follow-up [^1143BHZP]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Studying neuroleptic-naive first episode schizophrenia is a strategy for investigating clinical and neuropsychological abnormalities at a very early phase of the disease without confounding influences of illness duration and medication effects. We examined the clinical and neuropsychological time course over 2 years in 32 neuroleptic-naive first episode patients (20 males, 12 females) and 21 healthy individuals with similar sociodemographic characteristics. Early treatment-induced reduction of negative symptoms predicted superior cognitive performance throughout follow-up in the domains of verbal fluency, attention, and non-verbal learning and memory. There were no associations between psychotic or disorganized symptoms and cognitive variables. These findings suggest an important relationship between treatment efficacy of antipsychotic medication and the longer term course of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

### Meta-analytic evidence for the plurality of mechanisms in transdiagnostic structural MRI studies of hallucination status [^114emNLe]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Low credibility.

The prevalence of auditory hallucinations in the general population varies across the lifespan, with peaks in early life (< 30 years) and between 50 and 59 years. Results from these meta-analyses predict that the early onset of hallucinations will have a pattern of frontotemporal structural deficits similar to psychiatric disorders with neurodevelopmental origins, while later onset will show a neurodegenerative pattern of gray matter change in the occipital cortex, medial temporal lobe, and thalamus. Empirical neuroimaging and cognitive research in non-clinical groups and non-dominant modalities are necessary to extend the limits of knowledge.

As with all meta-analyses, statistical power is restricted by the size of the extant literature and the sample sizes of original studies. In neuroimaging, the experience of hallucinations remains immature. Despite this, the overall sample size was comparable to other SDM meta-analyses (n = 233 H, n = 194 NH for psychiatric; n = 128 H, n = 162 NH for neurodegenerative). Neuroimaging meta-analyses are often subject to heterogeneity in methodology. We noted broadly uniform software parameters and spatial smoothing but variation in covariates and statistical thresholds. However, all meta-analyses employed the same threshold throughout the brain, limiting bias towards any a-priori regions of interest and improving the reliability of results. The questionnaires used to assess hallucination status varied in the timeframe bounding the hallucination.

### Schizophrenia: Overview and treatment options [^111A7uWq]. P & T (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on schizophrenia:

- **Definition**: Schizophrenia is defined as a complex psychiatric condition characterized by symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and impaired cognitive functions.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of schizophrenia is unclear; however, in utero disorders (infections, obstetric complications, and fetal disturbances), and genetic and environmental factors (childhood trauma, social isolation, economic adversity, discrimination) have been implicated.

- **Epidemiology**: The annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US is 5.1 per 1,000 individuals.

- **Disease course**: Abnormalities in neurotransmission of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate are observed. Particularly, dopamine results in either hyperdopaminergic function in the caudate nucleus or hypodopaminergic function in the frontal lobe. A complex interaction of nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, mesocortical, and tuberoinfundibular pathways leads to negative symptoms, positive symptoms, and cognitive deficits, alongside detectable physical changes in the brain tissue.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: After a 10-year follow-up, 80% of patients with schizophrenia require readmission after the first discharge. Non-adherence to antipsychotic medication in the first year is associated with a 64% relapse rate, while adherence during the first year is associated with a 27% relapse.

### The early longitudinal course of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia [^113evJH3]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia. However, the longitudinal course and pattern of this impairment, and its relationship to functional outcome, are not fully understood. Among the likely factors in the persistence of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are brain tissue changes over time, which in turn appear to be related to antipsychotic medication adherence. Cognitive deficits are viewed as a core feature of schizophrenia primarily because they clearly exist before the onset of psychosis and can predict illness onset among those at high risk of developing the illness. Additionally, these deficits often persist during symptomatic remissions in patients and are relatively stable across time both in patients and in individuals at risk for schizophrenia.

Despite clear evidence that cognitive impairment can predict functional outcome in chronic schizophrenia, results of studies examining this relationship in the early phase of psychosis have been mixed. Recent data, however, strongly suggest that interventions targeting early cognitive deficits may be crucial to the prevention of chronic disability and thus should be a prominent target for therapy. Finally, it is vital to keep schizophrenia patients consistently on their antipsychotic medications. A novel method of examining intracortical myelin volume indicated that the choice of antipsychotic treatment had a differential impact on frontal myelination. These data suggest that long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication may prevent patients from declining further through a combination of mechanisms.

### Rationale and design of the "DIagnostic and Prognostic Precision Algorithm for behavioral variant Frontotemporal Dementia" (DIPPA-FTD) study: A study aiming to distinguish early stage sporadic FTD from late-onset primary psychiatric disorders [^117EYbG1]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). High credibility.

The DIPPA-FTD study includes subjects with late-life behavioral changes after the age of 45 years. Subjects who meet the Rascovsky criteria for possible or probable bvFTD and subjects meeting one of the DSM-V classifications, such as major depressive disorder, manic episode, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizotypal disorder, delusional disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are included. Subjects not fully meeting the Rascovsky criteria or the aforementioned DSM-V diagnoses at baseline are retained as 'ambiguous cases' to prevent the exclusion of a possibly early sporadic bvFTD case. The study aims to include 100 subjects with sporadic bvFTD cases and 100 subjects with a primary psychiatric disorder. Ambiguous subjects are distributed based on the most likely etiology (psychiatric or FTD) based on a five-point Likert scale. Subjects with a positive psychiatric history before the age of 45 can still be enrolled if the early-life psychiatric history is unrelated to the late-onset behavioral change and is relatively mild, such as a patient with late-onset psychosis reporting a mild depressive episode in a situational context in early adulthood.

Subjects are recruited at participating memory clinics or via referrals from the psychiatry department. All subjects undergo comprehensive diagnostic screening, following local guidelines of the participating memory clinics, to rule out the existence of an underlying Alzheimer's disease or other neurological disorders.

### Neurocognitive features in subgroups of bipolar disorder [^113jcSgB]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The findings seem to have clinical implications. First, as in patients with psychotic disorders, many patients with BD have cognitive disturbances that could affect functioning and may benefit from strategies that enhance cognitive function through cognitive remediation. Secondly, if neurocognition is involved in the etiology and pathophysiology of the disorder, an increased understanding of this role may increase the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the clinical picture and, in turn, the treatment of the disorder.

Taken together, the findings suggest that there may be latent subgroups within the BD spectrum that to some extent encompass characteristics of several of the previously proposed subgroups, such as the combination of elevated presenting polarity, manic episodes, and history of psychosis. These groups are characterized by impairments in neurocognitive function, particularly verbal memory and semantic fluency.

- **Limitations**: The cross-sectional design limits the possibility to look for causal relationships. Information about onset characteristics is gathered retrospectively, with possible recall bias. Family history of psychiatric illness is based on interview with patients only. The comparison of several subgroups with repeated statistical analyses involves the risk of spurious findings, even if the main findings survive correction for multiple testing. Since this is a naturalistic study, we have not controlled the use of medication, and differences in symptomatology between subgroups could be related to the use of different medications.

### Neuropsychological differences between late-onset and recurrent geriatric major depression [^117GPztt]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Executive dysfunction, possibly related to vascular pathology, has been well documented in patients with a first episode of major depressive disorder in later life (late-onset geriatric major depression). However, it is unclear whether the neuropsychological presentation differs in patients with a lifetime history of major depressive disorder (recurrent geriatric major depressive disorder). The aim of this study was to explore differences in neuropsychological function, symptoms, and cardiovascular comorbidity between patients with late-onset and recurrent geriatric major depression.

The study used a two-by-two factorial design, in which one factor was major depressive disorder (present versus absent) and the second factor was lifetime history of depression (present versus absent). Neuropsychological measures of executive functioning and episodic memory, as well as psychopathological symptoms and comorbid medical illness, were examined in a total of 116 older adults.

Patients with late-onset major depressive disorder showed specific deficits in attention and executive function, whereas patients with recurrent major depressive disorder exhibited deficits in episodic memory. The rates of anhedonia and comorbid cardiovascular illness were higher in patients with late-onset geriatric major depressive disorder.

In contrast to recurrent geriatric major depressive disorder, late-onset major depressive disorder is characterized by specific deficits in tasks of attention and executive function, consistent with increased anhedonia.

### Antipsychotic treatment of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (ATLAS): a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial [^115Qng7X]. The Lancet. Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

In the ATLAS trial, we selected amisulpride, a limbic-selective D2 and D3 antagonist, due to its relatively non-sedating properties, aiding compliance and blinding of treatment allocation. Although amisulpride was chosen, similar results could be expected with other antipsychotics. The recommended daily dose of amisulpride for early-onset schizophrenia is 400–800 mg, but our data indicate that a lower dose (100 mg/day) can improve symptoms in patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.

We opted for 100 mg/day of amisulpride, anticipating it would unlikely cause significant extrapyramidal side effects, as an open-label trial had previously suggested this dose is effective and well-tolerated in our study population. Our findings noted a moderate increase in extrapyramidal side effects, even at this low dose; however, these effects were neither frequent nor severe enough to impact compliance or outweigh the benefits of amisulpride, even with treatment lasting up to 36 weeks. This finding aligns with a PET study showing Alzheimer's patients receiving 50 mg/day of amisulpride for psychosis had a higher occupancy of striatal dopamine receptors (40–80%) than expected, elevating the risk of extrapyramidal side effects.

Given the mean age of ATLAS participants was around 80 years, exposure to high-dose antipsychotics would likely significantly increase the risk of such side effects, which can be distressing, disfiguring, reduce mobility, and lead to other complications.

### Persecutory delusions and the perception of trustworthiness in unfamiliar faces in schizophrenia [^114MFYH2]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

Persecutory delusions, a common symptom of schizophrenia, involve a disruption in the way that patients determine the intentions of others and especially their trustworthiness. However, it is unclear to what extent general preference affects trustworthiness judgments in patients with schizophrenia and how that relates to paranoid symptomology. Patients with schizophrenia and control subjects rated unfamiliar faces for trustworthiness and attractiveness (as a proxy for preference).

The results demonstrate that patients do not show an overall difference in their trustworthiness ratings of unfamiliar faces. However, they do show a significant reduction in the correlation between trustworthiness and other indicators of preference, in this case, attractiveness judgments. The level of persecutory delusions is associated with this effect, such that patients with low levels of delusions show correlations near that of normal controls, and high levels of persecutory delusions are related to a reduced trust/attractiveness correlation. These results suggest that patients with schizophrenia suffering from persecutory delusions rely less on normative social cues when making interpersonal judgments.

Such findings underscore the importance of examining symptom-specific information when studying trust in patients with schizophrenia.

### Neurocognitive features in subgroups of bipolar disorder [^114hF913]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The age range for the onset of bipolar disorder (BD) is very wide, with no gender differences. Previous research has focused on early versus late onset, but recent large multisite studies have identified three potential age-at-onset subgroups with different clinical presentations across various cultural settings and birth cohorts: early onset (mean age at onset ≈ 17 years), intermediate onset (mean age at onset ≈ 26 years), and late onset (mean age at onset ≈ 42 years).

The characteristics of the disorder may vary with the age at onset, and those with early onset appear as a separate subgroup with specific clinical manifestations. These include higher recurrence rates of mood episodes, especially elevated episodes in BD-I, more frequent depressive onsets, increased suicide attempts, higher risk for comorbid borderline personality disorder, higher rates of psychotic symptoms, more frequent neurocognitive impairment, a greater prevalence of BD-I compared to BD-II, and a more frequent family history of BD compared to patients with later onsets.

There is considerable empirical evidence of subgroups in BD associated with differences in clinical course and outcomes. However, there has been limited attention to the possibility that these different subgroups describe overlapping phenomena, as indicated by several characteristics common to the suggested groups. Even when focusing on different aspects or subgroups of a specific disorder, some of the same validating principles should apply as for other disease entities. Suggested validation criteria for psychiatric illness can be divided into three.

### Association between risk of dementia and very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis: a Swedish population-based cohort study [^117NUmcE]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

A validation study reported an average delay of 5.5 years in the recording of dementia diagnoses in the registers [Rizzuto et al.], which may have compromised the precision of estimates of the time between VLOSLP and dementia diagnoses. Misclassification between dementia subtypes is common in the NPR [Rizzuto et al.], hence we were not able to examine whether the association varied according to different diagnostic subtypes.

Further, misdiagnosis between schizophrenia and dementia remains a possibility. Pre-existing cognitive deficits are common in schizophrenia [Bora] and could contribute to the misdiagnosis of dementia in some cases. Conversely, early signs of dementia could be mistaken for cognitive deficits and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Previous studies have shown that comorbidities are often under-detected in people with schizophrenia [Roberts, Roalfe, Wilson, & Lester; Smith, Langan, Mclean, Guthrie, & Mercer], possibly due to diagnostic overshadowing, whereby comorbidities are misattributed to psychotic symptoms [Viron & Stern]. Although we conducted a sensitivity analysis to mitigate against misdiagnosis, and we would expect clinicians to be aware of the complexities of dementia diagnoses in the context of psychotic disorders, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of misdiagnosis in either direction. While we adjusted for length of education, we were unable to obtain more detailed information on educational attainment or cognitive functioning from the Swedish registers, which would have allowed greater insight into baseline cognitive function and reserve.

### The interaction of affective with psychotic processes: a test of the effects of worrying on working memory, jumping to conclusions, and anomalies of experience in patients with persecutory delusions [^1112gJ8U]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2013). Low credibility.

- **Baseline assessments**:

	- **Psychotic symptom rating scales – delusions (PSYRATS)**: The PSYRATS – delusions is a six-item multidimensional measure. It assesses the conviction, preoccupation, distress, and disruption associated with delusions. Symptoms over the last week are rated. Higher scores indicate greater severity.

	- **Positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS)**: The PANSS is a 30-item rating instrument developed for the assessment of patients with schizophrenia. Symptoms over the last week were rated (i.e. currently present). Higher scores indicate the greater presence of psychiatric symptoms.

	- **Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale (GPTS)**: The GPTS is a thirty-two item measure of paranoid thinking. Part A assesses ideas of reference (e.g. "It was hard to stop thinking about people talking about me behind my back") and Part B assesses ideas of persecution (e.g. "I was convinced there was a conspiracy against me"). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale. Higher scores indicate greater levels of paranoid thinking. The scale was completed for the period of the previous fortnight.

	- **Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)**: The PSWQ is the most established measure of trait worry style and has been used in non-clinical and clinical populations. Each of the sixteen items is rated on a 5-point scale. Higher scores indicate a greater tendency to worry.

### Characteristics associated with progression to probable dementia with Lewy bodies in a cohort with very late-onset psychosis [^112L7fc4]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis of DLB is critical to improve outcomes for patients and their caregivers and manage the prognostic and pharmacological implications of the disorder. Antipsychotics, in particular, can cause severe sensitivity reactions in DLB and were prescribed in 82% of this cohort with VLOP who developed dementia. However, at the time of writing, psychiatric-onset DLB has been difficult to differentiate from VLOP based on symptoms alone. Furthermore, although cognitive impairment at baseline is associated with incident dementia, accurate cognitive assessment is challenging in the context of severe psychotic symptoms.

It is increasingly recognized that core features can differentiate DLB in its prodromal stages, even in the absence of cognitive impairment. Indeed, in our cohort with VLOP, the presence of at least two core clinical features or visual hallucinations at the time of psychosis onset was associated with both an increased risk of, and shorter time to, dementia with two core features of DLB. Visual hallucinations have also been associated with faster progression to dementia in an MCI cohort, suggesting visual hallucinations may be a key early indicator of prospective DLB. The presence of two core features of DLB at the time of psychosis was associated with specificity over 80% for DLB-NLP, and the presence of these symptoms in VLOP should lead to a high index of suspicion, although the lower sensitivity highlights that not all cases are identified.

### Canadian guideline for Parkinson disease [^112Yu8fN]. CMAJ (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Parkinson's disease, specifically in the management of psychosis, CNSF 2019 guidelines recommend not treating hallucinations and delusions if they are well tolerated by the patient with PD, their family members, and caregivers (as appropriate). View minor hallucinations or delusions as a marker of disease progression. Obtain a general medical evaluation and offer treatment for any precipitating factors.

### Neuropsychological course in the prodrome and first episode of psychosis: Findings from the PRIME North America double-blind treatment study [^114hxMUi]. Schizophrenia Research (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to address the uncertainty regarding the onset timing of the cognitive deficiencies associated with schizophrenia. Researchers investigated whether conversion to psychosis and/or olanzapine treatment altered the neuropsychological course of subjects in the first-ever double-blind medication study of the putative schizophrenia first episode prodrome.

- **Method**: Sixty participants were involved in a double-blind trial of olanzapine as a treatment for putative prodromal states. Assessments occurred at entry (pre-randomization), and again at 6 and 12 months if participants remained non-psychotic, or at any of these points prior to psychosis followed by post-psychosis and 6 months post-psychosis assessments.

- **Results**: Participants who converted to psychosis did not differ from placebo non-converters in pre-randomization global neuropsychological status. Early converters did not differ from later converters in entry neuropsychological status. Subjects who converted after 6 months did not show neuropsychological declines during the initial, pre-psychosis, 6 months. Neuropsychological course did not differ between converters to psychosis and non-converters, or between olanzapine and placebo-assigned subjects.

- **Conclusions**: Neither the onset of frank psychosis nor olanzapine treatment of the prodrome significantly alters neuropsychological course in persons considered to be at high risk at their initial (pre-psychosis) assessment. These findings suggest that the neuropsychological deficiencies associated with psychotic conditions largely pre-exist the first frank psychotic episode.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^112LfKJB]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for schizophrenia, specifically concerning initial assessment, BAP 2020 guidelines recommend eliciting a personal and family history of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in all patients. It is vital to identify and modify risk factors for CVD and sudden death, such as increased BMI, smoking, diabetes, elevated heart rate, blood pressure, cholesterol, liver disease, and poor nutrition. These factors can often be exacerbated by antipsychotic medications.

### Evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia: Updated recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^116jjxXy]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for schizophrenia, more specifically with respect to pretreatment evaluation, BAP 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining pretreatment investigations, including electrolytes, liver function tests (LFTs), and an electrocardiogram (ECG). This is essential to exclude congenital conduction abnormalities and Brugada syndrome, ideally before the first prescription. Consider initiating an antipsychotic medication with a lower risk of arrhythmogenesis, specifically one with a relatively low affinity for human hERG potassium channels and a low propensity to prolong the QTc interval if pretreatment evaluation is not feasible.

### Cognitive performance at first episode of psychosis and the relationship with future treatment resistance: Evidence from an international prospective cohort study [^116gCj6U]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Low credibility.

Antipsychotic treatment resistance affects up to a third of individuals with a schizophrenia diagnosis. Revised guidelines from the Treatment Response and Resistance in Psychosis (TRRIP) working group classify treatment resistance as a lack of symptomatic relief following at least two or more antipsychotic trials of different drug classes, with adequate adherence. Each trial should last at least six weeks, with dosages at least in the mid-point of the licensed therapeutic range. The systematic review from the TRIPP working group identified 42 studies using treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) samples; 21 of these (50%) did not report operationalized criteria, with 95% (40 studies) using different criteria. Therefore, this consensus aimed at providing a more standard definition of TRS, something which has not been consistent in previous investigations, potentially resulting in heterogeneity across, as well as within, TRS studies.

A recent meta-analysis found differences in cognitive performance between individuals with treatment-resistant and treatment-responsive schizophrenia. Unlike those who respond to antipsychotic medication, individuals resistant to medication had cognitive impairments across all cognitive domains, with the greatest deficits observed on verbal memory and language function tasks. Cognitive differences between groups have also been observed on verbal intelligence and fluency tasks in first-episode samples with follow-up data to determine future treatment response or resistance, though studies comparing cognitive performance at first episode of psychosis (FEP) are limited.

### Antipsychotic treatment of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (ATLAS): a randomised, controlled, double-blind trial [^117PJLum]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

We recruited patients with very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis from community and inpatient specialist old age psychiatry services within the UK National Health Service. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis according to International Consensus Group Criteria. This included the onset of delusions or hallucinations, or both, at age 60 years or older, a BPRS score of 30 or greater, and the capacity to give informed consent to participate in the trial.

Exclusion criteria were as follows: cognitive impairment or a standardised Mini Mental State Examination score of less than 25; diagnosis of affective disorder; uncontrolled serious physical illness; prescribed amisulpride in the previous 28 days; contraindications to amisulpride; or participation in another clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product in the previous 28 days. Participants with conditions that would prevent them from having a blood test were excluded from the optional blood tests, but not the full trial.

Individuals treated with antipsychotics other than amisulpride in the 28 days before enrollment, but who still satisfied the eligibility criteria and for whom stopping their antipsychotic was considered appropriate, could participate. These participants discontinued antipsychotic treatment the day before starting trial medication. Participants were given an information sheet about the study, and the trial procedures were explained to them, after which they provided written informed consent.

### The initial prodrome of schizophrenia: Different duration, different underlying deficits [^117THjZP]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2007). Low credibility.

Approaching the initial schizophrenic prodrome is a multifaceted enterprise in light of various suggestions concerning underlying deficits and transition patterns. Recently, the prodromal phase has largely been viewed as a singular concept. However, observations of greatly varying prodromal time courses prompted us to investigate whether these differences suggest the existence of diverse prodrome subtypes. Our sample consisted of 160 patients from the Cologne Early Recognition study. The 79 patients transitioning from prodrome to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition schizophrenia were divided into three time groups according to the length of the prodromal state and compared based on their initial symptomatology.

We found differences in the prominent clinical picture, not only regarding single symptoms but also in logistic equations calculated for each group that included only cognitive deficits. Our results indicate different underlying deficits: disturbances in bottom-up and top-down loop processes associated with a long prodrome and in top-down processes with a medium prodrome, and a deficient central integrating system with a short prodrome.

### Association between risk of dementia and very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis: a Swedish population-based cohort study [^116aMXHa]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Although non-affective psychotic disorders typically have their first onset in adolescence or early adulthood, recent population-based evidence suggests a second peak of incidence after 60 years old, particularly in women. This is referred to as very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP) in those aged over 60 years old. There is ongoing debate about the aetiology of VLOSLP and its relationship with neurodegeneration and dementia. Understanding this issue is critical to providing insight into the aetiologies of VLOSLP and dementia, which could then inform clinical practice.

Data on the association between VLOSLP and cognitive decline are, however, sparse, and most studies in this area have been limited by small, unrepresentative samples and cross-sectional designs. Two longitudinal, population-based studies have focused on VLOSLP and dementia, reporting elevated risk of dementia in people with VLOSLP, but these studies had relatively short follow-up periods (maximum 7 years). This is problematic because dementia neuropathology may develop over decades, with symptoms emerging up to 12 years before dementia diagnosis.

### Evolution of neuropsychological dysfunction during the course of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [^115HQhx5]. Psychological Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and related disorders represents a core feature of these illnesses, possibly serving as a marker of underlying pathophysiology. Substantial overlap in domains of neuropsychological deficits has been reported among these disorders after illness onset. However, it is unclear whether deficits follow the same longitudinal pre- and post-morbid course across diagnoses. We examine evidence for neurocognitive dysfunction as a core feature of all idiopathic psychotic illnesses and trace its evolution from pre-morbid and prodromal states through the emergence of overt psychosis and into chronic illness in patients with SZ, BD, and related disorders.

- **Method**: Articles reporting on neuropsychological functioning in patients with SZ, BD, and related disorders before and after illness onset were reviewed. Given the vast literature on these topics and the present focus on cross-diagnostic comparisons, priority was given to primary data papers that assessed cross-diagnostic samples and recent meta-analyses.

- **Results**: Patients with SZ exhibit dysfunction preceding the onset of illness, which becomes more pronounced in the prodrome and early years following diagnosis, then settles into a stable pattern. Patients with BD generally exhibit typical cognitive development pre-morbidly but demonstrate deficits by the first episode that are amplified with worsening symptoms and exacerbations.

- **Conclusions**: Neuropsychological deficits represent a core feature of SZ and BD; however, their onset and progression differ between diagnostic groups.

### Association between risk of dementia and very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis: a Swedish population-based cohort study [^115UbSLq]. Psychological Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Using washout periods of 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years to exclude participants whose dementia may have been misdiagnosed as VLOSLP (and their matched participants without VLOSLP), we found some attenuation in elevated dementia rates in the VLOSLP group. However, these rates remained substantially higher than in the non-VLOSLP group in both fully adjusted Cox regression (2-year washout HR: 2.22, 95% CI 2.10–2.36) and competing risks regression (SHR: 1.45, 95% CI 1.37–1.53).

We conducted a further sensitivity analysis to investigate whether higher rates of dementia in people with VLOSLP were explained by ascertainment bias arising from increased contact with the health system. The results showed that dementia rates were higher in the VLOSLP group relative to both the non-VLOSLP groups who had not received any diagnosis of any condition 12 months either side of cohort entry (HR: 4.90, 95% CI 4.69–5.13) and those who had received a diagnosis during this time (indicative of health service contact) (HR: 2.89, 95% CI 2.75–3.04). These results suggest that higher rates of dementia in the VLOSLP group cannot be fully explained by a greater probability of detection of dementia due to greater contact with services.

To examine the joint effects of possible misdiagnosis and ascertainment bias on our results, we re-ran these sensitivity analyses together.

### Generalized and specific neurocognitive deficits in psychotic disorders: Utility for evaluating pharmacological treatment effects and as intermediate phenotypes for gene discovery [^115s1LwE]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

A growing body of research suggests that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder share overlapping clinical, neurobiological, and genetic features, raising important questions about the boundaries and distinctiveness of these two major psychiatric disorders. A generalized cognitive impairment has long been understood to be a core feature of schizophrenia. More recently, it has become apparent that cognitive impairment also occurs in bipolar disorder, particularly in those patients with a history of psychotic symptoms.

Whether a generalized deficit exists across a spectrum of psychotic disorders is less clearly established. Additionally, in the context of a broad impairment, it remains a significant challenge to identify deficits in specific cognitive processes that may have distinct neurochemical or regional brain substrates and linkages to particular risk-associated genetic factors.

In this article, we review findings from neuropsychological studies across a spectrum that includes schizophrenia, schizoaffective, and bipolar disorders, and conclude the available evidence strongly supports that a generalized deficit is present across psychotic disorders, differing in severity more so than form. We then consider the implications of generalized and specific deficits in psychosis for two areas of research — the evaluation of pharmacological treatments targeting cognitive deficits, and the investigation of cognitive intermediate phenotypes in family genetic studies. Examples from the literature that touch on the relevance of the generalized deficit in these contexts are provided.

### Prodromes of first-episode psychosis: How can we challenge nonspecificity [^111Kyypb]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Prevention of functional psychosis is a major concern of modern psychiatry. The aim is to avoid biological and psychosocial deterioration at the earliest possible stage of the illness. The term "prodrome" has become crucial for the identification of this very early stage. Recent years have seen intensive research efforts in defining prodromal signs and symptoms; however, the conclusion of most researchers is that they are nonspecific. We present the descriptive and phenomenological findings of the prodrome concept. Although prodromes are nonspecific, their discrepancy with persisting social impairment over time is a frequently encountered and highly alarming feature in young at-risk individuals. The inclusion of phenomenological findings may suggest the presence of psychosis-like inner experiences as early as the prodromal phase and thus raises the question of the starting point for psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatment. Finally, a decision pathway for clinicians is proposed in their challenging task of identifying young individuals at risk.

### Neurocognitive features in subgroups of bipolar disorder [^114Gbvsc]. Bipolar Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

To examine which subgroups of DSM-IV bipolar disorder (BD) - BD type I (BD-I) or BD type II (BD-II), and subgroups based on history of psychosis, presenting polarity, and age at onset - differentiate best regarding neurocognitive measures, a study was conducted with a total of 199 patients characterized by clinical and neurocognitive features. The distribution of subgroups in this sample was as follows: BD-I comprised 64% and BD-II comprised 36%; 60% had a history of psychosis; 57% had depression as the presenting polarity; 61% had an early onset of BD, 25% had a mid onset, and 14% had a late onset. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess relationships between neurocognitive variables and clinical subgroups.

Both BD-I diagnosis and elevated presenting polarity were related to impairments in verbal memory, with elevated presenting polarity explaining more of the variance in this cognitive domain (22.5%). History of psychosis and BD-I diagnosis were both related to impairment in semantic fluency, with history of psychosis explaining more of the variance (11.6%).

In conclusion, poor performance in verbal memory appears to be associated with an elevated presenting polarity, while poor performance in semantic fluency appears to be associated with a lifetime history of psychosis.

### Clinical characteristics influencing age at onset in psychotic disorders [^115QA2Ek]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Age at onset of psychosis may carry clinical significance across psychotic disorders and appears to be associated with specific genetic abnormalities.

- **Methods**: We used the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), to examine clinical characteristics contributing to age at onset variability in patients with schizophrenia (n = 80), schizoaffective disorder (n = 61), and bipolar disorder with psychotic features (n = 92).

- **Results**: Age at onset did not differ across DSM-IV diagnostic groups. Multiple regression analyses revealed that comorbid lifetime cannabis, but not alcohol, abuse/dependence was associated with a statistically significant 3 years earlier age at onset of psychosis. Patients developed cannabis abuse/dependence an additional 3 years before psychosis. Patients with comorbid lifetime panic disorder also had a 4-year earlier age at onset of psychosis. The effects of panic disorder and cannabis abuse/dependence were independent of one another.

- **Conclusions**: Early onset of psychosis, regardless of the specific DSM-IV diagnosis, is characterized by differential clinical features, notably a history of lifetime cannabis abuse/dependence. Panic disorder comorbidity is also associated with earlier age at onset of psychosis. Our findings indicate that examination of clinical and biological characteristics of patients with psychosis, regardless of DSM-IV diagnosis, can uncover relevant information.

### Differences in symptomatic presentation and cognitive performance among participants with LATE-NC compared to FTLD-TDP [^111eHUnW]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is aberrantly aggregated and phosphorylated in frontotemporal lobar degeneration of the TDP-43 type (FTLD-TDP) and in limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC). We examined data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center to compare clinical features of autopsy-confirmed LATE-NC and FTLD-TDP. A total of 265 LATE-NC and 92 FTLD-TDP participants were included. Cognitive and behavioral symptoms were compared, stratified by level of impairment based on global clinical dementia rating (CDR) score.

LATE-NC participants were older at death, more likely to carry APOE ε4, more likely to have Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, and had lower (i.e. less severe) final CDR global scores than those with FTLD-TDP. Participants with FTLD-TDP were more likely to present with primary progressive aphasia or behavior problems such as apathy, disinhibition, and personality changes. Among participants with final CDR scores of 2–3, those with LATE-NC were more likely to have visuospatial impairment, delusions, and/or visual hallucinations. These differences were robust after sensitivity analyses excluding older (≥ 80 years at death), LATE-NC stage 3, or severe Alzheimer cases. Overall, FTLD-TDP was more globally severe and affected younger participants, whereas psychoses were more common in LATE-NC.

### A voxel- and source-based morphometry analysis of grey matter volume differences in very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis [^112UDmMo]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (VLOSLP) is associated with significant burden. Its clinical importance is increasing as the global population of older adults rises. However, due to limited research in this population, the neurobiological underpinnings of VLOSP remain insufficiently clarified. This study addresses this knowledge gap using novel morphometry techniques to investigate grey matter volume (GMV) differences between VLOSLP and healthy older adults, as well as their correlations with neuropsychological scores.

- **Methods**: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated whole-brain GMV differences between 35 individuals with VLOSLP (mean age 76.7, 26 female) and 36 healthy controls (mean age 75.7, 27 female) using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and supplementary source-based morphometry (SBM) on high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MRI images. Additionally, we assessed the relationships between GMV differences and cognitive function using an extensive neuropsychological battery.

- **Results**: VBM showed lower GMV in the thalamus, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left insula in patients with VLOSLP compared to healthy controls. SBM revealed lower thalamo-temporal GMV in patients with VLOSLP. Patients with VLOSLP demonstrated impairments in processing speed, selective attention, mental flexibility, working memory, verbal memory, semantic fluency, and confrontation naming. Significant correlations between thalamic volumes and memory function were found within the group of individuals with VLOSLP, whereas no significant associations were found in the healthy controls.

### Delusion symptoms are associated with ApoE epsilon4 allelic variant at the early stage of Alzheimer's disease with late onset [^115Q7kbP]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with mixed cognitive and behavioral clinical manifestations. The possession of the apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) epsilon4 allelic variant is one of the most important risk factors for developing late-onset AD (LOAD). In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the entire range of behavioral symptoms, cognitive deficit, sociodemographic characteristics, and ApoE epsilon4 allele possession using multivariate logistic regression models in LOAD patients.

Patients included (n = 171) were consecutively admitted to a memory clinic for the first diagnostic visit. Levels of behavior and cognition during the last month were assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Mini-Mental State Examination. The presence of clinically significant psychosis, delusions, and hallucinations at the early stage of the illness, from onset to the first visit, was measured with diagnostic criteria.

ApoE epsilon4 allele possession was associated with increased levels of delusions within the last month from the first visit (OR 1.23; 95% CI 1.01–1.50; P < 0.05) and with the presence of categorical delusions at the early stage until the first visit (OR 3.11; 95% CI 1.21–8.01; P < 0.02). In this study, which considers the entire range of behavioral expressions in LOAD patients at the early stage of the illness, the relationship between behavior and ApoE epsilon4 allele is confirmed for delusions only.
