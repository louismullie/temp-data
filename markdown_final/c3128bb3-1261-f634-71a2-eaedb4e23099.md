## Question

4 generation cephalosporin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about fourth-generation cephalosporins, specifically cefepime, including their definition, spectrum, clinical uses, safety, cross-reactivity with penicillins, resistance considerations, and stewardship guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the class and its prototypical agent. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic and microbiologic properties that distinguish it from earlier generations. Next, I will review clinical indications and guideline-supported roles. After that, I need to examine safety signals, including neurotoxicity and mortality concerns. I will then assess allergy cross-reactivity and how side-chain chemistry changes practice. Finally, I should integrate resistance patterns and stewardship recommendations to synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach to use.

> Let me first confirm the definition and timeline. Fourth-generation cephalosporins were introduced in 1994, with cefepime as the prototypical agent, and they are classified among critically important antimicrobials by WHO due to their role in treating serious multidrug-resistant infections, which frames both their value and the stewardship imperative around their use [^113K8Vxs].

> I need to check the core pharmacologic and microbiologic features that set cefepime apart. Structurally, cefepime is a zwitterion with rapid outer-membrane penetration, enhanced affinity for penicillin-binding proteins, and greater stability against many beta-lactamases, including inducible AmpC, which underpins activity against organisms like Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii that can inactivate third-generation agents via derepressed AmpC production [^112m366V] [^1125NDs3]. Hold on, I should verify the caveat: while cefepime is less prone to AmpC hydrolysis, an inoculum effect can still blunt activity in high-burden infections, so source control and clinical judgment remain essential when treating AmpC producers [^1125NDs3].

> Next, I should review the clinical indications where cefepime is supported. For complicated intra-abdominal infections, cefepime plus metronidazole is a recommended empiric option, particularly in higher-risk patients, given its broader Gram-negative spectrum and activity against AmpC producers, though it lacks anaerobic coverage and must be paired with metronidazole [^115PvkqB] [^114K6TrV]. For febrile neutropenia, monotherapy with cefepime or a carbapenem is acceptable, and cefepime has been shown to be as effective as combination regimens in some studies, though I should note the older, lower-credibility evidence base for that specific comparison [^117P9vrz] [^115ixwiC]. In complicated urinary tract infections, including sepsis, third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins are preferred empiric choices depending on severity and local resistance risks, with cefepime reasonable when broader Gram-negative coverage is needed [^1144icsw] [^116FkURv]. For severe nosocomial infections such as HAP/VAP, cefepime is commonly used empirically, though I should confirm that local antibiograms and patient-specific factors guide selection and that combination therapy is not routinely beneficial unless risk factors for resistant pathogens are present [^113bjTRF].

> I will now examine safety, and I need to be careful not to jump to conclusions. Historically, a meta-analysis suggested increased all-cause mortality with cefepime compared with other beta-lactams, which triggered concern and regulatory review; however, subsequent analyses questioned methodology and emphasized that when dosed and monitored appropriately, cefepime remains a valuable agent, so the signal should be interpreted with caution and in context of proper PK/PD dosing and patient selection [^115dCnye] [^116oVvw4]. But wait, what if neurotoxicity is the real, actionable risk? Cefepime neurotoxicity, including encephalopathy, myoclonus, and seizures, is well described, particularly in renal impairment or overdose, and can be severe enough to require dialysis; dose adjustment and vigilance for neurologic changes are critical, and symptoms typically resolve with drug cessation and supportive care [^113EJS4v] [^115PbRv4]. I should double-check hepatic injury: while rare, cefepime-associated liver injury has been reported, including pediatric cases, reinforcing the need to monitor for jaundice, pruritus, and transaminase elevations during therapy [^112nKouu].

> Now, allergy cross-reactivity with penicillins — this is where side-chain chemistry changes practice. Let me verify the modern consensus: cross-reactivity is largely driven by R1 side-chain similarity rather than the beta-lactam core, and third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins have very low cross-reactivity with penicillins, typically less than 1% in contemporary cohorts, compared with higher rates seen with first-generation agents [^111QnJQx] [^115y26Vx]. I should confirm guideline direction: for patients with nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, direct challenge with a dissimilar cephalosporin is reasonable; for anaphylactic histories, cephalosporin skin testing to the intended agent is suggested before administration, recognizing that skin testing is less validated for cephalosporins than for penicillin and that negative skin tests should be followed by a graded challenge [^112Fk4uX] [^114yvZ69]. Hold on, I should verify cefepime's side chain: cefepime shares the aminothiazolyl-oxime R1 side chain with ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, so in patients with reactions to those agents, choosing a cephalosporin with a dissimilar R1 side chain is prudent to minimize cross-reactivity risk [^113yw1Hu].

> Next, I should review resistance patterns and stewardship. Extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in Enterobacterales is predominantly mediated by ESBLs and plasmid-mediated AmpCs, and cefepime's stability against some AmpCs can be advantageous, though ESBL-mediated resistance remains a limitation and mandates susceptibility-guided therapy and local antibiogram awareness [^113K8Vxs] [^1125NDs3]. Let me reconsider the role of cefepime in ESBL infections: while older data suggested potential utility in select contexts, contemporary guidance favors carbapenems for severe ESBL infections, reserving cefepime for susceptible isolates or alternative scenarios to protect carbapenem activity, which aligns with stewardship principles [^111nXUVJ] [^115JhTEJ]. I should confirm that cefepime is not a strong inducer of AmpC and may be useful against derepressed AmpC producers when dosed adequately and combined with source control, but this remains a nuanced, case-by-case decision [^1125NDs3].

> I need to ensure dosing and PK/PD considerations are explicit. Cefepime is renally cleared with a half-life around 2 hours in healthy adults, and efficacy correlates with time above MIC; in renal impairment, dose reduction is essential to mitigate accumulation and neurotoxicity, and in severe infections, extended or continuous infusion strategies can optimize exposure, though I should acknowledge that much of the continuous infusion data are based on pharmacodynamic modeling rather than large randomized trials [^116Sme78] [^116UwxJ8]. Wait, let me verify the practical implication: for patients with fluctuating renal function, frequent reassessment of creatinine and dose titration are mandatory to avoid neurotoxicity while preserving efficacy [^113EJS4v].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical approach. Fourth-generation cephalosporins, with cefepime as the representative, offer broad Gram-positive and Gram-negative coverage, including reliable activity against Pseudomonas and many AmpC producers, making them valuable for severe nosocomial infections, febrile neutropenia, complicated intra-abdominal infections when combined with metronidazole, and complicated urinary tract infections, particularly when broader empiric coverage is warranted pending cultures [^112m366V] [^115PvkqB] [^1144icsw]. I should confirm that use should be guided by local antibiograms, severity of illness, and patient-specific factors, with de-escalation when possible to limit selection pressure and resistance amplification [^1144icsw]. For allergy risk, prioritize side-chain dissimilarity and use risk-stratified pathways, reserving skin testing for high-risk histories and recognizing the very low cross-reactivity with penicillins in modern practice, which supports expanded beta-lactam access when clinically indicated [^111QnJQx] [^113LWyML].

---

Fourth-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefepime) are **broad-spectrum β-lactams** with **enhanced Gram-negative activity** (including Pseudomonas) and improved β-lactamase stability, especially against inducible AmpC producers [^112m366V] [^1125NDs3]. They are used for severe infections such as febrile neutropenia, HAP/VAP, cUTI, and intra-abdominal infections, but **require dose adjustment in renal impairment** due to neurotoxicity risk [^116Sme78] [^113EJS4v]. Cross-reactivity with penicillins is low (< 1%) and guided by side-chain similarity; avoid in severe IgE-mediated cephalosporin allergy and use caution in renal failure [^111QnJQx] [^113H1HaT] [^113EJS4v]. They are not active against MRSA, VRE, or ESBL producers, so susceptibility testing is essential [^notfound].

---

## Chemical structure and pharmacological properties

Fourth-generation cephalosporins retain the **β-lactam ring** fused to a dihydrothiazine ring, with side-chain modifications that enhance Gram-negative penetration and β-lactamase stability [^115uStQn]. Cefepime is a zwitterion with rapid outer-membrane penetration and high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins, contributing to broad-spectrum activity [^112m366V].

---

## Antimicrobial spectrum of activity

Fourth-generation cephalosporins exhibit a **broad spectrum of activity**, including:

- **Gram-positive bacteria**: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and Enterococcus species (limited activity).

- **Gram-negative bacteria**: Enhanced activity against Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and inducible AmpC-producing organisms (e.g. Enterobacter spp. Citrobacter spp.) [^112m366V] [^1125NDs3].

- **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**: Reliable activity, making cefepime a preferred agent for empiric coverage in severe infections [^112m366V].

- **Notable limitations**: No activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organisms [^114HXRzj].

---

## Clinical indications

Fourth-generation cephalosporins are indicated for **severe infections**, including:

- **Febrile neutropenia**: Monotherapy or combination therapy due to broad-spectrum coverage, including Pseudomonas [^117P9vrz].

- **Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)**: Empiric therapy, particularly when Pseudomonas coverage is required [^notfound].

- **Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI)**: Including pyelonephritis, especially in the presence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms [^1144icsw].

- **Intra-abdominal infections**: Often combined with metronidazole for anaerobic coverage [^114K6TrV].

- **Skin and soft tissue infections**: Particularly when Gram-negative coverage is indicated [^notfound].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics

Cefepime exhibits linear pharmacokinetics with a half-life of approximately 2 hours and is primarily eliminated unchanged via renal excretion [^116Sme78]. Its pharmacodynamic target is **time above MIC (fT > MIC)**; continuous or extended infusions can optimize exposure in severe infections [^116UwxJ8].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

Fourth-generation cephalosporins are generally well tolerated; however, **neurotoxicity** — including encephalopathy, seizures, and myoclonus — has been reported, particularly in patients with renal impairment or at high doses [^113EJS4v] [^115PbRv4]. Dose adjustment is essential in renal impairment to mitigate this risk [^113EJS4v]. Other adverse effects include gastrointestinal disturbances, hypersensitivity reactions, and rare hematologic abnormalities [^111UzDsn].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustment is critical to prevent neurotoxicity [^113EJS4v].

- **Allergy cross-reactivity**: Low (< 1%) with penicillins, guided by side-chain similarity; avoid in severe IgE-mediated cephalosporin allergy [^111QnJQx] [^114B89En].

- **Resistance**: Not active against MRSA, VRE, or ESBL producers; susceptibility testing is essential [^114HXRzj].

## Comparison with other cephalosporin generations

| **Generation** | **Spectrum of activity** | **Notable features** | **Examples** |
|-|-|-|-|
| First | Narrow-spectrum; Gram-positive coverage | High cross-reactivity with penicillins | Cefazolin, cephalexin |
| Second | Expanded Gram-negative coverage | Limited Pseudomonas activity | Cefuroxime, cefoxitin |
| Third | Broad Gram-negative coverage; some Pseudomonas activity | Lower penicillin cross-reactivity | Ceftriaxone, ceftazidime |
| Fourth | Broad-spectrum; enhanced Gram-negative and Pseudomonas activity | Improved β-lactamase stability | Cefepime |

---

Fourth-generation cephalosporins, particularly cefepime, offer **broad-spectrum activity** with enhanced Gram-negative and Pseudomonas coverage, making them valuable for severe infections. Clinicians must balance efficacy with safety, particularly regarding neurotoxicity in renal impairment, and adhere to susceptibility testing to guide appropriate use.

Introduction

Third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins are broad-spectrum β-lactam antimicrobial agents classified as critically important for human medicine by the World Health Organization due to their use in the management and treatment of serious infections caused by multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Third-generation cephalosporins were introduced for medical use in the early 1980s, with fourth-generation cephalosporins introduced in 1994; since then, resistance to these drugs has increased. Resistance to these extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) is widespread worldwide in Enterobacterales from both humans and animals, and is mediated predominantly by two main groups of inactivating enzymes: extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases (AmpCs).

### Cefepime or carbapenem treatment for febrile neutropenia as a single agent is as effective as a combination of 4th-generation cephalosporin + aminoglycosides: comparative study [^117P9vrz]. American Journal of Hematology (2002). Low credibility.

1998, a consensus meeting was held in Miyazaki, Japan, to develop an approach to management of febrile neutropenia (FN). The K-HOT study group decided to examine whether this proposal was applicable to clinical practice in a multicenter study. Patients who developed fever with neutrophil counts < 1,000/microL were randomized to receive either a single antibiotic, cefepime or one of the carbapenems, or a combination of cefepime and an aminoglycoside. Patients who became afebrile within the first 3 days were continued on the same treatment. Patients who remained febrile were switched to a combination regimen if they were randomized to receive a single agent, and patients on combination medication were changed from cefepime to another cephalosporin. A total of 165 patients were entered into the trial. One hundred fifty-three patients were evaluable for response. The average age was 52 years, and 70% of the patients had acute leukemia. Severe neutropenia, defined as < 100/microL at the time of FN, was seen in 62% of the patients on entry and during the course of treatment 71% of patients experienced neutrophil counts of < 100/microL. Microbiologically documented infection was seen in 6.5% for monotherapy, and 10.5% for a combination treatment, and fever of unknown origin occurred in 75.3% and 59.2% of the patients in each regimen, respectively. Excellent to good response was seen in two-thirds of the patients in all treatment groups. Adverse events were minimal, and three early deaths were observed at days 9, 16, and 16 among patients treated with a single antibiotic and three in the combination regimen group at days 14, 15, and 20. These results indicate that cefepime or a carbapenem alone is as effective as a combination of cefepime and an aminoglycoside for treating FN.

### Peripheral brain: cephalosporins… [^115uStQn]. publications.aap.org (2003). Low credibility.

After completing this article, readers should be able to: In the mid-1940s, products of the mold. Cephalosporium acremonium were noted to inhibit the growth of bacteria in seawater contaminated by sewage. A decade later, cephalosporin C, the parent compound of the cephalosporins, was isolated from C acremonium. The first cephalosporin, cephalothin, was marketed in 1964. A large number of cephalosporins were developed subsequently, and today there are four generations of cephalosporins and more than 20 cephalosporin antibiotics. This review examines the properties of the first four generations of cephalosporin antibiotics, focusing on those used commonly in children. The structure of the cephalosporin antibiotic is a beta-lactam ring fused to a six-membered dihydrothiazine ring. Substitutions at positions 1, 3, and 7 of this cephem nucleus influence the chemical properties and antimicrobial spectrum of the resultant antibiotic.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^114B89En]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Cephalosporin hypersensitivity pathway — patients with a history of reported hypersensitivity to cephalosporins or penicillin (penicillin class antibiotic [PCN]) outlines reaction types and management. For Type IV hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) with entities such as serum sickness, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, hemolytic anemia, or drug fever, avoid using PCNs, cephalosporins, and carbapenems (not amenable to desensitization), use alternative agents by microbial coverage, and if clinical indication for a beta-lactam, involve the Infectious Disease service and Allergy if available. For Type I (IgE-mediated) HSR with reaction to 1st/2nd Generation, it is OK to administer 3rd/4th/5th generation cephalosporin if dissimilar side chains by Test Dose Procedure, or use carbapenem, or use alternative agents by microbial coverage; if a PCN or a 1st/2nd generation cephalosporin is the preferred therapy, or one alternative agent is substandard, PCN skin testing is indicated and call/consult Allergy if available. For Type I (IgE-mediated) HSR with reaction to 3rd/4th Generation, it is OK to administer PCN or cephalosporin if dissimilar side chains by Test Dose Procedure, or use carbapenem, or use alternative agents by microbial coverage. For mild reaction (minor rash not hives; maculopapular rash) and for an unknown reaction in which the patient denies mucosal involvement, skin desquamation, organ involvement, or need for medical evaluation, it is OK to use a different generation cephalosporin and cephalosporin with dissimilar side chains, or use penicillin by Test Dose Procedure, or use carbapenem, or use alternative agents by microbial coverage.

### Cefepime microbiologic profile and update [^112m366V]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The evolution of the cephalosporin class of antibiotics through modifications of the basic cephem structure has resulted in a new generation with improved antibacterial activity. Cefepime is a prototypic agent of this new class of fourth generation cephalosporins.

Objective

To review the microbiologic profile of cefepime.

Results

Cefepime, which is a zwitterion, has a net neutral charge that allows it to penetrate the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria faster than third generation cephalosporins. It is more stable against beta-lactamases because of the lower affinity of the enzymes for cefepime when compared with third generation cephalosporins. As a result of these structural attributes, cefepime has in vitro activity against pathogens that are prevalent in pediatric infections. This agent offers the advantage of Gram-positive coverage similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, as well as good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and many enteric bacilli that are resistant to third generation cephalosporins, including clinical isolates of Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii.

Conclusions

Based on its spectrum of activity cefepime is an option for the treatment of pediatric infections caused by susceptible pathogens.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^113P9GHM]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

On the subject of cross-reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins, the practice parameter suggests again stratifying patients on the basis of anaphylactic versus nonanaphylactic histories, as well as determining whether the penicillin allergy is confirmed or unconfirmed. For patients with a history of an unconfirmed nonanaphylactic penicillin allergy, any cephalosporin can be routinely administered without testing or additional precautions. In contrast, for those rare patients with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin, a non–cross-reactive cephalosporin can be administered routinely without prior testing.

Despite the simplified approach to cephalosporin evaluation, the extent to which this approach is incorporated into allergy practice remains unclear. Therefore, we surveyed the members of the Adverse Reactions to Drugs, Biologics, and Latex (ARDBL) Committee of the AAAAI between February and April 2023 to assess current practices of cephalosporin allergy testing using real case examples.

### A unique class of Zn-binding serine-based PBPs underlies cephalosporin resistance and sporogenesis in Clostridioides difficile [^115mgpG2]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

C lostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a condition where the anaerobic, spore-forming, bacterium C. difficile infects the large intestine, producing symptoms that range from mild-diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. As the most common hospital-acquired infection, the pathogenesis of CDI is well-understood. Initially, antibiotics are administered for an unrelated infection or prophylaxis, causing the gut flora diversity to diminish. Without competition in the large intestine, C. difficile can easily proliferate, secreting toxins that cause cell death. The primary risk factor for CDI are broad-spectrum antibiotics, specifically those with weak activity against C. difficile and strong activity against other gut bacteria. Currently, 3rd generation cephalosporins and clindamycin present the highest odds ratio for CDI (3.20, 2.86), followed by 2nd and 4th generation cephalosporins (2.23, 2.14). Other risk factors include treatment duration, age, overall health, and diet. Specifically, recent studies have found Zn 2+ -rich diets increase the likelihood and severity of CDI –.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115y26Vx]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Cross-reactivity with cephalosporins — risk levels and anaphylaxis — notes that third-generation cephalosporins have lower cross-reactivity with IgE-mediated penicillin-allergic patients (< 1%) compared with first- and second-generation cephalosporins (range: 1%–8%). Anaphylaxis secondary to cephalosporins among persons who report a penicillin allergy is estimated at a rate of one per 52,000 persons, and Kaiser health care system data reported that among 3,313 patients with self-reported cephalosporin allergy who received a cephalosporin, no cases of anaphylaxis were reported. Use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems is safe for patients without a history of IgE-mediated symptoms from penicillin during the preceding 10 years.

### Prevention of group B streptococcal early-onset disease in newborns: ACOG committee opinion, number 797 [^113H1HaT]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion 797 — cephalosporins for reported penicillin allergy with low risk or uncertain severity: Because severe allergic reactions are uncommon, first-generation cephalosporins (ie, cefazolin) are recommended for women whose reported penicillin allergy indicates a low risk of anaphylaxis or uncertain severity. Older studies found that 8–10% of individuals with a penicillin allergy had significant allergic reactions to cephalosporins, whereas a more recent study estimated only 4.3% with first- and second-generation agents and less than 1% with third- and fourth-generation agents. Although cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin with a unique configuration and very low cross-reactivity with penicillin, GBS remains highly susceptible to cefazolin, which achieves high intraamniotic and fetal blood levels, and a first-generation cephalosporin such as cefazolin is preferable to third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins for intrapartum GBS prophylaxis.

### Diagnosis and management of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins [^1142FnYh]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Cephalosporins are one of the most commonly prescribed classes of antibiotics. Immediate IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with use of a specific cephalosporin, as a cross-reaction between different cephalosporins or as a cross-reaction to other β-lactam antibiotics, namely, penicillin. Historically, frequent reports of anaphylaxis following administration of first- and second-generation cephalosporins to patients with a history of penicillin allergy led to the belief of a high degree of allergic cross-reactivity. More recent evidence reveals a significantly lower risk of cross-reactivity between penicillins and the newer-generation cephalosporins. The current thought is that a shared side chain, rather than the β-lactam ring structure, is the determining factor in immunologic cross-reactivity. Understanding the chemical structure of these agents has allowed us to identify the allergenic determinants for penicillin; however, the exact allergenic determinants of cephalosporins are less well understood. For this reason, standardized diagnostic skin testing is not available for cephalosporins as it is for penicillin. Nevertheless, skin testing to the cephalosporin in question, using a nonirritating concentration, provides additional information, which can further guide the work-up of a patient suspected of having an allergy to that drug. Together, the history and the skin test results can assist the allergist in the decision to recommend continued drug avoidance or to perform a graded challenge versus an induction of tolerance procedure.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^116LfnBq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Since the publication of the 2022 Drug Allergy Practice Parameters (DAPP) of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI), it is unclear the extent to which the simplified and risk-stratified evaluation of cephalosporin allergy has been incorporated into allergy practice.

Objective

We aimed to assess current cephalosporin allergy testing practices using real case examples.

Methods

An 18-question REDCap survey was sent to the 136 members of the Adverse Reactions to Drugs, Biologics and Latex (ARDBL) Committee of the AAAAI between February and April 2023.

Results

Forty-six (33.8%) ARDBL members completed the survey after 3 email attempts. Most practiced in the United States (32, 69.6%), 6 (13.0%) in Canada, and the rest in Europe and Asia. Almost half (47.7%) reported that the 2022 DAPP had increased their use of direct oral challenge, and 91% would prescribe cephalosporins in the setting of low-risk penicillin allergy history without testing. For low-risk cephalosporin reactions, 68% would perform a direct oral challenge with the culprit drug. In severe immediate penicillin reactions, 23% would evaluate with penicillin skin test before assessing cephalosporin allergy. For cephalosporin-related anaphylaxis, 48% would perform cephalosporin-based tests. For perioperative anaphylaxis with cefazolin, 57% would perform cephalosporin-based tests. For positive skin test result to cefazolin, 79% chose to avoid the culprit drug with follow-up oral challenge to a structurally dissimilar cephalosporin.

Conclusion

Increased uptake of direct oral challenge represents the initial impact of the 2022 DAPP. However, there is significant variation in testing practices of cephalosporin allergy even among drug allergy experts, reflecting a need for a firmer evidence base to guide consensus around testing for higher-risk reactions.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^112fxd3s]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). High credibility.

Direct treatment approach for ceftriaxone — third-generation cephalosporins in low-risk histories: Among persons with confirmed IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, the level of cross-reactivity with third-generation cephalosporins is low. If a patient has a low-risk history for an IgE-mediated penicillin allergy, ambulatory settings often treat with third-generation cephalosporins without further testing. Low-risk history includes one nonspecific symptom (e.g., gastrointestinal intolerance, headache, fatigue, or nonurticarial rash), and examples listed in Box 2 include gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, pruritis without rash, localized rash, delayed onset rash (> 24 hours), symptoms unknown, family history of penicillin or another drug allergy, and a recorded allergy the patient denies. In addition, a family history of penicillin or β-lactam allergy alone is not a contraindication for treatment with β-lactam antibiotics.

### The use of cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients: a literature review [^117HEXUX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The practice of avoiding cephalosporin administration to penicillin-allergic patients persists despite the low rate of cross reactions between both groups of antibiotics.

Objective

The purpose of this literature review is to evaluate the published evidence regarding the commonly held belief that patients with a history of an allergic reaction to penicillin have a significantly increased risk of an allergic reaction to cephalosporins.

Materials and Methods

Articles were identified through a computerized search of MEDLINE from 1950 to the present using the search terms "penicillin$", "cephalosporin$", "allerg$", "hypersensitivity", and "cross-react$". All articles were reviewed, and additional sources cited in them were added to the literature review.

Results

Penicillins have a cross allergy with first-generation cephalosporins (odds ratio 4.8; confidence interval 3.7–6.2) and a negligible cross allergy with second-generation cephalosporins (odds ratio 1.1; confidence interval 0.6–2.1). Laboratory and cohort studies confirm that the R1 side chain is responsible for this cross reactivity. Overall cross reactivity between penicillins and cephalosporins is lower than previously reported, though there is a strong association between amoxicillin and ampicillin with first- and second-generation cephalosporins that share a similar R1 side chain.

Conclusions

Although a myth persists that approximately 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy will have an allergic reaction if given a cephalosporin, the overall cross-reactivity rate is approximately 1% when using first-generation cephalosporins or cephalosporins with similar R1 side chains. However, a single study reported the prevalence of cross reactivity with cefadroxil as high as 27%. For penicillin-allergic patients, the use of third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins or cephalosporins with dissimilar side chains than the offending penicillin carries a negligible risk of cross allergy.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^1163KCnb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a survey on current allergy clinic practices in relation to evaluation of cephalosporin allergy through the special-interest ARDBL Committee. At the time of our research, the committee included 136 members, who met both virtually and in person on average 4 times per year (including in person at the annual AAAAI meeting) to discuss and plan priorities in research, education, and clinical practice in drug allergy.

An 18-question descriptive survey in REDCap was sent to ARDBL Committee members, with 3 survey attempts made between February and April 2023. The survey included questions on demographics (country of practice, years in practice, types of drugs and reaction seen, availability of testing, etc) as well as current practices regarding cephalosporin allergy tests. In order to evaluate the latter, we used real case examples after each case presentation (high or low history of receipt of penicillin or cephalosporin), the survey participants were asked to answer the following question: "How do you evaluate this patient for cephalosporin allergy?" Multiple test options were offered, and more than one option could be chosen.

Five case scenarios of patients with previous reactions to β-lactams were presented to survey participants for their opinions on how they would evaluate and manage each case. The cases were as follows:
A. Low-risk history with penicillin.
B. Low-risk history with cephalosporin (cephalexin).
C. High-risk penicillin history.
D. High-risk history with cephalosporin (ceftriaxone).
E. High-risk history with cephalosporin (cefazolin).

Participants were asked to choose the preferred test for each case, specifically focused on answering the questions of future cephalosporin receipt and testing. Several answer choices for tests were offered — for example, penicillin skin test, penicillin oral challenge, cephalosporin skin test, or oral challenge with a dissimilar cephalosporin. Of note, we deliberately chose the term "oral challenge" in order to allow the choice of this test option both with or without a preceding skin test. The term "direct oral challenge" (DOC) was only used in retrospect, when the chosen evaluation options did not include skin test before oral challenge.

Cephalosporin allergy evaluation — Nonirritating concentrations of commonly used cephalosporins have been described, and 2 mg/mL is often used; a positive cephalosporin skin test suggests drug-specific IgE antibodies, and the patient should receive a skin test–negative alternative cephalosporin or alternate antibiotic, or undergo desensitization, whereas a negative cephalosporin skin test should be followed by a drug challenge to confirm tolerance; oral cephalosporins are not sterile and therefore cannot be used for intradermal skin testing, and skin testing with cephalexin has no clear utility; non–beta-lactam antibiotics may also be considered, but they may result in added patient morbidity, mortality, and cost of care.

### Efficacy and safety of cefepime: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115dCnye]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with enhanced coverage against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We did a systematic review of randomised trials that compared cefepime with another beta-lactam antibiotic, alone or with the addition of a non-beta-lactam antibiotic to both study groups. We searched Central, PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, new US Food and Drug Administration drug applications, conference proceedings, and references of the included studies. Two reviewers independently did the search and data extraction. 57 trials were included. All-cause mortality-the primary outcome-was higher with cefepime than other beta-lactams (risk ratio [RR] 1.26 [95% CI 1.08–1.49]). Sensitivity analyses by the trials' methodological quality revealed higher RRs for trials reporting adequate allocation-sequence generation (1.52 [1.20–1.92]) and allocation concealment (1.36 [1.09–1.70]). Baseline risk factors for mortality were similar. No significant differences between groups in treatment failure, superinfection, or adverse events were found. This Review provides evidence and offers possible explanations for increased mortality among patients treated with cefepime in randomised trials.

### Drug allergy: a 2022 practice parameter update [^115SLtyt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Cephalosporin immediate reactions — diagnostic approach and testing: immediate allergic reactions to cephalosporins appear largely to be related to antigenic responses to the R1 group/side chains rather than the core beta-lactam portion of the molecule or R2 group/side chains, and for immediate reactions to cephalosporins, we suggest stratifying patients based on anaphylactic reactions versus nonanaphylactic reactions. For those patients with nonanaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, a direct challenge should be performed for a cephalosporin with dissimilar side chains to determine tolerance, whereas for administration of cephalosporins with similar side chains and for the less common anaphylactic reaction history, a negative cephalosporin skin test to a parenteral cephalosporin should be performed prior to challenge to determine tolerance. Urticaria fulfilling "1-1-1" criterion (appearance within 1 hour after the first dose and regression within 1 day and occurred within 1 year) suggests a high likelihood of having a positive skin test.

### Hospital-based strategies for combating resistance [^113eqrjb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Selective pressures generated by the indiscriminate use of beta-lactam antibiotics have resulted in increased bacterial resistance across all beta-lactams classes. In particular, the use of third-generation cephalosporins has been associated with the emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Conversely, beta-lactams (e.g., cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin-sulbactam) have not demonstrated such strong selective pressures. Chief among institutional strategies to control outbreaks of multidrug-resistant bacteria are infection-control measures and interventional programs designed to minimize the use of antimicrobial agents that are associated with strong relationships between use and resistance. Successful programs include antimicrobial stewardship programs (prospective audit and feedback), formulary interventions (therapeutic substitutions), formulary restrictions, and vigilant infection control. Fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime, have proven to be useful substitutes for third-generation cephalosporins, as a part of an overall strategy to minimize the selection and impact of antimicrobial-resistant organisms in hospital settings.

Cephalosporins — general epidemiology and reaction patterns: Cephalosporin adverse drug reactions (ADRs) affect about 0.5% to 2.5% of patients, and although cephalosporin allergy is approximately 10-fold less common than penicillin allergy, it remains one of the most commonly reported drug allergies in the United States. Cephalosporins can elicit IgE-mediated reactions characterized by urticaria, angioedema, rhinitis, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis and may less frequently lead to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) and isolated eosinophilia.

### Cephalosporin allergy [^112rgep1]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Allergic reactions to cephalosporins may occur because of sensitization to cephalosporin determinants shared with penicillin or to unique cephalosporin haptens. The exact nature of the haptenic determinants resulting from the degradation of currently available cephalosporins is incompletely understood. Cephalosporin skin testing or specific IgE immunoassays have limited clinical utility. Patients with a history of allergy to cephalosporins or penicillin may be at increased risk for a reaction to cephalosporins. Skin testing for an allergy to penicillin may be helpful in patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have a clinical indication for cephalosporin use. Most of these patients have negative tests and should not be at increased risk for a reaction to cephalosporins.

### Cephalosporin allergy: current understanding and future challenges [^115G3Xxy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Cephalosporins are commonly used antibiotics both in hospitalized patients and in outpatients. Hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins are becoming increasingly common with a wide range of immunopathologic mechanisms. Cephalosporins are one of the leading causes for perioperative anaphylaxis and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. Patients allergic to cephalosporins tend to tolerate cephalosporins with disparate R1 side chains but may react to other beta-lactams with common R1 side chains. Skin testing for cephalosporins has not been well validated but appears to have a good negative predictive value for cephalosporins with disparate R1 side chains. In vitro tests including basophil activation tests have lower sensitivity when compared with skin testing. Rapid drug desensitization procedures are safe and effective and have been used successfully for immediate and some nonimmediate cephalosporin reactions. Many gaps in knowledge still exist regarding cephalosporin hypersensitivity.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) without sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with suspected complicated UTI without sepsis, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than carbapenems and newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Other agents (e.g., trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin-clavulanate, first or second-generation cephalosporins) are less well studied but may be appropriate in select settings or situations for empiric oral treatment of cUTI.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^113WKhSr]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Cephalosporin antibiotics are commonly prescribed for a wide range of infections as a result of their effectiveness and broad-spectrum activity. These drugs rarely cause diverse immunologic reaction phenotypes across different age groups, including IgE-mediated reactions, benign T-cell–mediated exanthems as well as serum sickness–like, single organ damage, and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. At the same time, as a result of their common use, a cephalosporin allergy label is relevant for 1.3% to 1.7% of the general population in the United States.

Despite major progress in understanding more about reactions to cephalosporins, specific and validated testing strategies of cephalosporin allergy evaluation are less well defined. In the last few years, there is evidence that immediate allergic reactions to cephalosporins as well as their cross-reactivity with penicillin appears to be largely related to antigenic responses to R1 side chains rather than β-lactam ring cross-reactivity or R2 side chains. Data on cross-reactivity among delayed reaction types are not as well characterized.

With improvements in our understanding of cross-reactivity and reaction risk assessment, the joint 2022 Drug Allergy Practice Parameters (DAPP) of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) now advocate a simplified and risk-stratified evaluation for cephalosporin allergy.

For immediate reactions to cephalosporins, the 2022 practice parameter suggests stratifying patients on the basis of potential IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions versus nonanaphylactic reactions. For those patients with nonanaphylactic cephalosporin allergy, a direct challenge should be performed for a cephalosporin with dissimilar side chains to determine tolerance. In contrast, for administration of cephalosporins with similar side chains and for the less common anaphylactic reaction history, a negative cephalosporin skin test result to a parenteral cephalosporin is required before challenge to determine tolerance. Cephalosporin skin tests have not been validated and have lower sensitivities than penicillin, so ideally, negative results should always be followed by graded challenges.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases and clinical outcomes: current data [^115JhTEJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Nosocomial infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative bacteria complicate therapy and limit treatment options. However, the clinical significance of infections caused by ESBL-producing bacteria remains unclear. A critical examination of the literature provides divergent views of the effect of ESBL carriage on morbidity and mortality and suggests that ESBL production may have its most marked effect on ceftazidime. Effective strategies for the empirical and directed treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing pathogens include the use of carbapenems and, possibly, the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefepime. Studies indicate that the use of cefepime to treat serious nosocomial infections (e.g., bacteremia, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections) is associated with high rates of microbiological and clinical success. The probability of attaining time above the minimum inhibitory concentration targets of at least 70% of the dosing interval, an important pharmacodynamic indicator of clinical success, is higher with cefepime than with other antimicrobials against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains exhibiting ESBL phenotypes. However, for non-ESBL-producing strains, there is no difference in the time above the minimum inhibitory concentration between ceftazidime and cefepime. When used appropriately in institutional settings, cefepime reduces the overall use of cephalosporins, thereby decreasing selection pressure for presumptive ESBL-producing pathogens.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^111qpSf8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Second-generation cephalosporins are widely used in surgical prophylaxis and trauma. They have been used in the treatment of mild-to-moderate community-acquired infections, but limitations in their spectra and microbial resistance restrict their utility in complicated intra-abdominal infections.

Among third generation cephalosporins both subgroups with poor activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftizoxime) and with good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cefoperazone and ceftazidime) have been used in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections in association with metronidazole. Both cephalosporins acquired resistance in enterobacteriaceae and intrinsic resistance in Enterococci may limit cephalosporins use in high risk intra-abdominal infections especially in healt-care infections.

Cefepime is a 'fourth-generation' cephalosporin. It was introduced into clinical practice in 1994 and is used in association with metronidazole for the treatment of severe infections. Cefepime possesses higher in vitro activity than other extended-spectrum cephalosporins against common Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens and may be effective, in association with metronidazole, in high risk intra-abdominal infections. The results of a meta-analysis by Yahav et al. in 2007 indicated a potential increased mortality in patients treated with cefepime compared with patients treated with other β-lactam drugs. Caution in the use of cefepime should be adopted until new evidence on cefepime safety is available.

Key points
- Multiple antibiotic regimens have been used to eradicate carriage of group A Streptococcus in previous outbreaks.
- Regimen should be chosen on a case-by-case basis.
- Some regimens require antibiotic susceptibility test results prior to their use.
- Follow recommended guidance on preventing and treating GAS infections. Overview Multiple antibiotic regimens have been recommended for GAS carriage eradication in either
- 2002 U. S. guidelines for postpartum and post-surgical outbreaks
- Canada's guidelines for prevention and control of invasive GAS disease Several regimens have been used in previous outbreaks for GAS carriage eradication. First-line regimens GAS is universally susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin and cephalosporins. LTCFs and public health don't need to consider antibiotic susceptibility when selecting one of these treatment regimens. Universally susceptible antibiotic regimens, with dosages.

Benzathine penicillin G plus rifampin BPG: 600, 000 units for patients < 27 kilograms or 1, 200, 000 units for patients ≥ 27 kg intramuscular in a single dose Rifampin: 20 mg/kg/day oral in 2 divided doses for 4 days. 1st generation cephalosporins Cephalexin: 25–50 mg/kg/day in 2–4 divided doses for 10 days. Alternative regimens LTCFs and public health should only consider clindamycin or macrolides if the outbreak strain is documented as susceptible to these antibiotics. Clindamycin and macrolide resistance have been commonly reported. Among invasive disease isolates in 2023, 27% of GAS isolates were macrolide resistant and 26% of isolates were clindamycin resistant.

### Cefepime neurotoxicity in the intensive care unit: a cause of severe, underappreciated encephalopathy [^113EJS4v]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobials are increasingly prescribed in intensive care units (ICUs) because of the proliferation of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, is one of these antimicrobials commonly prescribed empirically for nosocomial infections. Because cefepime is predominantly renally excreted (85% unchanged), a reduction in renal function confers a proportional increase in the elimination half-life and reduction in total body clearance of cefepime. In patients with renal failure, cefepime can accumulate in both the blood and cerebrospinal fluid and reach toxic concentrations. Consequently, patients with renal failure who are treated with cefepime at relatively high doses are at risk of developing neurological symptoms that include seizures, hallucinations, confusion, myoclonus, and coma.

The terms 'encephalopathy' or 'delirium' generically describe cerebral dysfunction of some type, but most of the time they are used to characterize patients with a change in attention, perception and memory. These neurological manifestations are very poorly understood considering their high prevalence in the ICU. Given the pervasiveness of confounding causes of encephalopathy (for example infection, postoperative state, electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, uremia, shock, alcohol withdrawal, pain, hypercapnia, hypoxemia), elucidating the cause of 'altered mental status' or 'failure to awaken' in a patient in the ICU can be challenging. Despite this etiologic uncertainty, the encephalopathy often resolves. However, in persistent cases without readily apparent causation, assessment for potential medication toxicity may prove explanatory. Antibiotics can cause neurologic symptoms, including penicillins, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and metronidazole. In our recent experience, we have noted that cefepime neurotoxicity may be a particularly underappreciated phenomenon in ICUs.

In this study we aimed to describe the features of a cohort of patients with cefepime neurotoxicity.

High-dose cefepime-tazobactam (1:1; WCK 4282), a novel antibacterial combination consisting of the β-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam and a fourth-generation cephalosporin, is under clinical development for the treatment of serious Gram-negative infections. A quality control (QC) study was performed to establish disk diffusion and MIC ranges for cefepime-tazobactam for multiple QC reference strains. The cefepime-tazobactam QC ranges for a fixed tazobactam MIC of 8 μg/ml and disk diffusion (30/20-μg disk) test methods were approved by the CLSI Subcommittee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing in January 2015 and January 2016. These QC ranges will be important for accurate in vitro activity evaluations of cefepime-tazobactam when tested against clinical Gram-negative bacteria during clinical studies and routine patient care.

### Antibiotic prescribing after removal of EHR cephalosporin warning for penicillin allergy… [^1126CJgT]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

We selected these infections a priori based on prior studies4, 23, 24 and clinical input. Infections were identified based on positive laboratory results or diagnoses from encounters in the hospital or outpatient setting. ICD-10 diagnosis codes starting with A04. 7 were used to identify C difficile infection; A41. 02, A49. 02, B95. 62, or J15. 212 were used to identify MRSA infection; and Z16. 21 and Z16. 22 were used to identify VRE infection. We tested how the results changed when the main variables interacted with the other covariates as well as after adding effect modification of the 3-way interaction by adding the 4-way interactions with age, sex, and race/ethnicity. In addition, we tested whether the results were sensitive to different variable definitions by assigning the penicillin allergy on the date when the treatment was first dispensed or administered and including only each patient's first or last course in the model.

Analyses were conducted using SAS, version 7.

1. The same general pattern was present for oral and parenteral courses. Most cephalosporin courses were first generation, and the increase in use was mainly in this generation. The crude increase in the rate of prescribing of parenteral cephalosporins among patients with penicillin allergy at the intervention site was larger than that for oral cephalosporins, but the RROR was smaller because of a concurrent increase in use of parenteral cephalosporins at the comparison site. For models that included only oral or only parenteral courses, the RROR values ranged from 1. 52 to
2. 71 and 1. 20 to
3. 37, respectively.

The model with effect modification by age, sex, and race/ethnicity suggested that the change in the warning was associated with fewer changes in antibiotic use patterns for patients younger than 18 years.

### Identification and characterization of cefazolin-induced liver injury [^117Qh4Aw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Cephalosporin antibiotics are popular because they have a broad spectrum of activity and are generally well tolerated; however, cephalosporin-induced liver injury is considered rare. We describe a new syndrome associated with a single intravenous dose of cefazolin and the clinical features of cephalosporin-induced liver injury.

Methods

The Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Network collected detailed clinical data on 1212 patients with DILI between 2004 and 2012. We analyzed data from 41 patients in whom cephalosporins were implicated as primary agents of liver disease; 33 formally were adjudicated as having cephalosporin-induced DILI.

Results

Nineteen patients developed clinically apparent DILI after a single intravenous dose of cefazolin. All patients developed self-limited liver injury 3 to 23 days after receiving cefazolin during surgery-often during a minor outpatient procedure. The latency period was 20 days. Clinical features included itching, jaundice, nausea, fever, and rash. Laboratory abnormalities included a mixed or cholestatic pattern of serum enzyme increases. We identified 14 more patients with DILI attributed to other cephalosporins (5 first-generation, 2 second-generation, 6 third-generation, and 1 fourth-generation agent). Although latency and injury patterns were similar for cefazolin and other cephalosporins, the other cephalosporins were associated with more severe courses of injury, including 2 deaths from liver failure.

Conclusions

DILI can develop after a single dose of cefazolin. It is characterized by a latency period of 1 to 3 weeks after exposure, a cholestatic biochemical pattern, and a self-limited moderate to severe clinical course. Other cephalosporins can cause a similar but more severe injury.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^116wRagD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Third generation cephalosporins including cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in association with metronidazole, may be still options for the treatment of mild IAIs. Ceftazidime and cefoperazone are third generation cephalosporins with an activity against P. aeruginosa. Cefepime, is a fourth-generation cephalosporin, with broader spectrum activity than third generation cephalosprins and effective against AmpC-producing organisms. For empiric therapy, also cefepime should also be combined with metronidazole because it does not possess anti-anaerobic activity.

Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are no longer appropriate choice as first-line treatment in many geographic regions because of the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance. However, when employed, these drugs should be used in association with metronidazole. In many current practices, the fluoroquinolones remain available for patients presenting allergy to beta-lactams, with mild intra-abdominal infections.

Carbapenems offer a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens (with the exception of MDR-resistant gram-positive cocci). Group 1 carbapenems include ertapenem. This group has activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens, but not active against P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus species. Group 2 includes imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, and doripenem, which share activity against non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli.

For more than two decades, carbapenems have been considered the agents of choice for multidrug-resistant infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae. The recent and rapid spread K. pneumoniae carbapenems resistant has become a critical issue in hospitals worldwide. The use of carbapenems should be limited so as to preserve activity of this class of antibiotics because of the concern of emerging carbapenem-resistance.

### Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^114EQqkw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Cephalosporins

Most isolates of E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae remain susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. Among this drug class, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime, in combination with metronidazole may be options for empirical therapy of CA-IAI, due to the relatively narrow spectrum of coverage bacause these agents lack activity against P. aeruginosa. On the other hand, ceftazidime and cefoperazone have activity against P. aeruginosa, but have relatively less activity against streptococci as compared to other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, with broader spectrum activity compared to ceftriaxone is a poor inducer of AmpC beta-lactamase, and is poorly hydrolyzed by the enzyme, allowing it to be effective against AmpC-producing organisms. For empiric therapy, cefepime must be combined with metronidazole because it does not possess anti-anaerobic activity.

The newest "5th" generation cephalosporins such as ceftobiprole have very broad-spectrum activity, exhibiting potent in vitro activity against a number of Gram-positive pathogens including MRSA, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Gram-negative pathogens including AmpC producing E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Their role towards E. faecium PBP 5 (PBP 5fm) is controversial. Ceftobiprole medocaril is approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia (excluding ventilator-associated pneumonia), in the European Union. It has not been approved for the treatment of cIAI.

For scenario C, the practice parameters recommend normal administration of a dissimilar cephalosporin, as well as a skin test–based approach for a structurally similar cephalosporin, for patients with an anaphylactic history to a penicillin. Our survey results showed that 23% elected to perform a penicillin-based skin test and focus only on proving or disproving the penicillin allergy, which aligns with practice parameters' recommendations.

For scenario D, for a patient with a high-risk cephalosporin history, the practice parameters suggest cephalosporin skin test as the evaluation approach. Forty-eight percent of the experts in our survey chose answers that aligned with this approach.

For scenario E, for patients with another high-risk history of a cephalosporin, specifically cefazolin, a higher number of participants, 57%, chose cephalosporin skin test as their evaluation.

Following scenario E, we specifically asked a question about the recommended steps in cephalosporin use when the skin test results are positive to cefazolin. For this scenario, most experts (34, 79.1%) recommended avoiding cefazolin and conducting an oral challenge with a structurally dissimilar cephalosporin, versus 9 experts (20.9%) who recommended avoiding cefazolin alone, without the need to continue to oral challenge.

We attempted to perform a post hoc analysis to look for a correlation between the experts' time in practice and their adherence to the guidelines, but we found no such correlation in any of the case scenarios.

The survey's last section asked about the impact of the 2022 practice parameter on the survey respondents' individual practices.

Twenty-one participants (47.7%) agreed that the 2022 practice parameters had changed their approach specifically for cephalosporin allergy testing. Among the 21 who answered "yes" to having changed their practice after the updated drug allergy practice parameters were reported qualitative changes in their practice of doing more DOCs (7 experts), more single-dose challenges (2 reports), and fewer skin tests (6 reports), as well as being less concerned about penicillin and cephalosporin cross-reactivity.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^114HzAae]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Thirty-six physicians (78.3%) reported having a capacity to test for both delayed and immediate reaction to cephalosporins, and 10 (21.7%) reported that they only test immediate reactions.

The second section of the survey was only available to participants who stated that they assess patients with cephalosporin allergy in their practice or if they planned to do so in the next year (44, 95.7%). The most common immediate cephalosporin reaction that participants reported evaluating was cefazolin (24, 53.3%), followed by cephalexin (18, 40.0%) and then ceftriaxone (3, 6.7%).

Survey results

Participant responses to how they would evaluate and test each of the 5 case scenarios (scenarios A-E) with a focus on cephalosporin use are shown in Fig 1, with answers aligning with current recommendations for testing in the practice parameters marked with an orange bracket.

Fig 1
Survey results for expert choice on tests for each case.

For scenario A, the practice parameters suggest that a patient reporting a low-risk penicillin allergy can receive a cephalosporin normally, without a preceding cephalosporin test. Some form of this response was selected by 91% of survey respondents, who focused on prescribing the cephalosporin, delabeling the low-risk penicillin allergy, or both.

For scenario B, the practice parameters suggest that a patient with a low-risk allergy to a cephalosporin should be evaluated by skin test before prescribing a structurally similar cephalosporin. In the survey, 12% chose to perform skin test before challenge, and 68% recommended direct challenge with the culprit drug.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^1144icsw]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric antibiotic selection uses a four-step approach: "Assess (1) severity of illness, (2) risk factors for resistance, (3) patient-specific considerations, and (4) if septic, consider the antibiogram". For sepsis with or without shock, preferred agents are "Third or fourth generation cephalosporins, * carbapenems,# piperacillin-tazobactam, fluoroquinolones&" with alternatives "Novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors,+ cefiderocol, plazomicin, or older aminoglycosides%". Without sepsis using an IV route, preferred agents are "Third or fourth generation cephalosporins, * piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones&" and alternatives are "Carbapenems,# newer agents (novel beta lactams-beta lactamase inhibitors,† cefiderocol, plazomicin), or older aminoglycosides%". Without sepsis using an oral route, preferred therapy is "Fluoroquinolones& or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole" with alternatives "Amoxicillin-clavulanate or oral cephalosporins (see Table 3.1)". Sepsis is described as "identified by SOFA score of 2 or higher" and screening tools "may be useful"; in step 4 choose antibiotics with susceptibilities "at least 90%" for sepsis with shock and "at least 80%" for sepsis without shock. The page also notes that "Difficult-to-treat resistant pathogens may require use of drugs not listed here (e.g., colistin); refer to IDSA Antimicrobial Resistance guidance" and that "nitrofurantoin and oral fosfomycin are generally not appropriate choices for cUTI because they may not achieve adequate levels in renal parenchyma and blood".

### What have we learned from pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic theories? [^111Twunw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic characteristics and pharmacodynamic properties dictate antimicrobial response and, along with natural immune responses, clinical outcomes. As new agents are developed with long half-lives, we will lose the ability to differentiate between concentration-dependent and time-dependent properties. The area under the inhibitory concentration curve (AUIC) defines drug regimens as a ratio of drug exposure to minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and allows them to be compared with each other. With AUIC and agents with long half-lives, these comparisons are possible regardless of chemical classification or concentration or time-dependent activity. Historical examples of reduced drug exposure from decreased doses (i.e., cefaclor, clarithromycin, and ciprofloxacin), and thus low AUIC values, directly correlate with drug resistance. In the face of rising MICs (as is occurring worldwide with Streptococcus pneumoniae), close attention to appropriate dosing and concentration above the MIC may delay and potentially even prevent antibiotic resistance. Creating selective pressure on reliable antibiotics by inappropriately reducing their doses will undoubtedly challenge these agents and may destroy entire drug classes with similar mechanisms of action or resistance.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^116FkURv]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) with sepsis — empiric antibiotic selection: For patients with sepsis due to complicated UTI, we suggest initially selecting among the following antibiotics, using the four-step assessment (Figure 1.1): third- or fourth-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, or fluoroquinolones, and rather than newer agents (novel beta lactam-beta lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin) or older aminoglycosides (conditional recommendation, very low to moderate certainty of evidence). Agents with broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococci, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) may be considered for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of cUTI is not clear or who are suspected to have cUTI due to these pathogens.

### Β-lactams without a suicide inhibitor [^117LC2wx]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Existing clinical studies concerning the impact of therapy with third-generation cephalosporins or cefepime on infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are retrospective, non-randomised, and have been carried out with a small number of patients and low-dosage schedules that lack PK-PD correlations with clinical efficacy. Rates of clinical failure and mortality are higher than those in studies with non-ESBL- producing Enterobacteriaceae. Therefore, in settings with a high prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, empirical therapy with advanced cephalosporins should be avoided. Temocillin, an old beta-lactam that is stable in the presence of both ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases, seems to deserve revival, although clinical data are limited.

### How fluoroquinolone preauthorization affects third-and fourth-generation cephalosporin use and resistance in a large academic hospital [^1178tj9H]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

We observed an overall increase in the use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins after fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented. We examined the change in specific third- and fourth-generation cephalosporin use, and we sought to determine whether there was a consequent change in non-susceptibility of select Gram-negative bacterial isolates to these antibiotics.

Design

Retrospective quasi-experimental study.

Setting

Academic hospital.

Intervention

Fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented in the hospital in October 2005. We used interrupted time series (ITS) Poisson regression models to examine trends in monthly rates of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime use and trends in yearly rates of nonsusceptible isolates (NSIs) of select Gram-negative bacteria before (1998–2004) and after (2006–2016) fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented.

Results

Rates of use of ceftriaxone and cefepime increased after fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented (ceftriaxone RR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.002–1.003; P < .0001; cefepime RR, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001–1.004; P = 0.0006), but ceftazidime use continued to decline (RR, 0.991, 95% CI, 0.990–0.992; P < .0001). Rates of ceftazidime and cefepime NSIs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ceftazidime RR, 0.937; 95% CI, 0.910–0.965, P < .0001; cefepime RR, 0.937; 95% CI, 0.912–0.963; P < .0001) declined after fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented. Rates of ceftazidime and cefepime NSIs of Enterobacter cloacae (ceftazidime RR, 1.116; 95% CI, 1.078–1.154; P < .0001; cefepime RR, 1.198; 95% CI, 1.112–1.291; P < .0001) and cefepime NSI of Acinetobacter baumannii (RR, 1.169; 95% CI, 1.081–1.263; P < .0001) were increasing before fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented but became stable thereafter: E. cloacae (ceftazidime RR, 0.987; 95% CI, 0.948–1.028; P = 0.531; cefepime RR, 0.990; 95% CI, 0.962–1.018; P = 0.461) and A. baumannii (cefepime RR, 0.972; 95% CI, 0.939–1.006; P = 0.100).

Conclusions

Fluoroquinolone preauthorization may increase use of unrestricted third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins; however, we did not observe increased antimicrobial resistance to these agents, especially among clinically important Gram-negative bacteria known for hospital-acquired infections.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^113Gvo9M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

When evaluating a patient with a high-risk penicillin allergy, many experts chose to include both penicillin and cephalosporin skin tests, as opposed to just performing a penicillin-based skin test, as suggested by the practice parameter. Similarly, for a high-risk cephalosporin history, more physicians recommended a penicillin skin test in addition to a cephalosporin skin test, even when evaluating whether the patient can receive cephalosporins, while the practice parameter does not suggest the need to evaluate penicillins.

We were especially interested in the approach to cefazolin allergy among drug allergy experts. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin broadly used for perioperative prophylaxis. Reviewing the chemical structures and immunogenic components of cefazolin shown that it has 2 side chains (R1 and R2) whose structures do not match those of any other β-lactams in use in the United States, including penicillin, which suggests that the true rate of cross-reactivity of cefazolin to other β-lactam antibiotics may actually be close to zero. Several studies suggest that patients with past immediate reactions to cefazolin often tolerate all other cephalosporins and other β-lactams. A 2021 study demonstrated that in a series of 452 patients labeled as having penicillin allergy who underwent allergy testing, none had a positive skin test result when tested specifically for cefazolin or ceftriaxone. In a systematic review and meta-analysis from 2021 looking at dual allergy to penicillin and cefazolin, less than 1% of nonconfirmed penicillin allergy also had the label of cefazolin allergy, suggesting that most patients with a history of penicillin allergy may safely be prescribed cefazolin.

Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance — ceftriaxone for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production states: "Ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime or ceftazidime) is not suggested for the treatment of invasive infections" caused by E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes, and C. freundii, but "Ceftriaxone is reasonable for uncomplicated cystitis… when susceptibility is demonstrated". The rationale notes uncertainty and diagnostic limits: "Clinical reports differ on how frequently resistance to ceftriaxone emerges", "there are no CLSI-endorsed approaches for AmpC detection in clinical isolates", and "these organisms may display ceftriaxone resistance for other reasons (eg, ESBL production)".

### Antimicrobials: a global alliance for optimizing their rational use in intra-abdominal infections (AGORA) [^1125NDs3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Group 1 enzymes are cephalosporinases belonging to molecular class C. They are more active on cephalosporins than benzylpenicillin. It includes AmpC beta-lactamases. AmpC beta-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases capable of inactivating cephalotin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and beta-lactamase inhibitor-beta-lactam combinations. AmpC-hyperproducing mutants are resistant to penicillins, aztreonam, third generation cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and even ertapenem when the enzyme is massively expressed. Imipenem, meropenem and doripenem remain the most active beta-lactams against AmpC beta-lactamases.

Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin with broader spectrum activity compared to ceftriaxone, is a poor inducer of AmpC beta-lactamase. Many AmpC-producing organisms are susceptible to cefepime because cefepime is poorly hydrolyzed by the AmpC beta-lactamase enzyme. However, the role of cefepime in treating infections caused by AmpC-producing organisms is controversial because of the inoculum effect. In vitro studies showed a high inoculum effect. If a 100-fold-higher inoculum is used, cefepime MIC increases dramatically for some AmpC producers. Clinical studies demonstrated that cefepime may be a reasonable option for the treatment of invasive infections due to AmpC beta-lactamase-producing organisms when adequate source control is achieved.

### Is there a rationale for the continuous infusion of cefepime? A multidisciplinary approach [^116UwxJ8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2003). Low credibility.

This review is the fruit of multidisciplinary discussions concerning the continuous administration of beta-lactams, with a special focus on cefepime. Pooling of the analyses and viewpoints of all members of the group, based on a review of the literature on this subject, has made it possible to test the hypothesis concerning the applicability of this method of administering cefepime. Cefepime is a cephalosporin for injection which exhibits a broader spectrum of activity than that of older, third-generation cephalosporins for injection (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime). The specific activity of cefepime is based on its more rapid penetration (probably due to its zwitterionic structure, this molecule being both positively and negatively charged) through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, its greater affinity for penicillin-binding proteins, its weak affinity for beta-lactamases, and its stability versus certain beta-lactamases, particularly derepressed cephalosporinases. The stability of cefepime in various solutions intended for parenteral administration has been studied, and the results obtained demonstrated the good compatibility of cefepime with these different solutions. These results thus permit the administration of cefepime in a continuous infusion over a 24-h period, using two consecutive syringes.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (third-generation cephalosporin-resistant), ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend to avoid using new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors for the treatment of infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales due to antibiotic stewardship considerations. Reserve these antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria.

### Cefiderocol: discovery, chemistry, and in vivo profiles of a novel siderophore cephalosporin [^113CWGQu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

MECHANISM OF ACTION

As with other β-lactam antibiotics, cefiderocol exerts a primary effect on cell wall synthesis by inhibiting PBPs, which results in cell death. Similarly to other cephalosporin antibiotics such as ceftazidime, cefiderocol showed potent in vitro bactericidal activity in time-kill curve experiments against 4 main bacterial pathogens — Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii — as a result of the high binding affinities, primarily to PBP3.

Carbapenem-resistant strains of gram-negative bacteria are genetically diverse and may harbor multiple resistance mechanisms, such as carbapenemase production and lower outer membrane permeability due to reduced expression or conformational mutations of porin channels and/or the upregulation of efflux pumps. However, the abovementioned key features have enabled cefiderocol to overcome these resistance mechanisms.

Cephalosporin–penicillin cross-reactivity — historical and agent-specific rates are noted: the incidence of cross-reactivity between cephalosporins and penicillin has been reported to be approximately 10%, with agents such as cefadroxil as high as 27%, whereas for commonly used first- and second-generation cephalosporins (including cefazolin) it is approximately 1%, and for third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins (such as ceftriaxone) it is reported to be negligible.

Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.

### Phenotypic detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamase production in enterobacteriaceae: review and bench guide [^113v8Dy6]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2008). Low credibility.

Strains of Enterobacteriaceae producing an extended spectrum beta-lactamase have become a concern in medical bacteriology as regards both antimicrobial treatment and infection control in hospitals. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) detection tests should accurately discriminate between bacteria producing these enzymes and those with other mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactams, e.g., broad-spectrum beta-lactamases, inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases and cephalosporinase overproduction. Several phenotypic detection tests, based on the synergy between a third-generation cephalosporin and clavulanate, have been designed: the double-disk synergy test (DDST), ESBL Etests, and the combination disk method. These tests often need to be refined in order for them to detect an ESBL in some bacterial strains, such as those that also overproduce a cephalosporinase. The sensitivity of the DDST can be improved by reducing the distance between the disks of cephalosporins and clavulanate. The use of cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin that is less rapidly inactivated by cephalosporinase than by ESBL, improves the detection of synergy with clavulanate when there is simultaneous stable hyperproduction of a cephalosporinase; alternatively, the cephalosporinase can be inactivated by performing phenotypic tests on a cloxacillin-containing agar. Some beta-lactamases can hydrolyse both third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems, such as the metallo-beta-lactamases, which are not inhibited by clavulanate, but rather by EDTA. The production of an ESBL masked by a metallo-beta-lactamase can be detected by means of double inhibition by EDTA and clavulanate. Since extended-spectrum Ambler class D oxacillinases are weakly inhibited by clavulanate and not inhibited by EDTA, their detection is difficult in the routine laboratory.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^115cJ8kz]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergy diagnostic testing — penicillin allergy evaluation and cephalosporin cross-sensitivity reports that penicilloyl polylysine detected 80% of penicillin-sensitive patients but is no longer commercially available, and estimates cross-sensitivity to cephalosporins at 6% to 15% for first-generation agents and as low as 1% to 2% for second- and third-generation analogs. In centers with proper reagents, penicillin skin tests should be used to evaluate the likelihood of an immediate hypersensitivity reaction in a patient with a history of a penicillin reaction when penicillin is strongly indicated and an effective alternate antibiotic cannot be substituted; under these conditions, 2 scenarios are possible: a skin test–negative patient may receive penicillin without anticipated problems, whereas a skin test–positive patient will require rapid oral or parenteral desensitization with close hospital monitoring. Routine penicillin testing before administration in a history-negative patient is not recommended. The diagnostic validity of commercially available specific IgE tests for all drugs, including penicillin, has not been confirmed, and negative specific IgE test results do not rule out the possibility of penicillin allergy and therefore such tests should not be used to detect penicillin allergy.

From these data, the potential to develop resistance to cefiderocol is considered to be similar to or lower than that of ceftazidime, regardless of the presence of carbapenemase enzymes. Although information is currently limited on resistance mechanisms to cefiderocol, recent studies identified mechanisms specific to genes related to iron acquisition, and no cross-resistance was observed between cefiderocol and ceftazidime. Further investigations are ongoing to fully understand the resistance mechanisms behind elevated cefiderocol MIC values.

### Safe use of selected cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients: a meta-analysis [^1172WSHK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent analysis of clinical data and a clearer understanding of the role of chemical structure in the development of cross-reactivity indicate that the increased risk of an allergic reaction to a cephalosporin in penicillin-allergic patients is smaller than previously postulated.

Method

Medline and EMBASE databases were searched with the keywords: cephalosporin, penicillin, allergy, and cross-sensitivity for the years 1960 through 2005. Among 219 articles retrieved, 9 served as source material for this evidence-based meta-analysis.

Results

A significant increase in allergic reactions to cephalothin (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 5.5), cephaloridine (OR = 8.7; CI = 5.9 to 12.8), and cephalexin (OR = 5.8; CI = 3.6 to 9.2), and all first generation cephalosporins plus cefamandole (OR = 4.8; CI = 3.7 to 6.2) were observed in penicillin allergic patients; no increase was observed with second generation cephalosporins (OR = 1.1; CI, 0.6 to 2.1) or third generation cephalosporins (OR = 0.5; CI = 0.2 to 1.1). Clinical challenges, skin testing, and monoclonal antibody studies point to the paramount importance of similarities in side chain structure to predict cross-allergy between cephalosporins and penicillins.

Conclusion

First-generation cephalosporins have cross-allergy with penicillins, but cross-allergy is negligible with second- and third-generation cephalosporins. Particular emphasis should be placed on the role of chemical structure in determining the risk of cross-reactivity between specific agents.

### Evaluation and management of well-appearing febrile infants 8 to 60 days old [^112WxFgF]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Empirical antibacterial therapy adjustments for suspected bacteremia, sepsis, or meningitis in communities with extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing E coli specify that gentamicin should be used instead of ceftazidime for suspected bacteremia or sepsis, meropenem should be used instead of ceftazidime when bacterial meningitis is suspected, and use of fourth- and fifth-generation cephalosporins may also be considered with expert consultation. Because cephalosporins do not provide adequate coverage for Listeria or enterococci, ampicillin generally should be used as part of empirical therapy when these microbes are suspected.

### Phenotypic and genotypic detection of ESBL mediated cephalosporin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae: emergence of high resistance against cefepime, the fourth generation cephalosporin [^1124yN2F]. The Journal of Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Cephalosporins belonging to second and third generation are commonly used in India for the treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Report on resistance among K. pneumoniae strains to second and third generation cephalosporins are on rise in this country, which has been attributed to emergence of strains expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of K. pneumoniae to broad-spectrum cephalosporins particularly to cefepime, a recently introduced fourth generation cephalosporin in relation to ESBL production.

Methods

This study has been carried out in two phases among K. pneumoniae strains isolated between October 2001 and September 2002 (phase I, before marketing of cefepime in India) and between August 2003 and July 2004 (phase II, after marketing of cefepime in India). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was determined by a commercial strip containing gradient of antimicrobials (Strip E-test). Detection for ESBL production was carried out by DDST, E-test ESBL and PCR.

Results

Antimicrobial resistance profile of K. pneumoniae strains to five cephalosporins as analyzed by WHONET 5 identified 15 different resistance profiles among the 108 phase I isolates, ranging from resistance to none (19.44%) to all the five cephalosporin (8.33%) and eight different resistance profiles among the 99 phase II isolates, ranging from resistance to none (9.1%) to all the five cephalosporins (36.4%). Among the 108 phase I isolates a total of 71 (65.72%) and out of 99 phase II isolates, a total of 87 (88.0%) could be identified as ESBL producers. Among the isolates, regardless of the phase of the isolation, those characterized by production of ESBL showed overall higher frequency of resistance to cephalosporins (range 19.7–85.9% and 51.7–100% in phase I and phase II, respectively) compared to those for ESBL non-producers (range 0–13.5% and 0–25% in phase I and phase II, respectively). Ten randomly selected isolates from the most common resistance phenotypes probably belonged to a single strain as evident by MIC patterns, genotypic characterization and resistance profile to non-cephalosporin group of antimicrobials thereby pointing out the possibility of an outbreak.

Conclusions

PCR may be regarded as a reliable method for detection of ESBL since in addition to the strains that could be identified as ESBL producers by DDST and E-test ESBL; PCR could demonstrate ESBL production among additional 32 strains (15 in phase I and 17 in phase II). Continued uses of cephalosporin group appear to be a potential risk factor for emergence of ESBL producing K. pneumoniae strains. In addition, as noted in the present study, the rise of resistance to cefepime that has been introduced recently in this country for therapeutic use could be of concern.

### Fatal anaphylactic shock following cefoperazone-sulbactam re-exposure: a short report on systemic gaps in adverse drug reaction management [^1177sC6a]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Adverse event analysis

Immunological mechanism

Cefoperazone's R1 side chain acts as a primary antigenic determinant, inducing IgE-mediated sensitisation. Subsequent re-exposure triggers mast cell degranulation, leading to anaphylaxis. Penicillins and cephalosporins exhibit a degree of cross-allergic reactivity due to shared β-lactam structures. Nevertheless, penicillin allergy is not an absolute contraindication for cefoperazone–sulbactam as its significant structural divergence in side chains from penicillin confers a low risk of cross-reactivity. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology guidelines state that cephalosporins with structurally dissimilar side chains (eg, third-generation agents) may be cautiously administered to penicillin-allergic patients, whereas avoidance remains imperative in cases of severe hypersensitivity reactions.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: survey of drug allergy experts [^113yw1Hu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, 48% of experts chose a cephalosporin-only skin test in the case of anaphylaxis to ceftriaxone (an antibiotic that shares side chains with several other cephalosporins, such as cefpodoxime, cefotaxime, and cefepime) versus 57% who chose a cephalosporin-only skin test in cases of immediate reactions to cefazolin. However, when specifically asked what the preferred step is after a positive skin test result to cefazolin, most experts (34, 79.1%) recommended avoiding cefazolin and conducting an oral challenge with structurally dissimilar cephalosporin, versus 9 experts (20.9%) who recommended avoiding cefazolin only, without a challenge with a dissimilar cephalosporin.

The main limitations of this study are the small sample size, low response rate of 33.8% among all ARDBL members, and lack of independent evaluation of cephalosporin allergy in children. However, large surveys typically show response rates of < 20%, even with multiple callouts. A Canadian study that looked at response rates to web-based surveys among physician specialists demonstrated an average response rate of 35%, which is similar to our response rate. The other limitation is the relatively short period of time between the publication of the 2022 practice parameter (online publication in September 2022) and performance of the survey (February-April 2023). Administering the survey later, after the practice parameter's official publication, might have shown different results, with more experts implementing the guidelines.

Another potential limitation is that the majority of responders were from academic medical centers, with only a small representation of drug allergy experts from the community. However, the selection of ARDBL members for the survey was intentional: they represent the top experts in drug allergy and are the first practitioners to be updated on the new guidelines. We selected them for our survey to see if there was general agreement among this group of experts on the subject of cephalosporin allergy evaluation, especially after the 2022 publication of the DAPP.

The variations among drug allergy experts regarding high-risk reactions with cephalosporins in particular suggest that there is currently low consensus even among experts, meaning that community members will not be expected to have better agreement. However, as a result of the limited access to reagents for drug allergy testing, in the community, high-risk cephalosporin allergy is usually not evaluated, with such patients referred to an academic medical center.

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

BPPL = Bacterial Priority Pathogens List. Salmonella Typhi = Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. *Rifampicin-resistant M tuberculosis was included after an independent analysis with parallel criteria and subsequent application of the multicriteria decision analysis matrix.

The final WHO BPPL 2024 list was categorised into three priority tiers: critical, high, and medium (table 2). These groupings and their interpretation were finalised with input from the WHO BPPL Advisory Group and relevant WHO programmes. Based on this categorisation, the critical tier includes carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenem-resistant and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales, and rifampicin-resistant M tuberculosis. The high-priority tier features fluoroquinolone-resistant S Typhi and Shigella spp, vancomycin-resistant E faecium, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fluoroquinolone-resistant non-typhoidal Salmonella, N gonorrhoeae (third-generation cephalosporin resistant or fluoroquinolone resistant, or both), and MRSA. The medium-priority tier encompasses macrolide-resistant group A streptococci and S pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, and penicillin-resistant group B streptococci (table 2).

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^111MyMBw]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

In a Baltimore, Maryland, STI clinic study, only 7.1% of the patients who reported allergy to penicillin or to another ß-lactam antibiotic had an objective positive test for penicillin allergy. Moreover, in studies that have incorporated penicillin skin testing and graded oral challenge among persons with reported penicillin allergy, the true rates of allergy are low, ranging from 1.5% to 6.1%. Studies in preoperative surgical patients with reported penicillin allergy, evaluated for cardiovascular surgery or orthopedics, have rates of skin test positivity < 8.5%. However, when patients with high-risk penicillin allergy histories are excluded, 99% of patients could receive ß-lactams. In hospitalized patients and other populations with comorbidities, the typical rates of validated penicillin allergy among patients who report a history of penicillin allergy are 2.5%–9.0%.

Cross-Reactivity with Cephalosporins

Penicillin and cephalosporins both contain a ß-lactam ring. This structural similarity has led to considerable confusion regarding cross-reactivity of these drugs and the risks for allergic reactions from cephalosporins among penicillin-allergic patients. In most clinical settings, patients with reported penicillin allergy are precluded from treatment with such cephalosporin antibiotics as ceftriaxone. Third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone and cefixime) have lower cross-reactivity with IgE-mediated penicillin-allergic patients (< 1%) compared with first- and second-generation cephalosporins (range: 1%–8%). Moreover, anaphylaxis secondary to cephalosporins is extremely rare among persons who report a penicillin allergy and is estimated to occur at a rate of one per 52,000 persons. Data from the Kaiser health care system reported that among 3,313 patients with self-reported cephalosporin allergy who received a cephalosporin (mostly first generation), no cases of anaphylaxis were reported. Use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems is safe for patients without a history of any IgE-mediated symptoms (e.g. anaphylaxis or urticaria) from penicillin during the preceding 10 years.

### Initial empirical antimicrobial therapy: duration and subsequent modifications [^115ixwiC]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Neutropenic patients at low risk of complications can receive oral ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin as outpatients. These agents plus amoxicillin/clavulanate or other penicillins, cephalosporins, or penem compounds are indicated to treat infections with gram-positive organisms in patients with oral mucositis or skin lesions. Parenteral fourth-generation cephalosporins or carbapenems can be given. For high-risk patients, monotherapy with cefepime or the carbapenems can be used. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus should be treated with vancomycin or teicoplanin. For combination therapy, a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin or carbapenem plus an aminoglycoside is desirable. Defervescence in 3–5 days for at least 7 days is suggested for subsequent management. Initial antibiotic(s) can be continued for patients who remain in good condition. For persistent fever after 3–5 days, the patient should be thoroughly reassessed. An aminoglycoside should be added for those initially treated with monotherapy. The initial cephalosporin can be changed to another cephalosporin or a carbapenem, or the initial carbapenem can be changed to a broad-spectrum cephalosporin. For patients initially receiving dual therapy, the cephalosporin or carbapenem can be changed as with monotherapy, whereas the initial aminoglycoside should be changed to another aminoglycoside or intravenous ciprofloxacin.

### Intra-abdominal infections survival guide: a position statement by the global alliance for infections in surgery [^114K6TrV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Statement 14

Antibiotic regimens with activity against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria should be used for selected patients with IAIs who are strongly suspected or proved to be harbouring a resistant pathogen (Moderate-quality evidence, Strong recommendation).

Initial antibiotic therapy for cIAIs is typically empiric in nature because standard microbiologic data and susceptibility results generally require 24–72 h after peritoneal fluid specimen collection. Blood cultures are seldom positive in cIAI (< 10%) and therefore largely unreliable. Typical bacterial pathogens in IAIs reflect endogenous gut flora including Enterobacterales such as E. coli and Klebsiella spp. viridans group Streptococcus, and anaerobes (especially Bacteroides spp.). Historically, cIAI pathogens tended to have greater susceptibility in community- as opposed to hospital-acquired infections.

IAIs caused by susceptible bacteria may be managed by beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations (e.g. ticarcillin/clavulanic acid or piperacillin/tazobactam), or a non-pseudomonal carbapenem (e.g. ertapenem). Increasing AMR to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid among E. coli and other Enterobacterales worldwide has compromised its clinical utility for empiric therapy; it should only be prescribed as targeted therapy based on demonstrated susceptibility. The comparably broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam makes it still useful in managing severe IAIs. However, the anti-pseudomonal activity of piperacillin/tazobactam is unnecessary for most community-acquired cIAIs, and its use in hospital-acquired infections should be determined based on local microbiologic epidemiology.

Many isolates of E. coli and other Enterobacterales are susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins that, in combination with metronidazole, may be options for empiric therapy of non-severe IAIs. Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with a broader spectrum of activity than third-generation cephalosporins. Compared to ceftriaxone, cefepime is poorly hydrolysed by AmpC beta-lactamase, allowing it to be effective against AmpC-producing organisms. For empiric therapy, cefepime must also be given with metronidazole. Fluoroquinolones have been prescribed widely for the treatment of IAIs because of their putative activity against aerobic gram-negative bacteria, tissue penetration, and high oral bioavailability. However, resistance of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. to fluoroquinolones has increased substantially over time, limiting their use for empiric treatment of IAIs.

We report a case of cefepime neurotoxicity characterised by myoclonic status epilepticus with coma, in a context of acute renal failure and requiring one discontinuous conventional haemodialysis. Cefepime is a fourth-generation broad-spectrum cephalosporin mainly used to treat hospital-acquired Gram-negative infections. Acute neurotoxicity is an increasingly reported adverse effect which occurs predominantly in patients with renal impairment. Renal replacement therapy has been proposed to treat this condition.

### Combination therapy versus monotherapy: a randomised pilot study on the evolution of inflammatory parameters after ventilator associated pneumonia [^113bjTRF]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Combination antibiotic therapy for ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is often used to broaden the spectrum of activity of empirical treatment. The relevance of such synergy is commonly supposed but poorly supported. The aim of the present study was to compare the clinical outcome and the course of biological variables in patients treated for a VAP, using a monotherapy with a beta-lactam versus a combination therapy.

Methods

Patients with VAP were prospectively randomised to receive either cefepime alone or cefepime in association with amikacin or levofloxacin. Clinical and inflammatory parameters were measured on the day of inclusion and thereafter.

Results

Seventy-four mechanically ventilated patients meeting clinical criteria for VAP were enrolled in the study. VAP was microbiologically confirmed in 59 patients (84%). Patients were randomised to receive cefepime (C group, 20 patients), cefepime with amikacin (C-A group, 19 patients) or cefepime with levofloxacin (C-L group, 20 patients). No significant difference was observed regarding the time course of temperature, leukocytosis or C-reactive protein level. There were no differences between length of stay in the intensive care unit after infection, nor in ventilator free days within 28 days after infection. No difference in mortality was observed.

Conclusion

Antibiotic combination using a fourth generation cephalosporin with either an aminoside or a fluoroquinolone is not associated with a clinical or biological benefit when compared to cephalosporin monotherapy against common susceptible pathogens causing VAP.

### Cefiderocol: discovery, chemistry, and in vivo profiles of a novel siderophore cephalosporin [^117EuGUk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Cefiderocol is a novel parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic with siderophore–iron binding properties as well as intrinsic structural stability to a wide range of serine- and metallo-β-lactamases, including clinically relevant carbapenemases. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that this innovative drug has the potential to overcome all 3 mechanisms of β-lactam resistance, including carbapenem resistance increasingly observed in gram-negative bacterial infections. The emergence of resistance to cefiderocol does not appear to be higher than that of other β-lactam antibiotics, and because of its multiple characteristics described above, resistance may be less of a threat to the utility of cefiderocol. Robust preclinical studies in infection models, including urinary tract and systemic infections, established the in vivo efficacy of cefiderocol, which was not demonstrated with earlier monobactam conjugates. With the likely continued emergence and spread of β-lactam resistance mechanisms, cefiderocol could play an important role in future antibacterial therapy against problematic gram-negative bacteria, particularly MBL-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, as well as MDR or carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and MDR or carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.

### MRSA: treating people with infection [^114HXRzj]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin, as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics, including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection, particularly in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. About 8% of S aureus in blood cultures in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of selected treatments for MRSA infections at any body site? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 312 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 133 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 55 studies and the further review of 78 full publications. Of the 78 full articles evaluated, 15 systematic reviews and one subsequent RCT were added at this update. In addition, six studies were added to the Comment sections. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 12 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview we categorised the efficacy for five interventions, based on information about the effectiveness and safety of cephalosporins (ceftobiprole, ceftaroline), daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, pristinamycin (streptogramins), and tigecycline.

### Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of cefdinir, an oral extended spectrum cephalosporin [^111sqYvd]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Oral second and third generation cephalosporins are undergoing continuing research and development in the arena of pediatric infectious disease in an attempt to fill voids created by existing agents in the quest for the "ideal" antimicrobial. This paper reviews the in vitro antimicrobial activity (pharmacodynamics) and pharmacokinetics of cefdinir, an extended spectrum oral cephalosporin, with an emphasis on those aspects relevant to the pediatric patient population.

Methods

A MEDLINE literature search was conducted for the years 1985 through 2000, identifying all English language papers examining the in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacokinetics of cefdinir. Bibliographies of these papers were reviewed, as were relevant data on file with the manufacturer.

Data Synthesis

Cefdinir exhibits broad range in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes. It exhibits superior activity against Gram-positive aerobes, compared with drugs like cefixime, ceftibuten, cefuroxime and cefpodoxime. In addition it is stable to hydrolysis by many of the common betalactamases. The pharmacokinetic parameters of cefdinir in children are similar to those obtained in adults using similar milligram per m2 doses (300, 600 mg in adults = 7, 14 mg/kg in children, respectively).

Conclusions

The pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of cefdinir as described in this paper, as well as the results of the clinical trials program, support the use of this agent in the treatment of a wide variety of pediatric infectious diseases.

### Efficacy of carbapenems compared with noncarbapenem broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics as initial antibiotic therapy against sepsis: a nationwide observational study [^112f2Nh3]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregulated host response to infection. Despite the progress made in medical management over the past few decades, sepsis remains an important global health problem causing millions of deaths around the world. One essential facet of sepsis management is the administration of appropriate antimicrobials. Multiple lines of evidence have shown that failure or delay in the administration of appropriate antimicrobials is associated with substantial increases in the mortality of sepsis. On the basis of the evidence, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommended empiric broad-spectrum therapy to cover all likely pathogens as soon as possible after sepsis is recognized.

Broad-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics are commonly used as empiric therapy for sepsis. Among them, carbapenems offer an exceptionally broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. The existing evidence suggests that carbapenems are associated with relatively low mortality in several infectious diseases, especially those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens. For these reasons, carbapenems are the preferably used antibiotics for the initial treatment of sepsis, and consumption of carbapenem has been reported to be increasing in different parts of the world. However, indiscriminate use of carbapenems against sepsis should be avoided because it has contributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, updating knowledge on the efficacy of alternative empiric regimens for sepsis is required.

The fourth-generation cephalosporins, such as cefepime and cefpirome, and piperacillin/tazobactam are nearly equal to carbapenems in antimicrobial activity and thus are considered alternative therapies against sepsis. Previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of carbapenems compared with these antibiotics against several specific pathogens, such as Acinetobacter species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli. However, there is little evidence of the efficacy of carbapenems against unidentified mixed pathogens. Causative pathogens are not usually identified at the time of initiating antibiotics in sepsis because of the strong recommendation to initiate immediate treatment, ideally within 1 hour after sepsis is first suspected. Thus, there is a significant need to comprehensively evaluate differences in mortality and morbidities between carbapenems versus noncarbapenem broad-spectrum antibiotics as initial treatment of sepsis, including various underlying infectious diseases and causative pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate mortality and morbidities in patients with community-acquired sepsis treated with carbapenems as initial antibiotic therapy compared with those treated with noncarbapenem antibiotics.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (third-generation cephalosporin-resistant), ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend to administer a carbapenem (imipenem or meropenem) as targeted therapy for the treatment of bloodstream infections and severe infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales.

### Cefdinir: an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin [^112FMZJx]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Cefdinir is an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, acute bacterial otitis media, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections in adult and pediatric patients.

Objective

The purpose of this article was to review the in vitro antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and potential role of cefdinir.

Methods

Studies were identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1983-September 2001) of the English-language medical literature, a review of identified articles and their bibliographies, and a review of data on file with the manufacturer. Clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. Information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and the pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir also was reviewed.

Results

Cefdinir has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by 13 of the common beta-lactamases. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (mean time to peak plasma concentration, 3 hours) and is almost entirely eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. Efficacy has been demonstrated in 19 clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (eg, pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia), and skin and skin-structure infections. The adverse-event profile is similar to that of comparator agents, although in 4 adult and adolescent studies and 1 adult study, diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in cefdinir recipients than in recipients of penicillin V, cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefprozil.

Conclusions

Cefdinir is an alternative to other antimicrobial agents and can be dosed once or twice daily for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. Similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of selected beta-lactamases. The clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.

### A systematic review: can one prescribe carbapenems to patients with IgE-mediated allergy to penicillins or cephalosporins? [^113RYC9R]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Cross-reactivity between penicillins or cephalosporins and carbapenems is anticipated as all have a beta lactam ring. However, the true incidence of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated cross-reactivity is not known.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to collect and combine all published data on children and adults reported to have a clinical history of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to a penicillin and/or cephalosporin who were subsequently given a carbapenem. Reactions were classified as proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated and non-IgE-mediated.

Results

Ten studies and 12 case reports describing 854 participants fit the study criteria. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated penicillin reactions (N = 838), the incidence of any type of suspected hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 36/838 (4.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1%-5.9%) and the incidence of proven (1/838), suspected (0/838), or possible (19/838) IgE-mediated reactions was 20/838 (2.4%; 95% CI, 1.6%-3.7%). Of the subset of patients with positive penicillin skin tests (n = 295), only 1 had a hypersensitivity reaction (0.3%; 95% CI, .06%-1.9%), and this was a possible IgE-mediated reaction. For patients with previous proven, suspected, or possible IgE-mediated cephalosporin reactions (N = 12), the incidence of any type of hypersensitivity reaction to a carbapenem was 3/12 (25%); this included 2 non-IgE-mediated reactions and 1 possible IgE-mediated reaction.

Conclusions

The cross-reactivity between penicillins and carbapenems for IgE-mediated reactions is very low, but caution is still advised. Cross-reactivity rates may be higher between cephalosporins and carbapenems; however, minimal data are available.

### Empiric use of cefepime in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in children [^11679DHR]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

These studies were designed to assess the efficacy and safety of cefepime, a fourth generation cephalosporin, for the treatment of serious infections, including lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children.

Methods

Four clinical trials of cefepime for the treatment of serious bacterial infections enrolled 259 children with LRTI. In 3 trials cefepime was compared with ceftazidime (n = 166), cefotaxime (n = 16) or cefuroxime (n = 12). One trial was noncomparative (n = 65).

Results

Treatment with cefepime 50 mg/kg/ dose administered every 8 to 12 h produced a satisfactory clinical response (clinical signs of infection resolved or improved with no evidence of recurrent infection at posttreatment follow-up) in 88 to 100% of patients, comparable with comparator therapy. In children from whom a causative pathogen was identified, bacteriologic eradication was comparable between cefepime and comparator therapy. Cefepime was as safe and well-tolerated as comparator therapy. Few treatment-related clinical or laboratory adverse events were noted and were equivalent to comparator in all studies.

Conclusion

Cefepime is as effective, safe and well-tolerated for the empiric treatment of children with LRTI as comparator agents but offers the advantage of an enhanced spectrum of activity for Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens compared with second or third generation cephalosporins.

### Fluoroquinolones protective against cephalosporin resistance in gram-negative nosocomial pathogens [^116MbJ7V]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Our data as well as those of Kaye et al. suggest that fluoroquinolones could be substituted for certain types of β-lactam antimicrobial drugs to prevent the emergence and lower the rates of isolation of the most common third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative nosocomial pathogens. The potential advantages of adding fluoroquinolones to the armamentarium of agents that can be used to combat third-generation cephalosporin resistance are several: they can be administered orally; they are relatively nontoxic and inexpensive; and they may allow the replacement of earlier generation cephalosporins, receipt of which has previously been identified as a risk factor for isolation of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative organisms.

A limitation of retrospective analyses is the inability to prove what appear to be causal relationships. Statistical associations are interpreted as risk factors, and inverse associations as protective effects. Proof that fluoroquinolones are in fact protective against the isolation of nosocomial third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative pathogens, as suggested by the inverse association demonstrated here, will require animal models or prospective interventional studies. Such studies will also be required to determine whether reduced third-generation cephalosporin resistance will come at the cost of increased levels of fluoroquinolone resistance, a phenomenon to which Burke has referred as "squeezing the balloon". Fluoroquinolone resistance, not addressed in our study, occurs primarily by means of chromosomal mutation, and resistant mutants could potentially be selected for by increased use of this class of antimicrobial agent. Our data, then, provide the impetus for further studies, including a prospective interventional trial to explore the overall protective efficacy of fluoroquinolones against multiresistant gram-negative pathogens.

Cephalosporin-based regimens and cephalosporin–β-lactamase inhibitor combinations — standard options and restrictions: Do not use cefoxitin and cefotetan routinely for empiric therapy (Grade 2-B). Do not use cefazolin plus metronidazole routinely for empiric therapy (Grade 2-C). Consider use of cefuroxime plus metronidazole as an option for empiric therapy of lower-risk adults and children (Grade 2-B). Use cefotaxime or ceftriaxone plus metronidazole for empiric therapy of lower-risk adults and children (Grade 1-A). Consider use of ceftazidime plus metronidazole as an option for empiric therapy of adults and children (Grade 2-A), but reserve this regimen primarily for higher-risk patients because of its broader-spectrum antimicrobial activity (Grade 2-C). Use cefepime plus metronidazole for empiric therapy of adults and children (Grade 1-A), but reserve this regimen primarily for higher-risk patients because of its broader-spectrum antimicrobial activity (Grade 2-C). Consider use of cefoperazone-sulbactam as an option for empiric therapy of lower-risk adults and children, in areas where this agent is available (Grade 2-B).

### An international prospective cohort study to validate 2 prediction rules for infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant enterobacterales [^113d66ow]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We externally validated 2 prediction rules for 3GC-R infections in patients with a clinical infection in whom empiric antibiotic treatment covering gram-negative bacteria was initiated. The rule for community-onset infections showed good discrimination and calibration and has the potential to safely reduce unnecessary carbapenem use. The hospital-onset rule had poor calibration, and its clinical utility was therefore limited.

The prediction rules illustrate the challenging trade-off between inappropriate therapy and overtreatment with broad- spectrum antibiotics. Prediction rules have been considered one of the options to mitigate the increase of broad-spectrum antibiotic prescriptions by aiding risk assessment of patients. While other researchers previously developed prediction tools for Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-BSI/3GC-R-BSI, prediction rules have either not been validated or validation yielded poor performance. Moreover, since these prediction rules (except for Fröding et al) were derived from comparisons of 3GC-R-BSI with other gram-negative BSIs, they are unsuitable for aiding in initiation of empiric treatment. Most of these studies do not report on calibration, arguably a more important performance metric than discrimination for clinical prediction rules, since accurately predicted risks are the basis for classifying patients in treatment groups. We consider this international validation an important step forward in using prediction rules to improve antibiotic use.

### Cefepime therapy and all-cause mortality [^116oVvw4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

The findings of increased all-cause mortality associated with cefepime therapy reported in a 2007 meta-analysis by Yahav and colleagues in The Lancet Infectious Disease prompted an early communication by the Food Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA stated that it would review more safety data to further evaluate the risk of death to patients treated with cefepime. The meta-analysis' conclusion and the FDA early communication have stirred up debates in many institutions about how to properly adjust their antibiotic practice. Our review of the method of the meta-analyis (e.g., the method of data collection)raises questions about its conclusion; we call for additional review of the clinical data before any effort is made to limit or eliminate cefepime from the current practice guidelines. We make a number of recommendations on the appropriate use of cefepime therapy while awaiting further FDA advice.

### Cefepime [^116Sme78]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cefepime is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)].

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Similar to other beta-lactam antimicrobial agents, the time that the unbound plasma concentration of cefepime exceeds the MIC of the infecting organism has been shown to best correlate with efficacy in animal models of infection. However, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics relationship for cefepime has not been evaluated in patients.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Pharmacokinetic parameters for cefepime in healthy adult male volunteers (n = 9) following single 30‑minute infusions (IV) of cefepime 500 mg, 1 g, and 2 g are summarized in Table 7. Elimination of cefepime is principally via renal excretion with an average (± SD) half-life of 2 (± 0.3) hours and total body clearance of 120 (± 8) mL/min in healthy volunteers. Cefepime pharmacokinetics are linear over the range 250 mg to 2 g. There is no evidence of accumulation in healthy adult male volunteers (n = 7) receiving clinically relevant doses for a period of 9 days.

Table 7: Mean Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Cefepime (± SD), Intravenous Administration

Pharmacokinetic parameters for cefepime following a single intramuscular injection are summarized in Table 8. The pharmacokinetics of cefepime are linear over the range of 500 mg to 2 g intramuscularly and do not vary with respect to treatment duration.

Absorption

Following intramuscular (IM) administration, cefepime is completely absorbed.

Distribution

The average steady-state volume of distribution of cefepime is 18 (± 2) L. The serum protein binding of cefepime is approximately 20% and is independent of its concentration in serum.

### Nursing home residents and enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins [^117RbyJS]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Discussion

Enterobacteriaceae infections resistant to cephalosporins are of concern in long-term care facilities and in the acute-care setting. Patients with infections resistant to third-generation cephalosporins have been reported to have had longer hospital stays, higher death rates, and greater hospital costs than patients whose infections are susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. A survey of infection control practitioners in Ontario showed that no standard approach exists to dealing with ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella spp. in long-term-care facilities. Reservoirs of resistant Enterobacteriaceae species will continue to emerge in this setting despite implementation of control measures.

Our findings show that recent exposure to any cephalosporin is associated with the isolation of third-generation cephalosporin–resistant Enterobacteriaceae in nursing home residents. Knowledge of previous exposure may help physicians anticipate this particular pattern of resistance.
