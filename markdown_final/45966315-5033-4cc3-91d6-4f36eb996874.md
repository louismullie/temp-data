## Question

epidemiology, clinical course, prognosis and risk factors of blunt chest trauma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the epidemiology, clinical course, prognosis, and risk factors for blunt chest trauma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the entity and its mechanisms. Then, I should quantify epidemiology and burden. Next, I will characterize the clinical course and timing of complications. After that, I will appraise prognosis and mortality patterns. Finally, I will identify and weigh risk factors, including modifiable and non-modifiable elements, and close with practical clinical implications and limitations of the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the definition and mechanisms so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Blunt chest trauma is a non-penetrating injury to the thorax from high-energy impacts such as motor vehicle collisions, falls, direct blows, compression, deceleration, and blast waves, producing a spectrum including rib/sternal fractures, pulmonary contusion, pneumothorax/hemothorax, blunt cardiac injury, and traumatic aortic injury, among others [^112GsPBz] [^114Y4aTc] [^113k7JDJ].

> I should double-check the epidemiologic burden before drawing conclusions. Blunt chest trauma accounts for roughly 10–25% of trauma presentations and contributes substantially to mortality; thoracic trauma is the third most common cause of death after abdominal and head injuries in polytrauma, directly responsible for about 25% of trauma deaths and contributory in another 25%, with blunt mechanisms predominating over penetrating in many settings [^112GsPBz] [^114Y4aTc] [^113k7JDJ]. Wait, let me verify the rib fracture subset: rib fractures are the most common thoracic injury and occur in roughly 10–15% of trauma admissions, underscoring their frequency and clinical relevance [^116i1ZLc] [^1172gaTR].

> Next, I should review the clinical course and timing so I don't miss delayed complications. Patients may initially appear stable, but respiratory complications often emerge 48–72 hours after injury, peaking around day 3, which mandates anticipatory monitoring and early intervention planning [^115yNEfZ] [^1176V7mE]. Hold on, I should verify the early mortality window: the highest mortality risk is concentrated in the first 24 hours, particularly from airway compromise, tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, and great vessel injury, reinforcing the need for early recognition and definitive stabilization [^112GsPBz].

> I will now examine prognosis and mortality patterns, but I need to be cautious about heterogeneity. Reported mortality ranges widely from about 4% to 60% depending on injury severity, mechanism, and patient factors, with an overall figure near 15% in some series and markedly higher in severe thoracic injury or polytrauma contexts [^115yNEfZ] [^112GsPBz]. Let me verify ARDS-specific signals: trauma-induced ARDS occurs in roughly 1% of trauma patients nationally, yet mortality among those with ARDS remains high and has paradoxically increased over time despite falling incidence, highlighting persistent severity and care challenges [^111J1q9A] [^117WJLnK]. I should confirm blunt cardiac injury mortality: contemporary reviews estimate about 13.9% mortality across the spectrum of BCI, aligning with older series and underscoring the need for vigilant screening and complication-directed management [^113bqmGN].

> Now, I need to identify and weigh risk factors, starting with non-modifiable demographics. Age ≥ 65 years consistently doubles mortality risk and is associated with higher complication rates; ACEP also recommends age-based triage considerations given disproportionate morbidity in older adults, which I should keep in mind for disposition decisions [^1139CZPM] [^1151j1un]. But wait, what if the effect is just confounded by comorbidity? Even after adjustment, age remains a robust predictor in pooled analyses, supporting independent prognostic value beyond comorbidity alone [^1139CZPM].

> Next, I should review injury-specific anatomic factors. Three or more rib fractures independently increase mortality by roughly twofold, and flail chest — often coexisting with pulmonary contusion — carries substantial morbidity and ventilation requirements, with mortality in isolated flail chest lower than historically cited but still nontrivial and tightly linked to ventilator dependence and pneumonia [^1139CZPM] [^115XUin6]. Hold on, I should verify lung contusion quantification: objective CT-derived contusion burden ≥ 24% of total lung volume strongly predicts ARDS and pneumonia, offering a practical threshold for early escalation and surveillance planning [^116X4cok].

> I need to check physiologic and severity markers that guide risk stratification. Hypoxemia with oxygen saturation < 90% on presentation, higher ISS, and the need for mechanical ventilation are consistent predictors of complications and mortality; a low SpO2/FiO2 ratio in the first 24 hours also portends prolonged ventilation and adverse outcomes, reinforcing the value of early objective respiratory assessment [^116ZaahJ] [^1139CZPM] [^111J1q9A]. Let me reconsider the ISS threshold: while many studies dichotomize at ISS ≥ 16–18, the directionality is clear — higher global injury burden correlates with worse outcomes, and this should be integrated with thoracic-specific scores and clinical evolution [^116uBVuj].

> I should confirm comorbidity and pre-injury medication effects. Pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease, chronic lung disease, and anticoagulant use independently increase complications and mortality; these factors impair compensatory mechanics and amplify bleeding risk, necessitating tailored analgesia, thromboprophylaxis, and monitoring strategies [^1139CZPM] [^116ZaahJ]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought pre-injury anticoagulation might not independently matter after adjustment, but multiple datasets show persistent association with complications, so I should not underweight this risk [^116ZaahJ].

> Let me consider modifiable and system-level contributors so I can translate risk into action. Aggressive crystalloid resuscitation in the first 24 hours increases ARDS risk, whereas restrictive fluid strategies and protocolized ARDS care mitigate this; early definitive fracture fixation in appropriate polytrauma patients may reduce pneumonia without clear mortality benefit, and adherence to evidence-based practices for rib fracture care — including multimodal analgesia and selective surgical stabilization — improves outcomes, though access and center verification status influence delivery [^111J1q9A] [^1168Eomv] [^116N8oQd] [^114cGMmS] [^1172gaTR]. I should double-check that non-flail rib fractures lack sufficient evidence for routine fixation; guidelines appropriately call for selective use rather than blanket operative management [^112Ph74q].

> Next, I should review special injury patterns that carry distinct prognostic implications. Blunt cardiac injury spans arrhythmias, contusion, and rare rupture, with mortality near 14% and a need for ECG, troponin, and echocardiography to risk-stratify for complications; traumatic aortic injury requires urgent CT angiography and graded management from anti-impulse therapy and surveillance for low-grade injuries to emergent TEVAR for high-grade lesions, where timing and anatomy dictate intervention [^113bqmGN] [^114tv5tM] [^1141ZQNP] [^117FE33Q]. Hold on, I should verify the imaging pathway: CTA is first-line for suspected blunt thoracic aortic injury in stable patients, with immediate repair for active extravasation or high-risk grade 3–4 injuries per contemporary vascular guidelines [^111cjqnW] [^112eBATv].

> I should confirm how to operationalize risk at the bedside. A validated, prospectively tested risk score incorporating age, number of rib fractures, chronic lung disease, pre-injury anticoagulation, and oxygen saturation stratifies early complication risk and can guide disposition thresholds, with a score ≥ 11 suggesting high risk and ≥ 26 prompting ICU-level care in external validation cohorts; this complements, rather than replaces, clinical judgment [^113qjWkV] [^111N3vxE]. Let me verify performance: the model showed excellent discrimination and practical calibration, supporting its use for triage and counseling while still allowing individualized decisions [^113qjWkV].

> Finally, I need to ensure the synthesis is coherent and clinically actionable. Blunt chest trauma is common, frequently severe, and dynamically evolving, with early mortality from immediate threats and delayed complications — especially ARDS and pneumonia — peaking at 48–72 hours; older age, multiple rib fractures, pulmonary contusion, hypoxemia, high ISS, and comorbidities independently worsen outcomes, while modifiable factors like fluid strategy, pain control, respiratory support, and selective surgical stabilization can mitigate risk when implemented in experienced, guideline-concordant centers [^112GsPBz] [^111J1q9A] [^116N8oQd] [^114cGMmS]. I should double-check that my conclusions align with contemporary guidelines emphasizing systematic evaluation, early imaging, and multidisciplinary care, which they do, though local resources and patient factors will always shape the final plan [^112vd3DF] [^116ydjpB] [^114bFyXv].

Blunt chest trauma is common and carries **significant morbidity and mortality** [^114Y4aTc], with rib fractures and pulmonary contusions frequent and complications such as pneumonia, ARDS, and hemothorax common [^116i1ZLc] [^1176V7mE]. Mortality is **higher in older adults, those with multiple rib fractures, pre-existing disease, and high injury severity** [^1139CZPM]; early complications (pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion) and delayed issues (pneumonia, ARDS, empyema) drive poor outcomes [^1176V7mE] [^111J1q9A]. Management is supportive, with **pain control, respiratory support, and early mobilization** [^116N8oQd] [^1161TEDw]; surgical stabilization is reserved for select cases, and prognosis depends on age, injury severity, and comorbidities [^114cGMmS] [^1139CZPM].

---

## Epidemiology

- **Incidence**: Blunt chest trauma accounts for ~10–25% of trauma admissions [^113qjWkV] and ~20–25% of trauma deaths [^113k7JDJ].
- **Mechanisms**: Motor vehicle collisions, falls, and direct blows are the most common causes [^114Y4aTc] [^112GsPBz].
- **Demographics**: Older adults are disproportionately affected due to falls and frailty [^1163vZ5U].

---

## Clinical course

- **Initial presentation**: Patients often have chest pain, dyspnea, hypoxia, and respiratory distress [^112GsPBz]; rib fractures and pulmonary contusions are common [^116i1ZLc].
- **Early complications**: Pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, and flail chest can occur within hours [^1176V7mE].
- **Delayed complications**: Pneumonia, ARDS, empyema, and respiratory failure may develop over days to weeks [^111J1q9A] [^1176V7mE].

---

## Prognosis

- **Mortality**: Ranges from 4–60% depending on injury severity, age, and comorbidities [^115yNEfZ] [^113qjWkV].
- **Factors influencing prognosis**: Age ≥ 65, ≥ 3 rib fractures, pre-existing disease, high ISS, and mechanical ventilation increase mortality [^1139CZPM] [^114Ahgr5].
- **Long-term outcomes**: Chronic pain, respiratory impairment, and reduced quality of life are common, especially in older adults [^116i1ZLc] [^1176V7mE].

---

## Risk factors for poor outcomes

| **Risk factor** | **Impact on outcomes** |
|-|-|
| Age ≥ 65 years | Increased mortality and complications [^1139CZPM] [^114Ahgr5] |
| ≥ 3 rib fractures | Higher mortality and respiratory complications [^1139CZPM] [^116i1ZLc] |
| Pre-existing disease | Increased mortality and complications [^1139CZPM] [^114Ahgr5] |
| High ISS | Increased mortality and complications [^1139CZPM] [^116uBVuj] |
| Mechanical ventilation | Increased mortality and complications [^1139CZPM] [^115XUin6] |
| Pulmonary contusion | Increased risk of ARDS and pneumonia [^111J1q9A] [^1176V7mE] |

---

## Management and interventions

- **Supportive care**: Pain control, respiratory support, and early mobilization are foundational [^116N8oQd] [^1161TEDw].
- **Surgical stabilization**: Considered for flail chest or severe rib fractures to reduce ventilator days and complications [^114cGMmS].
- **Complication management**: Timely intervention for pneumothorax, hemothorax, and infections improves outcomes [^112Fezcx].

---

Blunt chest trauma is a major cause of trauma morbidity and mortality, with outcomes shaped by age, injury severity, and comorbidities [^113k7JDJ] [^1139CZPM]. Early recognition, supportive care, and targeted interventions are **essential to optimize prognosis** [^112vd3DF].

Conclusion

Chest trauma management must be multidisciplinary. Emergency and trauma systems should be organized and prepared to face all its aspects to prevent underestimation of its evolution. Patients should be strictly monitored and followed to prevent delayed deterioration and complications. Secondary centralization algorithms must be defined and implemented to warrant the best treatment for all patients that may be initially admitted in spoke hospitals with reduced resource level.

Trauma in the elderly (> 65 years) is an increasingly common presentation to the ED. A fall from standing height is the most common mechanism after which such patients present, and rib fracture is the most common non-spinal fracture. Thoracic injury in patients aged over 65 is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There are currently no universally applied guidelines for assessment, investigation and management of such patients. In this expert practice review, we discuss the evidence base and options for clinical management in this vulnerable patient group.

### Impact of comorbidities in severely injured patients with blunt chest injury: a population-based retrospective cohort study [^1155vJ1a]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blunt chest injuries result in up to 10% of major trauma admissions. Comorbidities can complicate recovery and increase the mortality rate in this patient cohort. A better understanding of the association between comorbidities and patient outcomes will facilitate enhanced models of care for particularly vulnerable groups of patients, such as older adults.

Aims

i) compare the characteristics of severely injured patients with blunt chest injury with and without comorbidities and ii) examine the relationship between comorbidities and key patient outcomes: prolonged length of stay, re-admission within 28 days, and mortality within 30 days in a cohort of patients with blunt chest injury admitted after severe trauma.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study using linked data from the NSW Trauma Registry and NSW mortality and hospitalisation records between 1st of January 2012 and 31st of December 2019.

Results

After adjusting for potential confounding factors, patients with severe injuries, chest injuries, and comorbidities were found to have a 34% increased likelihood of having a prolonged length of stay (OR = 1.34, 95%I = 1.17–1.53) compared to patients with no comorbidities. There was no difference in 30-day mortality for patients with a severe chest injury who did or did not have comorbidities (OR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.80–1.39). No significant association was found between comorbidities and re-admission within 28 days.

Conclusion

Severely injured patients with blunt chest injury and comorbidities are at risk of prolonged length of stay.

### Risk factors that predict mortality in patients with blunt chest wall trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Ahgr5]. Injury (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The risk factors for mortality following blunt chest wall trauma have neither been well established or summarised.

Objective

To summarise the risk factors for mortality in blunt chest wall trauma patients based on available evidence in the literature.

Data Sources

A systematic review of English and non-English articles using MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from their introduction until May 2010. Additional studies were identified by hand-searching bibliographies and contacting relevant clinical experts. Grey literature was sought by searching abstracts from all Emergency Medicine conferences. Broad search terms and inclusion criteria were used to reduce the number of missed studies.

Study Selection

A two step study selection process was used. All published and unpublished observational studies were included if they investigated estimates of association between a risk factor and mortality for blunt chest wall trauma patients.

Data Extraction

A two step data extraction process using pre-defined data fields, including study quality indicators.

Study Appraisal and Synthesis

Each study was appraised using a previously designed quality assessment tool and the STROBE checklist. Where sufficient data were available, odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel method for the risk factors investigated. The I(2) statistic was calculated for combined studies in order to assess heterogeneity.

Results

Age, number of rib fractures, presence of pre-existing disease and pneumonia were found to be related to mortality in 29 identified studies. Combined odds ratio of 1.98 (1.86–2.11, 95% CI), 2.02 (1.89–2.15, 95% CI), 2.43 (1.03–5.72, 95% CI) and 5.24 (3.51–7.82) for mortality were calculated for blunt chest wall trauma patients aged 65 years or more, with three or more rib fractures, pre-existing conditions and pneumonia respectively.

Conclusions

The risk factors for mortality in patients sustaining blunt chest wall trauma were a patient age of 65 years or more, three or more rib fractures and the presence of pre-existing disease especially cardiopulmonary disease. The development of pneumonia post injury was also a significant risk factor for mortality. As a result of the variable quality in the studies, the results of the selected studies should be interpreted with caution.

### Analysis of risk factors in thoracic trauma patients with a comparison of a modern trauma centre: a mono-centre study [^114Y4aTc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Trauma continues to be a major public health problem worldwide, as it is associated with high morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries, with approximately 5.8 million deaths worldwide. Trauma has also been reported to be the leading cause of death, hospitalisation and long-term disabilities in the first four decades of life. Thoracic trauma comprises 20–25% of all traumas worldwide and constitutes the third most common cause of death after abdominal injury and head trauma in polytrauma patients. It directly accounts for approximately 25% of trauma-related mortality and is a contributing factor in another 25% of such cases. Blunt thoracic injuries are more common than penetrating injuries, with the most frequent causes being motor vehicle accidents, falls and crush injuries.

Penetrating injury causes a laceration of anatomic structures in the trajectory of the weapon. A knife injury is typically limited to the length of the blade and the corresponding depth of the wound, assuming that the entire blade has penetrated in each instance. Blunt injury, on the other hand, is much more common and usually compounded by dislocated skeletal fracture, which may lacerate the underlying viscera with sharp fragments. Although most injuries caused by blunt thoracic trauma are usually managed by chest tube drainage, surgical interventions are occasionally required in severe cases. Blunt thoracic trauma, especially after motor vehicle accidents, is usually associated with a higher thoracic Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS thoracic) score and Injury Severity Score (ISS). Therefore, individuals are susceptible to a higher risk of morbidity and mortality after thoracic trauma.

Time management is a very important task, especially in patients with high ISS and AIS thoracic. During the first hour after hospital admission, thoracic vascular and neurologic trauma are the most common causes of death. The presence of an interdisciplinary team with high experience in anaesthesia, critical care and surgical disciplines, especially neurosurgery, trauma surgery, abdominal surgery and thoracic surgery, is mandatory to ensure high-quality management with low morbidity and mortality rates in these patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the epidemiology, characteristics, incidence, management and risk factors affecting the outcome of polytrauma patients with chest injury admitted to our tertiary care facilities' level I trauma centre in order to identify factors influencing management, possible complications and patient mortality.

### Multi-detector row computed tomography and blunt chest trauma [^1113iKnY]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Blunt chest trauma is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. The clinical presentation of trauma patients varies widely from one individual to another and ranges from minor reports of pain to shock. Knowledge of the mechanism of injury, the time of injury, estimates of motor vehicle accident velocity and deceleration, and evidence of associated injury to other systems are all salient features to provide for an adequate assessment of chest trauma. Multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT) scanning and MDCT-angiography are being used more frequently in the diagnosis of patients with chest trauma. The high sensitivity of MDCT has increased the recognized spectrum of injuries. This new technology can be regarded as an extremely valuable adjunct to physical examination to recognize suspected and unsuspected blunt chest trauma.

### Predicting outcomes after blunt chest wall trauma: development and external validation of a new prognostic model [^115yNEfZ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blunt chest-wall trauma accounted for over 15% of all trauma admissions to Emergency departments (EDs) worldwide. Reported mortality ranges between 4 and 60%, however, no current national guidelines exist to assist in the management of this patient group unless the patient has severe, immediate life-threatening injuries. The difficulties in the management of the blunt chest-wall trauma patient are becoming increasingly well recognised in the literature. The blunt chest-wall trauma patient commonly presents to the ED initially with no respiratory difficulties, but can develop respiratory complications approximately 48 to 72 hours later. Clinical symptoms are not considered an accurate predictor of outcome following non-life threatening blunt chest-wall trauma. Decisions on the appropriate level of care required by the patient following discharge from the ED are therefore difficult, which is further compounded by the lack of current national guidelines. A number of well-documented risk factors for morbidity and mortality exist for blunt chest-wall trauma, including patient age, pre-existing disease, number of ribs fractured and the onset of pneumonia during the recovery phase.

A prognostic model enables the clinician to use combinations of predictor values to estimate a probability that a specified outcome will occur. The resulting model may be used to divide the patient into categories of risk or predict probabilities of a pre-specified outcome. A number of models exist for blunt chest trauma, however, most are designed for use with patients with multiple injuries and very few have been externally validated or presented in a clinically practical way. For the purpose of this study, blunt chest-wall trauma was defined as blunt chest injury resulting in chest wall contusion or rib fractures, with or without non-immediate life-threatening lung injury. We have developed and validated a prognostic model for the development of complications following blunt chest-wall trauma. Using the results of the prognostic model, we have also developed a simple risk score for use in the clinical setting which can assist the clinician in the management of the blunt chest-wall trauma patient.

### Thoracic trauma WSES-AAST guidelines [^113k7JDJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chest trauma is a common event, blunt chest trauma is more common (70–80%) than penetrating and accounts for 20 to 25% of trauma deaths. In many low-middle-income countries (LMIC) penetrating trauma, both stab and gunshot wounds, are at least as common as blunt trauma, and immediately lethal, with over 75% of stab wounds to the heart dying before they can reach the hospital. Motor vehicle collisions are associated with higher morbidity and mortality due to high-speed collisions and particularly with non-use of seat belts. Older patients may have a worse outcome due to frailty and other comorbidities. Despite its higher incidence, less than 10% of patients with blunt chest trauma require surgical intervention. In contrast, up to 30% of patients with penetrating chest trauma require surgery and are associated with higher all-cause mortality.

The complex lesion pattern, that may involve more than one component of the thorax content and boundaries, need attention and deep knowledge of mechanical and physiological mechanisms. The present paper describes the recommendations provided by World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), about comprehensive management of thoracic trauma.

Notes on the use of the guidelines

The guidelines are evidence-based, with the grade of recommendation based on the evidence. The guidelines present the methods for optimal management of thoracic trauma patients. The practice guidelines promulgated in this work do not represent a standard of practice. They are suggested plans of care, based on the best available evidence and the consensus of experts, but they do not exclude other approaches as being within the standard of practice. For example, they should not be used to compel adherence to a given method of medical management, which method should be finally determined after taking account of the conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. However, responsibility for the results of treatment rests with those who are directly engaged therein, and not with the consensus group.

Translation of classes of evidence to recommendation levels — Level A recommendations are generally accepted principles for patient care that reflect a high degree of scientific certainty (eg, based on evidence from one or more Class of Evidence I or multiple Class of Evidence II studies that demonstrate consistent effects or estimates). Level B recommendations are recommendations for patient care that may identify a particular strategy or range of strategies that reflect moderate scientific certainty (eg, based on evidence from one or more Class of Evidence II studies or multiple Class of Evidence III studies that demonstrate consistent effects or estimates). Level C recommendations are recommendations for patient care that are based on evidence from Class of Evidence III studies or, in the absence of adequate published literature, based on expert consensus, and when consensus recommendations are made, "consensus" is placed in parentheses at the end of the recommendation. Recommendations stemming from a body of evidence may be downgraded due to consistency of results, the uncertainty of effect magnitude, and publication bias, and clinically oriented statistics (eg, likelihood ratios, number needed to treat) are presented to help apply results to individual patients and to patients with extremes of risk.

### Flail chest: less deadly than originally thought [^115XUin6]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Flail chest is considered a highly morbid condition with reported mortality ranging from 10 to 20%. It is often associated with other severe injuries, which may complicate management and interpretation of outcomes. The physiologic impact and prognosis of isolated flail chest injury is poorly defined.

Methods

This is a National Trauma Databank study. All patients from 1/2007 to 12/2014 admitted with flail chest were extracted. Patients with head or abdominal AIS ≥ 3, dead on arrival, or transferred, were excluded. Primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were need for mechanical ventilation and pneumonia.

Results

Of the 1,047,519 patients with blunt chest injury, 14,718 (1.4%) patients presented with flail chest, and 8098 (0.77%) met inclusion criteria. The most commonly associated intrathoracic injuries were hemothorax (57.9%) and lung contusions (63.0%), while sternal fracture (8.8%) and cardiac contusion (2.5%) were less common. In total, 29.8% of patients required mechanical ventilation, and 11.2% developed pneumonia. Overall mortality was 5.6%. On multivariable analysis, age > 65 and need for mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors for mortality (OR 6.02, 3.75, respectively, p < 0.001). Independent predictors for mechanical ventilation included cardiac or pulmonary contusion and sternal fractures (OR 3.78, 2.38, 2.29, respectively, p < 0.001). Need for mechanical ventilation was an independent predictor of pneumonia (OR 13.18, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Mortality in isolated flail chest is much lower than previously reported. Fewer than 30% of patients require mechanical ventilation. Need for mechanical ventilation, however, is independently associated with mortality and pneumonia. Age > 65 is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes, and these patients may benefit by more aggressive monitoring and treatment.

### High plasma levels of high mobility group box 1 is associated with the risk of sepsis in severe blunt chest trauma patients: a prospective cohort study [^111pk7v2]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a late mediator of systemic inflammation. Extracellular HMGB1 play a central pathogenic role in critical illness. The purpose of the study was to investigate the association between plasma HMGB1 concentrations and the risk of poor outcomes in patients with severe blunt chest trauma.

Methods

The plasma concentrations of HMGB1 in patients with severe blunt chest trauma (AIS ≥ 3) were measured by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at four time points during seven days after admission, and the dynamic release patterns were monitored. The biomarker levels were compared between patients with sepsis and non-sepsis, and between patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and non-MODS. The related factors of prognosis were analyzed by using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The short-form 36 was used to evaluate the quality of life of patients at 12 months after injury.

Results

Plasma HMGB1 levels were significantly higher both in sepsis and MODS group on post-trauma day 3, 5, and 7 compared with the non-sepsis and non-MODS groups, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that HMGB1 levels and ISS were independent risk factors for sepsis and MODS in patients with severe blunt chest trauma.

Conclusions

Plasma HMGB1 levels were significantly elevated in patients with severe blunt chest trauma. HMGB1 levels were associated with the risk of poor outcome in patients with severe blunt chest trauma. Daily HMGB1 levels measurements is a potential useful tool in the early identification of post-trauma complications. Further studies are needed to determine whether HMGB1 intervention could prevent the development of sepsis and MODS in patients with severe blunt chest trauma.

Score development

We developed a simple clinical score based on the regression coefficients from the final model. To calculate the risk score for the individual predictors, the coefficient of each predictor was multiplied by a factor so that the smallest coefficient was transformed into a value close to one. This method was adapted from previous studies. These individual scores were then added together to provide an overall risk score for each patient. Using the validation sample, each patient's final overall risk score was compared to their probability of developing complications initially calculated using the final logistic regression equation. The individual final risk scores were categorised into groups (0 to 10, 11 to 15, 16 to 20, 21 to 25, 26 to 30 and ≥ 30) and the mean and standard deviation of all the corresponding probabilities were calculated. This would provide the clinician with a probability of the development of complications for each possible final risk score. Estimates of appropriate cut off points were included guiding the clinician as to whether the patient could be safely discharged home, or whether they should be admitted to a ward or intensive care unit.

Ethical approval

Full ethical approval for this study was granted by the South West Wales Research Ethics Committee. Written consent to participate and publish study findings was provided by each recruited patient.

### Blunt chest trauma: a clinical chameleon [^112GsPBz]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on blunt chest trauma:

- **Definition**: Blunt chest trauma refers to a non-penetrating injury to the chest, often resulting from high-energy impact or forceful direct blow.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of blunt chest trauma involves a variety of mechanisms, including direct impact, rapid deceleration, compression, and blast waves. These mechanisms can lead to a wide range of injuries to the thoracic structures, including fractures of the ribs and sternum, lung contusions, pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac contusions, and aortic injuries.
- **Epidemiology**: Blunt chest trauma accounts for over 10% of all trauma cases presenting to the emergency department.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for blunt chest trauma include involvement in road traffic accidents, violent falls, interpersonal aggression, and high-risk sports.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with blunt chest trauma may present dyspnea, chest pain, and cough. Physical examination may reveal abnormal breath sounds, subcutaneous emphysema, and signs of respiratory distress. In some cases, cardiac conduction abnormalities may occur due to the trauma.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of blunt chest trauma is influenced by several factors. The overall mortality rate is 15%, with the highest rate observed within the first 24 hours post-trauma.

### American Association for the Surgery of Trauma / American college of surgeons committee on trauma clinical protocol for management of acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe hypoxemia [^111J1q9A]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of prognostic factors for development of ARDS following traumatic injury included 39 studies involving over 5.3 million patients and identified the amount of crystalloid resuscitation with the first 24 hours of injury as a modifiable risk factor (adjusted odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15–1.24 for each additional liter of crystalloid administered within the first 6 hours after injury; high certainty). Nonmodifiable prognostic factors with a moderate or high certainty of association with posttraumatic ARDS included increasing age, non-Hispanic White race, blunt mechanism of injury, presence of head injury, pulmonary contusion or rib fracture, and increasing chest injury severity. Early ARDS after trauma due to overresuscitation has decreased due to improved trauma resuscitation strategies, but ARDS related to TBI and pneumonia/sepsis persists. A recent systematic review (20 studies, n = 2830) reported that 19% of patients had ARDS after TBI, with a median time of 3 days. Acute respiratory distress syndrome was associated with higher mortality and worse neurologic outcomes. Other studies have confirmed a second peak of ARDS later in the ICU course related to pneumonia and sepsis.

While the incidence of trauma-induced ARDS has decreased, mortality in trauma patients with ARDS has increased. In the largest study of almost 3 million patients from the National Trauma Data Bank, 1% developed ARDS, but decreased from 1.4% to 0.5% over the 4-year study period. Hospital mortality was 22% in ARDS trauma patients, but increased from 21% to 28% over the study period. Acute respiratory distress syndrome risk factors included direct thoracic injury, increased age, male sex, higher ISS, lower GCS. In another study of over 800,000 Trauma Quality Improvement Program patients between 2010 and 2014, the incidence of ARDS decreased over the study years (3% to 1.1%) but ARDS-related mortality increased (18 to 21%, p = 0.001). Acute respiratory distress syndrome risk factors included older age, male sex, and African American race. Mortality risk factors included older age, male sex, lower Glasgow Coma Scale and higher ISS.

Because many of the ARDS risk factors are nonmodifiable, this protocol focuses on the treatment of ARDS in trauma patients. Providing ARDS patients with optimal, evidence-based care improves outcomes. Protocolized management ensures that ICU teams at the bedside have guidance regarding what constitutes the best evidence-based care.

### An innovative approach to predict the development of adult respiratory distress syndrome in patients with blunt trauma [^116X4cok]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary contusion (PC) is a common injury associated with blunt chest trauma. Complications such as pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occur in up to 50% of patients with PC. The ability to predict which PC patients are at increased risk of developing complications would be of tremendous clinical utility. In this study, we test the hypothesis that a novel method that objectively measures percent PC can be used to identify patients at risk to develop ARDS after injury.

Methods

Patients with unilateral or bilateral PC with an admission chest computed tomographic angiogram were identified from the trauma registry. Demographic, infectious, and outcome data were collected. Percent PC was determined on admission chest computed tomography using our novel semiautomated, attenuation-defined computer-based algorithm, in which the lung was segmented with minimal manual editing. Factors contributing to the development of ARDS were identified by both univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. ARDS was defined as PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200 with diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph with no evidence of congestive heart failure.

Results

Quantifying percent PC from our objective computer-based approach proved successful. We found that a contusion size of 24% of total lung volume or greater was most significant at predicting ARDS, which occurred in 78% of these patients. Such patients also had a significantly higher incidence of pneumonia when compared with those with contusions less than 24%. The specificity of contusion size of 24% or greater was 94%, although sensitivity was 37%; positive predictive value was 78%, and negative predictive value was 72%.

Conclusion

We developed and describe a software-based methodology to accurately measure the size of lung contusion in patients of blunt trauma. In our analyses, contusions of 24% or greater most significantly predict the development of ARDS. Such an objective approach can identify patients with PC who are at increased risk for developing respiratory complications before they happen. Further research is needed to use this novel methodology as a means to prevent posttraumatic lung injury in patients with blunt trauma.

### Predicting outcomes after blunt chest wall trauma: development and external validation of a new prognostic model [^116SMjE1]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Patient age, number of rib fractures, chronic lung disease, pre-injury anticoagulants and oxygen saturation levels were the significant risk factors for development of complications following blunt chest-wall trauma. Patient age, number of rib fractures and chronic lung disease have been reported as significant risk factors for poor outcomes in a number of recent studies and possible explanations for these factors have been previously discussed. Pre-injury anticoagulant use and oxygen saturation levels have only been reported as risk factors for the development for complications following blunt chest-wall trauma in a previous study by Battle et al. and therefore, further research into these risk factors would be beneficial.

The results of this study have demonstrated that risk can be easily and accurately stratified from simple demographic and clinical variables on initial assessment of the blunt chest-wall trauma patient in the ED. The risk factors are all currently routinely measured in the ED and do not require expensive, time-consuming or complicated technology to investigate. This is one of the most important factors in the success of prognostic model development according to previous research. The clinician would simply collect routine data, total the scores for each risk factor, then obtain the corresponding probability of the development of complications. A more accurate decision can be made by the clinician on whether the patient is safe for discharge home directly from the ED, or whether the patient requires admission to hospital. Not only could this reduce the development of complications in blunt chest-wall trauma patients through close observation and early aggressive prophylactic treatment in the admitted patient, but also reduce unnecessary admission of patients unlikely to develop complications.

The overall results of this study suggest that the final validation model could be safely and effectively used in the clinical setting in England and Wales for assisting in the management of blunt chest-wall trauma patients. This is the first prognostic model that has been developed and externally validated in a prospective multi-centre study for use with blunt chest-wall trauma patients. The model can be used with the less severely injured patient who on presentation to the ED is not suffering any overt signs of respiratory distress, but will potentially go on to develop severe life-threatening pulmonary complications. Research has demonstrated that careful observation and early aggressive therapy can limit these complications, therefore identification of the high-risk patient is imperative for optimal management. It is inevitable, however, that the final decision on patient management must be individualised and many factors that cannot be translated into a statistical model must be considered. The overall purpose of the prognostic model is simply to guide clinical decision-making, not replace it.

### Predicting outcomes after blunt chest wall trauma: development and external validation of a new prognostic model [^111N3vxE]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical score

Based on the results of the logistic regression analysis, we developed a simplified clinical score by transforming the regression coefficient of each predictor into an equivalent accurately weighted risk integer score (Table 4). For example, a 67-year-old (score 6) patient with three rib fractures (score 9), a history of chronic lung disease (score 5) and oxygen saturations of 87% (score 4) would have a final risk score of 24 points.

Table 4
Risk factor scores as transformed from the regression coefficients

a Per additional 10-year increase starting at 10 years of age; b per additional rib fracture; c per 5% decrease in oxygen saturations starting at 94%.

Table 5 illustrates the final risk scores and their corresponding probability of developing complications following blunt chest-wall trauma. Using these results, for example, it is possible to estimate that a patient who scores 12 has a 29% (± 8) probability of developing complications compared to a patient with a final risk score of 36 who has an 88% (± 7) probability of developing complications.

Table 5
Final risk scores and corresponding probability of developing complications

A final total risk score of ≥ 11 was the most accurate cut off point (in terms of sensitivity, specificity and predictive values) at which the blunt chest-wall trauma patient was considered at risk of developing complications. The percentage of patients who would have been correctly managed (admitted to hospital and subsequently developed complications) was 90% and those correctly discharged directly from the ED (who had not developed complications) would have been 87%. If a final risk score ≥ 26 was selected as the cut off point at which the blunt chest-wall trauma patient was considered a high enough risk to require ICU admission, then the percentage of patients correctly managed (scored at ≥ 26 and the observed outcome was ICU admission) was 95%. The percentage of patients who would have been incorrectly managed (scored at ≥ 26 but were not admitted to the ICU in the observed outcome) would have been 11%.

### The radiologic manifestations of blunt chest trauma… [^115RrN7R]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

APPROXIMATELY one half of the deaths from auto accidents result either directly or indirectly from thoracic injury. 1 Serious injury to the thoracic contents may exist with absent or mild symptoms, and therefore, a careful radiologic investigation of the thorax is important in all patients with known chest trauma or those involved in serious accidents, whether or not they have chest symptoms. Thoracic injuries range from such relatively unimportant problems as simple rib fracture to great-vessel laceration, which, if not recognized and treated promptly, will almost certainly result in the death of the patient. Fortunately, the roentgenogram will demonstrate most of the significant injuries. In this presentation, discussion of injuries to the heart and great vessels will be omitted.

### The risk factors for the development of complications during the recovery phase following blunt chest wall trauma: a retrospective study [^116ZaahJ]. Injury (2013). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The difficulties in the management of the blunt chest wall trauma patient in the Emergency Department (ED) due to the development of late complications are well recognised in the literature. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors for the development of complications in the recovery phase following blunt chest wall trauma.

Methods

A retrospective study was completed in which the medical notes were analysed of all blunt chest wall trauma patients presenting to a large trauma centre in South Wales in 2009 and 2010. Using univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis, the risk factors for development of complications during the recovery phase following blunt chest wall trauma were investigated.

Results

Risk factors for development of complications in the recovery phase following blunt chest wall trauma in the univariate analysis were a patient age of 65 years or more, three or more rib fractures, presence of chronic lung disease or cardiovascular disease, pre-injury anticoagulant use and blood oxygen saturation levels of less than 90%. On multivariable analysis, the risk factors were three or more rib fractures, chronic lung disease, pre-injury anticoagulant use and oxygen saturations of less than 90%.

Conclusion

A number of risk factors have been presented in this study which should be considered in the management of the blunt chest wall trauma patient. This is the first study in which a number of the risk factors have been investigated and this may provide the basis for further prospective studies.

### Emergency department management of patients with rib fracture based on a clinical practice guideline [^111Q1Pmk]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Blunt mechanism accounts for the majority of trauma in most centers and for > 15% of emergency department (ED) trauma visits worldwide. Approximately 35% of blunt trauma patients are diagnosed with one or more rib fractures. The risk of pulmonary complications such as pneumonia, pulmonary effusion, atelectasis and lobar collapse is drastically increased in patients with rib fractures. It has been widely documented that mortality rates in patients with rib fractures are high for young adults (10%) and even higher for the elderly (22%). Patients with chest wall injury are managed by surgical and emergency medicine teams that use protocols to dictate interventions and disposition. Decision-making in patients with severe blunt trauma and rib fractures is less complicated if mechanical ventilation or emergent surgical intervention is required. When injuries are less severe, it becomes difficult to decipher who may require more aggressive management and who is appropriate for discharge from the ED. Symptoms are insufficient to determine appropriate discharge. Additionally, symptoms are not considered accurate in predicting the outcome and morbidity in patients with thoracic trauma. There are no current nationally recognized clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management in this population.

### Risk factors that predict mortality in patients with blunt chest wall trauma: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^1139CZPM]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the last 10 years, research has highlighted emerging potential risk factors for poor outcomes following blunt chest wall trauma. The aim was to update a previous systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk factors for mortality in blunt chest wall trauma patients.

Methods

A systematic review of English and non-English articles using MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library from January 2010 to March 2022 was completed. Broad search terms and inclusion criteria were used. All observational studies were included if they investigated estimates of association between a risk factor and mortality for blunt chest wall trauma patients. Where sufficient data were available, ORs with 95% CIs were calculated using a Mantel-Haenszel method. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic.

Results

73 studies were identified which were of variable quality (including 29 from original review). Identified risk factors for mortality following blunt chest wall trauma were: age 65 years or more (OR: 2.11; 95% CI 1.85 to 2.41), three or more rib fractures (OR: 1.96; 95% CI 1.69 to 2.26) and presence of pre-existing disease (OR: 2.86; 95%CI 1.34 to 6.09). Other new risk factors identified were: increasing Injury Severity Score, need for mechanical ventilation, extremes of body mass index and smoking status. Meta-analysis was not possible for these variables due to insufficient studies and high levels of heterogeneity.

Conclusions

The results of this updated review suggest that despite a change in demographics of trauma patients and subsequent emerging evidence over the last 10 years, the main risk factors for mortality in patients sustaining blunt chest wall trauma remained largely unchanged. A number of new risk factors however have been reported that need consideration when updating current risk prediction models used in the ED.

### Analysis of clinical risk factors associated with the prognosis of severe multiple-trauma patients with acute lung injury [^112j28wR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Several clinical risk factors have been reported to be associated with the prognosis of acute lung injury (ALI). However, these studies have included a general trauma patient population, without singling out the severely injured multiple-trauma patient population.

Objectives

To identify the potential risk factors that could affect the prognosis of ALI in multiple-trauma patients and investigate the prognostic effects of certain risk factors among different patient subpopulations.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, severely injured multiple-trauma patients with early onset of ALI from several trauma centers were studied. Potential risk factors affecting the prognosis of ALI were examined by univariate and multivariate logistic analyses.

Results

There were 609 multiple-trauma patients with ALI admitted to the emergency department and emergency intensive care unit during the study period. The nine risk factors that affected prognosis, as indicated by the unadjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, were the APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) score, duration of trauma, age, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, pulmonary contusion, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), multiple blood transfusions in 6 h, Injury Severity Score (ISS), and aspiration of gastric contents. Specific risk factors also affected different patient subpopulations in different ways.

Conclusions

Patients older than 65 years and with multiple (> 10 units) blood transfusions in the early stage after multiple trauma were found to be independent risk factors associated with deterioration of ALI. The other factors studied, including pulmonary contusion, APACHE II score ≥ 20, ISS ≥ 16, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and aspiration of gastric contents, may predict the unfavorable prognosis of ALI in the early stage of trauma, with their effects attenuating in the later stage. Duration of trauma ≥ 1 h and the presence of DIC may also indicate unfavorable prognosis during the entire treatment period.

### Factors affecting mortality of hospitalized chest trauma patients in United Arab Emirates [^113XVN5t]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Injury is a leading cause of death worldwide and is the second cause of death in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The mortality rate of patients having chest trauma ranges between 4% and 20% worldwide. The pattern of chest trauma and its clinical presentation vary between different countries. Consequently, predictors of mortality vary in different settings. When chest trauma is not life threatening, management decisions become less clear. Clinical presentations alone have a low predictive value of mortality and may not be enough to guide the decision making process.

Studies on predictors of mortality of chest trauma are limited. Majority studied specific age groups like children and elderly, or studied specific chest injuries. Predictors of mortality of chest trauma have been defined in different settings. Significant factors included the age, presence of flail chest, co-morbidities, number of fractured ribs, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS) and quality of pre-hospital care. There are no similar studies from the Middle East. We aimed to define the factors affecting mortality of hospitalized chest trauma patients in Al-Ain, UAE.

### Nationwide cohort study of independent risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome after trauma [^117WJLnK]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of specific direct and indirect factors that accounted, in trauma patients, for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality in patients with ARDS.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients from the National Trauma Data Bank. Multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression was used with the development of ARDS as the primary and mortality in patients with ARDS as the secondary outcome measures. We compared trauma patients with versus without thoracic (direct) and extrathoracic (indirect) risk factors, using patient demographics, physiologic, and anatomic injury severity as covariates. Subset analysis was performed for patients with trauma-induced lung contusion (TILC) and for patients with minor (Injury Severity Score [ISS] ≤ 15) injury.

Results

A total of 2 998 964 patients were studied, of whom 28597 developed ARDS. From 2011 to 2014, the incidence of ARDS decreased; however, mortality in patients with ARDS has increased. Predictors of ARDS included direct thoracic injury (TILC, multiple rib fractures, and flail chest), as well as indirect factors (increased age, male gender, higher ISS, lower Glasgow Coma Scale motor component score, history of cardiopulmonary or hematologic disease, and history of alcoholism or obesity). Patients with ARDS secondary to direct thoracic injury had a lower risk of mortality compared with patients with ARDS due to other mechanisms.

Discussion

Despite the decreasing incidence of trauma-induced ARDS, mortality in patients with ARDS has increased. Direct thoracic injury was the strongest predictor of ARDS. Knowing specific contributors to trauma-induced ARDS could help identify at-risk patients early in their hospitalization and mitigate the progression to ARDS and thereby mortality.

### Predicting outcomes after blunt chest wall trauma: development and external validation of a new prognostic model [^113qjWkV]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blunt chest wall trauma accounts for over 15% of all trauma admissions to Emergency Departments worldwide. Reported mortality rates vary between 4 and 60%. Management of this patient group is challenging as a result of the delayed on-set of complications. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a prognostic model that can be used to assist in the management of blunt chest wall trauma.

Methods

There were two distinct phases to the overall study; the development and the validation phases. In the first study phase, the prognostic model was developed through the retrospective analysis of all blunt chest wall trauma patients (n = 274) presenting to the Emergency Department of a regional trauma centre in Wales (2009 to 2011). Multivariable logistic regression was used to develop the model and identify the significant predictors for the development of complications. The model's accuracy and predictive capabilities were assessed. In the second study phase, external validation of the model was completed in a multi-centre prospective study (n = 237) in 2012. The model's accuracy and predictive capabilities were re-assessed for the validation sample. A risk score was developed for use in the clinical setting.

Results

Significant predictors of the development of complications were age, number of rib fractures, chronic lung disease, use of pre-injury anticoagulants and oxygen saturation levels. The final model demonstrated an excellent c-index of 0.96 (95% confidence intervals: 0.93 to 0.98).

Conclusions

In our two phase study, we have developed and validated a prognostic model that can be used to assist in the management of blunt chest wall trauma patients. The final risk score provides the clinician with the probability of the development of complications for each individual patient.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® blunt chest trauma – suspected aortic injury [^115RdvUY]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The purpose of these guidelines is to recommend appropriate imaging for patients with blunt chest trauma. These patients are most often imaged in the emergency room, and thus emergency radiologists play a substantial role in prompt, accurate diagnoses that, in turn, can lead to life-saving interventions. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment. Imaging largely focuses on the detection and exclusion of traumatic aortic injury; a large proportion of patients are victims of motor vehicle accidents. For those patients who survive the injury and come to emergency radiology, rapid, appropriate assessment of patients who require surgery is paramount.

### Factors influencing survival after flail chest injuries… [^114cJyoR]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

M ANY PAPERS devoted to treatment of flail chest leave the impression that this injury can be successfully managed in most cases by simple measures to fix the unstable segment of chest wall. On the other hand, a few authors1–5 have offered suggestions for management based on the physiological derangements which have been created by this grave injury. These offer a rational basis for treatment. A review of our own recent experience in the treatment of 74 patients with flail chest has shown that only a few patients with small unstable segments of lateral or posterior chest wall can be treated successfully by simple techniques such as inter-costal nerve blocks6 to relieve pain and facilitate effective cough. However, the great majority of patients with flail chest injuries require early, vigorous and often prolonged treatment by tracheotomy and controlled intermittent positive pressure ventilation. 5 This is the absolute minimum.

Chest trauma is a common consequence of traumatic events. It may be blunt or penetrating. A low number of patients with blunt chest trauma require surgical intervention; in contrast, penetrating ones frequently require surgery and are associated with higher mortality. Chest trauma due to its anatomical location and to its potential effects on different systems must be multidisciplinary, and emergency and trauma systems should be organized and prepared to face all aspects. The present paper describes the recommendations provided by World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), about comprehensive management of thoracic trauma.

### Pulmonary contusion: an update on recent advances in clinical management [^1176V7mE]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Pulmonary contusion is a common finding after blunt chest trauma. The physiologic consequences of alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary parenchymal destruction typically manifest themselves within hours of injury and usually resolve within approximately 7 days. Clinical symptoms, including respiratory distress with hypoxemia and hypercarbia, peak at about 72 h after injury. The timely diagnosis of pulmonary contusion requires a high degree of clinical suspicion when a patient presents with trauma caused by an appropriate mechanism of injury. The clinical diagnosis of acute parenchymal lung injury is usually confirmed by thoracic computed tomography, which is both highly sensitive in identifying pulmonary contusion and highly predictive of the need for subsequent mechanical ventilation. Management of pulmonary contusion is primarily supportive. Associated complications such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and long-term pulmonary disability, however, are frequent sequelae of these injuries.

### Analysis of risk factors in thoracic trauma patients with a comparison of a modern trauma centre: a mono-centre study [^111fNWnK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Thoracic trauma (TT) is the third most common cause of death after abdominal injury and head trauma in polytrauma patients. Its management is still a very challenging task. The purpose of this study was to analyse the risk factors affecting the outcome in a high-volume trauma centre and the efficacy of a specialised trauma team in level 1 trauma centres.

Patients and Methods

Between January 2003 and December 2012, data of all patients admitted to the accident and emergency (A&E) department were prospectively collected at the German Trauma Registry (GTR) and thereafter retrospectively analysed. Patients with chest trauma, an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 18 and an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) > 2 in more than one body region were included. Patients were divided into two groups: group I included patients presenting with thoracic trauma between January 2003 and December 2007. The results of this group were compared with the results of another group (group II) in a later 5-year period (Jan. 2008-Dec. 2012). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed, and differences with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

There were 630 patients (56%) with thoracic trauma. A total of 540 patients (48%) had associated extrathoracic injuries. Group I consisted of 285 patients (197 male, mean age 46years). Group II consisted of 345 patients (251 male, mean age 49years). Overall 90-day mortality was 17% (n = 48) in group I vs. 9% (n = 31) in group II (p = 0.024). Complication rates were higher in group I (p = 0.019). Higher Injury Severity Scores (ISSs) and higher Abbreviated Injury Acale (AIS) scores in the thoracic region yielded a higher rate of mortality (p < 0.0001). Young patients (< 40years) were frequently exposed to severe thoracic injury but showed lower mortality rates (p = 0.014). Patients with severe lung contusions (n = 94) (15%) had higher morbidity and mortality (p < 0.001). Twenty-three (8%) patients underwent emergency thoracotomy in group I vs. 14 patients (4%) in group II (p = 0.041). Organ replacement procedures were needed in 18% of patients in group I vs. 31% of patients in group II (p = 0.038).

Conclusions

The presence of severe lung contusion, a higher ISS and AIS thoracic score and advanced age are independent risk factors that are directly related to a higher mortality rate. Management of blunt chest trauma with corrective chest tube insertion, optimal pain control and chest physiotherapy results in good outcomes in the majority of patients. Optimal management with better survival rates is achievable in specialised centres with multidisciplinary teamwork and the presence of thoracic surgical experience.

### Association between adherence to evidence-based practices for treatment of patients with traumatic rib… [^1172gaTR]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

The mean number of rib fractures was 4.
2. On univariate analysis, patients treated at verified level I trauma centers were more likely to receive 5 or 6 EBPs. Pneumatic stabilization and chest tube placement were associated with increased mortality in older patients with 3 or more rib fractures. On multivariable analysis, insurance status, race/ethnicity, injury severity, hospital bed size, and trauma center verification level were associated with receiving EBPs for rib fractures. Chest trauma is involved in nearly one-third of trauma admissions worldwide, accounting for 25% of trauma-related deaths, with rib fractures sustained by nearly 15% of patients who experience trauma and in approximately two-thirds of chest trauma. 1, 2 Rib fractures are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

3, 4 Of patients aged 60 years or older who die from chest trauma, 55% have no injury worse than rib fractures.
5. To evaluate the association of EBP adherence with in-hospital mortality, we considered all patients who met a given EBP criterion and compared the mortality outcome between patients who received the EBP with those who did not receive the care recommended by the EBP. Noninvasive ventilation was associated with increased mortality in patients aged 65 years or older with 3 or more rib fractures. Chest tube placement was also associated with increased mortality for patients with hemothorax/pneumothorax. For all 3 EBPs associated with improved survival, underinsured patients were less likely to receive EBP. For all EBPs, the number of rib fractures or presence of hemothorax and/or pneumothorax was associated with increased odds of receiving EBP.

In addition, for the 3 EBPs associated with improved survival, patients treated at non–ACS-verified level I trauma centers were less likely to receive EBPs.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests in cardiac injury after blunt chest trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11476pei]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blunt chest injuries (BCI) account for 15% of admissions to emergency departments worldwide and they are associated with significant morbidity and mortality (1–3). They may occur following road collision accidents, falls from heights, physical assaults or athletic injuries. The injury sustained to the heart is thought to be due to decelerating forces on the anterior aspect of the chest wall, which challenges the viscoelastic properties of the heart. After the impact, the heart can move freely within the thoracic cavity on the anterior–posterior axis and may then either be solely compressed against the posterior aspect of the sternum or — after a more energetic impact — be "squashed" between the sternum and the anterior aspect of the thoracic spine.

As blunt chest injuries encompass an entire spectrum of different mechanisms and intensities, it is evident that the clinical presentation of these patients varies greatly. Presentations range from a silent clinical picture to differing degrees of physiological instability, but may in certain cases be "catastrophic" if important structures have been injured — such as the pericardium, the valves, the papillary muscle, chordae tendinae, the ventricular septum, or coronary artery.

### Nationwide cohort study of independent risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome after trauma [^1132rFJs]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, for people under 45, trauma is the leading cause of death and disability. In patients who develop multiple organ failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most frequent manifestation. Despite improvements in respiratory intensive care during the past several decades, ARDS is still associated with substantial mortality (25%–60% ARDS alone and 50%–80% when associated with multiple organ failure), morbidity, and costs.

Far fewer investigations have studied the risk factors and prognosis in patients with trauma-induced ARDS, as compared with medical or sepsis-affiliated ARDS. The vast majority of investigations that have studied trauma-induced ARDS were either single-institution studies and/or used pre-2007 data sources, prior to widespread adoption of ARDSNet (short for the multicenter ARDS Network) and fluid resuscitation best practices. Moreover, less is known regarding the risk factors for the development of ARDS in non-severely (Injury Severity Score [ISS] ≤ 15) injured trauma patients as these patients have frequently been excluded from previous studies. Furthermore, existing studies of predictors of trauma-induced ARDS have reported conflicting findings. One example is older age, which is a consistent risk factor for the development of ARDS; however, after accounting for injury severity and comorbidities, its independent association has been inconsistent. Additionally, reports of the relationship between trauma-induced ARDS and mortality have been inconsistent. Patients with ARDS have a higher raw mortality rate, but typically are also more severely injured and have additional comorbidities. Two retrospective single-institution studies called into question the effect of ARDS on trauma mortality, highlighting a key unknown in our field. The question of high mortality in patients with ARDS and its relation to the trauma itself or to extrathoracic factors (such as overall injury severity or patient comorbidities) remains unanswered.

Given the significant impact of ARDS on clinical outcomes and costs, recent calls have been made for large observational studies to assess the potential predictors for ARDS. A more complete understanding could facilitate early identification and prompt treatment to improve survival. In this study, we sought to evaluate predictors of trauma-induced ARDS and mortality in patients with ARDS, using a large national database of US trauma patients from 2009 through 2014. We hypothesized that trauma-induced ARDS occurs along the entire burden of injury severity, and direct thoracic risk factors (vs. extrathoracic risk factors) are most strongly associated with developing trauma-induced ARDS.

The following constitutes key background information on blunt cardiac injury:

- **Definition**: BCI refers to an injury sustained due to blunt trauma to the heart, the spectrum of which ranges from a minor bruise to specific post-contusion cardiac conditions such as free-wall rupture.
- **Pathophysiology**: BCI is mostly caused by motor vehicle accidents, falls from heights, direct blow to the chest wall by airbag deployment, crushing incidents, contact sports injuries, acts of violence, or blast trauma.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include arrhythmias, myocardial contusion, wall motion abnormalities, myocardial wall rupture, and valve damage. The spectrum of injuries includes commotio cordis, cardiac rupture, coronary artery dissection, indirect cardiac injury, cardiac herniation, pericardial effusion and tamponade, traumatic cardiac arrest, and blunt aortic injury.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: BCI is associated with an overall mortality rate of 13.9%.

Thoracic trauma classification

Thoracic trauma are classified as follow (Table 1).

Table 1
Thoracic trauma classification (Respiratory impairment: reduced lung function without distress; Respiratory distress: an acute diffuse lung injury that occurs within a short period of time and can cause severe hypoxemia leading to hypoxic damage to various organs throughout the body

Respiratory function evaluation

To evaluate the severity of respiratory impairment and respiratory distress, the Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be used, but we suggest the application of the more recently published Global definition of ARDS, (Table 2), which is more applicable in different settings, including lower resource ones.

Table 2
ARDS definition

In fact, the impairment in oxygenation may be evaluated by the SpO2/FiO2 ratio (or, with the classical PaO2/FiO2 ratio). In contrast, lung infiltrates may be assessed using ultrasound (or the classical chest x-ray). In this regard, the value of the Lung Ultrasound Score in quantifying the extension of pulmonary contusions in blunt chest trauma has been recently evaluated. Moreover, the definition does not mandate using positive pressure ventilation to diagnose and stratify ARDS severity, but it includes the application of oxygen by high flow nasal cannulas.

The risk of delayed development of ARDS may be predicted by the application of the Thoracic Trauma severity score, which includes several factors (Table 3): a value of the score between 13 and 25 predicts a high risk of developing ARDS.

Table 3
Thoracic trauma severity score

Diagnosis

Systematic evaluation of the patient is indicated to promptly identify life-threatening thoracic injuries, including lung parenchymal injuries (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
In unstable penetrating and blunt thoracic trauma patients lesions diagnosis should be pursued with E-FAST and/or chest-x ray (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
In stable penetrating and blunt thoracic trauma patients contrast enhanced CT-scan (with eventual 3D reconstruction) is strongly indicated to define the type and extent of injuries (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
Contrast-enhanced CT-scan and eventual CT-Angiography are indicated for precise vascular mapping, facilitating a tailored approach, and planning appropriate interventions (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
Bronchoscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosing specific tracheal and bronchial injuries, providing direct airway visualization (LoE moderate, GoR strong).
In case of suspected oesophageal perforation, contrast CT-scan or esophagoscopy is recommended (LoE moderate, GoR strong)

### Has the documentation of chest injuries and the development of systemic complications in patients with long bone fractures changed over time? – A systematic literature review and meta-analysis by the IMPACT expert group [^1168Eomv]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blunt chest trauma represents a major risk factor for complications in polytrauma patients. Various scoring systems have emerged, but their impact is not fully appreciated. This review evaluates changes in chest trauma scoring over time and potential shifts in complication rates linked to modified surgical approaches in long bone fractures.

Methods

A systematic review was performed utilizing Medline and EMBASE. Included studies analyzed the clinical course following blunt chest trauma with orthopedic injuries requiring surgical fixation. Quantification of chest injury severity was assessed based on the utilized scores in the respective publication such as the Abbreviated Injury Scale, Injury Severity Score, Thoracic Trauma Score (TTS) or the Chest Trauma Score (CTS). The studies were categorized into two groups: "ante-millenium" (AM) (< 31.12.2000) and "post-millenium" (PM) (> 01.01.2000). Endpoint analysis focused on chest-injury-related complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, multiple organ failure (MOF), and pulmonary embolism. A meta-analysis examined the influence of surgical timing (early vs. late) on clinical outcomes.

Results

Of 9,682 studies on chest trauma, 20 (4,079 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Most studies in both AM and PM reported the thoracic AIS scale for severity assessment. In group PM more clinical parameters were included in the decision making. Incidences of pooled and weighted mortality were higher in AM (5.1%) compared to PM (2.3%, p = 0.003), and ARDS incidence was also greater in AM (12.1%) versus PM (8.9%, p = 0.045), though these findings were not confirmed through indirect meta-analysis. Early fracture fixation (< 24 h) displayed a non-significant trend toward lower ARDS (OR: 0.60; 95% CI, 0.23–1.52) and mortality (OR: 0.66; 95% CI, 0.28–1.55), but significantly reduced pneumonia risk (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.40–0.71).

Conclusion

Prior to 2000, chest injuries were quantified using the AIS alone, while afterwards multiple scoring systems that incorporated pathophysiologic response were utilized. Possibly related to changes in timing of surgery, fixation techniques, or general improvements in-patient care seems to have improved in patients with concomitant thoracic trauma regarding mortality and ARDS. Overall, polytrauma patients with concomitant thoracic injuries might benefit from early definitive fracture care if their physiology and overall injury pattern allows it.

### Prospective cohorts and risk adjusted outcomes for trauma [^111wYgAg]. Injury (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this review is to highlight the specifics and applicability of two important methods of clinical research and quality assurance: the prospective cohort study and risk adjusted outcomes. Prospective cohort studies are the gold standard of epidemiological research and are highly applicable to the specific characteristics of the trauma population (i.e. they have a well defined onset and relatively short timeframe to the outcome, with most outcomes being evident during the hospital stay). Risk adjusted outcomes are designed to control for patient factors and injury characteristics allowing researchers to focus on the system-related variables that can improve the quality of care of the injured patient. This paper focuses on the trauma care-related specifics of these methods and is intended to guide junior researchers of the discipline.

### Early risk factors for prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients with severe blunt thoracic trauma: a retrospective cohort study [^117Tec9U]. Injury (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A significant proportion of patients with severe chest trauma require mechanical ventilation (MV). Early prediction of the duration of MV may influence clinical decisions. We aimed to determine early risk factors for prolonged MV among adults suffering from severe blunt thoracic trauma.

Methods

This retrospective, single-center, cohort study included all patients admitted between January 2014 and December 2020 due to severe blunt chest trauma. The primary outcome was prolonged MV, defined as invasive MV lasting more than 14 days. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors for prolonged MV.

Results

The final analysis included 378 patients. The median duration of MV was 9.7 (IQR 3.0–18.0) days. 221 (58.5%) patients required MV for more than 7 days and 143 (37.8%) for more than 14 days. Male gender (aOR 3.01, 95% CI 1.63–5.58, p < 0.001), age (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.21–1.63, p < 0.001, for each category above 30 years), presence of severe head trauma (aOR 3.77, 95% CI 2.23–6.38, p < 0.001), and transfusion of > 5 blood units on admission (aOR 2.85, 95% CI 1.62–5.02, p < 0.001) were independently associated with prolonged MV. The number of fractured ribs and the extent of lung contusions were associated with MV for more than 7 days, but not for 14 days. In the subgroup of 134 patients without concomitant head trauma, age (aOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.18–2.27, p = 0.004, for each category above 30 years), respiratory comorbidities (aOR 9.70, 95% CI 1.49–63.01, p = 0.017), worse p/f ratio during the first 24 h (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.15–2.09, p = 0.004), and transfusion of > 5 blood units on admission (aOR 5.71 95% CI 1.84–17.68, p = 0.003) were independently associated with MV for more than 14 days.

Conclusions

Several predictors have been identified as independently associated with prolonged MV. Patients who meet these criteria are at high risk for prolonged MV and should be considered for interventions that could potentially shorten MV duration and reduce associated complications. Hemodynamically stable, healthy young patients suffering from severe thoracic trauma but no head injury, including those with extensive lung contusions and rib fractures, have a low risk of prolonged MV.

### Wounds of the chest… [^111uZTzi]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Chest injuries are quite properly divided, for clinical purposes, into two large groups: nonpenetrating wounds and penetrating wounds. The distinction is the obvious one that in the latter there is a break, greater or less in extent, in the normally hermetically sealed thoracic cavity, while in the former such a disruption does not occur. The categories are not entirely mutually exclusive, as an injury producing multiple segmental rib fractures, while not a penetrating wound, may nevertheless produce all the disturbances of physiology present in the most severe types of penetrating wounds. With such obvious exceptions, however, the classification of wounds as penetrating and nonpenetrating serves admirably for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Thoracic injury is common in high-energy and low-energy trauma, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Evaluation requires a systematic approach prioritizing airway, respiration, and circulation. Chest injuries have the potential to progress rapidly and require prompt procedural intervention. For the diagnosis of nonemergent injuries, a careful secondary survey is essential. Although medicine and trauma management have evolved throughout the decades, the basics of thoracic trauma care have remained the same.

Conclusion

The incidence of BCI following blunt thoracic trauma remains variable and no gold standard exists to either diagnose cardiac injury or provide management.

Diagnostic tests should be limited to identifying those patients who are at risk of developing cardiac complications as a result of cardiac in jury. Therapeutic interventions should be directed to treat the complications of cardiac injury. Prompt, appropriate and well-orchestrated surgical treatment is invaluable in the management of the unstable patient.

### Nationwide cohort study of independent risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome after trauma [^115xnM7S]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

ARDS is a complex disease process occurring across the entire spectrum of injury burden. Despite the decreasing incidence of ARDS, mortality in patients with ARDS has increased. In our study, direct thoracic injury was the strongest predictor of trauma-induced ARDS. Distinct demographic, comorbid, extrathoracic, and thoracic predictors were identified for trauma-induced ARDS and mortality in patients with ARDS. The recognition of specific thoracic risk factors in trauma-induced ARDS has the potential to identify at-risk patients early in their hospitalization and mitigate the progression to ARDS and thereby mortality. Future research should be directed at implementing therapeutic strategies to mitigate the development of ARDS among subsets of trauma patients with identifiable risk factors.

### ACR appropriateness criteria blunt chest trauma [^115d4z52]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Imaging is paramount in the setting of blunt trauma and is now the standard of care at any trauma center. Although anteroposterior radiography has inherent limitations, the ability to acquire a radiograph in the trauma bay with little interruption in clinical survey, monitoring, and treatment, as well as radiography's accepted role in screening for traumatic aortic injury, supports the routine use of chest radiography. Chest CT or CT angiography is the gold-standard routine imaging modality for detecting thoracic injuries caused by blunt trauma. There is disagreement on whether routine chest CT is necessary in all patients with histories of blunt trauma. Ultimately, the frequency and timing of CT chest imaging should be site specific and should depend on the local resources of the trauma center as well as patient status. Ultrasound may be beneficial in the detection of pneumothorax, hemothorax, and pericardial hemorrhage; transesophageal echocardiography is a first-line imaging tool in the setting of suspected cardiac injury. In the blunt trauma setting, MRI and nuclear medicine likely play no role in the acute setting, although these modalities may be helpful as problem-solving tools after initial assessment. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Traumatic rib fractures: a marker of severe injury. A nationwide study using the national trauma data bank [^116i1ZLc]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Thoracic trauma is a frequently encountered injury, comprising 10%–15% of all trauma-related hospital admissions. Currently, it is responsible for approximately 35% of all trauma-related deaths in the USA, making it one of the leading causes of death among the trauma population after cardiovascular injury and traumatic brain injury.

Traumatic rib fractures represent the most common injury sustained following thoracic trauma and are often caused by a high impact force to the chest wall. Rib fractures are clinically relevant injuries as they are associated with significant pulmonary morbidity, mortality and decreased long-term quality of life. Prompt evaluation with pre-emptive pain control, pulmonary hygiene and timely respiratory support is essential in the management of rib fractures.

Fractured ribs can occur as simple isolated injury or as part of more extensive thoracic and extrathoracic injuries. Previous studies implied that rib fractures should be considered as a marker of severe injury, as > 90% of patients have severe concomitant injuries mostly involving head, abdomen and extremities.

The clinical significance of the number of fractured ribs has been debated in the literature. Several studies have suggested that there is a direct correlation between an increased number of rib fractures and pulmonary morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, other studies have reported that age, associated injuries and polytrauma might be better predictors for morbidity and mortality.

A systematic review and meta-analyses reported an age of 65 years or more, three or more rib fractures and the presence of pre-existing disease, especially cardiopulmonary disease, to be risk factors for mortality following blunt chest wall trauma. In addition, the development of pneumonia postinjury was a significant risk factor for mortality. However, the results of the review were limited by the small number and variable quality of studies included. Different subgroups of patients with traumatic rib fractures are at risk of developing complications, however, currently no guidelines exist to assist in the recognition of these high-risk patient populations.

The primary aim of this nationwide database study was to determine the epidemiology, injury characteristics and in-hospital outcomes of patients with traumatic rib fractures. Secondarily, all data were presented for patients with polytrauma, elderly, isolated thoracic trauma, flail chest and type of injury to describe the differences among these subgroups. Finally, we sought to determine factors associated with mortality.
