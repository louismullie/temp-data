## Question

Can kerendia be given to a 88 year old female patient who has had a creatinine of 2.20 and GFR 25 for th epast 7 years

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether finerenone (Kerendia) can be given to an 88-year-old woman with a creatinine of 2.20 mg/dL and an eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m² that has been stable for 7 years. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled eGFR threshold for initiation. Then, I should verify the potassium requirement and monitoring cadence. Next, I will consider age-related risk for hyperkalemia and whether any trials included patients this old. After that, I need to check for any dose-adjustment nuances in severe CKD and whether a lower starting dose is acceptable. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation with concrete monitoring and contingency plans, anchoring to FDA labeling and KDIGO guidance [^57c18955] [^05a98013].

> Let me first confirm the hard threshold. The FDA label states that finerenone should not be initiated if eGFR is less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m², which means an eGFR of exactly 25 is at the lower bound and initiation is not recommended below that cutoff, so I should not jump to conclusions about starting therapy at eGFR 25 without careful justification and documentation of stability and risk–benefit [^57c18955] [^eb9370a0].

> Wait, let me verify the potassium requirement before I go further. The label instructs to measure serum potassium and eGFR before initiation and not to start if potassium is greater than 5.0 mEq/L, with reassessment of potassium about 4 weeks after initiation and after any dose change, which is especially critical in advanced CKD where hyperkalemia risk rises as eGFR falls [^291199d3] [^eb9370a0].

> I need to check whether an eGFR of 25 has been studied. The pivotal trials FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD enrolled patients with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m², and the heart failure trial FINEARTS-HF also excluded those with eGFR < 25, so an eGFR of 25 is the labeled floor and there is no randomized evidence below that threshold, which reinforces caution rather than a blanket prohibition [^b5ea587b] [^881f7616].

> Hold on, let's not conflate "do not initiate" with "contraindicated". The FDA language is "do not initiate" when eGFR < 25, not an absolute contraindication, so in select cases with stable eGFR 25 and compelling indications, a cautious, off-label initiation with close monitoring may be reasonable after addressing hyperkalemia risk and concomitant medications, but I should confirm that this is a shared decision and document the rationale [^57c18955] [^eb9370a0].

> Next, I should review dose selection if, after counseling, we proceed at eGFR 25. For eGFR 25–60, the labeled starting dose is 10 mg once daily, with consideration of uptitration based on potassium and renal function; given the patient is at the threshold, I would start at 10 mg and not escalate unless potassium remains ≤ 4.8 mEq/L and eGFR is stable, aligning with KDIGO's potassium-based algorithm and the FDA's titration guidance [^291199d3] [^05a98013].

> I will now examine hyperkalemia risk modifiers in this 88-year-old. Advanced age, reduced muscle mass, and eGFR 25 all increase hyperkalemia risk; baseline potassium > 4.8 mEq/L further elevates risk, and the label warns that risk rises as kidney function declines, so I should double-check baseline potassium, review and adjust other potassium-raising drugs, and plan more frequent monitoring than usual if we proceed [^eb9370a0] [^0ce49502].

> Let me consider the clinical context and potential benefit. If she has type 2 diabetes with albuminuria, finerenone has proven kidney and cardiovascular benefits on top of ACEi/ARB in FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD; if she has heart failure with LVEF ≥ 40%, FINEARTS-HF showed reduced HF events, so the indication and expected benefit should be explicitly documented to justify off-label use at the eGFR threshold [^313d4e43] [^07be4577] [^881f7616].

> But wait, what if potassium is borderline or concomitant therapies raise risk. I should confirm that potassium binders or dietary strategies are in place if needed, and I should coordinate with nephrology given the advanced CKD; KDIGO supports structured potassium monitoring and suggests that continuation may be reasonable even with potassium 5.0–5.5 if carefully managed, though initiation should generally be avoided above 5.0 [^05a98013] [^57571c1c].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is conditional: if baseline potassium is ≤ 5.0 mEq/L, if the eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m² is stable and chronic, and if there is a clear indication such as diabetic CKD with albuminuria or HFpEF, then finerenone 10 mg once daily may be initiated with explicit off-label rationale, with a plan to recheck potassium and eGFR in about 4 weeks, avoid uptitration unless potassium is ≤ 4.8 mEq/L and eGFR is stable, and monitor potassium every 3–4 months thereafter, holding therapy if potassium exceeds 5.5 mEq/L and reassessing the regimen [^291199d3] [^05a98013] [^eb9370a0].

> If baseline potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L or if the eGFR is actively declining, I should not initiate finerenone and instead address modifiable contributors to hyperkalemia and reassess renal function before reconsidering; I need to ensure this decision is documented with shared decision-making given the lack of evidence below eGFR 25 and the elevated safety risk in this 88-year-old [^57c18955] [^eb9370a0].

Kerendia (finerenone) **should not be started** in an 88-year-old woman with a creatinine of 2.20 mg/dL and eGFR of 25 mL/min/1.73 m², as the FDA label advises **do not initiate if eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m²** [^57c18955] [^eb9370a0]. If eGFR were ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium were ≤ 5.0 mEq/L, a 10 mg daily dose with close monitoring would be considered; however, at eGFR 25, initiation is not recommended. If already on finerenone and eGFR declines to 25, **continue 10 mg daily with enhanced potassium and renal monitoring** [^291199d3] [^05a98013].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in renal impairment

Finerenone is metabolized hepatically with minimal renal elimination; however, **exposure increases as eGFR declines**, raising hyperkalemia risk [^57096926]. In severe impairment (eGFR < 25), drug accumulation and hyperkalemia risk are greatest, so initiation is not advised [^eb9370a0].

---

## Clinical trial evidence and regulatory guidance

- **FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD**: enrolled patients with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m²; those with eGFR < 25 were excluded, so safety and efficacy below this threshold are not established [^b5ea587b] [^313d4e43].
- **FDA labeling**: explicitly states do not initiate if eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m² [^57c18955] [^eb9370a0].
- **KDIGO 2024**: recommends finerenone for CKD with T2D when eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m² and potassium is ≤ 5.0 mmol/L, with structured potassium monitoring [^05a98013] [^57571c1c].

---

## Risks and benefits in elderly patients with advanced CKD

Benefits: finerenone reduces CKD progression and cardiovascular events in T2D with CKD, but **evidence is lacking for eGFR < 25** [^313d4e43] [^07be4577]. Risks: hyperkalemia and worsening renal function are more likely at low eGFR; in FINEARTS-HF, renal adverse events were more frequent with finerenone, though most were mild to moderate [^57d7d6cb] [^eb9370a0].

---

## Clinical recommendations and monitoring strategies

- **Initiation**: do not start finerenone if eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m² [^57c18955] [^eb9370a0].
- **If already on finerenone and eGFR declines to 25**: continue 10 mg daily with close monitoring of potassium and renal function [^291199d3] [^05a98013].
- **Potassium monitoring**: check at baseline, 4 weeks, and periodically; hold if potassium > 5.5 mEq/L and resume at 10 mg when ≤ 5.0 mEq/L [^291199d3] [^05a98013].
- **Renal function monitoring**: check eGFR periodically; if eGFR declines > 30% or worsens clinically, consider dose adjustment or interruption [^291199d3] [^eb9370a0].

---

## Alternative therapeutic options

- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: consider if eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² for cardiorenal benefit [^61e3dc27] [^bd8ed048].
- **Patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate**: potassium binders can enable RAAS blockade or finerenone use by controlling hyperkalemia [^95986444] [^29d8901e].
- **Nephrology referral**: appropriate for advanced CKD management and to explore options like dialysis or transplant when indicated [^bd8ed048].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Kerendia **should not be initiated** in this 88-year-old with eGFR 25 mL/min/1.73 m² because the FDA advises against starting therapy when eGFR is below 25. If already on finerenone and eGFR falls to 25, continue 10 mg daily with intensified potassium and renal monitoring. Consider SGLT2 inhibitors and potassium binders, and involve nephrology to optimize care.

14.2 Heart Failure (LVEF ≥ 40%)

FINEARTS-HF (NCT: 04435626) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study in adult patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II–IV) with documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%. Patients were required to have an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73m2and serum potassium ≤ 5.0 mEq/L at screening and randomization and were receiving background heart failure medical treatment, including diuretics. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular (CV) death and total (first and recurrent) heart failure events comprised of hospitalization for heart failure and urgent heart failure visits.

In FINEARTS-HF, 6001 patients were analyzed; 3003 were randomized to Kerendia and 2998 were randomized to placebo and were followed for a median of 2.7 years. The study included 3247 (54%) patients with a heart failure event in the past 3 months, including 1219 (20%) patients randomized during the hospitalization or within 7 days from the heart failure event. Patients with eGFR ≥ 25 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m2initiated Kerendia 10 mg and patients with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2initiated Kerendia 20 mg, and both groups were titrated up to a target dose of Kerendia 20 mg and 40 mg, respectively. At month 6, approximately 65% of the patients reached their target dose. The trial population was 79% White, 17% Asian, and 1.5% Black. The mean age at enrollment was 72 years and 46% of patients were female. At baseline, the mean LVEF was 53%, with 64% of patients having an LVEF ≥ 50%, and 69% and 30% of patients were NYHA class II and III, respectively. Mean blood pressure was 129/75 mmHg and mean body mass index (BMI) was 30 kg/m2. The median NT-proBNP was 1041 pg/mL, the mean eGFR was 62 mL/min/1.73m2with 48% of patients having an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2. Atrial fibrillation was present on screening/baseline ECG for 38% of patients and 41% had diabetes mellitus. The majority of patients were on loop diuretics (87%), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (79%), or an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) (9%), and 14% were on sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.

### Finerenone (Kerendia) [^a681ad41]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of finerenone PO (also known as Kerendia, Kerendia):
- **Increased serum finerenone levels**: use caution in patients taking moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitors.
- **Increased serum potassium**: use caution in patients with greater renal impairment, higher baseline potassium levels, receiving concomitant therapy with drugs or supplements increasing serum potassium, or other risk factors for hyperkalemia. Measure serum potassium and eGFR before initiating treatment and adjust the dose accordingly. Do not initiate finerenone if serum potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L. Assess serum potassium levels 4 weeks after initiating treatment and after any dose adjustments, then periodically throughout the treatment. Increase the dose to 20 mg if serum potassium is ≤ 4.8 mEq/L in patients taking 10 mg daily. Maintain the dose of 10 mg if serum potassium is between 4.8–5.5 mEq/L or if eGFR decreases by > 30%. Withhold finerenone if serum potassium is > 5.5 mEq/L and resume at 10 mg when it decreases to ≤ 5 mEq/L. Maintain 20 mg if serum potassium is ≤ 5.5 mEq/L in patients taking 20 mg daily. Withhold finerenone if serum potassium is > 5.5 mEq/L and resume at 10 mg when it decreases to ≤ 5 mEq/L.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In the event of suspected overdose, immediately interrupt Kerendia treatment. The most likely manifestation of overdose is hyperkalemia. If hyperkalemia develops, standard treatment should be initiated.

Finerenone is unlikely to be efficiently removed by hemodialysis given its fraction bound to plasma proteins of about 90%.

The primary objective of the FIDELIO-DKD study was to determine whether Kerendia reduced the incidence of a sustained decline in eGFR of ≥ 40%, kidney failure (defined as chronic dialysis, kidney transplantation, or a sustained decrease in eGFR to < 15 mL/min/1.73 m2), or renal death. The secondary outcome was a composite of time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure. The primary objective of the FIGARO-DKD study was to determine whether Kerendia reduced the time to first occurrence of CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for heart failure. The secondary outcome was a composite of time to kidney failure, a sustained decline in eGFR of 40% or more compared to baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death.

In FIDELIO-DKD, a total of 5674 patients were randomized to receive Kerendia (N = 2833) or placebo (N = 2841) and were followed for a median of 2.6 years. The mean age of the study population was 66 years, and 70% of patients were male. This global trial population was 63% White, 25% Asian, and 5% Black. At baseline, the mean eGFR was 44 mL/min/1.73m2, with 55% of patients having an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73m2. Median urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) was 852 mg/g, mean glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 7.7%, and the mean blood pressure was 138/76 mmHg. Approximately 46% of patients had a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and 8% had a history of heart failure. At baseline, 99.8% of patients were treated with an ACEi or ARB. Approximately 97% were on an antidiabetic agent (insulin [64.1%], biguanides [44%], glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists [7%], sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 [SGLT2] inhibitors [5%]), 74% were on a statin, and 57% were on an antiplatelet agent.

Heart Failure with LVEF ≥ 40%

The safety of Kerendia in patients with heart failure (LVEF ≥ 40%) was evaluated in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter pivotal phase 3 study, FINEARTS-HF, in which a total of 2,993 patients were treated with 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg once daily of Kerendia with a mean duration of treatment of 2.3 years.

The overall safety profile of Kerendia in the FINEARTS-HF study was largely consistent with the adverse reactions reported in patients with CKD and T2DM (Table 4). However, adverse reactions related to worsening renal function were reported more frequently in the Kerendia group (18%) compared with placebo (12%) in FINEARTS-HF. The most frequently reported adverse reactions included renal impairment (7% vs. 4%), eGFR decreased (5% vs. 4%), acute kidney injury (4% vs. 2%) and renal failure (3% vs. 2%). The majority of events were reported to be mild to moderate. These events led to dose modifications in 9% of patients receiving Kerendia versus 4% of patients receiving placebo. Hospitalization due to events related to worsening of renal function for the Kerendia group was 2.0% versus 1.3% in the placebo group.

Laboratory Test

Initiation of Kerendia may cause an initial small increase in blood creatinine levels (mean change < 0.1 mg/dL) and a small decrease in eGFR (mean change 2–3 ml/min) that occurs within the first 4 weeks of starting therapy and then stabilizes. These changes were reversible after treatment discontinuation. Initiation of Kerendia may also cause a small increase in serum uric acid. This increase appears to attenuate over time.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in postmarketing experience with finerenone. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to estimate their frequency reliably or to establish a causal relationship to drug exposure:

Hypersensitivity: Angioedema, Rash and Urticaria

2.1 Prior to Initiation of Kerendia

Measure serum potassium levels and eGFR before initiation. Do not initiate treatment if serum potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2 Recommended Starting Dosage

The recommended starting dose of Kerendia is based on eGFR and is presented in Table 1.

For patients who are unable to swallow whole tablets, Kerendia may be crushed and mixed with water or soft foods such as applesauce immediately prior to use and administered orally [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

2.3 Monitoring and Dosage Adjustment

CKD associated with T2DM

The target daily dose of Kerendia is 20 mg orally.

Measure serum potassium 4 weeks after initiating treatment and adjust dose (see Table 2); if serum potassium levels are > 4.8 to 5.0 mEq/L, initiation of Kerendia treatment may be considered with additional serum potassium monitoring within the first 4 weeks based on clinical judgment and serum potassium levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Measure serum potassium 4 weeks after a dose adjustment and periodically throughout treatment, and adjust the dose as needed (see Table 2) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Heart Failure with LVEF ≥ 40%

The target daily dose of Kerendia for heart failure (LVEF ≥ 40%) is dependent on renal function (eGFR) at initiation of Kerendia treatment (see Table 3).

The target daily dose is 40 mg orally once daily if eGFR at initiation is ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m.
The target daily dose is 20 mg orally once daily if eGFR at initiation is ≥ 25 to < 60 mL/min/1.73m.

Measure serum potassium and eGFR 4 weeks after initiating treatment and adjust dose (see Table 3). Measure serum potassium and eGFR 4 weeks after a dose adjustment and monitor periodically throughout treatment, and adjust the dose as needed (see Table 3) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 & 5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

2.4 Missed Doses

Direct a patient to take a missed dose as soon as possible after it is noticed, but only on the same day. If this is not possible, the patient should skip the dose and continue with the next dose as prescribed.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Finerenone is a nonsteroidal, selective antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which is activated by aldosterone and cortisol and regulates gene transcription. Finerenone blocks MR mediated sodium reabsorption and MR overactivation in both epithelial (e.g., kidney) and nonepithelial (e.g., heart, and blood vessels) tissues. MR overactivation is thought to contribute to fibrosis and inflammation. Finerenone has a high potency and selectivity for the MR and has no relevant affinity for androgen, progesterone, estrogen, and glucocorticoid receptors.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies in adult patients with chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes, the placebo-corrected relative reduction in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) in patients randomized to finerenone was 31% (95% CI 29–34%), and 32% (95% CI 30–35%) respectively at Month 4 and remained stable for the duration of the trial.

In ARTS DN, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter phase IIb dose finding study in adults with CKD and T2DM, the placebo-corrected relative reduction in UACR at Day 90 was 25% and 38% in patients treated with finerenone 10 mg and 20 mg once daily, respectively. In patients treated with Kerendia, the mean systolic blood pressure decreased by 3 mmHg and the mean diastolic blood pressure decreased by 1–2 mmHg at month 1, remaining stable thereafter.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

At a dose 2 times the maximum approved recommended dose, finerenone does not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Finerenone exposure increased proportionally over a dose range of 1.25 to 80 mg (0.06 to 4 times the maximum approved recommended dosage). Steady state of finerenone was achieved after 2 days of dosing. The estimated steady-state geometric mean Cmax, mdwas 166 µg/L and steady-state geometric mean AUCτ, mdwas 718 µg.h/L following administration of finerenone 20 mg to patients.

Absorption

Finerenone is completely absorbed after oral administration but undergoes metabolism resulting in absolute bioavailability of 44%. Finerenone Cmaxwas achieved between 0.5 and 1.25 hours after dosing.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Hyperkalemia. Patients with decreased kidney function and higher baseline potassium levels are at increased risk. Monitor serum potassium levels and adjust dose as needed. (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 5.1)
Worsening of Renal Function in Patients with Heart Failure. Measure eGFR and adjust dose as needed. (2.1, 2.3, 6.1)

5.1 Hyperkalemia

Kerendia can cause hyperkalemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The risk for developing hyperkalemia increases with decreasing kidney function and is greater in patients with higher baseline potassium levels or other risk factors for hyperkalemia. Measure serum potassium and eGFR in all patients before initiation of treatment with Kerendia and dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Do not initiate Kerendia if serum potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L.

Measure serum potassium periodically during treatment with Kerendia and adjust dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. More frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients at risk for hyperkalemia, including those on concomitant medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

5.2 Worsening of Renal Function in Patients with Heart Failure

Kerendia can cause worsening of renal function in patients with heart failure. Rarely, severe events associated with worsening renal function, including events requiring hospitalization, have been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Measure eGFR in all patients before initiation of treatment or with dose titration of Kerendia and dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3)]. Initiation of Kerendia in patients with heart failure and an eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73m is not recommended.

Measure eGFR periodically during maintenance treatment with Kerendia in patients with heart failure. Consider delaying up-titration or interrupting treatment with Kerendia in patients who develop clinically significant worsening of renal function.

14.1 CKD associated with T2DM

FIDELIO-DKD (NCT: 02540993) and FIGARO-DKD (NCT: 02545049) studies were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In FIDELIO-DKD, patients needed to either have an UACR of 30 to < 300 mg/g, eGFR 25 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2and diabetic retinopathy, or an UACR of ≥ 300 mg/g and an eGFR of 25 to < 75 mL/min/1.73 m2to qualify for enrollment. In FIGARO-DKD, patients needed to have an UACR of 30 mg/g to < 300 mg/g and an eGFR of 25 to 90 mL/min/1.73m2, or an UACR ≥ 300 mg/g and an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73m2.

Both trials excluded patients with known significant non-diabetic kidney disease. All patients were to have a serum potassium ≤ 4.8 mEq/L at screening and be receiving standard of care background therapy, including a maximum tolerated labeled dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). Patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and persistent symptoms (New York Heart Association class II to IV) were excluded. The starting dose of Kerendia was based on screening eGFR (10 mg once daily in patients with an eGFR of 25 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2and 20 mg once daily in patients with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). The dose of Kerendia could be titrated during the study, with a target dose of 20 mg daily.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:

Hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

CKD associated with T2DM

The safety of Kerendia in patients with CKD associated with T2DM was evaluated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter pivotal phase 3 studies, FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD, in which a total of 6510 patients were treated with 10 or 20 mg once daily over a mean duration of 2.2 and 2.9 years, respectively.

Overall, serious adverse events occurred in 32% of patients receiving Kerendia and in 34% of patients receiving placebo in the FIDELIO-DKD study; the findings were similar in the FIGARO-DKD study. Permanent discontinuations due to adverse events also occurred in a similar proportion of patients in the two studies (6–7% of patients receiving Kerendia and in 5–6% of patients receiving placebo).

The most frequently reported (≥ 10%) adverse reaction was hyperkalemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Hospitalization due to hyperkalemia for the Kerendia group was 0.9% vs 0.2% in the placebo group across both studies. Hyperkalemia led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in 1.7% receiving Kerendia versus 0.6% of patients receiving placebo across both studies.

Table 4 shows adverse reactions that occurred more commonly on Kerendia than on placebo, and in at least 1% of patients treated with Kerendia.

### Effect of finerenone on albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy: a randomized clinical trial [^806a9602]. JAMA (2015). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, when added to a renin-angiotensin system blocker, further reduce proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease but may be underused because of a high risk of adverse events.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of different oral doses of the nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone, given for 90 days to patients with diabetes and high or very high albuminuria who are receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted at 148 sites in 23 countries. Patients were recruited from June 2013 to February 2014 and the study was completed in August 2014. Of 1501 screened patients, 823 were randomized and 821 received study drug.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral, once-daily finerenone (1.25 mg/d, n = 96; 2.5 mg/d, n = 92; 5 mg/d, n = 100; 7.5 mg/d, n = 97; 10 mg/d, n = 98; 15 mg/d, n = 125; and 25 mg/d, n = 119) or matching placebo (n = 94) for 90 days.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the ratio of the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) at day 90 vs at baseline. Safety end points were changes from baseline in serum potassium and estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Results

The mean age of the participants was 64.2 years; 78% were male. At baseline, 36.7% of patients treated had very high albuminuria (UACR ≥ 300 mg/g) and 40.0% had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or lower. Finerenone demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in UACR. The primary outcome, the placebo-corrected mean ratio of the UACR at day 90 relative to baseline, was reduced in the finerenone 7.5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-mg/d groups (for 7.5 mg/d, 0.79 [90% CI, 0.68–0.91; P = 0.004]; for 10 mg/d, 0.76 [90% CI, 0.65–0.88; P = 0.001]; for 15 mg/d, 0.67 [90% CI, 0.58–0.77; P < .001]; for 20 mg/d, 0.62 [90% CI, 0.54–0.72; P < .001]). The prespecified secondary outcome of hyperkalemia leading to discontinuation was not observed in the placebo and finerenone 10-mg/d groups; incidences in the finerenone 7.5-, 15-, and 20-mg/d groups were 2.1%, 3.2%, and 1.7%, respectively. There were no differences in the incidence of the prespecified secondary outcome of an estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of 30% or more or in incidences of adverse events and serious adverse events between the placebo and finerenone groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with diabetic nephropathy, most receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker, the addition of finerenone compared with placebo resulted in improvement in the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio. Further trials are needed to compare finerenone with other active medications.

### Design and baseline characteristics of the finerenone, in addition to standard of care, on the progression of kidney disease in patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (FIND-CKD) randomized trial [^5b807356]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Sample size determination

A total sample size of 1500 patients (750 per treatment arm) was calculated to have > 90% power to demonstrate the superiority of finerenone to placebo with respect to total eGFR slope from baseline on day 1 to month 32 at a two-sided significance level of 5%. The > 90% power calculation assumes a 0.7 ml/min/1.73 m 2 /year total eGFR slope difference at month 32 of treatment. The assumption and initial parameter estimate of total eGFR slope are based on findings demonstrating that a yearly eGFR slope reduction of 0.5–1.0 ml/min/1.73 m 2 is associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of ≈0.7 for clinical outcomes in moderate–large randomized trials. Screening ≈3160 patients was planned to achieve 1580 patients randomly assigned to the study intervention. This sample size would allow for an ≈5% overall discontinuation rate in the study (≈40 patients in each treatment arm).

Randomization and study treatment

Patients were randomized 1:1 to either finerenone (10 or 20 mg) or placebo (sham 10 or 20 mg) once daily (OD) in a blinded fashion on top of their stable standard-of-care therapy (including stable and maximum tolerated dose of ACEI or ARB therapy; Fig. 2). Randomization was stratified by screening UACR (≤ 1000 mg/g versus > 1000 mg/g) and baseline SGLT2 inhibitor use (yes/no). The starting dose depends on the participant's eGFR level: a lower dose of 10 mg OD if eGFR is ≥ 25– < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or the higher (target) dose of 20 mg OD if eGFR is ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2. Finerenone will be up- or down-titrated based on potassium and eGFR levels.

Study follow-up

Visits were scheduled at screening, baseline (day 1), month 1 and month 3, then every 3 months up to month 12 (Fig. 2). Thereafter, 4-month visits were planned until the end of the study. The minimum planned treatment duration of each patient is 32 months and the maximum is ≈49 months for the first randomized participant. An additional visit is scheduled 4 weeks after study drug discontinuation to assess off-drug effects.

Finerenone dosing and population in FIGARO-DKD — cardiovascular outcomes focus in type 2 diabetes with CKD. The trial assessed finerenone in people with type 2 diabetes and CKD with elevated UACR (≥ 30 to < 300 mg/g) and eGFR 25–90 mL/min/1.73 m2, required potassium ≤ 4.8 mmol/L, and randomized participants to finerenone (n = 3,686) or placebo (n = 3,666). Participants with eGFR 25–60 mL/min/1.73 m2 received 10 mg once daily, while those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 received 20 mg once daily, with dose increase from 10 to 20 mg after 1 month if serum potassium was ≤ 4.8 mmol/L and eGFR was stable. The cohort characteristics included mean age 64.1 years, 31% female, median follow-up 3.4 years, median A1C 7.7%, mean systolic blood pressure 136 mmHg, and mean eGFR 67.8 mL/min/1.73 m2; people with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction and uncontrolled hypertension were excluded.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement: comprehensive type 2 diabetes management algorithm-2023 update [^af45ce74]. Endocrine Practice (2023). High credibility.

Finerenone for chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes — indications and outcomes — has supporting evidence for benefits on CKD progression, HF, ASCVD events, and mortality in persons with microalbuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g), macroalbuminuria, or moderate-to-advanced CKD with an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2. Although finerenone can modestly reduce systolic BP, its effects are independent of pretreatment BP levels, and regulatory approval is for risk reduction for eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, CV death, nonfatal MI, and hospitalization for HF in persons with CKD and T2D. The text also notes a small BP reduction may occur when starting GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i.

### Finerenone in the management of diabetes kidney disease [^26cb557e]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

We have used the UKKA grading system which is defined in the national guideline manual and is consistent with the KDIGO approach to assessing the strength of evidence and the quality of evidence (Table 1).

Table 1
UKKA grading system for strength of evidence and evidence quality (https://www.ukkidney.org/health-professionals/guidelines/guidelines-commentaries)

Based on the significant on-going residual renal and cardiovascular risk in people with T2DM and DKD with persistent albuminuria, and the strong evidence of protection offered by the addition of finerenone (from the FIDELIO-DKD, and FIGARO-DKD studies), our recommendations are:

In people with T2DM and DKD who have persistent albuminuria (ACR > 30 mg/mmol) despite use of maximum tolerated dose of RAASi and SGLT2i, consider addition of finerenone to reduce the risk of adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (Grade 1 A).
Fineronone can be used if eGFR is more than or equal to 25 ml/min/1.73m 2 and the potassium concentration is < 5 mmol/L. (Grade 2A)
Finerenone can be used either as a second line drug in addition to ACEi or ARB (if SGLT2i not tolerated or contraindicated) or as part of third line therapy in addition to ACEi/ARB + SGLT2i. (Grade 2D)
There is currently no evidence to support use of finerenone in people without proteinuria (Grade 2 A).

The study FIGARO-DKD was published by Bertram Pitt and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetic nephropathy and Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the FIGARO-DKD study, the trial question was: what is the role of finerenone in patients with CKD and T2DM? In the FIGARO-DKD study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the FIGARO-DKD study, the population was: 7352 patients (2247 female, 5105 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM and CKD treated with a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor at the maximum dose. The key exclusion criteria were urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300–5,000 and an eGFR of 25 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m², symptomatic chronic HFrEF. In the FIGARO-DKD study, the interventions were: n = 3686 finerenone (oral dose of 10 or 20 mg tablet once daily) n = 3666 placebo (oral dose of matching placebo once daily). In the FIGARO-DKD study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for HF (12.4% vs. 14.2%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.98). In the FIGARO-DKD study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in kidney failure, ≥ 40% sustained decline in the eGFR, or death from renal causes (9.5% vs. 10.8%; HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01) No significant difference in hospitalization for any cause (42.7% vs. 43.8%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.04) No significant difference in death from any cause (9% vs. 10.1%; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.04). In the FIGARO-DKD study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse and serious adverse events. In the FIGARO-DKD study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM and CKD treated with a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor at the maximum dose, finerenone was superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for HF.

### Finerenone in the management of diabetes kidney disease [^29d8901e]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation for management of hyperkalemia (Grade 2B)

Initiate finerenone

If K < 4.8 mmol/L.

10 mg daily if eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2.
20 mg daily if eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m2.
Monitor K at 1 month after starting treatment and every 4 months thereafter.
Restart 10 mg daily if previously held for hyperkalemia and potassium now < 5.0 mmol/L.

Monitoring finerenone

If K 4.9–5.5 mmol/l.

Continue finerenone 10 or 20 mg daily as per eGFR.
Monitor K every 4 months.

If K > 5.5 mmol/L.

Discontinue finerenone.
Consider adjustment to diet or concomitant medications.
Recheck K in 3 days' time.

Consider reinitiating on 10 mg/day dose when K < 5 mmol/L.

Hyperkalemia should be seen as a predictable and manageable complication of the use of these agents as it is in the use of inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system. Good practice in relation to reducing the risks of hyperkalemia are described in the KDIGO guideline on the management of diabetes in CKD. In particular, we suggest that non dietary causes of hyperkalemia such as constipation, acidosis and poorly controlled diabetes should be addressed. Adjustment to diet should be advised in the least restrictive way and not at the expense of a healthy balanced diet. Diets rich in fruits and vegetables are associated with a reduced risk of CKD and better survival in those with CKD. Furthermore, it is highlighted that NICE have now approved the use of new potassium binders where hyperkalaemia impairs the ability of clinicians to maximise therapy with inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system.

Study design and patient population

The design of the phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter FIDELIO-DKD study and the results of the primary analysis (including the clinical study protocol) have been published previously. The trial was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the competent authorities and ethics committees at each trial site. All participants provided written informed consent. Briefly, adults (≥ 18 years of age) with CKD and T2D who were receiving optimized renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor therapy, with serum potassium ≤ 4.8 mmol/L and without symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction (New York Heart Association Class II–IV) were eligible. The FIDELIO-DKD study comprised a run-in period (during which RAS inhibitor therapy was optimized for 4–16 weeks), a screening period and a double-blind treatment period. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral finerenone or matching placebo once daily. The starting dose of finerenone was 20 mg in participants with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 10 mg in participants with an eGFR of 25– < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, increasing to 20 mg after 1 month if serum potassium remained ≤ 4.8 mmol/L and eGFR was stable. Finerenone downtitration from 20 mg to 10 mg due to safety concerns was permitted at any time.

Endpoints

The primary endpoint of interest for this FIDELIO-DKD 'CREDENCE-like' subgroup analysis was a composite cardiorenal endpoint of time to first occurrence of CV death, kidney failure [defined as ESKD (the initiation of long-term dialysis for ≥ 90 days or kidney transplantation) or an eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 sustained for ≥ 4 weeks], an eGFR decrease of ≥ 57% sustained for ≥ 4 weeks or renal death. Other endpoints included a kidney-specific composite endpoint of time to onset of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥ 57% or renal death, a composite CV endpoint of CV death or hospitalization for HF, CV death, death from any cause and a change in UACR from baseline over time. Urinalysis was performed centrally during the run-in and screening visits as well as at baseline, month 4, month 12 and every 12 months thereafter. Central laboratory values, including serum potassium and serum creatinine, were obtained at all study visits.

5 CONCLUSION

Finerenone shows kidney and cardiovascular benefits across the spectrum of patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, and it is well tolerated. Finerenone was associated with a low absolute risk of clinically relevant hyperkalemia, with only a small proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to hyperkalemia, and no deaths attributed to hyperkalemia. A validated protocol for potassium monitoring and hyperkalemia management should be applied to enhance safety and to enable successful management of CKD with finerenone.

Efficacy and safety assessments

Demographic characteristics and medical history were recorded at screening. FIND-CKD utilizes a 3-month visit schedule during the first year, followed by a 4-month visit schedule thereafter, with the aim of comprehensively characterizing the initial eGFR slope with finerenone and to adequately determine the point of change from acute to chronic eGFR slope. The primary efficacy variable, eGFR, is assessed at all study visits, including the follow-up visit. eGFR is assessed by a central laboratory. The formula used for calculating eGFR (in ml/min/1.73 m 2) is the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation based on creatinine, and including age, sex and race. In addition, prespecified sensitivity analyses for eGFR will be performed using the 2021 equations. Cystatin C measurements are collected at all time points of creatinine measurements in a central laboratory for this purpose.

UACR is measured at screening; day 1; months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24; the end of the planned treatment period and the follow-up visit to assess effects after cessation of treatment. UACR is evaluated using first morning void urine samples collected at the patient's home on three consecutive days before the screening visit, on three consecutive days before the day 1 visit and on two consecutive days before the other scheduled visits. UACR is assessed by a central laboratory. In addition, urinary protein:creatinine ratio is assessed at the same time points. Blood pressure is assessed at all scheduled visits. Health status is assessed using the EuroQol five dimension, five level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), completed on day 1, then every 12 months until the end of the planned treatment period.

Safety is assessed at all scheduled visits and includes assessment of vital signs and adverse events. A 12-lead electrocardiogram is performed on day 1 and at the end of the planned treatment period. Hyperkalaemia is an adverse event of special interest in this study. Serum potassium and hyperkalaemia are characterized through monitoring the change from baseline in serum potassium and identification of the number of patients with serum potassium levels > 5.5 mmol/l and > 6.0 mmol/l.

The novel nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone has been shown to reduce the risk of kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. In this issue of Kidney International, Bakris et al. present new data on the kidney efficacy of finerenone across subgroups of estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, as well as safety data. We attempt to place these results in context by discussing the benefits and risks of finerenone, as well as the generalizability of the study findings to routine care settings.

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in resistant hypertension with chronic kidney disease — Practice Point 3.2.7 states mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) are effective for management of refractory hypertension but may cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in kidney function, particularly among patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Steroidal MRAs such as spironolactone and eplerenone have been found to reduce blood pressure (BP) in resistant hypertension, yet MRAs should not be used in patients with high risk of hyperkalemia. In resistant hypertension with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) (25 to < 45 ml/min per 1.73 m^2), concomitant patiromer compared with placebo allowed a greater proportion of patients taking spironolactone at 12 weeks, and the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone showed kidney protection while BP reduction was modest and hyperkalemia-related events increased.

Randomization and Masking

Patients were randomized based on a computer-generated randomizations schedule stratified by geographical region (North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and other), eGFR (25 to < 45, 45 to < 60, or ≥ 60 mL per min per 1.73 m 2), and albuminuria categories (UACR 30 to < 300 or ≥ 300 mg/g) at screening. All patients and study personnel were masked to treatment allocations (except the independent data monitoring committee). The study drug (finerenone) and placebo tablets were identical in appearance with a uniform administration schedule, with packaging and labeling designed to maintain blinding.

Procedures and Outcomes

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral finerenone or matching placebo (initial dose of study drug was either 10 or 20 mg OD based on an eGFR at the screening visit of 25 to < 60 or ≥ 60 mL per min per 1.73 m 2, respectively). Study drug uptitration from 10 to 20 mg OD was encouraged from month 1 onwards, provided the serum potassium was ≤ 4.8 mEq/L and eGFR was stable; downtitration from 20 to 10 mg OD was allowed any time after treatment initiation. The composite cardiovascular outcome included time to first onset of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. The composite kidney outcome included time to first onset of kidney failure (defined as chronic dialysis for > 90 days, kidney transplantation, or eGFR < 15 mL per min per 1.73 m 2 confirmed after at least 4 weeks), a sustained ≥ 40% decrease in eGFR from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death. A clinical event committee blinded to treatment assignment independently reviewed and adjudicated all reported outcome events. The definitions used for clinical outcome events have been published previously. For this analysis, the focus will be placed on cardiovascular outcomes in the overall population and effects of finerenone in patients with and without a history of CVD, to assess the primary and secondary cardioprotective effects of finerenone, respectively.

4.1 Recommendations for the management of potassium with Finerenone

In accordance with the US labelling prescribing information for finerenone, serum potassium and eGFR should be measured and finerenone should be dosed appropriately in all patients prior to initiation of treatment. Treatment with finerenone should not be initiated if serum potassium is > 5.0 mmol/L. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically, on a schedule similar to study visits in FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD (Month 1, Month 4, and at 4‐month intervals thereafter) to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia. Importantly, such a schedule is actually similar with the usual biological monitoring recommended in CKD patients by the KDIGO 2012 guidelines (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Protocol for potassium management

If serum potassium concentrations are ≤ 4.8 mmol/L, the dose should be continued or increased to 20 mg per day (if the starting dose was 10 mg per day, i.e. for patients with a baseline eGFR 25 to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2). If serum potassium concentrations are > 4.8‐ ≤ 5.5 mmol/L, the dose should be maintained at 10 mg daily or 20 mg daily. Serum potassium should be monitored 4 weeks after a dose adjustment and throughout treatment, and the dose adjusted as needed.

This is actually similar to the recommended procedure for RASi oversight, per KDIGO guidelines on diabetes management in CKD, which state "Monitor serum creatinine and potassium (within 2–4 weeks after starting or changing dose)". Finerenone should be temporarily discontinued if serum potassium concentrations are > 5.5 mmol/L and can be restarted at 10 mg daily when serum potassium concentrations are ≤ 5.0 mmol/L. Finerenone has a short half‐life of 2–3 h and no active metabolites; therefore, hyperkalemia can be treated by discontinuing treatment. For patients with moderate liver disease (Child‐Pugh B), additional potassium monitoring should be considered (Table 4).

Procedures and Outcomes

Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily oral treatment with finerenone (10 or 20 mg) or matching placebo. Patients randomized to the finerenone group received an initial daily dose of 10 mg or 20 mg if they had an eGFR of 25 to < 60 mL per min per 1.73 m 2 or ≥ 60 mL per min per 1.73 m 2, respectively. Up-titration was encouraged after 1 month provided serum potassium was ≤ 4.8 mmol/L and eGFR was stable; down-titration was allowed any time after treatment initiation. The prespecified subgroups included in these analyses were categorized by the presence or absence of a documented medical history of HF at baseline, as reported by the investigators.

The prespecified outcomes for these analyses were (1) time to new-onset HF (first HHF in patients without a history of HF at baseline); (2) a composite of time to cardiovascular death or first HHF; (3) a composite of time to HF-related death or first HHF; (4) time to first HHF; (5) a composite of time to cardiovascular death or total (first or recurrent) HHF; (6) a composite of time to HF-related death or total HHF; and (7) time to total HHF. Outcomes 2 to 7 were investigated in the full study population and by history of HF. A cardiovascular composite outcome including time to cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or HHF was also investigated in these analyses (see details in the). All potential cardiovascular outcomes in the study, as well as all hospitalizations and deaths, were prospectively reviewed and adjudicated by an independent clinical event committee composed of cardiologists blinded to treatment assignment. The criteria used by the clinical event committee to adjudicate HHF events are provided in the. The definition for new-onset HF (first HF in patients without a history of HF) required all criteria for an HHF event to be met, and in addition, the patient was required to have no previous documented history of HF (see details in the).

Effects of Finerenone on DKD: Clinical Studies

Accumulating data support a role for finerenone in the management of DKD (Table 1). In an early randomized, double-blind study conducted at 148 sites in 23 countries, 823 patients with type 2 DM and DN who were on ACE-Is or ARBs were randomly assigned to receive finerenone (1.25, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, or 25 mg/day) or matching placebo (n = 94) for 90 days. Finerenone induced dose-dependent decreases in albuminuria, which were significant at doses of at least 7.5 mg/day. Hyperkalemia leading to discontinuation of treatment was not observed in the placebo and finerenone 10-mg/day groups and occurred in 2.1%, 3.2%, and 1.7% of the finerenone 7.5-, 15-, and 20-mg/day groups, respectively. The incidence of estimated GFR decrease of at least 30% or other adverse events did not differ between the placebo and finerenone groups. In another multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b study in 96 Japanese patients with type 2 DM and DN who were treated with ACE-Is or ARBs, finerenone reduced albuminuria more than placebo at day 90 whereas the change in serum potassium levels was similar in the two groups; notably, no patient developed hyperkalemia. More recently, the results of the Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) trial were reported. This double-blind, multicenter trial was conducted in 48 countries and randomized 5734 patients with type 2 DM and CKD (defined as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) 30–300 mg/g, eGFR 25–60 ml/min/1.73 m 2, and a history of diabetic retinopathy or as UACR 300–5000 mg/g and eGFR 25–75 ml/min/1.73 m 2) treated with ACE-Is or ARBs at the maximum tolerated dose and with serum potassium level of at most 4.8 mmol/l to receive finerenone 20 mg/day (10 mg/day in patients with eGFR 25–60 ml/min/1.73 m 2) or placebo. After a median follow-up of 2.6 years, the incidence of the primary outcome [a composite of kidney failure (defined as initiation of long-term dialysis for at least 90 days, kidney transplantation, or eGFR less than 15 ml/min/1.73 m 2), sustained decrease of at least 40% in the eGFR from baseline over a period of at least 4 weeks, or death from renal causes] was 18% lower in the finerenone group. It was estimated that 29 patients had to be treated with finerenone for 3 years to prevent one primary outcome event. Moreover, finerenone was associated with a 31% greater reduction in UACR than placebo. The incidence of the key secondary outcome (a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure) was also 14% lower in patients treated with finerenone. The reduction in cardiovascular events was similar in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and in those without CVD. Finerenone reduced blood pressure by 2.1/0/9 mmHg more than placebo whereas body weight and HbA 1c did not differ between the two groups. On the other hand, the incidence of hyperkalemia leading to treatment discontinuation was higher in patients treated with finerenone 20 mg/day (10 mg/day in patients with eGFR 25–60 ml/min/1.73 m 2) (2.3% vs. 0.9% in the placebo group) and the incidence of serum potassium levels greater than 5.5 mmol/l was also higher in the former (21.7% vs. 9.8% in the placebo group). To prevent hyperkalemia, patients with serum potassium level of 4.8 mmol/l or below were excluded from the study, patients with eGFR 25–60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 received a lower dose of finerenone (10 mg compared with 20 mg in patients with eGFR 61–75 ml/min/1.73 m 2), and serum potassium levels were frequently monitored. Notably, in a recent meta-analysis, the combination therapy of finerenone plus ACE-Is or ARBs was not associated with hyperkalemia whereas spironolactone and eplerenone increased the risk for hyperkalemia by 4.58 and 2.81 times, respectively, when combined with ACE-Is or ARBs. The ongoing Finerenone in Reducing CV Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) trial will evaluate the effects of finerenone on cardiovascular and renal events in 7437 patients with type 2 DM and less advanced CKD.

Finerenone for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in FIDELIO-DKD — trial population, endpoints, and results. The double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized 5,734 people with CKD and type 2 diabetes to receive finerenone or placebo, enrolling participants with UACR 30 to < 300 mg/g with eGFR 25 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and diabetic retinopathy, or UACR 300–5,000 mg/g with eGFR 25 to < 75 mL/min/1.73 m2, with potassium ≤ 4.8 mmol/L. The primary end point was time to first occurrence of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥ 40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death; key secondary outcomes were cardiovascular. Finerenone reduced the primary end point versus placebo (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.73–0.93]; P = 0.001) and reduced the key secondary cardiovascular composite (HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.75–0.99]; P = 0.03). Hyperkalemia led to 2.3% discontinuation with finerenone versus 0.9% with placebo. Baseline characteristics included mean age 65.6 years, 30% female, mean eGFR 44.3 mL/min/1.73 m2, and median albuminuria 852 mg/g (interquartile range 446–1,634 mg/g).

The study FIDELIO DKD was published by George L Bakris and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2 and Chronic kidney disease. In the FIDELIO DKD study, the trial question was: what is the long-term effect of finerenone on CKD outcomes in T2DM patients? In the FIDELIO DKD study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the FIDELIO DKD study, the population was: 5674 patients (1691 female, 3983 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with CKD and T2DM. The key exclusion criteria were confirmed significant non-diabetic renal disease, uncontrolled arterial hypertension, chronic HFrEF, dialysis for acute renal failure within 12 weeks of run-in visit, renal allograft in place, scheduled kidney transplant within next 12 months, or glycated hemoglobin HbA1c > 12%. In the FIDELIO DKD study, the interventions were: n = 2833 finerenone (10 mg or 20 mg PO once daily) n = 2841 placebo (matching placebo tablet PO once daily). In the FIDELIO DKD study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in kidney failure, sustained decline of at least 40% in the eGFR from baseline, or death from renal causes (17.8% vs. 21.1%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.93). In the FIDELIO DKD study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for HF (13% vs. 14.8%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99) No significant difference in death from any cause (7.7% vs. 8.6%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.07) No significant difference in hospitalization for any cause (44.6% vs. 46.5%; HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.02). In the FIDELIO DKD study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events or AKI. significant differences in serious adverse events (31.9% vs. 34.3%), hyperkalemia-related adverse events (18.3% vs. 9.0%), incidence of hyperkalemia-related discontinuation (2.3% vs. 0.9%). In the FIDELIO DKD study, the conclusion was: in patients with CKD and T2DM, finerenone was superior to placebo with respect to kidney failure, sustained decline of at least 40% in the eGFR from baseline, or death from renal causes.

### A randomized controlled study of finerenone versus placebo in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy [^db1d9624]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

Finerenone (BAY 94–8862) is a novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of seven once-daily oral doses of finerenone (1.25-20mg) and placebo in 96 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) receiving a RAS blocker.

Methods

ARTS-DN Japan was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b study.

Results

Analysis of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) at day 90 relative to baseline indicated a nominally significant effect of finerenone. The UACR at day 90 relative to baseline for each finerenone treatment group was numerically reduced compared with placebo. No serious adverse events (AEs) or deaths were reported and no patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug. Small mean increases in serum potassium level were observed in the finerenone treatment groups (0.025–0.167mmol/L) compared with the placebo group (-0.075mmol/L); no patients developed hyperkalemia.

Conclusion

When given in addition to a RAS inhibitor, finerenone reduced albuminuria without adverse effects on serum potassium levels or renal function in Japanese patients with T2DM and DN.

### Finerenone: a novel mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist for cardiorenal protection in CKD and T2DM [^28904351]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the pharmacology, clinical and safety evidence, and relevance to clinical practice of finerenone.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed, MEDLINE, and clinicaltrials.gov with search terms of "finerenone" and "BAY94-8862".

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All available studies with human participants in English were considered. Studies were included if they investigated drug pharmacology, efficacy, and safety information.

Data Synthesis

In addition to standard of care with a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi), finerenone lowered the risk of kidney disease progression (17.8% vs 21.1%) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease compared to placebo. Similarly, finerenone reduced cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease compared to placebo (12.4% vs 14.2%).

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

It is anticipated that finerenone will be added to therapy after a RASi and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, as tolerated, based on adverse events and potassium levels.

Conclusions

Finerenone offers a unique approach to further delay the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It also provides another option for patients who cannot tolerate RASi or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors.

Patients with significant uncontrolled conditions (such as active malignancies [except for one case of stable postoperative renal cancer], severe heart failure [NYHA class IV], or acute infections) were excluded from the study. Hypertension was not utilised as an exclusion criterion because of its high prevalence in CKD; however, patients with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg despite treatment) were excluded to ensure safety during finerenone therapy. Other comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and dyslipidaemia, were documented but not excluded unless they posed immediate safety risks. This approach enabled the evaluation of the effects of finerenone in a real-world CKD population with typical comorbidities while maintaining safety.

Patients were required to have been receiving stable antihypertensive therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to enrolment, with no changes in drug class or dosage occurring during this time period. Eligible regimens included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, or loop diuretics (used either as a monotherapy or a combination treatment). Patients who required modifications to their regimen during the screening period (e.g. due to uncontrolled blood pressure or adverse effects) were excluded to minimise confounding effects on proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) outcomes. This criterion ensured that the observed changes in proteinuria were primarily attributable to finerenone rather than to alterations in concurrent antihypertensive therapies.

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients with an acute change in estimated glomerular filtration rate in the prespecified FIDELITY pool analysis [^d4c60d59]. Kidney International (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The efficacy and safety of finerenone (a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) versus placebo were assessed according to different changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using data from FIDELITY, a pooled individual-level analysis of two clinical trials.

Methods

Patients had chronic kidney disease (eGFR of 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or greater) and type 2 diabetes with optimized renin-angiotensin system blockade. Risk of composite cardiovascular and composite kidney outcomes was analyzed by baseline eGFR change at month one in the total population and by treatment group.

Results

Of12,798 patients, 25.1% had a > 10% eGFR decline, 31.2% had a > 0–10% decline, 26.8% had a 0–10% increase, and 16.8% had a > 10% increase after one month of treatment. Factors associated with acute eGFR decline included higher baseline urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, eGFR, systolic blood pressure, diuretic or beta-blocker use, and finerenone use. Finerenone significantly reduced composite cardiovascular and kidney outcomes overall and had similar beneficial effect across eGFR subgroups of > 10% decline, > 0–10% decline, 0–10% increase, and > 10% increase for composite cardiovascular (hazard ratio [95% Confidence Interval] of 0.74 [0.61–0.90], 0.87 [0.73–1.04], 1.06 [0.87–1.28], and 0.78 [0.61–0.99], respectively) and kidney outcomes (0.67 [0.53–0.85], 0.78 [0.61–1.01], 0.56 [0.40–0.77], and 0.75 [0.50–1.14], respectively) (P interaction 0.048 and 0.23, respectively). When modeled as a continuous variable, finerenone reduced the risk of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, irrespective of acute eGFR change (P interaction 0.58 and 0.36, respectively).

Conclusions

The cardiovascular and kidney benefits of finerenone were not modified by an acute eGFR change after drug initiation.

### Effect of finerenone on chronic kidney disease outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^9ac9f7d5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Finerenone, a nonsteroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, reduced albuminuria in short-term trials involving patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes. However, its long-term effects on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes are unknown.

Methods

In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 5734 patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes in a 1:1 ratio to receive finerenone or placebo. Eligible patients had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of 30 to less than 300, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25 to less than 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area, and diabetic retinopathy, or they had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300 to 5000 and an eGFR of 25 to less than 75 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2. All the patients were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockade that had been adjusted before randomization to the maximum dose on the manufacturer's label that did not cause unacceptable side effects. The primary composite outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was kidney failure, a sustained decrease of at least 40% in the eGFR from baseline, or death from renal causes. The key secondary composite outcome, also assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure.

Results

During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, a primary outcome event occurred in 504 of 2833 patients (17.8%) in the finerenone group and 600 of 2841 patients (21.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73 to 0.93; P = 0.001). A key secondary outcome event occurred in 367 patients (13.0%) and 420 patients (14.8%) in the respective groups (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03). Overall, the frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia-related discontinuation of the trial regimen was higher with finerenone than with placebo (2.3% and 0.9%, respectively).

Conclusions

In patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, treatment with finerenone resulted in lower risks of CKD progression and cardiovascular events than placebo. (Funded by Bayer; FIDELIO-DKD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02540993.).

Chronic kidney disease with type 2 diabetes — SGLT2 inhibitors vs finerenone sequencing and potassium monitoring are outlined as follows: The KDOQI Work Group "prioritizes SGLT2 inhibitors over finerenone therapy as the next step after baseline ACEI/ARB therapy because SGLT2 inhibitors have a larger effect on reducing both kidney and cardiovascular outcomes". Finerenone "should be considered if a person does not tolerate a SGLT2 inhibitor or remains with albuminuria despite being on an SGLT2 inhibitor", and "Serum potassium should be monitored prior to drug initiation and periodically during treatment". Implementation and access notes include that "Finerenone was approved for the treatment of CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes in the United States in July 2021 and in the European Union in February 2022", conventional mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists were prescribed to "9.8% of patients with diabetes and CKD during 2019–2020", and "The patent for finerenone does not expire until 2029".

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone in non-diabetic CKD patients: a single-center, real-world, retrospective study [^98bd3055]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Based on the observed efficacy and safety profile in this real-world cohort, finerenone may be considered as a viable therapeutic option for non-diabetic CKD patients with persistent proteinuria (UACR ≥ 300 mg/g) and mildly to moderately impaired renal function (eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m²). However, close monitoring of serum potassium levels and renal function is essential, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions. Dose adjustments should therefore be guided by potassium levels and tolerability to optimize therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, combination therapy with RASi/SGLT2i could be considered to achieve synergistic renoprotection, though this approach requires validation through prospective clinical trials. Importantly, these findings should be interpreted with caution until confirmed by additional studies involving diverse patient populations. Future research should prioritize prospective randomized trials to establish generalizability and refine clinical implementation strategies.

In conclusion, finerenone demonstrates favorable efficacy and safety profiles in non-diabetic CKD patients within real-world clinical settings. This study offers significant insights and a promising perspective on the application of finerenone for non-diabetic CKD patients.

### Finerenone in heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction [^881f7616]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study FINEARTS-HF (original research) was published by Scott D Solomon and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Heart failure. In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the trial question was: what is the role of finerenone in patients with HFmrEF or HFpEF? In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the population was: 6001 patients (2732 female, 3269 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HF and a LVEF ≥ 40%. The key exclusion criteria were eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m²; serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L; acute inflammatory heart disease; myocardial infarction or any event that could have led to reduced ejection fraction in the past 90 days; CABG surgery in the past 90 days. In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the interventions were: n = 3003 finerenone (at a maximum dose of 20–40 mg once daily plus usual therapy) n = 2998 placebo (matching placebo once daily plus usual therapy). In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the incidence of total worsening HF events and death from cardiovascular causes (14.9 events /100 py vs. 17.7 events /100 py; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.95). In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in improvement in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire total symptom score at 6, 9, and 12 months (8 points vs. 6.4 points; AD 1.6 points, 95% CI 0.8 to 2.3) No significant difference in improvement in NYHA functional class at 12 months (18.6% vs. 18.4%; OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.15) No significant difference in death from any cause (16.4% vs. 17.4%; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.06). In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the FINEARTS-HF (original research) study, the conclusion was: in patients with HF and a LVEF ≥ 40%, finerenone was superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of total worsening HF events and death from cardiovascular causes.

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone in non-diabetic CKD patients: a single-center, real-world, retrospective study [^64a583d1]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Finerenone, a non-steroidal MRA, exhibits distinct receptor selectivity and has demonstrated albuminuria reduction in diabetic CKD, but comparative efficacy against steroidal MRAs in proteinuria reduction requires further investigation. In the past few years, numerous clinical trials have proven the effectiveness and safety of finerenone in managing diabetic CKD. The successful finerenone trials indicate its potential to revolutionize therapeutic approaches for CKD. Recent empirical evidence increasingly substantiates the therapeutic potential of finerenone across a diverse range of renal dysfunctions. A study involving patients with diabetic kidney disease and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 25 mL/min/1.73 m² revealed that finerenone significantly mitigated eGFR decline without causing hyperkalemia, even among populations with advanced chronic kidney disease. Furthermore, in patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria secondary to diabetic kidney disease, finerenone treatment was linked to a clinically significant reduction in the urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio. These findings imply that the renoprotective effects of finerenone may transcend glycemic status, offering potential benefits for proteinuric CKD with severe functional impairment, but these findings are limited by small sample sizes, retrospective designs, and short follow-up periods. In non-diabetic CKD, MRAs like spironolactone and eplerenone have been shown to protect the heart and kidneys. Research has found that eplerenone can decrease proteinuria and blood pressure in these patients. These findings highlight the possible benefits of MRAs for this patient group and emphasize the necessity for more information on the effectiveness of finerenone in non-diabetic CKD.

Currently, the effectiveness and safety of finerenone in non-diabetic CKD have been explored in a limited number of retrospective studies. However, the evidence for finerenone's use in non-diabetic CKD patients is still not conclusive. Therefore, we conducted a real-world retrospective study investigating the efficacy and safety of finerenone in individuals with non-diabetic CKD.

### Finerenone in the management of diabetes kidney disease [^a754a73a]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite currently available interventions and advances in treatment, people with type 2 diabetes continue to have unmet needs and remain at risk of diabetic kidney disease and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. In patients with T2DM, the unique non-steroidal MRA finerenone is a welcome addition and has shown significant effects on reducing the risk of progression of kidney disease as well as cardiovascular events. The FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials have clearly demonstrated the renal and cardiovascular benefits of finerenone on background RAAS blockade therapy. The associated risk of hyperkalemia is much lower compared with conventional steroidal MRA. Current evidence suggests that finerenone either as second line or third line post RAAS blockade and or SGLT2i use could be beneficial in delaying the progression of DKD through an additive beneficial action.

Most specialist societies have incorporated a strategy for use of finerenone in their guidelines and we have produced a consensus statement on behalf of ABCD-UKKA to guide practicing clinicians on their evidence base and usability. This rapid emergence and evidence base of a new therapeutic option in the armamentarium for DKD management is exciting, and now more than ever, clinicians have the opportunity to tailor therapy to the individual needs of their DKD patients.

With regards to managing hyperkalemia, they suggest selecting people with consistently normal serum potassium concentration (< 5 mmol) and to monitor serum potassium regularly after initiation of a non-steroidal MRA (1 month initially and every 4 monthly thereafter).

American Diabetes Association (ADA) - Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 2024 recommend an evidence-based approach to reduce risks of microvascular outcomes, including kidney, retinopathy, neurologic, and cardiovascular complications. They have updated their guidance to include evidence from trials in people with type 2 diabetes on heart failure, cardiovascular, and chronic kidney disease outcomes. These include Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in people with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (EMPEROR-Preserved), Symptoms and Functional Status in Subjects With PRESERVED Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (PRESERVED-HF) and the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD studies.

This update states that for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD treated with maximum tolerated doses of ACEi or ARBs, addition of non-steroidal MRA finerenone should be considered to improve Cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and reduce the risk of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progression, with potassium monitoring (Grade A). They also mention considering use of SGLT2 inhibitors additionally for CV risk reduction when eGFR and urinary albumin creatinine are ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m or ≥ 300 mg/g, respectively (Grade A). For those who are unable to use an SGLT2 inhibitor, finerenone is recommended to reduce DKD progression and CV events (Grade A).

They recommend the use of a non-steroidal MRA to reduce cardiovascular events and CKD progression (if eGFR is ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m) with potassium monitoring in people with CKD and albuminuria, given the increased risk for cardiovascular events and CKD progression.

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone in non-diabetic CKD patients: a single-center, real-world, retrospective study [^ce63892d]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

In CKD, renal function deterioration is usually marked by a gradual decrease in eGFR. Previous meta-analysis on CKD indicated that while finerenone could slow down the deterioration of kidney function, patients still experienced a decrease in eGFR. The FIDELIO-DKD study found that eGFR decline in diabetic CKD patients treated with finerenone followed a biphasic pattern. In the initial stage, the finerenone group had a faster reduction in eGFR than the placebo group, but after 4 months, the decline rate slowed, causing the eGFR levels of the two groups to cross over. In our study, the average eGFR value moderately declined at the 6-month follow-up but subsequently moderately ascended at the 12-month follow-up. Despite the absence of statistically significant differences at various follow-up time points, the change in eGFR demonstrates a distinct pattern in non-diabetic CKD patients.

Finerenone, functioning as an MRA, is capable of influencing the retention of sodium and the excretion of potassium, which might result in hyperkalemia, particularly among CKD patients with compromised excretion function. Hyperkalemia is one of the specific adverse events linked to the utilization of MRA drugs. Previous studies have indicated that finerenone therapy was correlated with an elevated risk of hyperkalemia. Nevertheless, through monitoring and adjusting the dosage of the medication, the risk of hyperkalemia can be effectively mitigated in diabetic CKD patients. In our cohort, the sK + level remained relatively stable throughout the 12-month follow-up period, and no serious adverse events related to the treatment were noted, thereby confirming the favorable safety profile of finerenone in the non-diabetic CKD patient population.

### Finerenone in diabetic kidney disease: a systematic review and critical appraisal [^ccad7985]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Finerenone is a novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist (MRA) recently approved for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aim to conduct a systematic review of finerenone to know the efficacy and safety of finerenone in CKD with or without T2D.

Methods

A systematic search in the electronic database of PubMed and Google Scholar was made from inception until September 09, 2022, using several MeSH keywords related to finerenone. Ongoing trials were additionally searched from ClinicalTrials. Gov.

Results

Five phase 2 and three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies of finerenone have been published to date and several other randomized and real-world studies of finerenone are currently undergoing.

Conclusions

In short-term studies in patients with CKD and reduced ejection heart failure, with or without T2D, finerenone 20 mg appears to have a better renal outcome compared with spironolactone and a better mortality outcome compared with eplerenone, with significantly lesser hyperkalemia compared to both spironolactone and finerenone. In long-term studies in patients with CKD and T2D, finerenone 10/20 mg significantly reduces the progression of renal disease and reduced CV endpoints (especially heart failure hospitalization) compared to placebo. Finerenone has no effect on HbA1c, body weight, and sexual side effects including gynecomastia, and has only a modest effect on blood pressure. However, hyperkalemia leading to drug withdrawal was significantly higher with finerenone compared to placebo. Safety data in real-world settings is a pressing priority.

### Design of the COmbinatioN effect of FInerenone anD empaglifloziN in participants with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes using a UACR endpoint study (CONFIDENCE) [^154d442e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite available interventions, people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remain at risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Finerenone, a potent and selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) can reduce both kidney and cardiovascular risks in people with CKD and T2D. Here we outline the design of a study to investigate whether dual therapy with finerenone and an SGLT2i is superior to either agent alone.

Methods

CONFIDENCE (NCT05254002) is a randomized, controlled, double-blind, double-dummy, international, multicenter, three-armed, parallel-group, 7.5 - to 8.5-month, Phase 2 study in 807 adults with T2D, stage 2–3 CKD and a urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 300- < 5000 mg/g. The primary objective is to demonstrate that 6 months of dual therapy comprising finerenone and the SGLT2i empagliflozin is superior for reducing albuminuria versus either agent alone. Interventions will be once-daily finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg (target dose) plus empagliflozin 10 mg, or empagliflozin 10 mg alone, or finerenone 10 mg or 20 mg (target dose) alone.

Results

The primary outcome is a relative change from baseline in UACR among the three groups. Secondary outcomes will further characterize efficacy and safety, including changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate and incident hyperkalemia.

Conclusions

CONFIDENCE is evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of dual use of finerenone and an SGLT2i in adults with CKD and T2D. Should an additive effect be shown, early and efficient intervention with dual finerenone and SGLT2i therapy could slow disease progression and provide long-term benefits for people with CKD and T2D.

### A randomized controlled study of finerenone vs. eplerenone in patients with worsening chronic heart failure and diabetes mellitus and / or chronic kidney disease [^d442da1b]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Dosing, randomization, and masking

Randomization was carried out centrally by an interactive voice/web response system and participants, investigators, and the sponsor's clinical team was blinded to treatment allocation. There were five preplanned finerenone treatment arms and one eplerenone treatment arm. The daily doses in the finerenone treatment arms (presented as 'initial dose → uptitrated dose'; see 'Procedures' section below) were 2.5→5, 5→10, 7.5→15, 10→20, and 15→20 mg. The initial dose in the eplerenone treatment arm was 25 mg every second day; this could be increased to 25 mg once daily and then to 50 mg once daily if both uptitration steps were performed. Uptitration of both study drugs and in all dose groups was performed if serum potassium levels remained ≤ 5.0 mmol/L. Patients were initially randomized 1:1:1 during the 7 days following hospital presentation to 1 of the 2 lowest preplanned finerenone doses (2.5→5 or 5→10 mg once daily) or eplerenone. The Data Safety Monitoring Board assessed safety and tolerability after randomization of ∼300 patients in January 2014 and decided that the three remaining preplanned finerenone treatment arms could be introduced into the study. The randomization scheme was adapted to achieve a final randomization ratio of ∼1:1.5 between each finerenone dose group and the eplerenone group.

Procedures

Finerenone or eplerenone was administered on top of standard therapy for HF. The planned treatment duration was 90 days, with an additional follow-up period after the cessation of study drug for 30 days. The titration protocol was the same in all treatment groups: if blood potassium concentration was 5.0 mmol/L or less, the initial dose of finerenone or eplerenone was uptitrated at the end of the acute/vulnerable phase (Day 30), and an additional uptitration (eplerenone) or sham uptitration (finerenone) was performed at Day 60. Treatment with the study drug was stopped if the patient had a confirmed blood potassium concentration of 5.6 mmol/L or more.

### Kidney outcomes with finerenone: an analysis from the FIgARO-DKD study [^90665d38]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Procedures and outcomes

The trial procedures and outcomes have been described in detail previously. Following run-in and adjustment of background medical therapies, eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive finerenone or placebo (10 or 20 mg once daily). Following randomization, trial visits were conducted at months 1 and 4, then every 4 months until study completion. Treatment was withheld if serum potassium concentrations exceeded 5.5 mmol/L and restarted when serum potassium levels decreased to ≤ 5.0 mmol/L.

Kidney outcomes of interest for this analysis included an eGFR ≥ 40% kidney composite endpoint of time to kidney failure [defined as end-stage kidney disease (ESKD; the initiation of long-term dialysis for ≥ 90 days, or kidney transplantation) or an eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 sustained for ≥ 4 weeks], a sustained ≥ 40% decrease in eGFR from baseline for ≥ 4 weeks, or renal death; a similar eGFR ≥ 57% kidney composite considered a sustained ≥ 57% decrease in eGFR from baseline for ≥ 4 weeks. A CV composite endpoint of time to CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or hospitalization for HF was also analyzed. All potential endpoints were prospectively adjudicated by an independent clinical event committee blinded to treatment assignment.

Efficacy and safety outcomes were also analyzed by UACR subgroups at baseline. For the UACR subgroups, patients were defined as having either moderately increased albuminuria (UACR: 30 to < 300 mg/g) or severely increased albuminuria (UACR: 300 to 5000 mg/g). A small subgroup of patients had UACR < 30 mg/g at baseline and were excluded from subgroup analyses because of the limited sample size.

Albuminuria regression was defined as a change from severely increased to moderately increased albuminuria, or moderately increased albuminuria to normal albuminuria, accompanied by a UACR decrease from baseline of ≥ 30%. Albuminuria progression for patients with moderately increased albuminuria at baseline was defined as a change to severely increased albuminuria, accompanied by a UACR increase from baseline of ≥ 30%.

### Design and baseline characteristics of the finerenone in reducing kidney failure and disease progression in diabetic kidney disease trial [^4067740d]. American Journal of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Among diabetics, those with kidney disease have exceptionally high rates of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality, and progression of their underlying disease. Finerenone is a novel, non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist which has shown to reduce albuminuria in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), while revealing only a low risk of hyperkalemia. However, the effect of finerenone on renal and CV outcomes has not been investigated in long-term trials yet.

Methods

The Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease -(FIDELIO-DKD) trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared to placebo at reducing clinically important renal and CV outcomes in T2D patients with CKD. FIDELIO-DKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, event-driven trial running in 47 countries with an expected duration of approximately 5.5 years. FIDELIO-DKD randomized 5,734 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 25- < 75 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30- ≤ 5,000 mg/g). The study has at least 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the risk of primary outcome (overall two-sided significance level α = 0.05), the composite of time to first occurrence of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥ 40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death.

Conclusion

FIDELIO-DKD will determine whether an optimally treated cohort of T2D patients with CKD at high risk of renal and CV events will experience cardiorenal benefits with the addition of finerenone to their treatment regimen.

The Finerenone in Reducing CV Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD) trial aims to assess the efficacy and safety of finerenone compared to placebo at reducing clinically important CV and renal outcomes in T2D patients with CKD. FIGARO-DKD is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, event-driven trial running in 47 countries with an expected duration of approximately 6 years. FIGARO-DKD randomized 7,437 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 to ≤ 5,000 mg/g). The study has at least 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in the risk of the primary outcome (overall two-sided significance level α = 0.05), the composite of time to first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure.

Conclusions

FIGARO-DKD will determine whether an optimally treated cohort of T2D patients with CKD at high risk of CV and renal events will experience cardiorenal benefits with the addition of finerenone to their treatment regimen.

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone in non-diabetic CKD patients: a single-center, real-world, retrospective study [^0bdf6f76]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Finerenone, a novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, has shown promising efficacy and safety profiles in the management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, evidence for its role in non-diabetic CKD patients require further investigation.

Methods

This retrospective, real-world study involved non-diabetic CKD patients from April 2023 to June 2024. Participants received finerenone alongside standard CKD treatment. Primary clinical results included changes in the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and serum potassium (sK +) levels. The data were collected initially and during follow-ups at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.

Results

In total, 37 non-diabetic CKD patients were included in the population; 21 individuals (56.8%) were male, and the mean age was 48.84 ± 14.69 years. During the follow-up, there was a notable decrease in UACR, with a median reduction of 664.95 mg/g (IQR, 196.60–1226.70, P = 0.002). The baseline average eGFR was 70.80 ± 27.97 mL/min/1.73m 2, with no notable alterations observed during the follow-up (P > 0.05). In terms of safety analysis, the sK + levels were within the 3.5–5.5 mmol/L range, with no significant difference from the baseline (P > 0.05). No patients discontinued treatment or were hospitalized because of hyperkalemia.

Conclusion

Real-world practice indicates that finerenone is effective and safe for non-diabetic CKD patients, but further large-scale, prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.

8 USE OF FINERENONE IN MODIFYING CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE PROGRESSION: OPINION

ACEIs and ARBs have long been considered preferred first‐line agents for patients with diabetes with GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 (stage 3) and UACR ≥ 30 mg/g Cr because of their proven benefit, and this is unlikely to change in the absence of head‐to‐head studies with other renal protective medications. However, the ACEIs and ARBs are rarely titrated to their maximum dose to achieve optimal renal benefit. Because the aetiology of CKD is multifactorial, once a stable dose of the ACEI or ARB has been achieved, the authors believe that a second renal protective agent should be added without delay. Both the SGLT‐2is and finerenone slow the progression of DKD and provide CV protection against hospitalization for heart failure. Because the SGLT‐2is are approved for slowing kidney disease progression, reducing CV risk and reducing plasma glucose concentration if GFR is above 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2, we favour addition of the SGLT‐2i if glycaemic control is needed within 4 weeks after the ACEI or ARB dose has been maximized. Nonetheless, CKD can continue to progress despite combined SGLT‐2i/ACEI or ARB therapy. Therefore, we advocate the addition of finerenone within 4 weeks as the third pillar of therapy. If glycaemic control is adequate or SGLT‐2is are contraindicated, finerenone should be added to the ACEI or ARB.

### Cardiovascular events with finerenone in kidney disease and type 2 diabetes [^07be4577]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Finerenone, a selective nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, has favorable effects on cardiorenal outcomes in patients with predominantly stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with severely elevated albuminuria and type 2 diabetes. The use of finerenone in patients with type 2 diabetes and a wider range of CKD is unclear.

Methods

In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes to receive finerenone or placebo. Eligible patients had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of 30 to less than 300 and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25 to 90 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 of body-surface area (stage 2 to 4 CKD) or a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 300 to 5000 and an eGFR of at least 60 mL per minute per 1.73 m 2 (stage 1 or 2 CKD). Patients were treated with renin-angiotensin system blockade that had been adjusted before randomization to the maximum dose on the manufacturer's label that did not cause unacceptable side effects. The primary outcome, assessed in a time-to-event analysis, was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure. The first secondary outcome was a composite of kidney failure, a sustained decrease from baseline of at least 40% in the eGFR, or death from renal causes. Safety was assessed as investigator-reported adverse events.

Results

A total of 7437 patients underwent randomization. Among the patients included in the analysis, during a median follow-up of 3.4 years, a primary outcome event occurred in 458 of 3686 patients (12.4%) in the finerenone group and in 519 of 3666 (14.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 0.98; P = 0.03), with the benefit driven primarily by a lower incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.90). The secondary composite outcome occurred in 350 patients (9.5%) in the finerenone group and in 395 (10.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.01). The overall frequency of adverse events did not differ substantially between groups. The incidence of hyperkalemia-related discontinuation of the trial regimen was higher with finerenone (1.2%) than with placebo (0.4%).

Conclusions

Among patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 2 to 4 CKD with moderately elevated albuminuria or stage 1 or 2 CKD with severely elevated albuminuria, finerenone therapy improved cardiovascular outcomes as compared with placebo. (Funded by Bayer; FIGARO-DKD ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02545049.).

### Efficacy and safety of finerenone in non-diabetic CKD patients: a single-center, real-world, retrospective study [^e1274753]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This real-world, observational retrospective study indicated the potential for finerenone in the clinical treatment of non-diabetic CKD patients. Our findings revealed that patients undergoing finerenone therapy experienced a notable reduction in UACR and maintained a stable eGFR throughout the treatment, indicating the drug might be conducive to alleviating the deterioration of renal function. Another crucial aspect of this study was the stable sK + levels in the non-diabetic CKD population during treatment, supporting the low hyperkalemia risk with finerenone, and manifesting acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Currently, the clinical evidence related to the utilization of finerenone in this patient population is extremely limited, and this study provided initial yet valuable evidence of both the efficacy and safety of finerenone in the treatment of non-diabetic CKD patients.

The reduction of UACR implies an enhancement in renal function and a deceleration in the progression of kidney disease. Studies have reported that a decreased UACR is correlated with superior clinical outcomes. Prior investigations have revealed that finerenone treatment leads to a reduction in UACR, demonstrating the renal protective effect in diabetic CKD patients. The notable decrease in UACR seen in our group indicates that finerenone may effectively enhance kidney function in non-diabetic CKD patients. Pitt et al. conducted an earlier study that examined the effectiveness of finerenone in individuals with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, in conjunction with mild or moderate CKD. In their study, two-thirds of the participants were non-diabetic, and a reduction in UACR was noted one month following finerenone therapy. The findings revealed a UACR reduction trend that matches our research. However, Pitt's study did not conduct a diabetes-based subgroup analysis, thereby limiting the applicability of the findings to non-diabetic CKD patients. In our cohort, a reduction in UACR was noted within the first month of treatment initiation; nevertheless, this decrease was not statistically significant, which might be attributed to the limited sample size. On later follow-up, significant UACR reductions at 3 months were sustained over 12 months.

### Diabetes educators: understanding the role of finerenone in chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^54abf51f]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Finerenone in Clinical Practice Guidelines

Based on FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD outcomes, guidelines now recommend finerenone as a pillar of therapy for people with CKD associated with T2DM. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE), the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the ADA guidelines recommend starting finerenone for adults with T2DM, an eGFR ≥ 25 ml/min/1.73 m 2, albuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g), and normal serum potassium, despite a maximally tolerated dose of a RAASi. However, there are data that support the slow implementation of finerenone, specifically in primary care. A single-center study found that finerenone prescribing by primary care physicians was lower (34%) versus prescribing by specialists (66%). Low uptake of CKD medication prescribing in primary care may be due to barriers such as medication accessibility and affordability (including prior authorization, insurance formulary status, and out-of-pocket costs to the patient), clinical inertia, and lack of awareness of CKD guidelines. With such rapid changes in the landscape of CKD treatment, diabetes educators are well-positioned members of the healthcare team to help overcome such barriers by facilitating timely CKD screening, educating patients and other HCPs, collaborating with the healthcare team and people living with CKD associated with T2DM to make treatment decisions, and navigating additional medication assistance resources.

### 2023 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on management of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^bd8ed048]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) — definition, risk, assessment, and therapy thresholds are summarized. CKD is defined as reduced kidney function for at least 3 months duration, with markers including albuminuria (albumin to creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g) or other markers of kidney damage. CKD and HFpEF often coexist, and CKD is a risk factor for incident HFpEF, with a prevalence of ~50% in individuals with HF, and CKD is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and up to a 3-fold increase in mortality in HFpEF. Concentrations of natriuretic peptides are usually higher in individuals with CKD as compared with those without, making usual cutoffs less specific for the diagnosis of HF. Assessment notes serum creatinine may be falsely reduced due to loss of muscle mass or volume expansion/hemodilution, resulting in a falsely increased eGFR, and other useful markers include the presence of albuminuria, evidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism, and increasing creatinine with diuresis as a result of hemoconcentration to identify the true degree of CKD. Collaboration and comanagement by nephrology and cardiology should be considered, and agents that reduce the risk of progression to kidney failure in individuals with diabetic kidney disease include ACE inhibitors, ARBs, SGLT2is, and the nonsteroidal, selective MRAs, finerenone; trials have included individuals with eGFRs as low as 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for ACE inhibitors and ARBs, 25 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for finerenone, and 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for SGLT2is. In HFpEF, the PARAGON-HF trial demonstrated less decline in renal function with the ARNI compared with the ARB, and EMPEROR-Preserved also noted less decline in renal function with the SGLT2i empagliflozin vs placebo. Based on these findings, the use of an SGLT2i (eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m^2) is beneficial in slowing the decline of kidney function in individuals with HFpEF and CKD above and beyond other therapies, and when using RAAS blockers and/or SGLT2is, monitoring kidney function and serum potassium is useful 1 to 2 weeks after initiation.

Finerenone trial outcomes and hyperkalemia profile — adults with CKD and T2D: the nonsteroidal MRA finerenone reduced cardiovascular risk (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78–0.95), with a 22% reduction in risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66–0.92); participants had an eGFR of ≥ 25 ml/min per 1.73 m^2 and albuminuria at ≥ 30 mg/g (> 3 mg/mmol). Finerenone approximately doubled the RR of hyperkalemia, but average increase in serum potassium was approximately 0.2–0.3 mEq and participants were selected with serum potassium ≤ 4.8 mmol/l. In FIDELIO‑DKD, withdrawal or interruption due to hyperkalemia occurred in 2.3% and 11.0% with finerenone versus 0.9% and 5.2% with placebo; in FIDELITY, permanent withdrawal for hyperkalemia was 1.7% versus 0.6%, and hospitalization for serious hyperkalemia had a < 1% excess risk over 3 years.

### Finerenone reduces risk of incident heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes: analyses from the FIgARO-DKD trial [^77dcf545]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

With the exclusion of patients with symptomatic HFrEF in FIGARO-DKD (because of the class IA recommendation in guidelines for MRA treatment), the subgroup of patients with HF analyzed in this study are likely those with stage B (asymptomatic HFrEF or HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF]) or stage C HF (ie, current or previous signs and symptoms of HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction or HFpEF). Indeed, the baseline characteristics of the patients with a history of HF in the present study — more likely female, obese with lower eGFR, and higher C-reactive protein — are more indicative of a HFpEF population. Data on the efficacy and safety of steroidal MRAs in patients with HFpEF are mixed. – Data from the current analyses are limited to allow for any conclusions, but it is the first set of preliminary data evaluating a nonsteroidal MRA in patients with HFpEF or HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction. The ongoing FINEARTS-HF study (Finerenone Trial to Investigate Efficacy and Safety Superior to Placebo in Patients With Heart Failure), which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients with HF and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 40%, will offer a robust insight into the effects of finerenone in this patient population. 32

In the present study, finerenone led to a 29% reduction in the risk of first HHF compared with placebo, and furthermore, the rate of total HHF was reduced by 30%. The FIGARO-DKD trial included patients at high cardiovascular risk, with a broader spectrum of patients with CKD, yet overall, less advanced kidney disease than those included in FIDELIO-DKD. – In the FIDELIO-DKD study, a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular outcomes was also observed with finerenone compared with placebo. This was reflected by lower incidence rates for HHF as well as cardiovascular death in the finerenone group; however, the magnitude of risk reduction for HHF was smaller than that observed in the present study, at 14%. In patients with CKD, T2D, and HF, mortality and hospitalization rates have been shown to increase with CKD severity. Therefore, initiating treatment at earlier stages of disease such as those represented in these analyses, 62% of whom had albuminuric CKD with an eGFR ≥ 60 mL per min per 1.73 m 2, may be more beneficial for this patient population, and may explain in part the larger magnitude of treatment effect observed with finerenone on HF outcomes in the FIGARO-DKD trial.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Study design

This analysis combines individual patient‐level data from the FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD Phase III clinical trials; the designs and results of these studies have been published previously. Briefly, adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with CKD and T2D who were receiving maximum tolerated labelled renin‐angiotensin system inhibitor therapy were eligible to participate if they had a serum potassium level ≤ 4.8 mmol/L at screening. Patients had either a UACR of ≥ 30 to < 300 mg/g and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 25 to ≤ 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or a UACR of ≥ 300 to ≤ 5000 mg/g and an eGFR of ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m 2.

Patients with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) > 108 mmol/mol (> 12%) at screening were not eligible to participate. There were no restrictions on the use of antidiabetic treatment, and the use of GLP‐1RAs was permitted at baseline and throughout the trial, as was the initiation of GLP‐1RA treatment during the trial.

During the study, healthcare providers were advised to follow local guidelines for the management of T2D, including recommendations for glycaemic control. Patients were recruited from September 2015 to October 2018, a period when guidelines and recommendations for GLP‐1RA use in patients with T2D at risk of CV events were being updated. The trial protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each study site, and all patients provided written informed consent.

2.2 Randomization and masking

In both studies, patients were randomized 1:1 to receive double‐blind therapy with either oral finerenone (at titrated doses of 10 or 20 mg) or matching placebo once daily. Randomization was stratified by region (North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, other), albuminuria at screening (UACR 30 to < 300 mg/g, ≥ 300 mg/g) and eGFR at screening (25 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2, 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2). Patients were also stratified by history of CV disease in FIGARO‐DKD. All patients and study personnel (except for the independent data monitoring committee) were masked to treatment allocation.

### Kidney outcomes with finerenone: an analysis from the FIgARO-DKD study [^3bbe1414]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

Increased albuminuria is an independent marker of progression to kidney failure and adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes, and patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) remain at high risk despite best-recommended therapies.
Finerenone is a novel, selective, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist that slowed CKD progression and improved CV outcomes versus placebo in patients with predominantly stage 3–4 CKD with severely increased albuminuria in the FIDELIO-DKD trial.
In the FIGARO-DKD trial, finerenone reduced the risk of CV events in patients with stage 2–4 CKD and moderately increased albuminuria or stage 1–2 CKD with severely increased albuminuria. Although there was a trend favoring finerenone for the first kidney composite endpoint, this difference was not statistically significant.

What this study adds?

The purpose of this analysis was to further evaluate the effects of finerenone on kidney outcomes in patients with CKD and T2D in FIGARO-DKD.
This exploratory analysis demonstrated that there are beneficial effects of finerenone on clinical kidney outcomes, including a 36% relative risk reduction of end-stage kidney disease compared with placebo.
In FIGARO-DKD, despite showing greater treatment effects on kidney composite outcomes in patients with severely rather than moderately increased albuminuria, finerenone reduced the risk of CV events and markers of CKD progression in patients with both severely increased albuminuria and moderately increased albuminuria.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

Finerenone offers an important treatment advance for patients with CKD and T2D with both moderately or severely increased albuminuria to protect against CV events and kidney disease progression.
These findings emphasize the need for albuminuria screening in clinical practice for patients with T2D to enable earlier identification of CKD and initiation of appropriate treatment.

At 1 month, 86 (3.1%) and 14 (0.5%) subjects in the finerenone group and 34 (1.2%) and four of 2749 (0.1%) subjects in the placebo group had serum potassium > 5.5 and > 6.0 mmol/L, respectively. Elevated baseline potassium was associated with an increased risk of mild hyperkalemia; the risk was increased 1.5, 2.8, and 4.2 times with serum potassium of 4.5– < 4.8, 4.8–5.0, and > 5.0 mmol/L at baseline, respectively, compared with a serum potassium of 4.1–4.5 mmol/L. Lower eGFR was also an independent risk factor of hyperkalemia. Risk of mild hyperkalemia increased 1.5 and 2 times as eGFR dropped below 45 and 25 ml/min per 1.73 m, compared with an eGFR greater than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m. Patients with an eGFR of 45 – < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m had a similar risk to those with an eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m.

### Low-dose spironolactone and cardiovascular outcomes in moderate stage chronic kidney disease: a randomized controlled trial [^53940962]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a substantial risk of progression to end-stage renal disease and vascular events. The nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA), finerenone, offers cardiorenal protection for people with CKD and diabetes, but there is uncertainty if the steroidal MRA, spironolactone, provides the same protection. In this prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint trial, we assessed the effectiveness of 25 mg spironolactone in addition to usual care or usual care alone for reducing cardiovascular outcomes in stage 3b CKD among an older community cohort (mean age = 74.8 years and s.d. = 8.1). We recruited 1,434 adults from English primary care, of whom 1,372 (96%) were included in the primary analysis. The primary outcome was time from randomization until the first occurrence of death, hospitalization for heart disease, stroke, heart failure, transient ischemic attack or peripheral arterial disease, or first onset of any condition listed not present at baseline. Across 3 years of follow-up, the primary endpoint occurred in 113 of 677 participants randomized to spironolactone (16.7%) and 111 of 695 participants randomized to usual care (16.0%) with no significant difference between groups (hazard ratio = 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 0.81–1.37). Two-thirds of participants randomized to spironolactone stopped treatment within 6 months, predominantly because they met prespecified safety stop criteria. The most common reason for stopping spironolactone was a decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate that met prespecified stop criteria (n = 239, 35.4%), followed by participants being withdrawn due to treatment side effects (n = 128, 18.9%) and hyperkalemia (n = 54, 8.0%). In conclusion, we found that spironolactone was frequently discontinued due to safety concerns, with no evidence that it reduced cardiovascular outcomes in people with stage 3b CKD. Spironolactone should not be used for people with stage 3b CKD without another explicit treatment indication. ClinicalTrials.gov registration:
