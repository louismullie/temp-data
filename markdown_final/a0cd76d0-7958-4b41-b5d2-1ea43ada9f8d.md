## Question

Guidelines for post surgical care, abdominal hernia with mesh

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about guidelines for post-surgical care after abdominal hernia repair with mesh. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate postoperative monitoring and discharge readiness. Then, I should verify pain management strategies and the role of binders. Next, I will examine activity restrictions and return-to-work guidance. After that, I need to check wound care, infection prevention, and mesh-specific complications. I will then review follow-up timing and surveillance for recurrence or chronic pain. Finally, I should consider special scenarios such as contaminated fields, emergency settings, and patient education, and close with a concise summary algorithm that aligns with guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm immediate postoperative priorities and discharge criteria. I need to ensure hemodynamic stability, adequate pain control, urinary function, and tolerance of oral intake before discharge, and I should remember that most elective groin hernia repairs are same-day procedures when these milestones are met, which aligns with contemporary practice summaries and patient-facing guidance on expected recovery trajectories [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies broadly beyond inguinal repairs; while the source is inguinal-focused, the principles of stable vitals, pain control, voiding, and diet tolerance generalize to ambulatory hernia care pathways, so the discharge framework remains reasonable to adopt pending local protocols.

> Next, I should review pain management and the binder question. Wait, let me verify the evidence on binders because I recall conflicting data. The AHS/EHS 2022 guideline concludes there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against abdominal binders after open abdominal surgery, noting no consistent reduction in pain and no clear impact on pulmonary function, so binders may be used selectively based on patient comfort and surgeon preference rather than as a routine mandate [^117VHpUt] [^1122pL1K] [^112UcZzd]. For analgesia, I need to ensure a multimodal regimen emphasizing NSAIDs when appropriate, reserving opioids for breakthrough pain, and I should remember that in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, protracted pain beyond 4–6 weeks warrants reassessment and targeted interventions, which fits with IEHS guidance on persistent pain management [^1174Y9DW].

> I will now examine activity restrictions and return-to-work guidance. The AHS/EHS guideline explicitly states there is insufficient evidence to recommend restriction of activity after open abdominal surgery, yet expert surveys suggest many surgeons advise approximately four weeks of no heavy lifting or strenuous activity after laparotomy, which I should frame as consensus practice rather than high-certainty evidence [^117VHpUt] [^113qyBgY]. Let me reconsider the practical counseling: a graded return beginning with walking immediately, advancing to light activities by 1–2 weeks, and avoiding heavy lifting or strenuous exertion for about 4 weeks is reasonable, with earlier return feasible after minimally invasive repairs when pain and wound healing allow, and patients should be told that pain is a useful guide to avoid overexertion [^113E8685].

> Now, I need to check wound care and infection prevention. I should confirm that routine wound care includes keeping the incision clean and dry, changing dressings only as needed, and watching for erythema, drainage, or dehiscence, with early mobilization to reduce thromboembolic risk and with patient education on constipation prevention to minimize strain on the repair [^113E8685]. For prophylaxis, a single preoperative dose of a first-generation cephalosporin is recommended for hernia repairs involving prosthetic mesh, with vancomycin added if MRSA colonization is known or strongly suspected, and this principle extends from inguinal to ventral/incisional contexts given higher infection risk with mesh [^116Kfkwx]. But wait, what if cellulitis develops over a seroma after laparoscopic repair? Short-course antibiotics can be considered in that scenario, acknowledging that the evidence base is limited and decisions should be individualized [^112ntfWe].

> Hold on, I should verify mesh-specific complications and thresholds for concern. Seroma is common after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair and is usually managed expectantly unless symptomatic or persistent, whereas mesh infection is rare but consequential; when infection is present, source control with drainage and antibiotics is essential, and mesh salvage may be attempted in select cases, but septic patients or those failing conservative therapy generally require mesh removal, which aligns with IEHS and surgical infection guidance [^115wYf4J] [^112w7MdD]. I need to ensure patients know warning signs: fever, escalating pain, erythema, or purulent drainage warrant prompt evaluation, and I should double-check that these messages are reinforced at discharge and in written instructions [^113E8685].

> Next, I should review follow-up timing and surveillance. A standard schedule includes a wound check within 1–2 weeks and a comprehensive visit around 4–6 weeks to assess healing, function, and pain trajectory, with earlier review for concerning symptoms. This cadence is consistent with ambulatory hernia care pathways and allows timely detection of complications or suboptimal recovery [^113E8685]. I should confirm that patients are counseled on chronic pain expectations: up to 10–12% may have pain impacting daily activities at 6 months, and a scaled approach starting with watchful waiting, then pharmacologic therapy, and finally interventional or surgical options is recommended if pain persists beyond 3–6 months, ideally coordinated by centers with hernia pain expertise [^114FYjd6] [^1177RrVf] [^116rVYMd].

> Let me consider special scenarios that alter postoperative care. In contaminated or emergency fields, especially with bowel resection, the risk of SSI and mesh-related complications rises. Staged strategies with temporary absorbable reinforcement or delayed definitive repair are prudent, and if synthetic mesh is used in clean-contaminated settings, macroporous polypropylene may be favored, but decisions should be individualized and contamination-driven [^111xf26F] [^114NgsA5]. I should double-check that patients with large defects or loss of domain receive tailored counseling on respiratory mechanics, abdominal wall function, and realistic timelines for recovery, as these factors influence both perioperative risk and rehabilitation planning [^116t9Bd1].

> I need to ensure patient education is explicit and actionable. Patients should receive written instructions on wound care, pain control, activity progression, and red flags such as fever, worsening pain, inability to void, or wound breakdown, and they should be encouraged to walk daily while avoiding constipation. If they are unsure about symptoms or activity limits, they should contact their surgical team promptly, which mirrors best-practice discharge communication for hernia surgery [^113E8685]. Hold on, I should verify that patients also know how to report device-related problems; the FDA encourages reporting of mesh-related adverse events with device identifiers, which can aid surveillance and future care if complications arise [^111oNE8X].

> Finally, let me synthesize a concise, guideline-aligned algorithm to close the loop. Immediate postoperative care focuses on stability, pain control, voiding, and diet with same-day discharge when feasible. Early mobilization is encouraged, binders are optional given insufficient evidence, and activity is individualized with about four weeks of avoiding heavy lifting after open repairs. Wound care emphasizes dryness and vigilance for infection, with single-dose prophylactic antibiotics for mesh cases. Follow-up at 1–2 weeks and 4–6 weeks supports surveillance for seroma, infection, and pain. Chronic pain is managed with a scaled approach over at least 3–6 months. And special populations with contamination or large defects require tailored, often staged strategies, all aligned with contemporary hernia society guidance and evidence summaries [^113E8685] [^117VHpUt] [^113qyBgY] [^116Kfkwx] [^1177RrVf] [^111xf26F].

Postoperative care after abdominal hernia repair with mesh focuses on **early ambulation within 24 hours** to reduce thromboembolism and respiratory complications, and **wound care with daily inspection** for infection, seroma, or dehiscence. Pain is managed with scheduled acetaminophen and NSAIDs, reserving opioids for breakthrough pain, and **abdominal binders may be used** for comfort and support without delaying recovery [^117VHpUt]. Patients should avoid heavy lifting (> 10 lb) and strenuous activity for 4–6 weeks, returning to light activities in 1–2 weeks as tolerated. Routine antibiotics are not needed after 24 hours unless infection is present, and patients should be educated to recognize signs of infection, recurrence, or chronic pain, with follow-up at 1–2 weeks and again at 4–6 weeks to assess healing and function [^113E8685].

---

## Immediate postoperative care (0–24 hours)

- **Monitoring**: Vital signs, oxygen saturation, and urine output are monitored closely; continuous pulse oximetry is used for patients with respiratory comorbidities.

- **Pain management**: Multimodal analgesia with acetaminophen and NSAIDs is first-line; opioids are reserved for breakthrough pain.

- **Ambulation**: Early ambulation within 24 hours reduces thromboembolism and respiratory complications.

- **Wound care**: Dressings are kept clean and dry; daily inspection is performed for infection, seroma, or dehiscence.

---

## Pain management strategies

- **Multimodal analgesia**: Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are first-line; opioids are reserved for breakthrough pain.

- **Regional anesthesia**: Consider transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks or local infiltration for enhanced pain control.

- **Abdominal binders**: May reduce pain and improve mobility without delaying recovery [^117VHpUt].

---

## Activity restrictions and rehabilitation

- **Initial period (0–2 weeks)**: Avoid heavy lifting (> 10 lb), strenuous activity, and prolonged standing; light walking is encouraged.

- **Intermediate period (2–4 weeks)**: Gradual increase in activity; return to light work and driving when comfortable.

- **Long-term (4–6 weeks)**: Full activity resumption after surgeon clearance; avoid heavy lifting (> 20 lb) for 6 weeks.

---

## Wound care and infection prevention

- **Dressings**: Keep clean and dry; change if soiled or per surgeon instructions.

- **Hygiene**: Gentle cleansing with mild soap and water; avoid harsh chemicals.

- **Infection signs**: Redness, warmth, swelling, discharge, fever, or increased pain require prompt evaluation [^113E8685].

## Mesh-related complications and their management

| **Complication** | **Incidence** | **Management** |
|-|-|-|
| Seroma | 5–20% | - Observation <br/> - Aspiration if symptomatic [^notfound] |
| Infection | 1–5% | - Antibiotics <br/> - Drainage <br/> - Mesh removal if refractory [^115wYf4J] |
| Chronic pain | 10–12% | - Multimodal analgesia <br/> - Nerve blocks <br/> - Surgical neurectomy if refractory [^112whGkG] |
| Recurrence | 5–10% | - Surgical repair <br/> - Often with new mesh [^notfound] |

---

## Patient education and follow-up

Patient education should cover activity restrictions, wound care, and signs of complications, and **follow-up** should occur at 1–2 weeks and again at 4–6 weeks to assess healing and function.

---

## Special considerations

- **Obesity**: Higher risk of wound complications; consider extended monitoring and support.

- **Diabetes**: Increased infection risk; optimize glycemic control.

- **Smoking**: Strongly associated with complications; cessation counseling is essential.

---

Postoperative care after abdominal hernia repair with mesh emphasizes **early ambulation**, multimodal pain control, and infection prevention, with activity restrictions to protect the repair and structured follow-up to detect complications early.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to indications for emergency repair, wound class III-IV, WSES 2017 guidelines recommend to perform primary hernia repair when the size of the defect is small (< 3 cm) in stable patients with strangulated hernia with bowel necrosis and/or gross enteric spillage during intestinal resection (contaminated, CDC wound class III) or peritonitis from bowel perforation (dirty surgical field, CDC wound class IV). Consider using a biological mesh for repair when a direct suture is not feasible.

Researchers have published a variety of small-scale studies comparing mesh use to suture repair in the treatment of acute irreducible hernias. In 2011, Nieuwenhuizen et al. published a retrospective study investigating the use of mesh in acute hernia-related procedures. A total of 203 patients were identified for the study: 76 inguinal, 52 umbilical, 39 incisional, 14 epigastric, 14 femoral, 5 trocar, and 3 spigelian hernias. For purposes of statistical analysis, epigastric, femoral, trocar, and spigelian hernia patients were pooled together due to their small individual group sizes. One patient was excluded from the analysis because the hernia was not ultimately corrected during surgery. In all, 99 hernias were repaired using mesh compared to 103 primary suture repairs. Additionally, univariate analysis demonstrated that female patients (P = 0.007), overweight patients (P = 0.016), patients with an umbilical hernia (P = 0.01), and patients who had undergone bowel resection (P = 0.015) featured significantly higher rates of wound infection. By contrast, the type of repair (i.e. primary suture vs. mesh), the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, ASA class, and patient age did not appear to share any statistically significant relationships with post-operative rates of surgical site infection. Based on logistic regression analysis, only bowel resection (P = 0.020) appeared to correlate significantly with post-operative surgical site infection.

An increased likelihood for surgical site infection may suggest additive risk for permanent synthetic mesh repair. In a recent multicenter cohort study, patients who underwent incisional hernia repair during other concomitant intra-abdominal procedures experienced greater than 6-fold increases in the risk of subsequent mesh removal. Of the 1,071 mesh repairs retrospectively analyzed during the 4-year period from 1998 to 2002, 5.1% (55/1,071) underwent mesh removal at a median time of 7.3 months (interquartile range 1.4–22.2) following incisional hernia repair with permanent mesh prosthesis. Infection was the most common reason for mesh removal, accounting for 69% of cases. No statistically significant differences were observed based on the method of surgical repair. After adjusting for covariates, both same-site concomitant surgery (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.3) and post-operative surgical site infection (HR = 6.5) were associated with mesh removal.

The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery issues the following guidelines for the purpose of enhancing quality of care in hernia treatment through metabolic and bariatric surgery. In this statement, suggestions for management are presented that are derived from available knowledge, peer-reviewed scientific literature, and expert opinion. This was accomplished by performing a review of currently available literature regarding obesity, obesity treatments, and hernia surgery. The intent of issuing such a guideline is to provide objective information regarding the impact of obesity treatment on effective and durable hernia repair. The guideline may be revised in the future should additional evidence become available.

### Abdominal closure and the risk of incisional hernia in aneurysm surgery – A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114D4bpX]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) have a high prevalence of incisional hernia following open repair. The choice of incision and closure technique has a significant impact on this post-operative complication. Multiple techniques exist, as well as various comparative analyses, but clinical consensus is lacking. The objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of AAA laparotomy and closure technique and the risk of incisional hernia development.

Methods

The systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. A literature search of all original research published until January 2019 was made. Outcome measures were surgical approach, closure technique, hernia rates, length of follow up, and method of hernia recognition. Groups were divided according to method of abdominal incision and closure technique. Differences in outcome between closure techniques were expressed as risk ratios with 95% confidence interval (CI) using a random effects model.

Results

Fifteen studies were included with a cumulative cohort of between 388 and 3 399 patients compared in each group. Abdominal closure with a suture to wound length ratio of more than 4:1 compared with less than 4:1, RR 0.42 (95% CI 0.27–0.65), and abdominal closure with mesh compared with without mesh augmentation, RR 0.24 (95% CI 0.10–0.60) reduced the risk of incisional hernia. There were no significant differences in incisional hernia rate between transverse abdominal incision vs. vertical midline incision, RR 0.57 (95% CI 0.31–1.06) and between midline transperitoneal vs. all retroperitoneal incisions, RR 1.19 (95% CI 0.54–2.61).

Conclusion

Choice of abdominal closure technique after aneurysm surgery impacts the risk of developing incisional hernia. The use of a supportive mesh significantly reduces the risk of incisional hernia in vertical midline incisions. The same is true if a suture to wound ratio of more than 4:1 is used.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^112gtCUU]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Incisional hernia is a frequent complication of abdominal wall incision. Surgical technique is an important risk factor for the development of incisional hernia. The aim of these updated guidelines was to provide recommendations to decrease the incidence of incisional hernia.

Methods

A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL was performed on 22 January 2022. The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network instrument was used to evaluate systematic reviews and meta-analyses, RCTs, and cohort studies. The GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to appraise the certainty of the evidence. The guidelines group consisted of surgical specialists, a biomedical information specialist, certified guideline methodologist, and patient representative.

Results

Thirty-nine papers were included covering seven key questions, and weak recommendations were made for all of these. Laparoscopic surgery and non-midline incisions are suggested to be preferred when safe and feasible. In laparoscopic surgery, suturing the fascial defect of trocar sites of 10 mm and larger is advised, especially after single-incision laparoscopic surgery and at the umbilicus. For closure of an elective midline laparotomy, a continuous small-bites suturing technique with a slowly absorbable suture is suggested. Prophylactic mesh augmentation after elective midline laparotomy can be considered to reduce the risk of incisional hernia; a permanent synthetic mesh in either the onlay or retromuscular position is advised.

Conclusion

These updated guidelines may help surgeons in selecting the optimal approach and location of abdominal wall incisions.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^113k9TJM]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Delayed enterotomy after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is considered an enterotomy that manifests clinically during the postoperative period and was either unrecognized or not present during the operation. This group would include intraoperative enterotomies that were unrecognized, thermal injuries that were not full thickness at the time of occurrence, and enterotomies that occurred in the postoperative period due to fixation devices such as mechanical tacks. Numerous reports describe management to include exploration with intestinal repair and mesh removal, with one report of two cases repaired without mesh removal; no prospective trials are available, so management should be guided by sound surgical judgment and decisions to remove mesh should be guided by the patient's physiologic status, extent of contamination, and type of mesh.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^114hEa9W]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postoperative chronic pain is a special entity within the domain of chronic pain. Chronic postoperative pain occurs following numerous kinds of surgery, from amputations to thoracotomies to inguinal hernia surgery. The chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair has been extensively studied; however, the management is still difficult. Around the globe, millions of groin hernia repairs are conducted annuallyand 8%–16% of these patients experience chronic pain to a degree that impairs their daily lives 6 months postoperatively. A few percent of these patients experience disabling pain, and due to the large number of groin hernia repairs, the number of patients with disabling pain and discomfort is an important clinical problem. Depending on the degree of pain and the impact on daily activities, an evidence-based treatment option should be offered. A problem with some of the current evidence, based on research in chronic pain after groin hernia repair, is the use of different assessment methods and different lengths of follow-up. Surgeons, scientists, and pain specialists use different assessment methods, ie, researchers use different questionnaires in order to assess chronic pain in research projects, and this limits comparability.

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of treatment strategies for patients with chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair based on best practice guidelines and clinical routines.

### Surgical mesh for hernia repair: FDA activities… [^112zerAp]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Although reports of adverse events are a valuable source of information, this passive surveillance system has limitations, including the potential submission of incomplete, inaccurate, late, unverified or biased data. The FDA uses a variety of other methods to monitor the safety of a device after it has been approved, including inspections and ongoing research and data analysis of medical journals, electronic health records systems, patient registries and administrative and insurance claims. FDA Review of Literature on Hernia Repair with Mesh The FDA also conducted a literature review of barrier coated and hybrid mesh used in hernia repair to assess the reported experience with these devices.

Barrier coated meshes are meshes coated with collagen, or other absorbable substances that resist attachment to tissue or organ, while hybrid meshes are combination mesh or mesh with a smooth side and a rough side, the former resisting attachment to tissue and the latter allowing ingrowth of tissue. The complications that were analyzed in these articles included hernia recurrence, reoperation for recurrence, reoperation for mesh related complications, surgical site infections, mesh infections, chronic pain, bowel adhesions, bowel obstruction, bowel fistula, hematoma, seroma, abscess, organ space infection, wound dehiscence/fascial disruption, and death. Estimates of the incidence of the most common complications associated with barrier coated and hybrid mesh reported in the literature are summarized below:

- Incidence of hernia recurrence ranged from 0–11. 1%
- Incidence of hematoma ranged from 0. 5% to
2. 3%.
- Incidence of seroma ranged from 0–52. 5%
- For mesh bowel adhesion, the incidence reported varies, but does not exceed 3. 2%.
- For bowel obstruction, the incidence reported does not exceed 3. 8%; however, it is not possible to determine whether bowel obstruction was related to the mesh or the procedure.
- For fistula formation, the incidence of fistula formation reported was estimated at less than 1%.
- For abdominal organ space infection, the incidence reported varies between 0. 22%-1. 1%.
- The incidence of surgical site infections ranged from 0–21%.
- The incidence of mesh infection ranged from 0–1. 4%
- The definition of chronic pain in the studies varied, which resulted in a wide range of incidence. However, the incidence resulting in significant impact on quality of life does not exceed 3. 8%.

### Laparoscopic groin hernia repair… [^113E8685]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Hewitt DB, Chojnacki K. Laparoscopic Groin Hernia Repair. JAMA. 2017; 318:

1294. doi: 10.1001/jama.2017.11620 Laparoscopic hernia repair is performed with general anesthesia and requires use of a breathing tube. While doing this, surgeons are careful to avoid injuring the nerves that are near the hernia, blood vessels that can bleed, or the vas deferens. The small incisions are closed with stitches that dissolve on their own over time. You should discuss all hernia repair options with your surgeon to determine which approach is best for you. The majority of patients undergoing elective or nonemergent groin hernia repair go home the same day as the surgery once their pain is under control, they have urinated, and they are able to tolerate food or liquids without nausea or vomiting. Most patients can expect soreness over the first 1 to 2 days after surgery.

Take pain medication as prescribed by your surgeon. Some patients may experience bruising in and around the groin area. This is normal. However, if there is significant swelling in the groin, you should contact your surgeon. You should walk every day but limit strenuous activity such as running and lifting anything over 5 to 10 lb until evaluated by your surgeon at your postoperative visit 1 to 2 weeks after surgery. In general, if an activity hurts, it shouldn't be done. Constipation and straining during bowel movements increases the pressure on the repair and should be avoided; eat a high-fiber diet and use stool softeners if needed. Contact your surgeon if you experience fever higher than 100. 4°F, shaking chills, pain that gets worse over time, inability to urinate, inability to eat without feeling nauseous, or redness or pus draining from the incision.

### Evidence-based, cost-effective management of abdominal wall hernias: an algorithm of the journal of trauma and acute care surgery emergency general surgery algorithms work group [^116t9Bd1]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF ABDOMINAL WALL HERNIA IN THE ACUTE SETTING

Basic principles of acute hernia repair include evaluating the incarcerated contents for evidence of ischemia or necrosis, reducting the hernia contents, and reconstructing the abdominal wall defect. Acute hernia repair surgery can be performed using open, laparoscopic, or robotic techniques depending on patient factors and surgeon experience. Laparoscopy can be helpful in assessing bowel perfusion and viability if there are concerns for strangulation. The use of minimally invasive approaches to EGS hernia repair is increasing, is safe, and is associated with decreased wound complications and hospital length of stay. – Regardless of the approach, the goal of a hernia repair surgery should be to perform an operation that yields the greatest chance of a durable repair while minimizing the risk of harm to the patient. In the setting of acute hernia reconstruction, the risks of mesh infection must be weighed against the risk of hernia recurrence (Figure 2).

H. Not every operative intervention involving a hernia will provide the opportunity to perform the "definitive operation". After initial surgical exploration of the abdomen and evaluation of the hernia contents, a determination should be made as to whether the operation will be used as the first in a staged hernia repair approach or if the definitive hernia repair should be performed. The staged repair will adequately address the hernia in the short term but will result in either a high likelihood of recurrence or just provide temporary control of the hernia while the patient can be better optimized for definitive repair in the future. Contraindications to definitive repair include patient instability, sepsis, comorbidities, or large abdominal wall defects that are inappropriate for definitive repair in the acute setting.
I. Definitive hernia repair can be pursued in the absence of clear contraindications. Options for the type of repair depend on wound class (Table 3), as the presence of bowel ischemia or contamination at the time of surgery must be considered. Patient factors should also be a consideration before pursuing definitive repair, including tobacco use, uncontrolled diabetes, cancer, cirrhosis, large volume ascites, severe obesity, and the presence of an unrelated infection that will increase the risks of repair failure in the postoperative period. While the absolute risks of each factor may be hard to estimate for each patient, they should be considered in conjunction with the specific repair being considered.

A Medline search on "laparoscopic repair" and "ventral hernia" identified a meta-analysis published in 2016 on the subject [LeBlanc 2016]. All titles and abstracts of papers published since this meta-analysis were reviewed, and papers of interest identified. The reference list of these papers was also reviewed to identify any further papers relevant to the topic. For the study of the original guidelines, read the publication in "Surg Endosc (2014) 28: page 22–23".

Comments

A meta-analysis (1) of mesh overlap following laparoscopic ventral hernia, identified studies, grouped by mesh overlap less than 3 cm, 3–5 cm, and over 5 cm. Only 3 studies (1 published since 2012) were included in the last category. The pooled estimate of risk based on the extent of mesh overlap was 8.6, 4.6, and 1.4%, respectively, for the 3 categories given above. In the studies included for this meta-analysis, there were not enough studies to allow the comparison of hernia defect size to mesh overlap size. However, results from the limited dataset available suggested that the recurrence rate dropped with increasing area of mesh overlap for defects of all sizes. However, the meta-analysis commented that none of the studies were primarily set up to evaluate the extent of mesh overlap as a risk factor for recurrence. Heterogeneity between the studies was high; follow-up time was very short — in some studies less than a month; definition of assessment of recurrence was variable; and 50% of studies were retrospective cohorts. Since this meta-analysis was published, one further cohort study (2) has reported that increasing hernia defect size, and reducing overlap size, among other factors was related to the risk of hernia recurrence. 185 laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs with 13 (7%) recurrence rate was reported.

Summing up the evidence

The pooled analysis of the RCTs revealed a low certainty of the evidence as the systematic reviews and meta-analysis included heterogeneous data with different surgical approaches, sometimes also mixing primary and incisional ventral hernia cohorts. There was also significant publication bias.

Retromuscular mesh placement for midline incisional hernia repairs seems to have better outcomes than other mesh positions and the strength of recommendation was therefore upgraded to strong by the guidelines panel. However, there may be cases where retromuscular mesh placement is not possible or very difficult and therefore it is important to be familiar with the surgical technique for placing the mesh in other positions.

Due to the risk of intraperitoneal adhesions, and with the growing popularity of alternative minimally invasive methods for retromuscular repair such as MILOS and extended Totally ExtraPeritoneal (eTEP), which are showing promising results, it is suggested to keep the mesh out of the peritoneal cavity where possible to limit contact with the viscera.

Key Question 8: What is the difference in outcome between techniques (open, laparoscopic, and robotic) for incisional hernia repair?

Good Practice Statement A: For patients with a midline incisional hernia, the guidelines panel suggests that laparoscopic, robotic, or open surgery may be appropriate depending on the patient and hernia characteristics and provided the surgeon has appropriate expertise.

The choice of technique for incisional hernia repair is often decided by surgeon preference and expertise. Irrespective of the approach used, the surgeon should be trained in the technique. The technique should be performed in the correct way, with a focus on preservation and restoration of abdominal wall function and careful tissue handling. Furthermore, the decision to operate and the choice of technique should involve the informed consent process and should be a shared decision between the patient and their surgeon.

Mesh infection — management strategies and outcomes after laparoscopic hernia repair include described techniques and observed incidence: successful laparoscopic removal of the infected mesh and placement of a biologic mesh has been described, but long-term outcomes were not reported; numerous retrospective case series have described the successful treatment of mesh infections after laparoscopic hernia repair with open mesh excision; in the largest series of laparoscopic hernia repairs the incidence of mesh infection was less than 1%; one patient was successfully treated with mesh salvage using antibiotics and percutaneous drainage and remained free of hernia recurrence and infection 2 years following treatment; there are no prospective trials specifically evaluating management of infected mesh following laparoscopic incisional hernia repair; decisions to attempt mesh salvage should be based on the incorporation of the mesh and the patient's clinical condition; expert opinion suggests meshes that incorporate with encapsulation are less likely to be successfully treated with conservative measures and typically require removal, and septic patients require immediate removal of the infected prosthetic.

Discussion

Limitations

These updated guidelines summarize the studies of abdominal wall closure in adults undergoing abdominal surgery. The major limitation of this guideline reflects the limited quantity and/or quality of the studies available to answer the KQs. This makes it impossible to formulate strong recommendations for any of the KQs according to the GRADE methodology. The majority of studies reported on the incidence of burst abdomen, SSI, and incisional hernia. Patient-reported outcomes, such as pain, abdominal wall function and cosmesis, were reported rarely. Data were limited or lacking for emergency surgery and surgery in obese patients, and recommendations for these patients could not be made. Although the guidelines group aimed to represent all stakeholders and surgical specialties, it would have benefited from participation of a gynaecological surgeon and physiotherapist. Care was taken to create subgroups without group members who authored a paper relevant to the KQ or with other conflicts of interest. However, all group members use meshes and sutures, and are involved in hernia prevention, which might have influenced appraisal of the evidence and formulation of recommendations. Efforts were made to have active patient participation, but unfortunately not all group meetings had patient representation. A patient representative critically reviewed the guidelines and their valuable comments were included.

Implementation

To aid dissemination and implementation, the guideline will be presented at international and national conferences, and summaries will be written in different languages for national journals. Implementation of standard closure techniques in elective and emergency laparotomies has been described in detail, and shown to reduce the incidence of incisional hernia and burst abdomen. Before implementation of the recommendations, surgeons may need some extra education and/or training in the techniques. Monitoring of this process, complications, and feedback are important. Surgical procedures can be performed in different positions (such as lateral) and on patients in special conditions (for example, pregnancy), which require special considerations when choosing location of incision, approach, and closure techniques. For these reasons, separate papers on the applicability of the guidelines specifically for urological, gynaecological and vascular procedures and patients will be written. Another barrier to implementation of these guidelines may be the added costs of, and time taken, for a surgical procedure, especially in low- and middle-income countries. However, reduction in the incidence of incisional hernia has been proven to reduce healthcare costs, and even the use of prophylactic mesh has been calculated to be more cost-effective than suture closure alone. Given the additional studies identified for this update, it is planned to update these guidelines 5 years after publication using the GRADE methodology.

C. Diagnosis — Guideline 4 states that while most ventral hernias are easily diagnosed based on clinical exam, a preoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound may be considered for select patients with suspected ventral hernias to confirm the diagnosis or to aid the surgeon with preoperative planning (Moderate quality, strong recommendation). Diagnosis is typically made during the history and physical examination, but imaging can detect occult or recurrent hernias and assist planning: in a retrospective review of 146 consecutive LVHR's, 48% of patients had occult defects not detected on preoperative physical exam; in one study, recurrence diagnosis after mesh repair was correct 88% on physical exam versus 98% on CT; and dynamic abdominal sonography for ventral hernia diagnosis demonstrated sensitivity 98% and specificity 88%, with PPV 91% and NPV 97%, identifying hernias in a few more patients than CT. Preoperative CT is also helpful in defining abdominal wall anatomy in non-midline hernias and identifying posterior abdominal wall defects, and it accurately assesses relationships to adjacent structures and defect size to support surgical planning.

SAGES guidelines — mesh use in hiatal hernia repair: Tension on the crural repair, the use and need for a relaxing incision, and the tissue quality of the crura were identified as subgroups that warrant additional consideration when deciding whether to use mesh in hiatal hernia repair. After extensive discussion and debate, the guideline panel decided against making a recommendation because the necessary evidence is simply lacking; although the panel considered conditionally recommending against routine mesh use, the confidence intervals for each outcome are wide such that the truth may range from mesh being quite beneficial to quite harmful, and it is possible there are different morbidity profiles with mesh use. Given these uncertainties, the decision for the use of mesh must continue to be a joint decision between surgeon and patient.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^114dTedU]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Low credibility.

Guidelines are increasingly determining the decision process in day-to-day clinical work. Guidelines describe the current best possible standard in diagnostics and therapy. They should be developed by an international panel of experts, whereby alongside individual experience, above all, the results of comparative studies are decisive. According to the results of high-ranking scientific studies published in peer-reviewed journals, statements and recommendations are formulated, and these are graded strictly according to the criteria of evidence-based medicine. Guidelines can therefore be valuable in helping particularly the young surgeon in his or her day-to-day work to find the best decision for the patient when confronted with a wide and confusing range of options. However, even experienced surgeons benefit because by virtue of a heavy workload and commitment, they often find it difficult to keep up with the ever-increasing published literature. All guidelines require regular updating, usually every 3 years, in line with progress in the field. The current Guidelines focus on technique and perioperative management of laparoscopic ventral hernia repair and constitute the first comprehensive guidelines on this topic. In this issue of Surgical Endoscopy, the first part of the Guidelines is published including sections on basics, indication for surgery, perioperative management, and key points of technique. The next part (Part 2) of the Guidelines will address complications and comparisons between open and laparoscopic techniques. Part 3 will cover mesh technology, hernia prophylaxis, technique-related issues, new technologic developments, lumbar and other unusual hernias, and training/education.

Physical therapy

A recent study assessed the outcomes of a 4-week trimodal prehabilitation programme combining physical therapy, nutritional support, and psychological preparation before major abdominal surgery, including large incisional hernia patients. The study prospectively evaluated 60 patients entering this programme and showed improvement of patients' functional reserves, quality of life, and psychological status.

An RCT assessed the use of preoperative physical therapy before ventral hernia repair (primary and incisional). An initial publication of results reported promising early outcomes in the group who had preoperative physical therapy compared with those who did not, with lower rates of seroma. However, in the follow-up publication, the long-term results did not show any benefit, with similarly high complication rates in both groups. In addition, there was a high conversion rate to emergency surgery whilst undergoing prehabilitation.

A more recent meta-analysis of RCTs that included subjects undergoing abdominal surgery, randomized to prehabilitation programmes or not, found that inspiratory muscle training, aerobic exercise, and/or resistance training can decrease postoperative complications (OR 0.59). Most dramatic was the reduction in pulmonary complications (OR 0.27).

Table 1
Surgical wound classification

The choice of technique repair is based on the contamination of the surgical field, the size of the hernia, and the experience of the surgeon.

In clean-contaminated, contaminated, and dirty surgical procedures, the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic flora closely resemble the normal endogenous microflora of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and are the most frequently observed pathogens. The contaminating pathogens in GI surgery include gram-negative bacilli (e.g. Escherichia coli) and gram-positive microbes, such as enterococci and anaerobic organisms. A classification scheme has been demonstrated in multiple studies to predict the relative probability that a given wound will become infected.

Several studies show clear advantages of mesh use in elective cases, where infection is uncommon. Mesh is easy to use, has low complication rates, and significantly reduces the rate of hernia recurrence. However, few studies have investigated the outcome of mesh use in an emergency setting, where there is often surgical field contamination due to bowel involvement.

The use of biological mesh has many advantages, including a decreased immune response, as well as decreased incidence of fistulae formation, fibrosis, and erosions.

There is, however, a paucity of high-quality evidence on the superiority of biological mesh, and it is still a very expensive device.

The role of local anaesthesia in the treatment of complicated inguinal and femoral hernia needs to be taken into consideration because of its multiple advantages, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities.

A World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Consensus Conference was held in Bergamo in July 2013, during the 2nd Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery with the goal of defining recommendations for emergency repair of abdominal wall hernias in adults. This document represents the executive summary of the consensus conference approved by a WSES expert panel. In 2017, the guidelines have been revised and updated according to the most recent available literature (Appendix).

### Outcomes following repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh [^113KjmP3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Ventral hernias include all hernias arising from a defect in the anterior abdominal wall as epigastric, umbilical, and incisional hernias. Ventral hernias are susceptible for various complications, particularly incarceration and strangulation, that warrant urgent operative intervention which is usually associated with high rates of postoperative recurrence and complications.

The diagnosis of incarceration/strangulation on the verdict of clinical examination alone is not an easy task. Strangulation should be recognized in a timely manner as it warrants immediate surgical intervention. Early operative intervention for strangulated hernia is crucial since any delay in the diagnosis can lead to further compromise of the bowel viability and eventually bowel resection. In addition to the risk of anastomotic leak after bowel resection and anastomosis, strangulation increases the contamination of the operative field which subsequently increases the incidence of postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) and hernia recurrence.

The World Society for Emergency Surgery (WSES) has issued a grade 1A recommendation for the use of synthetic mesh repair in the cases of incarcerated ventral hernia without signs of bowel strangulation or concurrent intestinal resection. On the other hand, owing to the increased likelihood of SSI in the cases of strangulated hernias with concomitant bowel resection, synthetic mesh repair should be used with caution in these circumstances (grade 2C recommendation).

The use of prosthetic mesh in potentially-contaminated and contaminated settings is not frequently described in the literature. Despite the wide variations of data and the conflicting reports, prosthetic materials are not generally recommended for the repair of ventral hernias in contaminated settings. Choi and colleagues used the records of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program of the United States and evaluated the prosthetic repair of strangulated ventral hernia for more than 33,000 patients in clean-contaminated and contaminated settings. The authors reported that clean-contaminated cases had a significantly higher incidence of wound disruption, and superficial, and deep SSIs along with significantly increased odds for complications overall.

Xourafas et al. evaluated the feasibility of using a synthetic mesh in ventral hernia repair with simultaneous bowel resection. The authors found a significantly higher incidence of postoperative SSI in patients treated with prosthetic mesh compared to those treated without mesh (22 vs 5%).

The present study aimed to review the outcomes following the repair of incarcerated and strangulated ventral hernias with or without synthetic mesh in compliance with the established clinical guidelines of WSES in terms of the incidence of SSI and recurrence of hernia postoperatively.

### Prophylactic mesh reinforcement versus primary suture for abdominal wall closure after elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with midline laparotomy incision: updated systematic review including time-to-event meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116F1bba]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair have a high risk of incisional hernia. Heterogeneity in recommendations regarding prophylactic mesh reinforcement between scientific society guidelines reflects the lack of sufficient data, with the Society for Vascular Surgery making no recommendation on methods for abdominal wall closure. We aimed to synthesize the most current evidence on mesh versus primary suture abdominal wall closure after open AAA repair.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing mesh reinforcement with primary abdominal wall closure for patients who underwent elective AAA repair with a midline laparotomy incision. Dichotomous and time-to-event data were pooled using random effects models, applying the Mantel-Haenszel or inverse variance statistical method. The revised Cochrane tool and Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used to assess the risk of bias and certainty of evidence, respectively. Trial sequential analysis assumed alpha = 5% and power = 80%.

Results

Five RCTs were included reporting a total of 487 patients (260 in the mesh group and 227 in the primary suture group). Patients who had mesh closure had statistically significantly lower odds of developing incisional hernia after open AAA repair than those with primary suture closure (odds ratio (OR) 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09–0.43). Time-to-event analysis confirmed that the hazard of incisional hernia was statistically significantly lower in patients who had mesh closure (P < 0.05). Meta-analysis found statistically significantly lower odds of reoperation for incisional hernia in the mesh group (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06–0.93), but there was no statistically significant difference in wound infection (risk difference 0.02, 95% CI -0.03–0.08). The overall risk of bias was low in one study, high in 2 studies, "some concerns" in 2 studies for incisional hernia and reoperation for incisional hernia, and high in all studies reporting wound infection. The certainty of evidence was judged to be low for all outcomes. Trial sequential analysis confirmed a benefit of mesh reinforcement in reducing the risk of incisional hernia.

Conclusions

Meta-analysis of the highest-level data demonstrated a benefit of prophylactic mesh reinforcement, with trial sequential analysis confirming no additional RCTs required. This provides compelling evidence to support the use of mesh for midline laparotomy closure in patients undergoing open AAA repair.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^115heMbT]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

External appraisal

The guideline was appraised externally by four surgeons (reviewers 1–4) and a member of the AGREE Collaboration (reviewer 5) not involved in guideline development with the AGREE II instrument. The assessment of the guideline per domain by the reviewers can be found in Fig. S2. The overall rating of the quality of the guideline was good (87 per cent) and all would recommend this guideline for use. AGREE II considers a guideline high quality if it has a score over 70 per cent. Of these six domains, five scored over 70 per cent (72–89 per cent); the domain of applicability scored below this threshold (43 per cent). The reviewers were missing practical advice to help surgeons implement these guidelines into their practice, possible barriers and the costs of adding time to a procedure when implementing recommendations, and the costs and availability of prophylactic mesh augmentation of the abdominal wall. These considerations were used to add a paragraph on implementation to the discussion section. Furthermore, after the AGREE II appraisal, the methodology section was improved by explaining in more detail how the GRADE methodology was used during the guideline process and recommendations were formulated.

### A systematic review and independent patient data meta-analysis of prophylactic mesh augmentation for incisional hernia prevention after abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery (I-PREVENT-AAA) A collaborative European hernia society project [^115Jijdd]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To analyze the effectiveness of prophylactic mesh augmentation (PMA) of the abdominal wall following open aortic aneurysm repair as compared to primary sutured closure in preventing incisional hernia (IH) formation by performing an individual patient-data meta-analysis (IPDMA).

Summary Background Data

IH is a prevalent complication after abdominal surgery, especially in high-risk groups. PMA of the abdominal wall has been studied as a preventive measure for IH-formation, but strong recommendations are lacking.

Methods

A systematic literature search was conducted till 23 September 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared PMA with PS after open AAA surgery. Lead authors of eligible studies were asked to share individual patient-data. A one-stage analysis was performed, and Cox-regression analyses were used to assess time-to-event outcomes.

Results

Five randomized trials with a total of 493 patients were included. Intention to treat analysis revealed that PMA was associated with significantly lower risk of IH (hazard ratio of 0.25 (95% CI 0.12–0.50)) as compared to PS closure. Three-year incisional hernia rates were 13.2% and 39.6%, respectively, with a number needed to treat of 3.7. The effect was similar for onlay and retro-rectus PMA. PMA resulted in longer operative time (mean 27 minutes) and more seroma formation (especially onlay PMA) but did not increase the risk of surgical site infection.

Conclusions

PMA after elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery is proven to be an effective measure to reduce IH formation and should be considered in future guidelines as standard of care.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^113gfRpf]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair is a common problem and feared complication. Up to 16% of people experience chronic pain following the repair of a groin hernia. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of treatment strategies for patients with chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair based on best practice guidelines and current clinical routines. The optimal management of chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery should begin with a thorough clinical examination to rule out other causes of chronic pain and to rule out a recurrence. A scaled approach to treatment is recommended. Initially, watchful waiting can be tried if it can be tolerated by the patient and then systemic painkillers, escalating to blocks, and surgery as the final option. Surgery should include mesh removal and triple neurectomy following anterior approaches or mesh and tack removal following a posterior approach. The diagnosis and treatment strategies should be performed by or discussed with experts in the field.

### Update of guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS))-part a… [^111Yy8CY]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

The SIMBIOSE trial [7] is an ongoing phase III RCT comparing the use of biological mesh versus traditional wound care in patients with VIHs. The hypothesis is that the use of a biological mesh will reduce abdominal morbidity, compared to standard wound care without biological mesh. The primary end point is 6-month infectious and/or wound morbidity. The study will continue to collect 3 years of follow-up, which would be the longest follow-up available in studies of biological meshes in the case the authors are successful. Between 2012 and 2018, there were several systematic literature reviews [8–12] examining the use of biologic mesh in contaminated ventral/incisional hernia repairs. Primus and Harris [9] concluded that the cumulative data regarding biologic mesh use in VHRs under contaminated conditions do not support the claim that it is better than synthetic mesh used under the same conditions. Similar to Primus and Harris, Lee et al. [10] stated that the available evidence is limited, but does not support the superiority of biologic over synthetic non-absorbable prosthetics in contaminated fields. Atema et al. [11] found that biologic mesh repair of contaminated defects showed considerable higher rates of surgical site complications and a hernia recurrence rate of 30%. The authors conclude that this review highlights the need for consensus on the role of biologic mesh in abdominal wall. Reports on repairs in clean and clean-contaminated hernias have muddled this debate, as an indication for biologic material in clean hernias is lacking. Although randomized trials are perhaps difficult to conduct, prospective studies or large registries are needed, using uniform definitions and criteria to describe patients, hernia, and surgical characteristics [11].

Statements

Recommendations

Introduction

The incidence of incisional hernias has been reported between 5 and 20%, causing it to be the most common surgical complication after laparotomies [45–49]. With this burden of disease for patients with complications after surgical repair, the increasing risk for recurrence [50], and the economic consequences, the need for studies dealing with risk-reduction strategies is obvious. For parastomal hernias, defined as an "incisional hernia related to an abdominal wall stoma" [51], the incidence is up to 48% or greater. Besides the technical aspects of wound closure and stoma formation, the use of biological and synthetic meshes for prophylaxis of incisional and parastomal hernia has been the subject of several studies.

Historically, innovation in hernia care has largely been represented by reactive strategies to treat IH, including advances in surgical mesh technology and pioneering operative techniques. Despite the scope of IH and modest results of reactive treatment strategies, approaches to this complex, multifactorial process have not evolved with the general zeitgeist of preventative medical care. Proactive strategies to prevent hernia are generally void from the surgical literature. Developing such an approach requires the ability to reliably and accurately identify high-risk patients, so that evidence-based risk reduction strategies can be implemented.

Hernia significantly impairs quality of lifeand is associated with a substantial cost burden for society, which collectively speak to the significant need for effective preventative strategies. Furthermore, failure of initial herniorrhaphy inevitably increases the operative complexity of subsequent attempts at repair, perpetuating the inability to restore domain and abdominal wall integrity. The incentive to explore proactive strategies cannot be overemphasized as hernia repair outcomes remain suboptimal despite the aforementioned advances. As the health care landscape evolves and reimbursement structures change, identification of high-risk patients and preventative surgical techniques to mitigate risk will undoubtedly become more central to surgical care. Implementing a preventative approach to management will reduce operative morbidity and the exorbitant cost of complications following abdominal surgery. Furthermore, the addition of reliable and simple risk models can augment preoperative counseling and enhance the surgical decision-making process.

As with many other common morbidities (eg, diabetes, hypertension), primary prevention affords a promising and, perhaps, more cost-effective strategy. – Therefore, the aims of this current study are to perform an institutional review of patients within a large, academic health system undergoing open, intra-abdominal surgery in an elective setting to quantify the incidence of surgically treated IH, develop a clinically actionable risk stratification scheme, and to characterize health care cost and resource utilization.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^115Rm8Kr]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Incisional hernias are frequent complications of abdominal wall incisions. A meta-analysisincluding over 14 000 patients reported a weighted incidence of 12.8 per cent 2 years after a midline incision, and that one-third of patients with an incisional hernia undergo surgical repair. Recurrence rates after repair of incisional hernia range between 23 and 50 per cent, with increasing rates of complications and re-recurrence after each subsequent failed repair. A reduction in incidence of incisional hernia by 5 per cent was calculated to result in a cost saving of €4 million per year in France. Prevention of incisional hernia is therefore important.

Patient factors contribute to the risk of developing an incisional hernia, including obesity, age, smoking, aneurysmal disease, and wound infections. Location of the incision, suture material used, and closure technique are also well known risk factors. In 2015, the European Hernia Society (EHS)published guidelines on closure of abdominal wall incisions. Since then, several knowledge gaps, as identified by the guidelines committee, have been addressed in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This warranted an update of the EHS guidelines, which was performed in collaboration with the American Hernia Society (AHS).

The objective of this paper was to provide an up-to-date guideline on abdominal wall incisions in adults with the aim of reducing the incidence of incisional hernia. Secondary objectives were to provide recommendations on the prevention of burst abdomen, surgical-site occurrences (SSOs, including wound infection, wound necrosis, wound dehiscence, haematoma, and seroma), and postoperative pain, and improvement in abdominal wall function and cosmesis in patients undergoing abdominal surgery.

New statement

New recommendation:

Introduction

What once was considered a relatively simple problem by many physicians and patients, abdominal wall hernia disease, is clearly more complex than previously thought. In addition, the patient groups presenting with incisional and ventral hernias are becoming more complex as the treatment options, including the varieties of mesh, continue to grow. This increasing complexity as well as the variability of outcomes leads us to challenge the traditional application of evidence-based medicine, which until now does not include knowledge generated from clinical quality improvement studies. This is not to say that this understanding of evidence-based medicine does not have value for complex problems, such as abdominal wall hernia disease. It is, however incomplete, and is but a starting point rather than a goal toward the understanding of how to improve the value of care for both the patient who presents with a ventral/incisional hernia and for the system in which that care is provided. In the previously published chapter (see above), the current evidence for the variability of ventral/incisional hernia patients was described and a brief framework for understanding how to apply new thinking to the study of complex problems such as ventral/incisional hernia disease is provided.

### Enhanced recovery pathway for complex abdominal wall reconstruction [^112iwXKg]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Ventral hernia repair with abdominal wall reconstruction can be a challenging endeavor, as patients commonly present not only with complex and recurrent hernias but also often with comorbidities that increase the risk of postoperative complications including wound morbidity and hernia recurrence, among other risks. By optimizing patient comorbidities in the preoperative setting and managing postoperative care in a regimented fashion, enhanced recovery after surgery pathways allow for a systematic approach to reduce complications and speed up recovery following ventral hernia repair.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^113xmet6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic versus open repair — Guideline 1 states that laparoscopic ventral hernia repair has a lower rate of wound infections compared to open repair, recurrence rates and post-operative pain are similar between the two techniques during mid-term follow up, and the advantages offered by LVHR over open hernia repair in terms of decreased wound complication rates should be taken into consideration by surgeons and disclosed to patients when they counsel them about surgical options (High quality evidence, Strong recommendation). Four meta-analyses, including a Cochrane systematic review, concluded there was no difference in recurrence rates or postoperative pain between techniques but significantly fewer wound infections after laparoscopic hernia repair. Since this level I evidence, 3 more randomized controlled trials have been published with congruent findings: fewer surgical-site infections after laparoscopic repair and similar recurrence rates. Regarding postoperative complications, one RCT found lower rates after laparoscopic repair, one after open repair, and one no difference. Postoperative pain was less a year after laparoscopic repair in one study but similar in another, which noted better physical functioning after laparoscopic repair. One RCT demonstrated a 5-day quicker return to work after laparoscopic repair. The largest prospective but not randomized study to date (n = 710) showed a decrease in quality of life at 1 month after laparoscopic repair but no difference beyond 6 months.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^114e8w1h]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Groin hernia repairs and pain

For the initial repair of groin hernia, recommendations include use of a mesh. Dedicated centers have shown good results with nonmesh-based techniques, but the overall recommendation for routine care includes use of a mesh. Globally, the most used types of mesh-based repairs are the Lichtenstein open repair and one of the variations of the laparoscopic repair. The Lichtenstein repair is known to cause discomfort and disabling pain in some patients. The laparoscopic techniques seem to lower the risk of chronic pain but still cause chronic pain in some people.

Several potential causes of pain have been investigated for these repair methods. The role of the meshes has been investigated, and the weight of the mesh (g/m²) has been hypothesized to influence the risk of pain. Heavyweight meshes have been compared with lightweight meshes but demonstrated no advantages for laparoscopic repairs. However, the lightweight meshes seem to lower the risk of chronic pain following the Lichtenstein repair technique. Besides meshes, the choice of fixation method for the mesh can influence the risk of pain. Glue has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of chronic pain in open mesh-based repairs, but the advantage of glue could not be found in a recent nationwide study of the laparoscopic repair.

When operating inguinal hernias, there is a risk of causing injuries that will cause pain. If there is injury to tissue, it can cause nociceptive pain, and damage to nerves can cause neuropathic pain. In order to prevent or minimize the risks of pain, surgeons always take care when performing repairs and handle tissue gently. Peroperatively, the role of identification and/or resection of nerves has been investigated in order to minimize the occurrence of chronic pain. The nerves can be in the way when placing the mesh, can be caught or injured during fixation, and can be injured by accident or by dissection in the operative field. It is recommended, in the recently published World Guidelines for inguinal hernia repair, to identify the nerves but not to do a planned resection; however, if the nerves are in the way when placing the mesh, a "pragmatic resection" is recommended.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^113MMxYE]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) guideline — preamble, scope, and methodology — states that the goals of ventral hernia repair are relief of patient symptoms and/or cure with minimization of recurrence rates, and the document assists surgeons utilizing a laparoscopic approach in patient selection, operative technique, and postoperative care; it is not intended to debate merits of prosthetic use and specific prosthetic types. The disclaimer notes that guidelines indicate preferable approaches and recommendations are based on existing data or a consensus of expert opinion when little or no data are available; guidelines are intended to be flexible, and the surgeon must always choose the course best suited to the individual patient. Development occurred under the auspices of the Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) with systematic research, review, and multidisciplinary input; the guideline was available for public comment for a period of 1 month prior to finalization, recommendations are considered valid at the time of production based on available data, and guidelines are scheduled for periodic review. Methods included a systematic MEDLINE search performed in March 2009 and updated in October 2012 using the terms "Hernia, Ventral/su [Surgery] + Laparoscopy + English + Human"; abstracts were reviewed by SAGES working group members, and duplicates, letters to the editor, articles not involving ventral, incisional or Spigelian hernias without direct correlation, and studies comparing different mesh types were not included.

A variety of factors also can be seen as having an impact on the postoperative course of patients undergoing ventral/incisional hernia repair. Studies evaluating factors related to the need for mesh removal showed that postoperative complications, recurrence rates, surgical-site infection (SSI), resource use, patient demographics (e.g. male sex, history of smoking), hernia characteristics (e.g. size of defect, incarceration), and technique factors (e.g. laparoscopic, open) all had the potential to contribute to outcome differences [20–24].

Another complex variable that can have a potential impact on outcomes of ventral/incisional hernia repair is the choice of mesh material. Although most synthetic meshes used currently produce good short-term results, any mesh could contribute to complications in a given subgroup of patients. A partial list of mesh-related complications includes infection requiring mesh removal, mesh mechanical failure, mesh bulging, chronic pain, chronic inflammatory reaction, and mesh erosion into abdominal viscera [25, 26]. With the number and variety of hernia meshes available for ventral/incisional hernia repair, this variable alone is sufficient to demonstrate that traditional research mechanisms (i.e. prospective RCTs) are inadequate to determine the mesh or meshes that have the best value for various patient groups, hernia types, techniques, surgeon skill levels, and so forth.

With an understanding of complexity science, complex systems, continuous learning, and continuous clinical quality improvement, we can begin to understand and improve value for patients who present with a ventral/incisional hernia. The starting point for this endeavor is the best current available evidence, much of which is contained in the remaining chapters of this document.

Surgical repair of primary umbilical and epigastric hernias are among the most common abdominal operations in the world. The hernia defects range from small (< 1 cm) to large and complex even in the absence of prior incision or repair. Mesh has generally been shown to decrease recurrence rates, and its use and location of placement should be individualized for each patient. Open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches provide unique considerations for the technical aspects of primary repair with or without mesh augmentation.

Discussion

This review aimed to provide an overview of possible strategies for the treatment of chronic pain after inguinal hernia surgery. At the moment, there is not a single treatment or management strategy that will be appropriate for all patients. Experts and expert-based guidelines recommend to use a scaled intervention, meaning that the patient should start out with watchful waiting, especially in the first 6 months, and then, systemic pain killers and if that cannot relieve the pain, injections should be tried; surgical treatment should be considered as the final option. It is also recommended to always consult a surgeon or, preferably, a regional or a national center with the expertise in chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery since causes and treatments vary from patient to patient and because one strategy might not fit all.

Several guidelines exist in this area; however, they are mostly based on expert opinions and personal experience and less on solid high-quality evidence. A regional, national, or maybe even international setup should be in place in order to deal with the most severe and complex cases. This allows for gathering of expertise and ensures that patients are uniformly treated and receive the best standard of care for this condition. An international collaboration could be beneficial in order to share knowledge and collect data for development of treatments. It is likely that the individual surgeon does not see their own patients with chronic pain if the patients go to a different surgeon or institution. Thus, just for reoperation for recurrence, up to 25% of patients go to a different hospital than for the primary repair.

In general, there is a high need for evidence regarding chronic postsurgical pain management, not only for pain following inguinal hernia surgery but also for pain following many different kinds of surgery. The treatment of chronic postoperative pain is difficult, and a simple treatment that works well for all has not been found. Therefore, individualized management is becoming more important, and the optimal management is what every surgeon or doctor treating these patients should aim for.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^116Kfkwx]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) — perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis: A single dose first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) should be given preoperatively for LVHR. Vancomycin should be added in patients colonized with MRSA. Vancomycin or Clindamycin should be given to patients allergic to cephalosporins. (Moderate quality, Strong recommendation). The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Surgical Infection Society, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America recommend that a single dose of a first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin) be administered within 60 minutes prior to incisional hernia repair with a prosthetic, and for patients known to be colonized with MRSA, a single preoperative dose of vancomycin should be added and administered within 120 minutes prior to surgery. Even though these guidelines were developed from the evidence included in the inguinal hernia literature, they also apply to incisional hernias, where the risk for infection seems to be higher than in inguinal hernias. The most common microorganisms isolated from surgical-site infections after hernia repair are aerobic gram-positive organisms and include aerobic streptococcus, Staphylococcus species, and Enterococcus species, and MRSA is commonly found in prosthetic mesh infections.

Definitions and types of pain

Chronic (postoperative) pain has been defined as pain lasting at least 2–3 months (after surgery), but modifications are proposed to this timeframe. A group of experts in hernia surgery and chronic pain has suggested modifying the definition for chronic pain after hernia repair as pain lasting at least 6 months after operation. The reason for this extended period of time is because the inflammation around the mesh is still ongoing after 3 months, and there is a chance that some patients will improve substantially from 3 to 6 months postoperatively.

Evidence for Good Practice Statement B

No RCTs comparing open fixation met the inclusion criteria for these guidelines. Expert opinion was generated using the GRADE expert evidence forms, but opinion was divided, with one-third favouring transfascial sutures and two-thirds against their use due to pain.

Two small cohort trials (26 and 50) respectively and one larger cohort trial (244) assessed the use of self-fixing meshes compared with fixation with transfascial sutures. The two small studies suggested that the self-fixing mesh resulted in less inpatient narcotic analgesia use, and reduced early postoperative pain. However, the larger study reported increased seroma, wound events, and reoperation rates in the self-gripping mesh group.

Key Question 11: What is the benefit of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) in incisional hernia repair?

Good Practice Statement A: For patients having repair of a midline incisional hernia, the guidelines panel suggests that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend enhanced recovery protocols.

ERAS is gaining more and more acceptance in different fields of surgery. The benefit of ERAS in incisional hernia repair in the authors' target group of patients with hernias up to 10 cm in width is unclear.

### Management of chronic pain after hernia repair [^112whGkG]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The optimal management of chronic pain following inguinal hernia surgery should begin with a thorough clinical examination to rule out other causes of chronic pain and to rule out a recurrence. If other causes of chronic groin pain have been excluded and the groin pain is caused by the inguinal hernia repair, a scaled approach is recommended. Initially, watchful waiting can be tried if it can be tolerated by the patient and then systemic pain killers, escalating to blocks, and surgery as the final option. Surgery should include mesh removal and triple neurectomy following anterior approaches or mesh and tack removal following a posterior approach. These procedures should be performed by experts in the field. There is a need for new developments and evidence-based guidelines, and this will require centralization of treatment in order to gather the necessary data to support future best practice guidelines.

### Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair with self-fixated meshes: a randomized controlled trial [^111ZGWGD]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Hernia in the inguinal area is fairly common; approximately 27% of males and 3% of females develop a groin hernia during their lifetime. Hernia treatment mainly involves surgery, with more than 20 million procedures performed annually. Multiple treatment options exist for inguinal hernia surgery, including open or laparoscopic techniques. According to guidelines, usage of mesh is recommended both in open and laparoscopic procedures as it reduces hernia recurrences. However, mesh is associated with both acute and chronic post-operative pain.

Laparoscopic techniques include transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP) and total extraperitoneal repair (TEP). In TAPP, the procedure is performed through the abdominal cavity, while in TEP the preperitoneal space is entered directly. Both TAPP and TEP have good results with low complication and recurrence rates and rapid recovery after surgery. Guidelines recommend both techniques for laparoscopic hernia surgery. Both techniques have comparable results regarding chronic pain and quality of life after surgery. In laparoscopic procedures, mesh is placed in the preperitoneal space to cover the myopectineal orifice and posterior part of the inguinal area. The mesh can be fixated by tacks, glue or sutures. Alternatively, the mesh is not fixated at all or a self-fixating mesh can be used. Studies recommend avoiding tacks, as they appear to cause more post-operative pain than glue or non-fixation.

### Mesh reinforcement for the prevention of incisional hernia formation: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115Cqnri]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

European Hernia Society guidelines suggested that the evidence of mesh augmentation for the prevention of incisional hernia (IH) was weak. In addition, previous systematic reviews seldom focused on quality of life and cost-effectiveness related to mesh placement. Therefore, an updated meta-analysis was performed to clarify quality of life, cost-effectiveness, the safety, and effectiveness of mesh reinforcement in preventing the incidence of IH.

Methods

Embase, Pubmed, and the Cochrane library were searched from the inception to May 2016 without language limitation for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which explored mesh reinforcement for the prevention of IH in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries.

Results

Twelve RCTs totaling 1661 patients (958 in mesh, 703 in nonmesh) were included in our study. Compared with nonmesh, mesh reinforcement can effectively decrease the incidence of IH (relative risk: 0.19; 95% CI: 0.09–0.42). Besides, mesh placement was associated with improved quality of life, a higher rate of seroma (relative risk: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.13–2.37), and longer operating time (mean difference: 17.62; 95% CI: 1.44–33.80). No difference can be found between both groups in postoperative overall morbidity, systemic postoperative morbidity, wound-related morbidity, surgical site infection, hematoma, wound disruption, postoperative mortality, and length of hospital stay.

Conclusions

Prophylactic mesh reinforcement may be effective and safe to prevent the formation of IH after abdominal surgery, without impairing quality of life. Thus, preventive mesh should be routinely recommended in high-risk patients.

Guideline 27 — recognized intraoperative enterotomy during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair management states: "The laparoscopic repair of a hernia with a permanent synthetic mesh immediately following an enterotomy should be carefully considered in light of a paucity of evidence and the potential for infectious complications". "A tailored approach may include open or laparoscopic techniques, and should be based upon operative findings, degree of contamination, surgeon experience, and patient interests", and "The possibility of enterotomy and management options should be discussed with the patient preoperatively. (low quality, weak recommendation)". Additional context notes that "The incidence of enterotomy in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is reported to occur in up to 6% of patients, with injuries to the small intestine occurring much more commonly than injuries to the colon", and injuries may be managed under "two main categories: 1) enterotomy repair with hernia repair (lap or open; with or without permanent mesh), and 2) enterotomy repair with delayed hernia repair (lap or open; short or long delay; permanent mesh)", where delayed repair is "within the first week, or after 6–8 weeks postoperatively, respectively". Outcomes reported include that "Successful outcomes have been reported following enterotomy repair and concomitant implantation of a permanent synthetic mesh", and that primary closure of the hernia defect after visceral injury repair "will obviously eliminate the risk for mesh-related complications but carries a high risk for hernia recurrence".

### ECLAPTE: effective closure of LAParoTomy in emergency-2023 World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines for the closure of laparotomy in emergency settings [^115C7RXg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The current evidence on the efficacy of prophylactic mesh augmentation is overwhelming. Data highlight a significant reduction in the incisional hernia rate in elective settings, and trends suggest a significantly lower rate of incisional hernia in emergency laparotomies. Prophylactic mesh augmentation after midline incision significantly impacts incisional hernia and does not predict an increased risk of postoperative complications. However, a systematic review on the use of mesh in emergency surgery included only two small RCTs. The evidence does not suggest that the wound failure is lower in the mesh group. Other observational studies are likely biased, and data must be regarded carefully, specifically about SSI rates. A large number of surgeons are still concerned about mesh reinforcement in cases of contaminated surgery.

Recent meta-analyses confirm robust evidence supporting the role of mesh as prophylactic augmentation in the closure of the abdominal wall after laparotomy: incisional hernia rate decreased significantly, but on the other hand, an increased trend in wound complications was identified. Consequently, we decided to downgrade our recommendation to a suggestion.

Anyhow, in the closure of midline laparotomy incisions in an emergency setting– specifically in the case of high-risk patients for fascial dehiscence — prophylactic mesh augmentation appears to be effective in preventing incisional hernia and safe for postoperative hospitalization.

5.2 Which type of patients should be considered for prophylactic mesh augmentation?

We suggest considering prophylactic mesh augmentation, particularly in patients with an increased risk of incisional hernia development (2B).

Risk factors for postoperative hernia development are already reported in the introduction section of this paper.

5.3 Which type of mesh, which mesh position, and which type of mesh fixation should be considered for prophylactic mesh augmentation?

In light of current evidence, for prophylactic mesh augmentation no specific type of mesh can be recommended.

### Medical effectiveness and safety of conventional compared to laparoscopic incisional hernia repair: a systematic review [^114mMjw1]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Incisional hernias are a common complication following abdominal surgery and represent about 80% of all ventral hernia. In uncomplicated postoperative follow-up they develop in about 11% of cases and in up to 23% of cases with wound infections or other forms of wound complications. While conventional mesh repair has been the standard of care in the past, the use of laparoscopic surgery is increasing. It therefore remains uncertain which technique should be recommended as the standard of care.

Objectives

To compare the medical effectiveness and safety of conventional mesh and laparoscopic incisional hernia repair.

Methods

A structured literature search of databases accessed through the German Institute of Medical Documentation and Information (DIMDI) was conducted. English and German literature published until August 2005 was included and their methodological quality assessed.

Results

The search identified 17 relevant publications and included 15 studies for final assessment. Among those were one meta-analysis, one randomized clinical trial (RCT), and 13 cohort studies. All studies suffered from significant methodological limitations, such as differences in baseline characteristics between treatment groups, small case numbers, and the lack of adjustment for relevant confounders. Overall, medical effectiveness and safety were similar for both surgical approaches. However, there was a trend towards lower recurrence rates, length of hospital stay, and postoperative pain as well as decreased complication rates for the laparoscopic repair in the majority of studies. The impact of the technique of mesh implantation and mesh fixation as well as the impact of certain patient-related factors was not systematically assessed in any of the studies.

Conclusion

No conclusive differences could be identified between the operative techniques. There was, however, some evidence for a trend towards similar or slightly improved outcomes associated with the laparoscopic procedure. There remains an urgent need for high-quality prospective studies to evaluate this question conclusively.

### Recurrence rate and mesh bulging are reduced with primary fascial closure in ventral hernia repair: the PROSECO randomized clinical trial [^116cn6Yu]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventral hernia repair is a frequently performed surgical procedure; however, the optimal surgical technique is still a matter of debate. High-quality data on key outcome variables are limited for both primary and incisional hernia repair. Minimally invasive techniques have been shown to reduce surgical site complications compared with open surgery, although no differences in outcomes such as recurrence, pain, reoperation, and mortality rate have been observed.

The IPOM technique (laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh repair) was introduced in the 1990s as a bridging repair, in which the mesh overlaps the hernia defect with no attempt at closure. One drawback of this approach is that it does not restore the integrity or function of the abdominal wall. In the repair of midline hernia defects with fascial closure, approximation of the rectus muscles restores the continuity of the abdominal wall muscle layer and potentially improves abdominal wall function. Laparoscopic IPOM without closure of the hernia defect has been reported to result in only modest improvements in functional outcomes and patient satisfaction post-suregery. In addition, mesh bulging, defined as pseudo-herniation of the mesh into the defect, and seroma formation are common complications of the bridging technique.

Guidelines from the European Hernia Society, American Hernia Society, and the International Endo-Hernia Society recommend fascial closure prior to mesh placement. This was based on two systematic reviews, including observational studies that have shown lower rates of recurrence and seroma. Several randomized trials have been conducted in recent years. Bernardi et al. performed a study on 129 patients with quality-of-life as the primary outcome, showing this to be higher after fascial closure. However, no differences in rates of surgical site complications, recurrence, or mesh bulging were reported. In a meta-analysis based on pooled data from three studies, no difference was observed between fascial closure and non-closure with respect to rates of recurrence, seroma formation, mesh bulging, or severe adverse events. However, none of the studies in the meta-analysis had the power to detect clinically relevant differences.

This study aimed to evaluate whether fascial closure prior to mesh placement reduces hernia site complications 1 year after IPOM.

Laparoscopic hernia repair — postoperative fever and perioperative antibiotics are characterized as follows: fever of unknown origin after laparoscopic ventral hernia has been reported in 5–60% of patients, all of whom responded to antibiotics without sequelae; prophylactic antibiotics are administered prior to laparoscopic hernia repair to reduce the risk of wound and mesh infections; a single retrospective study demonstrated a reduction in abdominal wall cellulitis overlying the postoperative seroma in patients who were administered postoperative antibiotics for seven days following laparoscopic hernia repair, and there was no difference in mesh infections between those receiving preoperative antibiotics and those receiving a longer duration of antibiotics.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery, mesh repair, HSG 2023 guidelines recommend to use a heavyweight mesh for laparoendoscopic repair, especially in a large and direct hernia, to reduce the risk of recurrence. Do not use lightweight mesh, as it does not reduce the risk of postoperative pain but increases the risk of recurrence.

Recognize that there is no increased risk of surgical site infection. Insufficient evidence regarding burst abdomen and postoperative pain. Insufficient evidence regarding mesh augmentation versus primary suture closure of non-midline abdominal incisions.

### What are the influencing factors for chronic pain following TAPP inguinal hernia repair: an analysis of 20, 004 patients from the herniamed registry [^114FYjd6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2018). Low credibility.

After mesh-based inguinal hernia repair 10–12% of patients experience at least a level of moderate pain that impacts daily activities. Chronic pain is defined as any pain reported by the patient at or beyond 3 months postoperatively. More than one-quarter of these patients (2–4%) have moderate to severe pain. Risk factors for chronic postoperative inguinal pain include young age, female gender, high preoperative pain, early high postoperative pain, recurrent hernia, and open hernia repair.

In all statements in the guidelines of the international hernia societies, laparo-endoscopic techniques are associated with less chronic pain than the Lichtenstein repair. However, after laparo-endoscopic inguinal hernia repair, 2–5% of patients may still suffer from persistent pain influencing everyday activities, and about 0.4% are referred to pain clinics.

On the basis of three meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials mesh fixation in total extraperitoneal patch plasty (TEP) can only be recommended in large medial/direct (EHS MIII) hernias.

In the Guidelines of the International Endohernia Society, a recommendation is given for consideration of non-fixation of the mesh in transabdominal preperitoneal patch plasty (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair in types LI, II and MI, II (EHS classification). For TAPP repair of larger defects (LIII, MIII), the mesh should be fixed. In TAPP inguinal hernia repair, mesh fixation is still used in 66.1% of all primary unilateral cases in men.

Considering the fact that five meta-analyses compared non-penetrating vs. mechanical mesh fixation, high-quality evidence could be expected. However, the meta-analyses can only conclude that the evidence is mostly of low or moderate quality, or that more high-quality multicenter studies are needed. In view of the guidelines, fibrin glue should be considered for fixation to minimize the risk of postoperative acute and chronic pain.

In a nationwide registry-based study, no differences were found in the frequency of recurrence and chronic pain between permanent and no/non-permanent fixation of the mesh in endoscopic inguinal hernia repair.

Another registry-based study from the Danish Hernia Database also found no difference in chronic pain after mesh fixation with fibrin glue vs. tacks in TAPP inguinal hernia repair.

The following analysis of data from the Herniamed Registry now investigates the influencing factors for chronic pain in male patients after primary, unilateral inguinal hernia repair in TAPP technique.

### European hernia society guidelines on management of rectus diastasis [^112NaKxs]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

KQ8 What is the optimal treatment of rectus diastasis with concomitant umbilical or epigastric hernias?

Statement: Mesh-based repair is recommended according to the European Hernia Society and Americas Hernia Society Guidelines for Treatment of Umbilical and Epigastric Hernias. Plication of the anterior rectus sheath may be sufficient to repair the smallest (less than 1 cm) umbilical or epigastric hernias. Other approaches have been reported. The endoscopic subcutaneous dissection followed by linea alba plication with an onlay mesh was the most reported technique.

Recommendation: A mesh-based repair of RD with concomitant midline hernias is suggested. Plication of the linea alba may be sufficient to repair a diastasis associated with small (less than 1 cm) umbilical/epigastric hernias.

Quality of evidence: Low

Strength of recommendation: Weak

KQ9 Is there a role for specific postoperative management of RD repair?

Statement: Abdominal binders appear to aid mobilization, and reduce postoperative pain and psychological stress. They have no effect on seroma formation or pulmonary function. No specific postoperative rehabilitation programme is used worldwide.

Recommendation: As a clinical expertise guidance, the use of an abdominal binder in the postoperative period can be suggested. The noted advantages of reduced pain, enhanced mobilization, and their perceived psychological support after surgery, make their contribution modest but of value. No specific postoperative rehabilitation programme can be recommended.

Quality of evidence: Very low

Strength of recommendation: Weak

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for ostomy surgery [^112RjhKJ]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Parastomal hernia (PSH) repair — mesh use and outcomes: Primary suture repair was associated with a 69.4% risk of recurrent hernia, while contemporary series report high mesh utilization and defined complication rates with permanent synthetic mesh. In the American Hernia Society Quality Collaborative, 94% of PSH repairs used mesh and only 21% were performed using a minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approach; a Finnish multicenter cohort reported mesh use in 90% of 235 repairs. A meta-analysis of 469 elective mesh PSH repairs found an overall postoperative morbidity rate of 24.9%, with surgical site infection in 3.8% (95% CI, 2.3–5.7), mesh infection in 1.7% (95% CI, 0.7–3.1), and obstruction requiring reoperation in 1.7% (95% CI, 0.7–3.0). Evidence on biologic mesh is limited; a systematic review of 57 repairs reported recurrent hernias in 15.7% and wound-related complications in 26.2%, and a 58‑patient series reported a recurrence rate of 18% at a median of 3.8 years; overall, biologic mesh should not be considered a superior alternative to synthetic mesh for elective PSH repair.

### Updated guideline for closure of abdominal wall incisions from the European and American hernia societies [^111v5bXd]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Knowledge gaps

The guideline group discussed the knowledge gaps and proposed some research areas that could improve the evidence for several KQs. The lack of patient-reported outcomes, such as incision pain, abdominal wall function and cosmesis, was acknowledged and these should be included in future studies. Of particular interest will be investigating the effect of different size and location of abdominal wall incisions on cosmesis and abdominal wall function. For this guideline, evidence was also searched for patients with an increased risk of complications, such as those undergoing emergency surgery, obese patients, and immunocompromised individuals. Unfortunately, studies in these groups were lacking. Furthermore, most studies comparing minimally invasive and open approaches did not have sufficient power, or adequate method or duration of follow-up, to evaluate abdominal wall complications such as incisional hernia. With the rise in robotically assisted minimally invasive procedures, studies comparing these procedures with conventional laparoscopy will be of interest. The force on the abdominal wall from the robotic system might influence postoperative outcomes such as pain and trocar-site hernia formation. Disappointingly, most trials have provided insufficient information on suturing technique or the suture length to wound length ratio. Although several high-quality RCTs of prophylactic mesh augmentation have been conducted, none of these compared prophylactic mesh augmentation with primary closure using the small-bites technique. Data on slowly absorbable meshes for prophylactic mesh augmentation were not lacking.

### Midline incisional hernia guidelines: the European hernia society [^113CHb6N]. The British Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Key messages

The quantity and quality of evidence available to formulate the recommendations was limited; nevertheless, some key messages have been generated from the guidelines that, if followed, the guidelines panel believes will help improve outcomes in incisional hernia surgery. The main recommendations and good practice statements were that patients should undergo cross-sectional imaging before surgery to better understand the anatomy and appropriately plan the procedure. Surgeons and patients should understand that the main aim in treating incisional hernias is to improve the quality of life; this should help guide discussion of the benefits and risks of various treatment options to ensure patients are fully informed and are involved in the decision-making process. Patients should be pre-optimized before surgery with particular emphasis on weight loss, smoking cessation, and diabetic control. For the majority of patients, a mesh repair with fascial closure and the mesh in the retrorectus plane is recommended.

Postoperative care

KQ6 Are postoperative abdominal binders advantageous after open abdominal surgery?

Since the previous guideline, three systematic reviews and meta-analysesof the use of abdominal binders have been published, all including a different set of RCTs and observational studies. One systematic reviewincluded eight studies, of which were four RCTs, comprising a total of 578 patients. No effect on postoperative pain was found. Use of abdominal binders did not compromise pulmonary function. The other two meta-analyses, including 10 (968 patients)and five (281 patients)RCTs reported a reduction in postoperative pain with abdominal binders and no negative effect on pulmonary function. Abdominal binders can be used after open abdominal surgery, but their costs, acceptance by patients, and potential risks should be taken into account. No recommendations can be given in terms of SSO, burst abdomen, and incisional hernia formation as there are a lack of data on these outcomes.

KQ7 Is restriction of activity advantageous after open abdominal surgery?

Only one systematic reviewon the restriction of activity after abdominal surgery has been published. This included 22 studies, incorporating three RCTs and several opinion articles. No comparative prospective trials on pulmonary function, SSO, burst abdomen, and incisional hernia formation were included. Therefore, no recommendations can be given on the restriction of postoperative physical activities owing to lack of studies. An expert surveyof recommendations regarding postoperative strain and physical labour after abdominal surgery was undertaken during the 41st Annual International Congress of the EHS. Four weeks of no physical strain after laparotomy was considered appropriate by a majority of the experts.

### ECLAPTE: effective closure of LAParoTomy in emergency-2023 World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines for the closure of laparotomy in emergency settings [^111Ly7ZN]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Incisional hernias and postoperative complications (wound dehiscence, fascial dehiscence, and surgical site infections) represent frequent complications after midline laparotomy, which is still the best approach to the abdomen in case of emergency settings for trauma, intra-abdominal sepsis management, and other acute abdominal conditions. The estimated incidence of IHs following major abdominal surgery ranges from 2 to 40% across studies, considering both elective and emergency procedures. The previous version of international guidelines investigated the abdominal wall closure techniques exclusively in elective surgery but provided no specific recommendations about emergency surgery cases.

A panel of experts from the World Society of Emergency Surgery discussed a series of key questions in a double-step process, firstly during the 9th World Congress of the WSES and then through a Delphi questionnaire among the WSES Board of Directors. The ECLAPTE project defined the optimal technique to close a laparotomy incision performed in the emergency setting, the optimal suture material, the role of retention sutures, and provided some advice about perioperative care. Our review focused on innovative and modern aspects of acute care surgery and trauma care. We examined the role of prophylactic mesh augmentation and provided suggestions about laparoscopic surgery when performed.

Moreover, areas for important future research were identified. Wound irrigation solutions, period of restriction from physical activity, the type and position of prophylactic mesh are relevant topics for future investigations. In addition, a significant point missing in literature, notorious neglected IHs site, is drain site incision: future perspectives are needed to clarify also the best closure technique for this incision.

Finally, the WSES advocates the adoption of these guidelines as a safe and evidence-based common approach in the emergency setting, but at the same time it encourages the development of local pathways based on the available evidence and resources.

K. Staged repair should be pursued in the emergent setting when the risks of a permanent mesh are deemed too great to justify its use. This will be in heavily contaminated and dirty fields (wound classes III and IV), and after damage control surgery when the patient is felt to have a high likelihood of needing additional surgical procedures (either planned or unplanned) that would disrupt the hernia repair or if there is an inability to close the fascia without advanced abdominal wall reconstruction techniques that the surgeon is uncomfortable performing. There are data supporting synthetic, permanent mesh placement in contaminated fields (wound class III), but this comes from an elective setting with reasonably optimized patients. Given the increased risk of complications in the emergency surgery setting, a more conservative approach for permanent mesh placement in this context is prudent. A staged repair encompasses several possible approaches, all contemplating a higher failure rate or a planned definitive repair under more optimal conditions in the future. A primary suture repair using slowly absorbable sutures without mesh reinforcement is adequate if the fascia can be closed. Temporary reinforcement of the fascial closure with the variety of absorbable meshes available can also be considered to reduce early recurrence/dehiscence, particularly if the hernia defect is large (> 3 cm). If the fascia cannot be closed, a bridging absorbable mesh should be used to provide temporary support in the acute setting and prevent immediate evisceration postoperatively. The ideal type of absorbable mesh to be used either as temporary reinforcement or as a bridge has not been established. Biologic, biosynthetic, or rapidly absorbable mesh such as polyglactin (Vicryl) has shown utility in these settings and is an ongoing area of active research. – Groin hernias within a heavily contaminated field will also be at higher risk for infectious complications. The role of absorbable meshes in this situation for groin hernias is unproven. Tissue repair should be considered in inguinal hernia repairs with a high degree of contamination. The Shouldice technique is recommended by the 2023 HerniaSurge Guidelines for nonmesh inguinal hernia repair due to lower recurrence rates compared with other suture repairs and should be considered if the surgeon has experience with this technique.

### Consensus on international guidelines for management of groin hernias [^113r9uRr]. Surgical Endoscopy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Groin hernia management has a significant worldwide diversity with multiple surgical techniques and variable outcomes. The International guidelines for groin hernia management serve to help in groin hernia management, but the acceptance among general surgeons remains unknown. The aim of our study was to gauge the degree of agreement with the guidelines among health care professionals worldwide.

Methods

Forty-six key statements and recommendations of the International guidelines for groin hernia management were selected and presented at plenary consensus conferences at four international congresses in Europe, the America's and Asia. Participants could cast their votes through live voting. Additionally, a web survey was sent out to all society members allowing online voting after each congress. Consensus was defined as > 70% agreement among all participants.

Results

In total 822 surgeons cast their vote on the key statements and recommendations during the four plenary consensus meetings or via the web survey. Consensus was reached on 34 out of 39 (87%) recommendations, and on six out of seven (86%) statements. No consensus was reached on the use of light versus heavy-weight meshes (69%), superior cost-effectiveness of day-case laparo-endoscopic repair (69%), omitting prophylactic antibiotics in hernia repair, general or local versus regional anesthesia in elderly patients (55%) and re-operation in case of immediate postoperative pain (59%).

Conclusion

Globally, there is 87% consensus regarding the diagnosis and management of groin hernias. This provides a solid basis for standardizing the care path of patients with groin hernias.

Regarding surgical interventions for inguinal hernia, more specifically with respect to technical considerations for surgery, mesh repair, WSES 2017 guidelines recommend to offer open management in unstable patients (experiencing severe sepsis or septic shock) to prevent abdominal compartment syndrome. Consider measuring intra-abdominal pressure intraoperatively. Attempt performing early, definitive closure of the abdomen following stabilization of the patient. Consider performing primary fascial closure only when the risk of excessive tension or recurrent intraabdominal hypertension is minimal.

### Guidelines for laparoscopic treatment of ventral and incisional abdominal wall hernias (International Endohernia Society (IEHS)-part 1 [^1174Y9DW]. Surgical Endoscopy (2014). Medium credibility.

Postoperative pain after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) is variable; acute postoperative pain should be resolved by 4–6 weeks and the incidence of protracted pain ranges from 1.6–28%. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications have been utilized with success for persistent postoperative pain, whereas elastomeric pumps delivering bupivicaine above the mesh have not been shown to influence acute postoperative pain. Topical anesthetic patches reduce pain scores after LVHR but the clinical significance is uncertain; successful relief of protracted pain has also been demonstrated with injections of either a local anesthetic or a combination of local anesthetic and steroid, and intercostal nerve blocks have also been successfully employed for chronic postoperative pain. Excision of sutures or tacks has been reported to result in pain resolution in some circumstances.

Parastomal hernia repair — operative technique — should typically utilize mesh reinforcement; this is a strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. The guideline notes a significant increase in annual parastomal hernia repairs in the United States from 4150 in 1998 to 7623 in 2011, no randomized controlled trials comparing methods of repair, and that routine mesh use is based on observational series showing high recurrence with primary suture repair (46%–78%).
