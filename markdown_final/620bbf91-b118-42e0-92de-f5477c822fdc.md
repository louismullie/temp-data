## Question

what medication should be added for a asthmatic with poor symptom control who is taking fluticasone furoate-vilanterol

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to escalate therapy for an adult with asthma who remains uncontrolled on fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI), and what the evidence-based next step should be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the current regimen is optimized and at an adequate dose. Then, I should verify the guideline-based escalation pathway beyond ICS-LABA. Next, I will review the comparative evidence for adding a LAMA versus other options. Finally, I will consider practical implementation, safety, and follow-up timing to ensure the plan is actionable and aligned with best practice.

> Let me first confirm the current therapy and dose optimization. FF/VI is available as 100/25 mcg or 200/25 mcg once daily. If the patient is on 100/25 mcg and still uncontrolled, increasing to 200/25 mcg is reasonable before adding another class, as FDA labeling supports dose escalation for inadequate control, and this aligns with GINA's principle of ensuring sufficient ICS exposure before adding LAMA [^1139QNuF].

> Wait, let me verify the fundamentals before escalating. I need to check inhaler technique, adherence, and modifiable risk factors such as smoking or allergen exposure, because poor technique or nonadherence often masquerades as "treatment failure". GINA emphasizes confirming the diagnosis, correcting technique, and ensuring adherence before stepping up therapy, and this should be documented and addressed concurrently with any pharmacologic change [^111RDuHV].

> Next, I should review the guideline-based step-up beyond ICS-LABA. GINA recommends adding a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) as the preferred next step for adults with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA, with modest improvements in lung function and a meta-analytic reduction in severe exacerbations of about 17% when LAMA is added to ICS-LABA, particularly in those with a history of exacerbations.

> Hold on, I should verify the formulation options for adding LAMA. For adults aged 18 years and older, GINA lists single-inhaler triple therapy options including fluticasone furoate/vilanterol/umeclidinium (Trelegy Ellipta) or other ICS-LABA-LAMA combinations, or alternatively adding tiotropium in a separate inhaler to existing ICS-LABA. The choice depends on patient preference, device familiarity, and access, but the evidence base is strongest for triple therapy in this context.

> I will now examine the efficacy data for triple therapy to ensure this is evidence-based. In the CAPTAIN randomized trial of adults uncontrolled on ICS-LABA, adding umeclidinium to FF/VI improved trough FEV1 by about 110 mL versus FF/VI 100/25 mcg and by about 92 mL versus FF/VI 200/25 mcg, with small improvements in ACQ-7; exacerbation rates were numerically lower but did not meet statistical significance in that study, which is consistent with GINA's characterization of modest but clinically meaningful benefits for LAMA add-on in selected patients [^115Q8BN4].

> But wait, what if I considered other add-on options instead of LAMA? Leukotriene receptor antagonists can be considered, but the evidence for symptom control is weaker and less consistent than LAMA add-on in this setting; GINA places LAMA ahead of LTRA for Step 4 escalation in adults with uncontrolled symptoms on ICS-LABA, reserving LTRA more for adjunctive use or specific phenotypes rather than routine step-up [^notfound].

> Let me think about the practical implementation. If using a single-inhaler triple, Trelegy Ellipta is dosed once daily and comes in 100/62.5/25 mcg or 200/62.5/25 mcg strengths. I should match the ICS dose to what the patient was previously receiving on FF/VI when possible, and counsel that the LAMA component adds anticholinergic bronchodilation without replacing the need for a rapid-onset reliever when symptoms flare [^115tGH19].

> I should confirm the reliever strategy. Because vilanterol has a slower onset and is not approved for as-needed rescue, patients on FF/VI or FF/VI/UMEC should continue to use a short-acting beta-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for acute relief. GINA also notes that for patients on triple therapy with a non-formoterol LABA, the appropriate reliever is SABA or ICS-SABA, reinforcing that vilanterol-containing regimens are not suitable as relievers [^116bZAF1] [^113yzsMm].

> Next, I should review safety and monitoring. Common adverse effects of adding LAMA include dry mouth and, rarely, urinary retention. I need to screen for narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder outlet obstruction before initiating. I should also monitor for ICS-related effects with higher total steroid exposure and reinforce rinsing after inhaled corticosteroid use to mitigate oral candidiasis risk [^114pbuzs].

> I need to ensure the follow-up plan is explicit. Reassess control in about 3 months after any step-up to judge response. If there is no meaningful improvement in symptoms, lung function, or exacerbation frequency, I should reconsider the diagnosis, adherence, and technique, and consider referral for specialist evaluation to assess for severe or difficult-to-treat asthma phenotypes and biologic candidacy [^115S3rJq].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is to optimize the current FF/VI dose to 200/25 mcg once daily if not already at maximum, confirm technique and adherence, and then add LAMA, preferably as single-inhaler triple therapy with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol/umeclidinium (Trelegy Ellipta) at a matched ICS dose, while maintaining a SABA reliever and reassessing control in 3 months. This aligns with FDA labeling, GINA guidance, and randomized evidence showing improved lung function with triple therapy in adults uncontrolled on ICS-LABA [^1139QNuF] [^113GFQbA] [^115Q8BN4].

For an asthmatic with poor control on fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, the next step is to **add a LAMA** (e.g. tiotropium) or switch to **triple therapy** (ICS/LABA/LAMA) if available [^113GFQbA] [^114c32gc]. This is supported by GINA and the CAPTAIN trial, which show modest improvements in lung function and a reduction in exacerbations with LAMA add-on therapy [^115Q8BN4] [^114yna1J]. If triple therapy is not available, add tiotropium as a separate inhaler [^113GFQbA]. Ensure inhaler technique and adherence are optimized before escalating therapy [^111RDuHV].

---

## Recommended next step: add a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)

- **GINA guidelines**: Recommend adding a LAMA (e.g. tiotropium) for patients aged ≥ 6 years [^113GFQbA] who remain uncontrolled on medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA, either as a separate inhaler or as part of triple therapy [^114c32gc].

- **CAPTAIN trial**: Adding umeclidinium (LAMA) to fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (ICS/LABA) significantly improved lung function (FEV1) and reduced exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled asthma [^115Q8BN4].

- **Meta-analyses**: Adding LAMA to ICS-LABA reduces severe exacerbations by ~17% [^114yna1J], particularly in patients with a history of exacerbations [^113GFQbA].

---

## Alternative option: switch to triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA)

- **Single-inhaler triple therapy**: Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol/umeclidinium (Trelegy Ellipta) is approved for asthma maintenance therapy in adults [^114WS19W] and provides the convenience of once-daily dosing [^115tGH19].

- **Clinical evidence**: The CAPTAIN trial demonstrated that triple therapy improved lung function and reduced exacerbations compared to ICS/LABA alone [^115Q8BN4].

- **GINA recommendation**: Triple therapy is recommended for patients who remain uncontrolled despite optimized ICS-LABA therapy [^113GFQbA] [^114c32gc].

---

## Additional considerations

Before escalating therapy, **confirm the diagnosis** and assess for comorbidities, and reinforce inhaler technique and adherence [^113RE1Ap]. If available, **biologic therapy** (e.g. anti-IgE, anti-IL5, anti-IL4/13) may be considered for patients with severe asthma who remain uncontrolled despite triple therapy [^notfound].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Evidence level** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Add LAMA (tiotropium) | High | - GINA guidelines <br/> - CAPTAIN trial <br/> - Meta-analyses [^113GFQbA] [^115Q8BN4] [^114yna1J] |
| Switch to triple therapy (ICS/LABA/LAMA) | High | - GINA guidelines <br/> - CAPTAIN trial <br/> - FDA approval [^113GFQbA] [^115Q8BN4] [^113k5YJW] |
| Optimize inhaler technique and adherence | High | - GINA guidelines <br/> - Clinical practice [^113RE1Ap] |
| Consider biologic therapy | Moderate | - GINA guidelines <br/> - Clinical practice [^notfound] |

---

The recommended next step for an asthmatic patient with poor control on fluticasone furoate/vilanterol is to **add a LAMA** or switch to **triple therapy** (ICS/LABA/LAMA) [^113GFQbA]. This approach is supported by GINA guidelines and clinical evidence demonstrating improved lung function and reduced exacerbations [^113GFQbA].

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Serious Asthma-Related Events

Inform patients with asthma that LABA when used alone increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization or asthma-related death. Available data show that when ICS and LABA are used together, such as with Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA, there is not a significant increase in the risk of these events. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]

Not for Acute Symptoms

Inform patients that Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA is not meant to relieve acute symptoms of COPD or asthma and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Advise patients to treat acute symptoms with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist such as albuterol. Provide patients with such medication and instruct them in how it should be used.

Instruct patients to seek medical attention immediately if they experience any of the following:

Decreasing effectiveness of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists
Need for more inhalations than usual of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists
Significant decrease in lung function as outlined by the physician

Tell patients they should not stop therapy with Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA without physician/provider guidance since symptoms may recur after discontinuation. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).]

### Fluticasone furoate / vilanterol versus fluticasone propionate in patients with asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction [^116zBuGq]. The Journal of Asthma (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective: To investigate whether once-daily (OD) fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) provides greater long-term protection from postexercise fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) than twice-daily (BD) fluticasone propionate (FP) in patients with asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, crossover study was conducted in patients (aged 12–50 years) on low-/mid-dose maintenance inhaled corticosteroid. Following a 4-week run-in period (FP 250 µg BD), patients with a ≥ 20% decrease in postexercise FEV 1 received FF/VI 100/25 µg OD or FP 250 µg BD for 2 weeks. Exercise challenges were carried out 23 h after the first dose of study medication, and 12 and 23 h after evening clinic dose at the end of the 2-week treatment period. After a 2-week washout period (FP 250 µg), patients crossed over treatments, with procedures and tests repeated. The primary endpoint was mean maximal percentage decrease from pre-exercise FEV 1 following exercise challenge 12-h postevening dose on Day 14. Results: The mean maximal percentage decrease from pre-exercise FEV 1 after the 12-h exercise challenge (Day 14) was 15.02% with FF/VI, and 16.71% with FP (difference, -1.69; 95% confidence interval, -3.76 to 0.39; p = 0.109). After the 23-h exercise challenge (Day 14), respective mean maximal decreases were 11.90% and 14.05% (difference, -2.15; 95% confidence interval, -4.31 to 0.01). Conclusion: The study failed to show a difference between FF/VI and FP at providing long-term protection from exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

Background

The inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone furoate (FF) in combination with the long-acting β2-agonist vilanterol (VI) is under development for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of FF-VI and FF in patients (≥ 12 years old) with persistent asthma.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients (n = 609) (intent-to-treat population) received FF-VI 100–25 mcg, FF 100 mcg, or placebo once daily (evening) by using a dry powder inhaler for 12 weeks. Coprimary end points were change from baseline in trough FEV1 and serial (0–24 hours) weighted mean FEV1 (wmFEV(1)). Rescue-free 24-hour periods and safety also were assessed.

Results

Placebo increased trough FEV1 (196 mL) and wmFEV(1) (212 mL) versus baseline. Compared with placebo, FF-VI and FF significantly improved trough FEV1 (172 mL [P < .001] and 136 mL [P = 0.002]), respectively, and serial wmFEV(1) (302 mL [P < .001] and 186 mL [P = 0.003]), respectively. Treatment differences between FF-VI and FF approached significance for serial wmFEV(1) (116 mL; p = 0.060) but not for trough FEV1 (36 mL; p = 0.405). The percentage of rescue-free 24-hour periods with FF-VI was 10.6% greater than FF and 19.3% greater than placebo. Statistically significant (P = 0.032) urinary cortisol suppression was observed with FF-VI (ratio, 0.82) relative to placebo, but not with FF. Adverse event and safety profiles were similar across treatment groups.

Conclusions

Significant improvement in lung function was observed with FF-VI and FF versus placebo in patients with persistent asthma. Improvement of FEV1 when VI was added to FF was not significant. The high placebo response in evening trough FEV1 may have influenced the assessment of efficacy.

### Comparison of budesonide / formoterol versus fluticasone furoate / vilanterol as maintenance and reliever therapy for asthma control: a real-world observational study [^116zfmg8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to compare the effectiveness of BUD/FOR as MART with FF/VIL as MART. In the present study, all patients in this study exhibited a decrease in adverse events (AEs) and blood eosinophil counts, although these reductions were not statistically significant. Patients treated with FF/VIL experienced significant improvements in ACT scores. Furthermore, FeNO levels significantly decreased in patients treated with BUD/FOR. These findings suggest that FF/VIL as a maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) may provide comparable effectiveness to BUD/FOR as MART and may even offer better symptom control.

The primary goals of asthma treatment include symptom control, risk reduction, decreased AE rates, and improved quality of life. The GINA guidelines recommend the regular use of ICS + LABA for patients at steps 3 and 4. There are two treatment approaches for these patients, differing primarily in the choice of reliever medication. In Track 1, the reliever is as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol, which is the preferred approach for adults according to GINA. In Track 2, an as-needed SABA or ICS-SABA is an alternative when Track 1 is not feasible. Single use of SABA as a reliever for asthma patients is no longer recommended due to concerns of overuse of SABA and underuse of controller medications such as ICS. Anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy is now recommended, which combines both controller and reliever medications in the same inhaler. ICS-formoterol has been proven as an AIR for mild asthma, providing better symptom control, reduced exacerbations, and anti-inflammatory effects compared to SABA alone. In cases of worsening asthma, ICS-formoterol can also be used as MART. The rationale behind using ICS-formoterol as MART lies in the rapid onset of action with formoterol, providing quick symptomatic relief. Patients treated with ICS-formoterol as MART have been reported to have similar symptom relief and lower AE rates compared to those treated with other ICS + LABA using SABA as a reliever. In these studies, the matched patients were treated with SM/FP. There was limited evidence available regarding the efficacy of MART compared to FF/VIL.

### Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol [^114rHpDo]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients received 1 inhalation once daily of the following: fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, fluticasone furoate 200 mcg, vilanterol 25 mcg, or placebo.

12-Month Trials

Long-term safety data are based on two 12-month trials (Trials 3 and 4; n = 1,633 and n = 1,622, respectively). Trials 3 and 4 included 3,255 patients, of which 57% were male and 85% were White. They had a mean age of 64 years and an average smoking history of 46 pack years, with 44% identified as current smokers. At screening, the mean postbronchodilator percent predicted FEV1was 45% (range: 12% to 91%), and the mean postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio was 46% (range: 17% to 81%), indicating that the patient population had moderate to very severely impaired airflow obstruction. Patients received 1 inhalation once daily of the following: fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50/25 mcg, or vilanterol 25 mcg. In addition to the reactions shown in Table 2, adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 3% of the patients treated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg (n = 806) for 12 months included back pain, pneumonia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)], bronchitis, sinusitis, cough, oropharyngeal pain, arthralgia, influenza, pharyngitis, and pyrexia.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112EAN1M]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

ICS in combination with a long-acting beta2 agonist bronchodilator (ICS-LABA) for maintenance asthma treatment includes beclometasone-formoterol, budesonide-formoterol, fluticasone furoate-vilanterol, fluticasone propionate-formoterol, fluticasone propionate-salmeterol, mometasone-formoterol and mometasone-indacaterol, delivered by pMDI or DPI. When a low-dose of ICS alone fails to achieve good control of asthma, the addition of LABA to maintenance ICS improves symptoms, lung function and reduces exacerbations in more patients, more rapidly, than doubling the dose of ICS. Two regimens are available: low-dose combination beclometasone or budesonide with low-dose formoterol for both maintenance-and-reliever treatment (MART, GINA Track 1), and maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA or ICS-SABA as reliever (Track 2); MART with low-dose ICS-formoterol reliever is preferred as it reduces exacerbations compared with conventional maintenance therapy with SABA as reliever, and is a simpler regimen. The LABA component may be associated with tachycardia, headache or cramps; LABA is safe in asthma when used in combination with ICS, but LABA or LAMA should not be used without ICS in asthma (or in patients with asthma+COPD) due to increased risk of serious adverse outcomes. Concomitant treatment with cytochrome P450 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, itraconazole, erythromycin and clarithromycin may increase the risk of ICS adverse effects.

Labeled indications for Fluticasone furoate / umeclidinium bromide / vilanterol trifenatate (also known as Trelegy Ellipta) include:

### Comparison of budesonide / formoterol versus fluticasone furoate / vilanterol as maintenance and reliever therapy for asthma control: a real-world observational study [^116zTn7n]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma presents with variable symptoms and airflow limitation due to airway inflammation. This inflammation causes airway hyperresponsiveness and exacerbations, making it a crucial target for asthma treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the primary treatment for managing asthma symptoms and minimizing future risks due to inflammation. Long-acting B2 agonists (LABAs) are added to ICSs when asthma symptoms are not fully controlled by ICSs alone. Budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FOR) can serve as both a controller and a rescue medication thanks to the rapid and long-acting bronchodilator properties of formoterol. This treatment is termed Single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART). Previous studies have shown that asthma patients treated with SMART had reduced acute exacerbation rates, improved symptom control, and required a lower dosage of ICSs.

### Inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β ₂-agonist pharmacological profiles: effective asthma therapy in practice [^111hgwgB]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Fixed-dose combinations of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) have been used to manage asthma for several years. They are the preferred therapy option for patients who do not achieve optimal control of their asthma with low-dose ICS monotherapy. In Europe, four ICS/LABA products are commercially available for asthma maintenance therapy (fluticasone propionate/formoterol fumarate, fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate, budesonide/formoterol fumarate and beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate), and other combinations are likely to be developed over the next few years (e.g. mometasone/formoterol fumarate, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, mometasone/indacaterol). Data from randomized, controlled, clinical trials do not demonstrate a clear overall efficacy difference among ICS/LABA combinations approved for asthma therapy. Conversely, pharmacological data indicate that there may be certain advantages to using one ICS or LABA over another because of the specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles associated with particular treatments. This review article summarizes the pharmacological characteristics oft he various ICSs and LABAs available for the treatment of asthma, including the potential for ICS and LABA synergy, and gives an insight into the rationale for the development of the latest ICS/LABA combination approved for asthma maintenance therapy.

### Reply to suissa: mortality in IMPACT: confounded by asthma? [^115rrqRy]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

It is important to recognize that IMPACT was not an ICS withdrawal study. Although ∼77% of patients entered the trial on ICS, because of the 2:2:1 randomization, only approximately 15% of the overall population underwent withdrawal of ICS. The vast majority of the population (85%) did not experience ICS removal. In addition, deaths occurred in all arms throughout the trial, indicating no "surge" in deaths caused by abrupt withdrawal of ICS. Overall mortality on the long-acting muscarinic antagonist–long-acting β 2 agonist arm was actually lower than what has been previously observed in similar patients with advanced COPD, also strongly suggesting that abrupt ICS withdrawal was not the cause of the findings.

Even if we were to believe Dr. Suissa's argument that ICS withdrawal was harmful, we would then have to conclude that the addition of ICS was beneficial for these patients in the first place.

What is clear is that most patients who met the IMPACT inclusion criteria benefited from triple therapy compared with dual therapy. Patients with symptomatic COPD and a history of exacerbation who received triple therapy with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol experienced clinically relevant improvements in lung function and health-related quality of life, reduction in exacerbations and hospitalizations, and now a confirmed additional benefit of improved survival compared with patients randomized to umeclidinium/vilanterol.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113mdrTk]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbation pharmacotherapy after an episode — patients previously using as-needed-only ICS-formoterol should start maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with added maintenance ICS-formoterol; there is no need to prescribe or provide short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for patients prescribed an ICS-formoterol reliever. For adults and adolescents using SABA as a reliever before the exacerbation, consider switching to maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol (MART) to reduce the risk of future exacerbations.

### Fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol trifenatate (trelegy ellipta) [^117MgXME]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14.2 Asthma

The safety and efficacy of TRELEGY ELLIPTA were evaluated in 2,436 subjects in a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled confirmatory trial of 24 to 52 weeks' duration in adult subjects with asthma inadequately controlled on their current treatments of combination therapy (ICS plus a LABA) (Trial 4, NCT02924688).

Subjects with an Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6) score ≥ 1.5 on their current asthma treatment of ICS (greater than fluticasone propionate 250 mcg/day or equivalent) plus LABA entered a 3-week run-in period of treatment with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 mcg twice daily. Subjects who remained inadequately controlled (ACQ-6 ≥ 1.5) after the run-in period were transferred to fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 mcg once daily for a 2-week stabilization period. After the 5-week run-in/stabilization period, eligible subjects were randomized to receive once-daily inhalations of TRELEGY ELLIPTA 100/62.5/25 mcg (n = 406), TRELEGY ELLIPTA 200/62.5/25 mcg (n = 408), fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 100/31.25 mcg/25 mcg (n = 405), fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 200/31.25 mcg/25 mcg (n = 404), fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 100/25 mcg (n = 407), or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 200/25 mcg (n = 406).

### Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol [^112XdF9v]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The 3 adult and pediatric trials were designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.0, and the pediatric trial was designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.7. Each individual trial met its pre-specified objective and demonstrated non-inferiority of ICS/LABA to ICS alone. A meta-analysis of the 3 adult and pediatric trials did not show a significant increase in risk of a serious asthma-related event with ICS/LABA fixed-dose combination compared with ICS alone (Table 1). These trials were not designed to rule out all risk for serious asthma-related events with ICS/LABA compared with ICS.

The pediatric safety trial included 6,208 pediatric patients aged 4 to 11 years who received ICS/LABA (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder) or ICS (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder). In this trial, 27/3,107 (0.9%) patients randomized to ICS/LABA and 21/3,101 (0.7%) patients randomized to ICS experienced a serious asthma-related event. There were no asthma-related deaths or intubations. ICS/LABA did not show a significantly increased risk of a serious asthma-related event compared with ICS based on the pre-specified risk margin (2.7), with an estimated hazard ratio of time to first event of 1.29 (95% CI: 0.73, 2.27).

Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)

A 28-week, placebo-controlled, U.S. trial that compared the safety of salmeterol with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in patients treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in patients treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.25, 15.34]). Use of background ICS was not required in SMART. The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily vilanterol / fluticasone furoate MDI in persistent asthma: phase 3 OD-INHALE study [^115KGUer]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Once-daily inhalers have been shown to improve adherence leading to lesser discontinuation compared to twice- or thrice-daily inhalers in management of asthma. Combination of Vilanterol and Fluticasone Furoate (VI/FF) is approved for management of asthma and COPD and is available as a dry powder inhaler. Pressurized-Metered Dose Inhalers (pMDIs) offer ease-of-use and therapy alternatives for patients with low inspiratory flow. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of a new once-daily pMDI containing VI/FF in individuals diagnosed with persistent asthma.

Methods

This phase 3, double-blind, randomized controlled study assessed the non-inferiority of VI/FF (12.5mcg/50mcg & 12.5mcg/100mcg; 2 puffs once-daily) over Formoterol Fumarate and Fluticasone Propionate (FOR/FP, 6mcg/125mcg & 6mcg/250mcg; 2 puffs twice-daily) in patients with persistent asthma. Primary outcome was change from baseline in trough FEV1 at the end of study (12 weeks). Adverse events and number of exacerbations were used to evaluate safety.

Results

A total of 330 patients were randomized into VI/FF (165) and FOR/FP (165). Trough FEV1 significantly improved in both the groups at week 12, with a mean difference (VI/FF minus FOR/FP) being 54.75mL (95% CI, 8.42–101.08mL, p = 0.02). The low dose VI/FF had similar efficacy to that of low dose FOR/FP and high dose VI/FF had similar efficacy to high dose FOR/FP. No serious adverse events were reported during the study.

Conclusion

Once daily VI/FF pMDI was non-inferior to twice daily FOR/FP pMDI in patients with persistent asthma.

### Effectiveness of fluticasone furoate plus vilanterol on asthma control in clinical practice: an open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial [^117GsWK3]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Evidence for management of asthma comes from closely monitored efficacy trials done in highly selected patient groups. There is a need for randomised trials that are closer to usual clinical practice.

Methods

We did an open-label, randomised, controlled, two-arm effectiveness trial at 74 general practice clinics in Salford and South Manchester, UK. Patients aged 18 years or older with a general practitioner's diagnosis of symptomatic asthma and on maintenance inhaler therapy were randomly assigned to initiate treatment with a once-daily inhaled combination of either 100 μg or 200 μg fluticasone furoate with 25 μg vilanterol or optimised usual care and followed up for 12 months. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients who achieved an asthma control test (ACT) score of 20 or greater or an increase in ACT score from baseline of 3 or greater at 24 weeks (termed responders), in patients with a baseline ACT score less than 20 (the primary effectiveness analysis population). All effectiveness analyses were done according to the intention-to-treat principle. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01706198.

Findings

Between Nov 12, 2012, and Dec 16, 2016, 4725 patients were enrolled and 4233 randomly assigned to initiate treatment with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol (n = 2114) or usual care (n = 2119). 1207 patients (605 assigned to usual care, 602 to fluticasone furoate and vilanterol) had a baseline ACT score greater than or equal to 20 and were thus excluded from the primary effectiveness analysis population. At week 24, the odds of being a responder were higher for patients who initiated treatment with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol than for those on usual care (977 [71%] of 1373 in the fluticasone furoate and vilanterol group vs 784 [56%] of 1399 in the usual care group; odds ratio [OR] 2.00 [95% CI 1.70–2.34], p < 0.0001). At week 24, the adjusted mean ACT score increased by 4.4 points from baseline in patients initiated with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol, compared with 2.8 points in the usual care group (difference 1.6 [95% CI 1.3–2.0], p < 0.0001). This result was consistent for the duration of the study. Pneumonia was uncommon, with no differences between groups; there was no difference in other serious adverse events between the groups.

Interpretation

In patients with a general practitioner's diagnosis of symptomatic asthma and on maintenance inhaler therapy, initiation of a once-daily treatment regimen of combined fluticasone furoate and vilanterol improved asthma control without increasing the risk of serious adverse events when compared with optimised usual care.

### Comparison of budesonide / formoterol versus fluticasone furoate / vilanterol as maintenance and reliever therapy for asthma control: a real-world observational study [^111JcNdQ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In our study, the lower FEF25–75% in the BUD/FOR group compared to the FF/VIL group suggests a potential difference in small airway involvement between the two groups. This difference may be reflected in the change in ACT scores. However, this is a retrospective study and patient number was relatively small, further study may be needed for clarification. Despite these limitations, this study represents the first real-world comparison of the efficacy between BUD/FOR as MART and FF/VIL as MART in patients with step 3 and 4 asthma, with comprehensive measurements including, FEV1, AE rate, serum IgE, and blood eosinophil count.

5.2 Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes

Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA should not be initiated in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of COPD or asthma. Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA has not been studied in patients with acutely deteriorating COPD or asthma. The initiation of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA in this setting is not appropriate.

In COPD, if Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction; the patient's inhaled, short-acting, beta2-agonist becomes less effective; or the patient needs more short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, re-evaluate the patient and the COPD treatment regimen at once. For COPD, the daily dose of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg should not be increased.

Increasing use of inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma. In this situation, the patient requires immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen, giving special consideration to the need for additional therapeutic options. Patients should not use more than 1 inhalation once daily of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA.

Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA should not be used for the relief of acute symptoms, i.e., as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm. Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA has not been studied in the relief of acute symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist.

When beginning treatment with Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA, patients who have been taking oral or inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonists on a regular basis (e.g., 4 times a day) should be instructed to discontinue the regular use of these drugs and to use them only for symptomatic relief of acute respiratory symptoms. When prescribing Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA, the healthcare provider should also prescribe an inhaled, short‑acting beta2-agonist and instruct the patient on how it should be used.

2.1 Recommended Dosage for Maintenance Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

The recommended dosage of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg (containing fluticasone furoate 100 mcg and vilanterol 25 mcg) is 1 actuation once daily by oral inhalation.

If shortness of breath occurs in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be used for immediate relief.

2.2 Recommended Dosage for Maintenance Treatment of Asthma

Adult Patients Aged 18 Years and Older

The recommended dosage of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg (containing fluticasone furoate 100 mcg and vilanterol 25 mcg) is 1 actuation once daily by oral inhalation or Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg (containing fluticasone furoate 200 mcg and vilanterol 25 mcg) is 1 actuation once daily by oral inhalation.

When choosing the starting dosage strength of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA, consider the patients' disease severity, their previous asthma therapy, including the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dosage, as well as the patients' current control of asthma symptoms and risk of future exacerbation.
The median time to onset, defined as a 100-mL increase from baseline in mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), was approximately 15 minutes after beginning treatment. Individual patients will experience a variable time to onset and degree of symptom relief.
For patients who do not respond adequately to Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg once daily, increasing the dose to Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg once daily may provide additional improvement in asthma control. For patients who do not respond adequately to Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg once daily, re-evaluate and consider other therapeutic regimens and additional therapeutic options.
The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg once daily.
If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be used for immediate relief.

### A randomised, phase III trial of once-daily fluticasone furoate / vilanterol 100 / 25 μ g versus once-daily vilanterol 25 μ g to evaluate the contribution on lung function of fluticasone furoate in the combination in patients with COPD [^116zzayT]. Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The contribution of fluticasone furoate (FF) on lung function in the FF/vilanterol (VI) 100/25 μg combination has been demonstrated numerically, but not statistically.

Methods

This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, controlled trial (GlaxoSmithKline study number 200820; clinicaltrials.gov NCT02105974) enrolled ≥ 40-year-old patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a ≥ 10-pack-year smoking history, a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) 30–70% of the predicted value, a FEV 1 /forced vital capacity ratio of ≤ 0.70, ≥ 1 COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months requiring corticosteroids, antibiotics and/or hospitalisation, and current COPD symptoms. Participants received FF/VI 100/25 μg or VI 25 μg once daily. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in trough FEV 1 at day 84.

Findings

1620 patients were randomised and received at least one dose of FF/VI 100/25 μg (n = 806) or VI 25 μg (n = 814). At day 84, the FF/VI 100/25 μg group showed an adjusted mean treatment difference of 34 mL over VI 25 μg in change from baseline trough FEV 1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 14–55; p = 0.001). There was no significant difference between the groups in the percentage of rescue medication-free 24-h periods. The FF/VI 100/25 μg group demonstrated a 42% risk reduction compared with the VI 25 μg group in time to first moderate/severe COPD exacerbation (95% CI 22–57; nominal p < 0.001). The incidence of on-treatment adverse events was similar between the groups.

Interpretation

The contribution of FF in the FF/VI 100/25 μg combination on lung function in COPD was statistically significant.

### Efficacy and safety comparison: fluticasone furoate and fluticasone propionate, after step down from fluticasone furoate / vilanterol in Japanese patients with well-controlled asthma, a randomized trial [^1174jPLJ]. Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

For patients with well-controlled asthma, 'step down' of therapy is recommended. We evaluated Japanese patients switching from inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting beta 2 -agonists (LABA; equivalent to fluticasone propionate [FP]/salmeterol [SAL] 250/50 μg twice daily [BD]) to fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) 100/25 μg, then stepping down to ICS alone.

Methods

This phase III trial had two treatment periods (P): P1, patients with well-controlled asthma on FP/SAL 250/50 μg BD equivalent stepped across to once daily (OD) FF/VI 100/25 μg (open-label, eight weeks); P2, patients remaining 'well controlled' after P1 stepped down to FF 100 μg OD/FP 100 μg BD/FP 250 μg BD (randomized 1:1:1, double-blind, 12 weeks). Co-primary P2 endpoints: percentage of patients with well-controlled asthma; time to withdrawal due to poorly controlled asthma requiring step-up therapy. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored.

Results

At the end of P1 (n = 430), 373 (90.5%; 95% confidence interval 87.29–93.18) patients' asthma remained well controlled with FF/VI; in P2 (n = 371), control was maintained in 89.5% (FF 100 μg)/79.5% (FP 100 μg)/83.8% (FP 250 μg) of patients. In P2, 4.9–7.3% of patients were withdrawn due to worsening asthma (time-to-withdrawal cumulative incidence curves were comparable). AEs were reported by 37% of patients during P1; and by 36% (FF 100 μg)/48% (FP 100 μg)/49% (FP 250 μg) of patients in P2.

Conclusions

For patients with well-controlled asthma on mid dose ICS/LABA (equivalent to FP/SAL 250/50 μg BD), control can be maintained when they are stepped across to FF/VI 100/25 μg OD. FF 100 μg OD is an effective step-down therapy from FF/VI 100/25 μg OD with similar efficacy to FP 100 μg BD and FP 250 μg BD.

### The effect of fluticasone furoate / umeclidinium in adult patients with asthma: a randomized, dose-ranging study [^11644Gm2]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated the dose-response of umeclidinium (UMEC; a long-acting muscarinic antagonist) combined with fluticasone furoate (FF; an inhaled corticosteroid [ICS]) in patients with asthma.

Methods

In a double-blind, three-period crossover study, 421 subjects (symptomatic on ICS), were randomized to a sequence of three of seven treatments: FF 100 mcg alone, FF 100 mcg combined with UMEC (15.6, 31.25, 62.5, 125, or 250 mcg), or vilanterol 25 mcg (a long-acting β-agonist), inhaled once-daily for 14 days (12–14-day washout). Trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and safety were assessed.

Results

Period baseline was a significant covariate, indicating a potential carryover effect between treatment periods. Across all treatment periods, trough FEV1 improved with FF/UMEC 125 and 250 versus FF (treatment difference 0.055 L [both doses]; p = 0.018). FF/UMEC increased morning (15.9–22.9 L/min) and evening (16.2–28.8 L/min) PEF versus FF. As intended assessments were confounded, post hoc Period 1 data analyses were performed, demonstrating significant increases in trough FEV1 with FF/UMEC 31.25, 62.5, and 250 versus FF. Trough FEV1 improvements with FF/UMEC were greater in subjects with fixed (0.095–0.304 L) versus non-fixed (-0.084 to 0.041 L) obstruction. The incidence of on-treatment adverse events was 13–25% across groups. No treatment-related effects on laboratory parameters were reported.

Conclusion

FF/UMEC may be a viable treatment for patients with asthma symptomatic on ICS; benefit may be most prominent in those with fixed obstruction. The carryover effect suggests future UMEC studies should use an alternative design. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01573624.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^113GFQbA]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Other Step 4 treatment options for adults and adolescents — Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) may be considered as add-on therapy in a separate inhaler for patients aged ≥ 6 years (tiotropium), or in a combination triple inhaler for patients aged ≥ 18 years if asthma is persistently uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroid–long-acting beta2 agonist (ICS-LABA). Adding a LAMA to medium or high-dose ICS-LABA modestly improved lung function but with no difference in symptoms; in some studies it modestly reduced exacerbations, and meta-analyses reported a 17% reduction in risk of severe exacerbations with addition of LAMA to medium- or high-dose ICS-LABA, mainly in those with a history of exacerbations in the previous year. For patients with exacerbations despite low-dose ICS-LABA, the ICS dose should be increased to at least medium, or switched to maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol, before considering adding a LAMA. One study found the severe exacerbation rate was lower with high-dose fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (ICS-LABA) than with low- to medium-dose fluticasone furoate-vilanterol-umeclidinium (ICS-LABA-LAMA), and for patients prescribed an ICS-LABA-LAMA with a non-formoterol LABA, the appropriate reliever is SABA or ICS-SABA. In Step 4, there is insufficient evidence to support ICS-LAMA over low- or medium-dose ICS-LABA combination; in one analysis, response to adding LAMA to medium-dose ICS was not modified by baseline demographics, body-mass index, FEV1, FEV1 responsiveness, or smoking status. Consider adding sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT) for adult patients with sensitization to house dust mite with suboptimally controlled asthma despite low- to high-dose ICS, but only if FEV1 is > 70% predicted.

### Fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol trifenatate (trelegy ellipta) [^112KygjZ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

The 3 adult and adolescent trials were designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.0, and the pediatric trial was designed to rule out a risk margin of 2.7. Each individual trial met its pre-specified objective and demonstrated non-inferiority of ICS/LABA to ICS alone. A meta-analysis of the 3 adult and adolescent trials did not show a significant increase in risk of a serious asthma-related event with ICS/LABA fixed-dose combination compared with ICS alone (Table 1). These trials were not designed to rule out all risk for serious asthma-related events with ICS/LABA compared with ICS.

The pediatric safety trial included 6,208 pediatric subjects aged 4 to 11 years who received ICS/LABA (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder) or ICS (fluticasone propionate inhalation powder). In this trial, 27/3,107 (0.9%) subjects randomized to ICS/LABA and 21/3,101 (0.7%) subjects randomized to ICS experienced a serious asthma-related event. There were no asthma-related deaths or intubations. ICS/LABA did not show a significantly increased risk of a serious asthma-related event compared with ICS based on the pre-specified risk margin (2.7), with an estimated hazard ratio of time to first event of 1.29 (95% CI: 0.73, 2.27). TRELEGY ELLIPTA is not indicated for use in pediatric patients aged 17 years and younger.

Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)

A 28-week, placebo-controlled, U.S. trial that compared the safety of salmeterol with placebo, each added to usual asthma therapy, showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in subjects receiving salmeterol (13/13,176 in subjects treated with salmeterol vs. 3/13,179 in subjects treated with placebo; relative risk: 4.37 [95% CI: 1.25, 15.34]). Use of background ICS was not required in SMART. The increased risk of asthma-related death is considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy.

### Safety and tolerability of the novel inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone furoate in combination with the β ₂ agonist vilanterol administered once daily for 52 weeks in patients ≥ 12 years old with asthma: a randomised trial [^114y1Ky7]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In this study, both doses of FF/VI (100/25 µg and 200/25 µg) administered once daily over 52 weeks were well tolerated by patients ≥ 12 years of age with asthma. The overall safety profile observed with FF/VI did not reveal unusual or unexpected findings of significant clinical concern. Safety findings that were observed reflected the expected pharmacological activity of the ICS and LABA components.

### Once-daily fluticasone furoate (FF) / vilanterol reduces risk of severe exacerbations in asthma versus FF alone [^1156ocPi]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

In this study the results of secondary endpoints, including annualised rate of severe exacerbations, further support the primary endpoint. The improvements in trough FEV 1 and reductions in ACQ7 scores confirm superior current asthma control with the FF/VI combination. In addition, the frequency of severe asthma exacerbations leading to hospitalisation, emergency room visit or unscheduled healthcare provider visit was similar for both FF and FF/VI. Thus, there was no indication of an increased risk of such severe events with the addition of the LABA, a finding that is consistent with several meta-analyses of studies comparing combined ICS/LABA with ICS alone.

Interpreting the clinical significance of exacerbation reductions in clinical trials is easiest when the comparator is usual treatment. In this study two new treatments were compared: a new once-daily moderate dose of FF and FF combined with VI. The resultant annualised rate of severe asthma exacerbations was low in both treatment groups, 0.19 for FF (corresponding to approximately one exacerbation every 5 years per patient) and 0.14 for FF/VI (one every 7 years), despite the fact that all patients were required to have had a severe asthma exacerbation during the 1-year period prior to randomisation. The exacerbation rate observed in the FF group compares favourably with those observed in previous studies of patients uncontrolled on medium-dose ICS, in which annualised rates ranging from 0.31 to 0.35 were reported for patients receiving budesonide alone. In two recent studies of the effect of adding salmeterol to FP on asthma exacerbation rates, rates of 0.27–0.30 exacerbations/patient/year were reported for patients using FP monotherapy. Thus, the 25% decrease seen in this study represents a clinically useful improvement from an already very low base rate.

### Once-daily fluticasone furoate and vilanterol for adolescents and adults with symptomatic asthma: a systematic review with meta-analysis [^113CVStV]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol is a new inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) combination developed for once-daily administration via a dry powder inhaler.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate-vilanterol in adolescents and adults with symptomatic asthma compared with ICS monotherapy or twice-daily ICS-LABA formulations.

Methods

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials with longer than 8 weeks of treatment duration were included. Primary outcome was pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] or peak expiratory flow rate [PEF]).

Results

Seven published randomized clinical trials were included (5,668 patients). Fluticasone furoate-vilanterol was associated with significant increases in trough FEV1 and morning and evening PEF compared with fluticasone furoate, 100 μg, monotherapy (90 mL, 20.1 L/min, and 18.9 L/min respectively). Fluticasone furoate-vilanterol reduced significantly the rate of severe asthma exacerbations (number need to treat for benefit = 24). Fluticasone furoate-vilanterol also produced significant increases in weighted FEV1 and morning and evening PEF (140 mL, 32.6 L/min, and 25.7 L/min, respectively) compared with fluticasone propionate, 500 μg twice daily. Fluticasone furoate-vilanterol presented a nonsignificant increase in the frequency of cardiac events (6.4% vs 1.8%) compared with fluticasone propionate. No differences were found between both available doses of fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (200/25 μg and 100/25 μg) in terms of efficacy. However, patients receiving fluticasone furoate-vilanterol, 200/25 μg, had a trend toward an increased risk of cardiac events.

Conclusion

Fluticasone furoate-vilanterol combination was associated with an increase in trough FEV1 compared with fluticasone furoate-fluticasone propionate; however, observed differences may not be clinically significant. Studies comparing fluticasone furoate-vilanterol with fixed twice-daily ICS-LABA combinations are required.

### Efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate / vilanterol compared with fluticasone propionate / salmeterol combination in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma: a randomized trial [^115gEvuT]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The combination of fluticasone furoate (FF), a novel inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and vilanterol (VI), a long-acting β2 agonist, is under development as a once-daily treatment of asthma and COPD. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of FF/VI with fluticasone propionate (FP)/salmeterol (SAL) in patients with persistent asthma uncontrolled on a medium dose of ICS.

Methods

In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study, 806 patients received FF/VI (100/25 μg, n = 403) once daily in the evening delivered through ELLIPTA (GlaxoSmithKline) dry powder inhaler, or FP/SAL (250/50 μg, n = 403) bid through DISKUS/ACCUHALER (GlaxoSmithKline). The primary efficacy measure was 0- to 24-h serial weighted mean (wm) FEV1 after 24 weeks of treatment.

Results

Improvements from baseline in 0- to 24-h wmFEV1 were observed with both FF/VI (341 mL) and FP/SAL (377 mL); the adjusted mean treatment difference was not statistically significant (-37 mL; 95% CI, -88 to 15, P = 0.162). There were no differences between 0- to 4-h serial wmFEV1, trough FEV1, and asthma control and quality-of-life questionnaire scores. There was no difference in reported exacerbations between treatments. Both treatments were well tolerated, with no clinically relevant effect on urinary cortisol excretion or vital signs and no treatment-related serious adverse events.

Conclusions

The efficacy of once-daily FF/VI was similar to bid FP/SAL in improving lung function in patients with persistent asthma. No safety issues were identified.

### Fluticasone furoate / vilanterol 200 / 25 mcg in Asian asthma patients: a randomized trial [^111M2CmF]. Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This study investigated the efficacy and safety of the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) combination fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) in Asian asthma patients.

Methods

A 12-week, double-blind, double-dummy, active-comparator, parallel-group, multicenter study. 309 Asian asthma patients (≥ 12 years, uncontrolled with high-strength ICS or mid-dose ICS/LABA) were randomized (1:1) and included in the intent-to-treat population; 155 received once-daily FF/VI 200/25 mcg and 154 received twice-daily fluticasone propionate (FP) 500 mcg. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in daily evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) averaged over 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints were mean change from baseline in % rescue-free 24-h periods, daily morning PEF, % symptom-free 24-h periods, and overall Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score. Safety assessments were performed.

Results

For change from baseline in daily evening PEF, the adjusted mean treatment difference for FF/VI versus FP of 28.5 L/min (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.1, 36.9) was clinically and statistically significant (p < 0.001). For change from baseline in % rescue-free 24-h periods, the adjusted mean treatment difference (1.0%; 95% CI: -7.3, 9.2) was not statistically significant (p = 0.821). Statistical significance could not be inferred for the remaining endpoints due to the statistical hierarchy employed. Incidence of on-treatment adverse events was similar with FF/VI (26%; 3% treatment-related; n = 1 serious) and FP (27%; 3% treatment-related; n = 2 serious); none were fatal. No further safety concerns were identified.

Conclusions

FF/VI improved evening PEF over 12 weeks versus FP in Asian patients, with a similar safety profile. The results are generally consistent with a global study comparing the same treatments.

### Medical uses… [^113YJXrq]. Wikipedia (2020). Medium credibility.

Fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol, sold under the brand name Trelegy Ellipta among others, is a fixed-dose combination inhaled medication that is used for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The medications work in different ways: fluticasone furoate is an inhaled corticosteroid, umeclidinium is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist, and vilanterol is a long-acting beta-agonist. In 2023, it was the 118th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. Medical uses The combination fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol product is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration with an indication for the maintenance treatment of a chronic lung problem called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults who have already tried fluticasone.

furoate/vilanterol but are still experiencing symptoms of airway obstruction or who want to reduce the risk for COPD exacerbations and are already receiving umeclidinium and fluticasone furoate/vilanterol and would like to consolidate their inhaler therapy into a single product. Similarly, in the European Union, FF/UMEC/VI is indicated for the maintenance treatment in adults with moderate to severe COPD who are not adequately treated by an inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting beta-agonist combination or a LABA plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist combination. Because FF/UMEC/VI is for maintenance treatment, it is not used when people are experiencing acute symptoms consistent with worsening airway obstruction.

The 2018 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommend consideration for ICS/LABA/LAMA triple therapy provided that the person with COPD has received optimal non-pharmacologic management, is experiencing acute COPD exacerbations, and their COPD has worsened their quality of life. The 2020 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines recommend consideration for triple therapy for people with COPD that — despite ICS/LABA therapy — are persistently breathless, cannot exercise due to their symptoms, or develop further exacerbations. Contraindications Fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol is contraindicated in people who are allergic to any of the individual medication components or who are severely allergic to milk proteins. This is because each dose of FF/UMEC/VI is formulated with lactose monohydrate, a portion of which contains detectable milk proteins. Adverse effects The adverse effects of fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol include those that are characteristic of its individual components. For example, there is a risk for anticholinergic side effects due to umeclidinium. Effects on the cardiovascular system, such as increased pulse, elevated blood pressure, and abnormal heart rhythms, can occur due to vilanterol. Fluticasone furoate, as an inhaled corticosteroid, can cause side effects that are characteristic of corticosteroids, such as decreased bone mineral density, adrenal suppression, and a weakened immune system.

Survival: Survival with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg was not significantly improved compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.88; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.04). Mortality per 100 patient-years was 3.1 for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg, 3.5 for placebo, 3.2 for fluticasone furoate, and 3.4 for vilanterol.

Lung Function: A reduction of 8 mL/year was estimated on-treatment for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg compared with placebo in the rate of lung function decline as measured by FEV1(95% CI: 1, 15).

Exacerbations: Treatment with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg reduced the on-treatment annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations by 29% compared with placebo (95% CI: 22, 35). Treatment with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg reduced the annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations by 19% compared with fluticasone furoate (95% CI: 12, 26) and by 21% compared with vilanterol (95% CI: 14, 28). The on-treatment annual rate of moderate/severe exacerbations was 0.25 for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg, 0.35 for placebo, 0.31 for fluticasone furoate, and 0.31 for vilanterol.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are insufficient data on the use of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA or its individual components, fluticasone furoate and vilanterol, in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. (See Clinical Considerations .) In an animal reproduction study, fluticasone furoate and vilanterol administered by inhalation alone or in combination to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis produced no fetal structural abnormalities. The highest fluticasone furoate and vilanterol doses in this study were approximately 5 and 40 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation doses (MRHDID) of 200 and 25 mcg, respectively. (See Data .)

The estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk: In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women should be closely monitored, and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal control of asthma.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily fluticasone furoate / vilanterol (FF / VI) versus twice-daily inhaled corticosteroids / long-acting β-agonists (ICS / LABA) in patients with uncontrolled asthma: an open-label, randomized, controlled trial [^111XxerZ]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A variety of different fixed-dose combinations of inhaled corticosteroids/long-acting β 2 -agonists (ICS/LABA) are available for the treatment of asthma. The aim of this 24-week, open-label, multicenter, Phase IIIb randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI; 100/25 or 200/25 μg) compared with twice-daily fixed combinations of ICS/LABA (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol [FP/S] and budesonide/formoterol [BUD/F]) as maintenance therapy in patients with uncontrolled asthma treated with ICS alone.

Methods

Adult patients with documented physician-diagnosed asthma ≥ 1 year with an Asthma Control Test (ACT) score ≥ 15 and < 20 were included. The primary study endpoint was change from baseline in ACT total score at Week 12.

Results

Overall, 423 patients were randomized to receive study medication in France and Germany. The least-squares mean change (standard error) in ACT total score at Week 12 was 3.6 units with FF/VI and 2.8 with usual ICS/LABA, giving a treatment difference of 0.8 (95% confidence interval 0.1, 1.5; p = 0.033). Non-inferiority of FF/VI to usual ICS/LABA was confirmed at Weeks 6, 18 and 24. The observed safety profile for FF/VI in this study was in line with previous experience with FF/VI.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that, in a tightly controlled randomized controlled trial setting, once-daily FF/VI provides similar asthma control over 24 weeks to usual, twice-daily ICS/LABA in patients with asthma that is uncontrolled on ICS alone. FF/VI was well tolerated.

### Efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate 100 μ g and 200 μ g once daily in the treatment of moderate-severe asthma in adults and adolescents: a 24-week randomised study [^111BKs7H]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

FF 100 μg and 200 μg resulted in improvements from baseline in lung function and symptomatic endpoints in a population of moderate-severe asthma patients uncontrolled on mid-high dose ICS, and displayed an acceptable safety profile. The AEs seen in this study were consistent with those expected in this patient population. There were no treatment-related serious AEs, and no safety signals of clinical concern were seen with either dose. As in previous studies testing clinical dosages of FF, alone or with vilanterol, there was no evidence of cortisol suppression in patients receiving either dose.

A numerically greater effect of FF 200 μg was observed for FEV 1 and for attainment of asthma control, with similar effects seen with both doses of FF for rescue-free and symptom-free 24-hour periods. A placebo control was not included in this study, as FF 100 μg has previously been shown to be superior to placebo in a number of studies, and it was not thought to be ethical for patients symptomatic on mid-high dose ICS to receive placebo for 24 weeks. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether incremental benefits of the higher FF dose could be seen in a population with a requirement for high-dose ICS. In this study, it was observed that patients using higher-dose ICS at baseline showed a comparatively greater lung function benefit with FF 200 μg than with FF 100 μg. Improvements from baseline were seen for all secondary endpoints with both FF 100 μg and FF 200 μg, with little difference between treatments for most secondary endpoints. Clinically meaningful improvement in ACT score was seen with both strengths of FF in both strata, and patients treated with FF 200 μg were 42% more likely to be well controlled (ACT score ≥ 20) after 24 weeks than those receiving FF 100 μg. However, it is important to note that none of the CIs for the primary and secondary treatment comparisons excluded the null value, and the study was not designed to statistically test for a differential treatment effect on any efficacy endpoint.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114pbuzs]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) are an add-on option at Step 5 (or at Step 4, non-preferred because of weaker evidence for benefit) in combination or separate inhalers for patients with uncontrolled asthma despite ICS-LABA, and modestly improve lung function but not symptoms or quality of life with a small reduction in exacerbations; for patients with exacerbations, ensure that ICS is increased to at least medium dose before considering need for add-on LAMA. Medications include tiotropium, ≥ 6 years, by mist inhaler, added to separate ICS-LABA, and combination ICS-LABA-LAMA inhalers for adults ≥ 18 years: beclometasone-formoterol-glycopyrronium; fluticasone furoate-vilanterol-umeclidinium; mometasone-indacaterol-glycopyrronium. Delivery is pMDI or DPI or mist inhaler, and adverse effects are uncommon but include dry mouth and urinary retention.

### Once-daily fluticasone furoate (FF) / vilanterol reduces risk of severe exacerbations in asthma versus FF alone [^111cQkoz]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

In summary, this study confirms that the combination of FF/VI 100/25 μg administered once daily in the evening to adolescents and adults with moderate asthma significantly reduced the risk of severe asthma exacerbations, improved lung function and led to asthma control in a larger proportion of patients than FF 100 μg. Both treatments were well tolerated with similar safety profiles and a low incidence of treatment-related AEs and SAEs, and no increased risk of serious asthma-related events was seen with the addition of VI.

In Track 2 of asthma management, the reliever is an as-needed SABA. Even though SABAs can provide quick relief for asthma symptoms, over-users are less likely to perceive their health and asthma control as excellent, often unaware that frequent usage can worsen control. We were curious whether FF/VIL could be used for both maintenance and reliever therapy, an approach that could help to prevent the overuse of SABAs. Therefore, we conducted this real-world study to evaluate lung function improvements, exacerbation rates, quality of life, and biomarkers (fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO], blood eosinophil count) in asthma patients treated with BUD/FOR as SMART versus FF/VIL as MART.

### Fluticasone furoate / vilanterol… [^116kK9cA]. Wikipedia (2013). Low credibility.

Fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, sold under the brand names Breo Ellipta and Relvar Ellipta among others, is a combination medication for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. It contains fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid, and vilanterol, an ultra-long-acting β₂ agonist. In 2013, the drug was approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration for long-term maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in people with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and the European Medicines Agency approved it as a second-line therapy for the treatment of COPD and asthma. There were, however, concerns that LABAs such as vilanterol increase the risk of deaths due to asthma. In 2017, the FDA states that they were not justified. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

In 2023, it was the 139th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. History Approval The combination was approved by the FDA for use as a long-term, once-daily, maintenance treatment in people with COPD in 2013. The FDA label was changed in April 2015, to add an indication for a once-daily treatment of asthma in people aged 18 years of age and older. The exclusivity for a new product ended in May 2016, in the United States, and the exclusivity on the indication for asthma expired on 30 April 2018. The patent for both indications expired in August
2021. The European Medicines Agency authorized the combination for marketing in November 2013. Society and culture Commercial information GlaxoSmithKline manufactures the combination. As of December 2015, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol inhalation powder was approved for marketing in 73 countries, and had been launched in 45 countries.

Within the brand name, the Ellipta is the dry powder inhaler that the medication is administered in. Innoviva developed the active substance vilanterol, and receives royalties on sales. Research There is tentative evidence as of 2016, that it is better than placebo for asthma. Evidence is less strong in children. References Categories:

### Fluticasone / formoterol combination therapy is as effective as fluticasone / salmeterol in the treatment of asthma, but has a more rapid onset of action: an open-label, randomized study [^113X31dV]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases, affecting an estimated 300 million people worldwide. Its prevalence continues to rise in parallel with the increasing urbanization of communities around the world, and an estimated 100 million more people may be affected by 2025. At an individual level, asthma can have a considerable impact on the quality of life of both patients with asthma and their caregivers. The vast economic burden of asthma comprises both direct costs, such as emergency care, hospitalizations and medications, and indirect costs, largely driven by absenteeism and reduced productivity. In many regions, asthma-associated mortality has declined in recent years, in line with improved management strategies. Despite this, it is estimated that asthma still accounts for approximately 1 in 250 deaths worldwide.

Recent data from Europe suggest that over 50% of patients have asthma that is not well controlled. This is largely due to suboptimal use of their medication. It has been suggested that inadequate levels of asthma control account for over half of the existing economic cost of the disease. Furthermore, patient and physician perceptions of treatment effectiveness in practice may be inaccurate. The International Asthma Patient Insight Research (INSPIRE) study revealed that 87% of patients with asthma that was not well controlled classed their asthma control as relatively good. Coupled with inaccuracies in physicians' assessments of their patients' asthma control levels, these misconceptions probably contribute to the poor adherence of patients to asthma therapy.

This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, 24-week study (NCT02301975/GSK study 201378). Patients whose asthma met study-defined criteria for control were randomized 1:1:1 to receive FF/VI, FP/SAL or twice-daily FP 250 µg for 24 weeks. Primary endpoint was change from baseline in evening trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1). Secondary endpoints included rescue-/symptom-free 24-hour periods. Safety was also assessed.

Results

The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 1504 randomized and treated patients (504 FF/VI; 501 FP/SAL; 499 FP); mean age 43.5 years, 64% female. FF/VI demonstrated non-inferiority (using a margin of -100 mL) to FP/SAL for evening trough FEV 1 at Week 24 (ITT: 19 mL [95% confidence interval (CI) -11 to 49]; per protocol population [N = 1336]: 6 mL [95% CI -27 to 40]). Improvement in evening trough FEV 1 at Week 24 for both FF/VI (123 mL; p < 0.001) and FP/SAL (104 mL; p < 0.001) was greater than FP. FF/VI increased rescue-/symptom-free 24-hour periods by 1.2%/1.2% compared with FP/SAL. All treatments were well tolerated. On-treatment adverse event (AE) rates were 43% to 45% across arms; there were no drug-related serious AEs.

Conclusions

FF/VI was non-inferior to FP/SAL for evening trough FEV 1 at 24 weeks. These data suggest that patients well controlled on FP/SAL could step across to FF/VI without loss of control.

### Once-daily fluticasone furoate (FF) / vilanterol reduces risk of severe exacerbations in asthma versus FF alone [^115DgVCh]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Safety

Safety endpoints relating to severe asthma exacerbations included the number of hospitalisations, emergency department/urgent care visits, unscheduled healthcare provider visits and intubations for an asthma event. General safety and tolerability endpoints including vital signs were monitored (see online supplementary appendix).

Patients were withdrawn from the study if they experienced three on-treatment severe asthma exacerbations in any 6-month period or four throughout the treatment period.

Statistical analysis

Three hundred and thirty events were required to provide 90% power to detect a 30% reduction in risk (HR 0.70) of severe asthma exacerbation at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. The total sample size of 2000 (1000 per treatment arm) was based on assumptions of 10% loss to follow-up, 20% of patients in the FF arm having ≥ 1 severe asthma exacerbations per year and a recruitment pattern as specified in the protocol.

The primary efficacy endpoint was analysed by Cox proportional hazards analysis (FF/VI vs FF) of time to first severe asthma exacerbation, incorporating terms for baseline FEV 1, sex, age and region. A Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to examine treatment interactions with these covariates. Statistical methods for the secondary and other efficacy endpoints and sensitivity analyses including the interim analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint are described in the online supplementary appendix. All efficacy and safety analyses were carried out in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population other than those specified as being carried out in the per protocol (PP) population (see online supplementary appendix). The decision to exclude a patient or some of a patient's data from the PP population was made prior to breaking the blinding.

### Efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate 100 μ g and 200 μ g once daily in the treatment of moderate-severe asthma in adults and adolescents: a 24-week randomised study [^115XPhz9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects approximately 300 million individuals worldwide. Effective maintenance therapy in asthma can improve lung function, minimise symptoms and reduce the likelihood of exacerbations that can result in hospitalisation and mortality. Anti-inflammatory medications, primarily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of maintenance treatment of all severities of asthma. Despite the well-documented effectiveness of maintenance therapy in alleviating the symptoms of asthma in randomised controlled trials, non-adherence to anti-inflammatory medication is a significant problem in clinical practice, even in patients with severe asthma. A number of factors have been found to contribute to non-adherence in this patient population, one of which is dosing frequency. Hence, an efficacious, once-daily, inhaled ICS with a good safety profile may benefit patients and provide better outcomes in asthma management.

Fluticasone furoate (FF) is a new ICS in development for the treatment of asthma and–in combination with vilanterol, a new long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA)–for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. FF is structurally distinct from fluticasone propionate (FP) and has demonstrated a longer duration of action than FP in vitro. In addition, an in vitro study of the glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity of FF compared with that of other ICS, FF displayed a markedly greater affinity and high retention in human lung tissue. Once-daily dosing of FF is non-inferior to the same total dose of FF given twice daily, and once-daily doses of FF 100 μg and 200 μg are effective in improving lung function and asthma symptoms in 8-week studies of patients with asthma uncontrolled on low- or mid-dose ICS, with an acceptable safety profile. Once-daily FF 200 μg has been shown to produce similar improvements in trough FEV 1 to twice-daily FP 500 μg over 24 weeks in patients with moderate-severe asthma and is considered to be high-dose ICS. Once-daily FF 100 μg has been shown to produce similar improvements in trough FEV 1 over 24 weeks to twice-daily FP 250 μg in patients uncontrolled on low-mid dose ICS. Previous data have suggested that FF 200 μg may be more effective than FF 100 μg in improving lung function in more severely impaired patients (FEV 1 ≤ 65% predicted). Pharmacokinetic analysis of FF has showed that the absolute bioavailability of FF is 14%, and that systemic exposure is dose proportional. In healthy subjects, there were no apparent safety issues, even at supra-therapeutic doses.

14.2 Asthma

Adult Patients

The efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA for the maintenance treatment of asthma was based on data from 4 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials (Trial 8 [NCT01165138], Trial 9 [NCT01686633], Trial 10 [NCT01134042] and Trial 12 [NCT01086384]). While these 4 trials enrolled pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age, these trials only support efficacy in adults [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. In addition, patients in these trials were treated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg once daily by oral inhalation, which is not the approved recommended dosage for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Trials 8, 9, and 10 were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA given once daily in patients who were not controlled on their current treatments of ICS or combination therapy consisting of an ICS plus a LABA. Trial 12 (24- to 76-week exacerbation trial) was designed to demonstrate that treatment with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg significantly decreased the risk of asthma exacerbations as measured by time to first asthma exacerbation when compared with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg. This trial enrolled patients who had 1 or more asthma exacerbations in the year prior to trial entry. The demographics of these 4 trials and the comparator trial (Trial 13, NCT01147848) are provided in Table 8.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are insufficient data on the use of BREO ELLIPTA or its individual components, fluticasone furoate and vilanterol, in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. (See Clinical Considerations.) In an animal reproduction study, fluticasone furoate and vilanterol administered by inhalation alone or in combination to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis produced no fetal structural abnormalities. The highest fluticasone furoate and vilanterol doses in this study were approximately 5 and 40 times the maximum recommended human daily inhalation doses (MRHDID) of 200 and 25 mcg, respectively. (See Data.)

The estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryofetal Risk: In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women should be closely monitored, and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal control of asthma.

Day 1

Day 168

The second co-primary variable was change from baseline in trough FEV1following the final treatment day. At Day 169, both Trials 1 and 2 demonstrated significant increases in trough FEV1for all strengths of the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol combination compared with placebo (Table 7). The comparison of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg with vilanterol did not achieve statistical significance (Table 7).

Trials 1 and 2 evaluated FEV1as a secondary endpoint. Peak FEV1was defined as the maximum postdose FEV1recorded within 4 hours after the first dose of trial medicine on Day 1 (measurements recorded at 5, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, and 4 hours). In both trials, differences in mean change from baseline in peak FEV1were observed for the groups receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg compared with placebo (152 and 139 mL, respectively). The median time to onset, defined as a 100-mL increase from baseline in FEV1, was 16 minutes in patients receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg.

Exacerbations: Trials 3 and 4 were randomized, double-blind, 52-week trials designed to evaluate the effect of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA on the rate of moderate and severe COPD exacerbations. All patients were treated with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 mcg twice daily during a 4-week run-in period prior to being randomly assigned to 1 of the following treatment groups: fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol 50/25 mcg, or vilanterol 25 mcg.

### The salford lung study protocol: a pragmatic, randomised phase III real-world effectiveness trial in asthma [^111xu9kk]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Novel therapies need to be evaluated in normal clinical practice to allow a true representation of the treatment effectiveness in real-world settings.

Methods/Design

The Salford Lung Study is a pragmatic randomised controlled trial in adult asthma, evaluating the clinical effectiveness and safety of once-daily fluticasone furoate (100 μg or 200 μg)/vilanterol 25 μg in a novel dry-powder inhaler, versus existing asthma maintenance therapy. The study was initiated before this investigational treatment was licensed and conducted in real-world clinical practice to consider adherence, co-morbidities, polypharmacy, and real-world factors.

Primary Endpoint

Asthma Control Test at week 24; safety endpoints include the incidence of serious pneumonias. The study utilises the Salford electronic medical record, which allows near to real-time collection and monitoring of safety data.

Discussion

The Salford Lung Study is the world's first pragmatic randomised controlled trial of a pre-licensed medication in asthma. Use of patients' linked electronic health records to collect clinical endpoints offers minimal disruption to patients and investigators, and also ensures patient safety. This highly innovative study will complement standard double-blind randomised controlled trials in order to improve our understanding of the risk/benefit profile of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol in patients with asthma in real-world settings.

### Once-daily inhaled fluticasone furoate and vilanterol versus vilanterol only for prevention of exacerbations of COPD: two replicate double-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trials [^114em6Mz]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether the combination of a once-daily inhaled corticosteroid with a once-daily longacting β(2) agonist is more protective than a once-daily longacting β(2) agonist alone against exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is unknown. We hypothesised that fluticasone furoate and vilanterol would prevent more exacerbations than would vilanterol alone.

Methods

We did two replicate double-blind parallel-group 1 year trials. Both studies began on Sept 25, 2009. Study 1 ended on Oct 31, 2011, and study 2 on Oct 17, 2011. Eligible patients were aged 40 years or older, had a history of COPD, a smoking history of 10 or more pack-years, a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) to forced vital capacity of 0.70 or less after bronchodilators (and an FEV(1) of 70% or less of predicted), and a documented history of one or more moderate or severe disease exacerbations in the year before screening. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) on the basis of the Registration and Medication Ordering System to 25 μg vilanterol alone or 25 μg vilanterol combined with either 50 μg, 100 μg, or 200 μg fluticasone furoate once daily. Our primary endpoint was the yearly rate of moderate and severe exacerbations. The trials were analysed separately and a pooled analysis was also done. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01009463 and NCT01017952).

Findings

1622 patients in study 1 and 1633 patients in study 2 were randomly assigned. In study 1, no significant difference in exacerbation rate was noted between the 200/25 μg fluticasone furoate/vilanterol group and the vilanterol only group (mean 0.90 events vs 1.05 events per year; ratio 0.9 [95% CI 0.7–1.0]). Because of the statistical hierarchy used, we could not infer significance for the 50 μg and 100 μg groups. In study 2, significantly fewer moderate and severe exacerbations were noted in all fluticasone furoate/vilanterol groups than in the vilanterol only group (p = 0.0398 for the 50 μg group, 0.0244 for the 100 μg group, and 0.0004 for the 200 μg group). In the pooled analysis, significantly fewer moderate and severe exacerbations were noted in all fluticasone furoate/vilanterol groups than in the vilanterol only group (0.0141 for the 50 μg group, < 0.0001 for the 100 μg group, and 0.0003 for the 200 μg group). Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported adverse event in both studies. Pneumonia and fractures were reported more frequently with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol than with vilanterol alone. Eight deaths from pneumonia were noted in the fluticasone furoate/vilanterol groups compared with none in the vilanterol only group.

Interpretation

Addition of fluticasone furoate to vilanterol was associated with a decreased rate of moderate and severe exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of exacerbation, but was also associated with an increased pneumonia risk.

### Stopping long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) for children with asthma well controlled on LABA and inhaled corticosteroids [^1125sh21]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common chronic medical condition among children and is one of the most common causes of hospitalisation and medical visits. Poorly controlled asthma often leads to preventable exacerbations that require additional medications, hospital stays, or treatment in the emergency department. Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) are the preferred add-on treatment for children with asthma whose symptoms are not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a 'black box' warning for LABA in asthma, and now recommends that they be used "for the shortest duration of time required to achieve control of asthma symptoms and discontinued, if possible, once asthma control is achieved".

Objectives

To compare the effect on asthma control and adverse effects of stepping down to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-only therapy versus continuing ICS plus LABA in children whose asthma is well controlled on combined ICS and LABA therapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, and also searched www. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.who.int/ictrp/en/, reference lists of primary studies and existing reviews, and manufacturers' trial registries (GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca). We searched all databases from their inception to the present, and imposed no restriction on language of publication. The most recent search was done in April 2015.

Selection Criteria

We looked for parallel randomised controlled trials of at least eight weeks' duration, available as published full text, abstract only, or unpublished data. We excluded studies including participants with other chronic respiratory comorbidities (for example bronchiectasis). We looked for studies in which children (18 years or younger) whose asthma was well controlled on any dose of ICS and LABA combination therapy were randomised to: a) step-down therapy to ICS alone or b) continued use of ICS and LABA. We included any dose of LABA (formoterol, salmeterol, vilanterol) and any dose of ICS (beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, mometasone, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate, fluticasone furoate, triamcinolone) delivered in a combination inhaler or in separate inhalers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all records identified in the searches. We used a data extraction tool in Microsoft Excel to manage searches and document reasons for inclusion and exclusion, and to extract descriptive and numerical data from trials meeting the inclusion criteria. The prespecified primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring oral steroids, asthma control, and all-cause serious adverse events.

Main Results

Despite conducting extensive searches of electronic databases, trial registries and manufacturers' websites we identified no trials matching the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates, we screened 1031 abstracts, and assessed 43 full-text articles for inclusion. We identified several adult studies, which will be summarised in a separate review (Ahmad 2014). The most common reasons for exclusion after viewing full texts were 'wrong comparison' (n = 22) and 'adult population' (n = 18). Some adult studies recruited adolescents from age 15, but none reported data separately for those under 18.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence from randomised trials to inform the discontinuation of LABAs in children once asthma control is achieved with ICS plus LABA. It is disappointing that such an important issue has not been studied, and a randomised double-blind trial recruiting children who are controlled on ICS plus LABA is warranted. The study should be large enough to assess children of different ages, and to measure the important safety and efficacy outcomes suggested in this review over at least six months. The only randomised evidence for stopping LABA has been conducted in adults; it will be summarised in a separate review.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily fluticasone furoate 50 mcg in adults with persistent asthma: a 12-week randomized trial [^115BCHPE]. Respiratory Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Failure to achieve asthma control can impact patients' daily lives and results in persistent symptoms, more frequent exacerbations and absenteeism from work and school. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective anti-inflammatory treatments for all severities of persistent asthma. Patient adherence is a key component to the overall success of asthma treatment, and it has been demonstrated that compliance with a once-daily ICS is better than with a twice-daily regimen.

Fluticasone furoate (FF) is a novel once-daily ICS treatment for asthma, which is also used in combination with the long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) vilanterol (VI) for the once-daily treatment of asthma and COPD. Animal and human pharmacology studies show that FF has a long duration of action and prolonged retention in the lung, suggesting it is appropriate for once-daily dosing. As part of the overall FF clinical development program, a dose-ranging study (25–200 mcg doses of FF) showed that FF 50 mcg administered over 8 weeks was the minimum dose required to achieve significant improvements in evening trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) and the percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods compared with placebo.

This 12-week study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily FF 50 mcg dosed in the evening in asthma patients aged ≥ 12 years who were uncontrolled on short-acting β 2 -agonists (SABA) and/or leukotriene modifying agent. One other study with FF 50 mcg has been published, which was an 8-week dose ranging study. Two phase III studies of longer duration (of which this is one) comparing FF 50 mcg with placebo have been conducted in SABA only patients, to determine whether FF 50 mcg is a suitable starting dose for asthma patients not already using a controller medication. Preliminary results have been presented in abstract form.

5.1 Serious Asthma-Related Events – Hospitalizations, Intubations, Death

Use of Long-acting Beta2-adrenergic Agonist (LABA) as monotherapy (without ICS) for asthma is associated with an increased risk of asthma-related death [see Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial (SMART)]. Available data from controlled clinical trials also suggest that use of LABA as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric patients. These findings are considered a class effect of LABA monotherapy. When LABA are used in fixed-dose combination with ICS, data from large clinical trials do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma‑related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared with ICS alone (see Serious Asthma-Related Events with Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-Acting Beta -Adrenergic Agonists).

Serious Asthma-Related Events with Inhaled Corticosteroid/Long-Acting Beta -Adrenergic Agonists

Four (4) large, 26-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical safety trials were conducted to evaluate the risk of serious asthma-related events when LABA were used in fixed‑dose combination with ICS compared with ICS alone in patients with asthma. Three (3) trials included adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older: 1 trial compared budesonide/formoterol with budesonide, 1 trial compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder, and 1 trial compared mometasone furoate/formoterol with mometasone furoate. The fourth trial included pediatric patients aged 4 to 11 years and compared fluticasone propionate/salmeterol inhalation powder with fluticasone propionate inhalation powder. The primary safety endpoint for all 4 trials was serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death). A blinded adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma related.

Methods

Systematic literature review

A systematic literature review was conducted to identify Phase III and Phase IV parallel-group RCTs of any ICS/LABA maintenance therapies vs any drug comparator(s). Studies of > 8 weeks duration, in ≥ 10 patients aged ≥ 12 years, with an established diagnosis of COPD at any severity warranting treatment (defined as % predicted forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV 1] ≤ 80%), who were receiving ICS or ICS/LABA maintenance therapy at randomisation, were included. Studies examining only short-acting beta agonists or short-acting muscarinic antagonists aimed at symptom control were excluded. RCTs of FF/VI were identified internally using the same criteria.

Studies were identified through the systematic searching of clinical publication databases and clinical trial registers (Additional file 1). Additionally, references in retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews were checked for further studies that might fulfil the inclusion criteria. No date limits were applied to the searches.

### Can severe asthmatic patients achieve asthma control? A systematic approach in patients with difficult to control asthma followed in a specialized clinic [^11665dxY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Our study has important clinical implications. Patients classified as GINA steps 4 and 5 followed at our asthma clinic for at least 4 years, with free access to anti-inflammatory therapies, educational programs and proper evaluation of factors associated with non-control composed our population. Given the lack of control add on therapy would be the next natural step to be implemented in everyday practice. Our systematic low cost and widely available protocol with optimised IC + LABA + short course oral corticosteroid was able to control 25% of patients. The rising cost of medicine and the pressure to incorporate new technologies are crucial issues when discussing non-infectious chronic diseases. Even in developed countries there is a consensus that the incorporation of high-cost asthma treatments is justified only to a select group of patients. Our results highlight the importance of a thorough assessment before considering the indication of these costly treatments.

Materials and methods

Study patients

This retrospective study was conducted at the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, China Medical University Hospital, Taiwan, from October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2023. The inclusion criteria were patients: (1) aged 20 years or older; (2) diagnosed with asthma based on clinical symptoms and spirometry characteristics, including diurnal peak expiratory flow (PEF) variability of over 20%, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) improvement of over 12% and 200 mL after 400 μg inhaled salbutamol, clinical symptoms (e.g. difficulty breathing, cough, sputum production, wheezing), and lifetime asthma risk; (3) with data on FeNO, serum eosinophil count; (4) who received combination therapy with an ICS + LABA (e.g. BUD/FOR or FF/VIL) as MART; and (5) classified as steps 3 and 4 according to the GINA guidelines.

The exclusion criteria were patients: (1) diagnosed with cancer; (2) who had previously received biological agents such as omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, or dupilumab; (3) treated with triple therapy (ICS + LABA + LAMA); (4) who had used short-acting bronchodilators as rescue inhalers in the past 6 months, including monotherapy such as SABAs or combination therapy: SABA + short-acting muscarinic antagonist; and (5) with insufficient available data for further analysis or those lost to follow-up. The enrolled patients were divided into two groups. One group received BUD/FOR as MART, while the other received FF/VIL as MART for asthma control. Patients being treated with FF/VIL as MART were administered either FF/VIL 92/22 μg or FF/VIL 184/22 μg as 1 puff once daily (QD), with the option to take more puffs when they experienced discomfort. All patients participated in healthcare case management to enhance their health outcomes and healthcare quality. The study received approval from the China Medical University Hospital Institutional Review Board (CMUH112-REC1–175). The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the observational and retrospective nature of the study design.

### Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol [^116T16Bt]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary endpoint was time to first asthma exacerbation. Asthma exacerbation was defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroid for at least 3 days or an in‑patient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroid. Rate of asthma exacerbation was a secondary endpoint. The hazard ratio from the Cox Model for the analysis of time to first asthma exacerbation for fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg compared with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg was 0.795 (95% CI: 0.642, 0.985). This represents a 20% reduction in the risk of experiencing an asthma exacerbation for patients treated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg compared with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg (P = 0.036). Mean yearly rates of asthma exacerbations of 0.14 and 0.19 in patients treated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg compared with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, respectively, were observed (25% reduction in rate; 95% CI: 5%, 40%).

Comparator Trial

Trial 13 was a 24-week trial that compared the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg once daily with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 mcg twice daily (N = 806). Patients receiving mid-dose ICS (fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily or equivalent) entered a 4‑week run-in period during which all patients received fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in weighted mean FEV1(0 to 24 hours) at Week 24.

### Comparison of budesonide / formoterol versus fluticasone furoate / vilanterol as maintenance and reliever therapy for asthma control: a real-world observational study [^112Y2As4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous studies have reported reduced acute exacerbation rates and improved symptom control in asthma patients treated using inhaled corticosteroids plus formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy (MART). Fluticasone furoate (FF) and vilanterol (VIL) also provide rapid bronchodilation and sustained anti-inflammatory effects, however no studies have investigated FF/VIL as MART for asthma control.

Methods

From October 1, 2021 to September 30, 2023, this retrospective study included asthma patients classified as step 3 or 4 according to the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines, who were then divided into two groups. One group received BUD/FOR as MART, while the other received FF/VIL as MART. Pulmonary function tests, exacerbation rates, Asthma Control Test (ACT), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, and blood eosinophil counts were measured before and after 12 months of treatment.

Results

A total of 161 patients were included, of whom 36 received BUD/FOR twice daily as MART, and 125 received FF/VIL once daily as MART. After 12 months of treatment, the FF/VIL group showed a significant increase in ACT scores by 1.57 (p < 0.001), while the BUD/FOR group had an increase of 0.88 (p = 0.11). In terms of FeNO levels, the BUD/FOR group experienced a decline of -0.2 ppb (p = 0.98), whereas the FF/VIL group had a mild increase of+0.8 ppb (p = 0.7). Notably, there was a significant difference in the change of FeNO between the two groups (∆ FeNO: -0.2 ppb in BUD/FOR;+0.8 ppb in FF/VIL, p < 0.001). There were no significant alterations observed in FEV1, blood eosinophil count, or acute exacerbation decline in either group.

Conclusions

In the current study, patients treated with FF/VIL as MART showed improvements in ACT scores, while those treated with BUD/FOR as MART exhibited a reduction in FeNO levels. However, the difference between the two treatment groups did not reach clinical significance. Thus, FF/VIL as MART showed similar effectiveness to BUD/FOR as MART.

### Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol [^114SLdi5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Trial 9 was a 12-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg, and fluticasone furoate 100 mcg in patients with asthma. This trial did not have a placebo arm. The incidence of adverse reactions associated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg and fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg is shown in Table 4.

24-Week Trial

Trial 10 was a 24-week trial that evaluated the efficacy of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg once daily, fluticasone furoate 200 mcg once daily, and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily in patients with asthma. This trial did not have a placebo arm. In addition to the reactions shown in Tables 3 and 4, adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 2% of patients treated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg included viral respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pyrexia, and arthralgia.

12-Month Trial

Long-term safety data are based on a 12-month trial that evaluated the safety of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg once daily (n = 201), fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg once daily (n = 202), and fluticasone propionate 500 mcg twice daily (n = 100) in patients with asthma (Trial 11). In addition to the reactions shown in Tables 3 and 4, adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 2% of the patients treated with fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg for 12 months included pyrexia, back pain, extrasystoles, upper abdominal pain, respiratory tract infection, allergic rhinitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, arthralgia, supraventricular extrasystoles, ventricular extrasystoles, acute sinusitis, and pneumonia.

### Efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate / vilanterol compared with fluticasone propionate / salmeterol combination in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma: a randomized trial [^114Cf3F7]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

No differences in Asthma Control Test scores or in measures of quality of life (AQLQ+12 and EQ-5D) were shown in the present study. A difference of 1.4 was observed between groups on the EQ-5D test, but this difference was not statistically significant. The outcomes of the post hoc analysis suggest that FF/VI may provide clinically relevant improvements in certain patient-reported quality-of-life measures (environmental domain of the AQLQ+12 in the present study), as well as in the percentage of patients who improved by at least the minimally important difference of 0.5, that were not reported with FP/SAL. However, this statement is speculative and requires further evaluation in real-world studies outside the environment of a clinical trial.

FF/VI and FP/SAL were well tolerated, and FF/VI had a similar AE profile to FP/SAL. The AE profile with FF/VI reported in the present study is consistent with that seen in the two FF dose-ranging studies that included the 100 μg once-daily dose, and the two studies of VI 25 μg plus concurrent ICS. Most of the SAEs reported in the present study were single events, and none were considered treatment related. Asthma exacerbations requiring hospitalization occurred in one patient receiving FF/VI and two patients receiving FP/SAL.

Step 3: Double the 'low' daily ICS dose plus as-needed SABA — before any step up in treatment is considered, confirm that the symptoms are due to asthma rather than a concomitant or alternative condition, check and correct inhaler technique (consider alternative delivery systems if indicated), confirm good adherence with the prescribed dose, and enquire about risk factors such as exposure to allergens or tobacco smoke; the preferred option is medium-dose ICS by doubling the initial low dose, which may be the best option, and response should be assessed after 3 months; consider specialist referral, and the child should be referred for expert assessment if symptom control remains poor and/or flare-ups persist, or if side-effects of treatment are observed or suspected; other options are that addition of a LTRA to low-dose ICS may be considered; for ICS in combination with a long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) in young children, there are insufficient data in children < 4 years old to recommend their use, and in a short-term (8 week) placebo-controlled study there was no significant difference in symptoms between combination fluticasone propionate-salmeterol versus fluticasone propionate alone, with no additional safety signals noted in the group receiving LABA.

### Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol trifenatate (breo ellipta) [^1166uvV2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of fluticasone / vilanterol INH (also known as Breo Ellipta) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. Evidence of fetal harm in animals. Monitor neonates for signs of hypoadrenalism. Women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma are at increased risk of perinatal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age neonates. Closely monitor pregnant women and adjust medication for optimal asthma control. Although there are no studies, because of the potential for β-agonist interference with uterine contractility, use during labor should be restricted to those in whom benefits clearly outweigh risks. The drug fluticasone / vilanterol INH (also known as Breo Ellipta) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human foetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of foetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Blood eosinophil counts, exacerbations, and response to the addition of inhaled fluticasone furoate to vilanterol in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a secondary analysis of data from two parallel randomised controlled trials [^114648vL]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The short-term benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are greater in patients with evidence of eosinophilic airway inflammation. We investigated whether blood eosinophil count is a useful biomarker of the long-term effect of the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone furoate on exacerbation frequency.

Methods

We did a post-hoc analysis of data from two replicate, randomised, double-blind trials of 12 months' duration (Sept 25, 2009 to Oct 21, 2011 and Oct 17, 2011) in which once a day vilanterol 25 μg was compared with 25 μg vilanterol plus 50 μg, 100 μg, or 200 μg fluticasone furoate in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and a history of one or more exacerbation in the previous year. We compared exacerbation rates according to two baseline eosinophil cell count strata (< 2% and ≥ 2%), and according to four baseline percentage groupings. We also assessed lung function and incidence of pneumonia per strata in treatment groups.

Findings

We included 3177 patients in the analyses, with 2083 patients (66%) having an eosinophil count of 2% or higher at study entry. Across all doses of inhaled corticosteroids, fluticasone furoate and vilanterol reduced exacerbations by 29% compared with vilanterol alone (mean 0.91 vs 1.28 exacerbations per patient per year; p < 0.0001) in patients with eosinophil counts of 2% or higher, and by 10% (0.79 vs 0.89; p = 0.2827) in patients with eosinophil counts lower than 2%. Reductions in exacerbations with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol, compared with vilanterol alone, were 24% in patients with baseline eosinophil counts of ≥ 2- < 4%, 32% for those with counts of 4- < 6%, and 42% for those with eosinophil counts of ≥ 6%. In patients treated with vilanterol alone, exacerbation rates increased progressively with increasing eosinophil count percentage category. Improvement in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and the increased risk of pneumonia with fluticasone furoate and vilanterol compared with vilanterol alone were not associated with eosinophil count.

Interpretation

Blood eosinophil count is a promising biomarker of response to inhaled corticosteroids in patients with COPD. Blood eosinophil count could potentially be used to stratify patients for different exacerbation rate reduction strategies.

### Efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate / vilanterol compared with fluticasone propionate / salmeterol combination in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma: a randomized trial [^11686RVE]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Sample size calculations were based on the primary end point of 0- to 24-h serial wmFEV 1 at the end of the 24-week treatment period for the treatment comparison of FF/VI 100/25 μg once daily vs FP/SAL 250/50 μg bid. It was estimated that approximately 348 patients with evaluable data per treatment group would provide 90% power to detect a difference of 80 mL between FF/VI 100/25 μg and FP/SAL 250/50 μg; this assumed an SD of 325 mL. Details about the analysis populations and power calculation are provided in.

The primary analysis was performed on the intention-to-treat population with an analysis of covariance model allowing for the effects of baseline FEV 1, region, sex, age, and treatment group. A two-sided 5% risk (significance level) associated with incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis was considered acceptable for this study. For the secondary and other efficacy end points, if the statistical test for the primary end point failed to reject the null hypothesis of no treatment difference at the 0.05 significance level, the tests for the secondary and other efficacy end points were to be interpreted as descriptive only.

As a consequence of site audits conducted by the study sponsor GlaxoSmithKline, concerns about the quality of data supplied were identified for two study centers. These centers contributed 57 patients (7% of enrolled patients) to the study. Because of these concerns, analysis of the primary end point was repeated, excluding the data from these two centers. Results were consistent with the primary analysis. The authors and study sponsor are satisfied that the exclusion of data derived from these centers did not materially change the findings of the study; therefore, we present a complete data set from all the centers.

### Once-daily fluticasone furoate / vilanterol 100 / 25 mcg versus twice daily combination therapies in COPD-mixed treatment comparisons of clinical efficacy [^113Z4JRo]. Respiratory Research (2015). Low credibility.

Change from baseline SGRQ total score

FF/VI 100/25 mcg, FP/SAL 500/50 mcg and BUD/FORM 400/12 mcg were all associated with significant improvement in estimated mean SGRQ score relative to placebo. The mean improvement observed with FF/VI 100/25 mcg (−4.599 units) exceeded the MCID of 4 units and was numerically greater than that seen with FP/SAL 500/50 mcg (−3.278) or BUD/FORM 400/12 mcg (−3.635) (Additional file 1: e-Table S2).

Based on a non-inferiority margin of 2 units (half the MCID), FF/VI 100/25 mcg demonstrated 99% probability of non-inferiority to FP/SAL 500/50 mcg and 98% probability of non-inferiority to BUD/FORM 400/12 mcg for change from baseline SGRQ score. Using a 3-unit margin, FF/VI had > 99% probability of non-inferiority to both FP/SAL and BUD/FORM. No significant covariate effects on the change from baseline SGRQ Total score outcome were identified in the main analysis.

Sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis of an enlarged network (Additional file 1: e-Figure S1) was conducted for the exacerbations outcome. Six additional studies which did not require patients to have an explicit history of exacerbations were added to the primary analysis network of 15 studies. The findings of this sensitivity analysis (Additional file 1: e-Table S5) were similar to those of the primary analysis, and the CrIs for comparisons of FF/VI 100/25 mcg remained wide; thus, it was not possible to draw conclusions on non-inferiority of FF/VI 100/25 mcg on exacerbation rate from the sensitivity analysis. Separate sensitivity analyses of the exacerbation rate calculations using alternative assumptions for patients lost to follow-up reached similar conclusions to the primary analysis (Additional file 1: e-Table S6). Findings of a sensitivity analysis of the SGRQ outcome in which two studies were excluded from the network were similar to those of the primary analysis.

### Vilanterol and fluticasone furoate for asthma [^112Lnxii]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Vilanterol (VI) is a long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA) that binds to the beta 2 -adrenoceptor on the airway smooth muscle, producing bronchodilation. LABA therapy, which is well established in adults as part of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) Guidelines for the Management of Asthma, leads to improvement in symptoms and lung function and reduction in exacerbations. At present, the commonly used LABAs licensed for use in asthma management (formoterol and salmeterol) require twice-daily administration, whereas VI is a once-daily therapy. Fluticasone furoate (FF) is an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and ICS therapy is recommended by the BTS asthma guidelines. ICSs, the mainstay of asthma treatment, lead to a reduction in both airway inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness. Regular use leads to improvement in symptoms and lung function. ICSs are currently recommended as 'preventer' therapy for patients who use a 'reliever' medication (e.g. short-acting beta 2 agonist (SABA), salbutamol) three or more times per week. Most of the commonly used ICS treatments are twice-daily medications, although two once-daily products are currently licensed (ciclesonide and mometasone). At the present time, only one once-daily ICS/LABA combination (FF/VI) is available, and several other combination inhalers are recommended for twice-daily administration.

Objectives

To compare effects of VI and FF in combination versus placebo, or versus other ICSs and/or LABAs, on acute exacerbations and on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adults and children with chronic asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of trials, clinical trial registries, manufacturers' websites and reference lists of included studies up to June 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults and children with a diagnosis of asthma. Included studies compared VI and FF combined versus placebo, or versus other ICSs and/or LABAs. Our primary outcomes were health-related quality of life, severe asthma exacerbation, as defined by hospital admissions or treatment with a course of oral corticosteroids, and serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and analysed outcomes using a fixed-effect model. We used standard Cochrane methods.

Main Results

We identified 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 6641 randomised participants, of whom 5638 completed the study. All studies lasted between two and 78 weeks and showed good methodological quality overall. We included 10 comparisons in this review, seven for which the dose of VI and FF was 100/25 mcg (VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs placebo; VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs same dose of FF; VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs same dose of VI; VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs fluticasone propionate (FP) 500 mcg twice-daily; VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) 250/50 mcg twice-daily; VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs FP/SAL 250/25 mcg twice-daily; FF/VI 100/25 vs FP/SAL500/50) and three for which the dose of VI and FF was 200/25 mcg (VI/FF 200/25 mcg vs placebo; VI/FF 200/25 mcg vs FP 500 mcg; VI/FF 200/25 mcg vs same dose of FF). We found very few opportunities to combine results from the 14 included studies in meta-analyses. We tabulated the data for our pre-specified primary outcomes. In particular, we found insufficient information to assess whether once-daily VI/FF was better or worse than twice-daily FP/SAL in terms of efficacy or safety. Only one of the 14 studies looked at health-related quality of life when comparing VI and FF 100/25 mcg versus placebo and identified a significant advantage of VI/FF 100/25 mcg (mean difference (MD) 0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 0.46; 329 participants); we recognised this as moderate-quality evidence. Only two studies compared VI/FF 100/25 mcg versus placebo with respect to exacerbations; both studies reported no exacerbations in either treatment arm. Five studies (VI/FF 100/25 mcg vs placebo) sought information on serious adverse events; all five studies reported no serious adverse events in the VI/FF 100/25 mcg or placebo arms. We found no comparison relevant to our primary outcomes for VI/FF at a higher dose (200/25 mcg) versus placebo. The small number of studies contributing to each comparison precludes the opportunity to draw robust conclusions for clinical practice. These studies were not of sufficient duration to allow conclusions about long-term side effects.

Authors' Conclusions

Some evidence suggests clear advantages for VI/FF, in combination, compared with placebo, particularly for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) and peak expiratory flow; however, the variety of questions addressed in the included studies did not allow review authors to draw firm conclusions. Information was insufficient for assessment of whether once-daily VI/FF was better or worse than twice-daily FP/SAL in terms of efficacy or safety. It is clear that more research is required to reduce the uncertainties that surround interpretation of these studies. It will be necessary for these findings to be replicated in other work before more robust conclusions are revealed. Only five of the 13 included studies provided data on health-related quality of life, and only six recorded asthma exacerbations. Only one study focused on paediatric patients, so no conclusions can be drawn for the paediatric population. More research is needed, particularly in the primary outcome areas selected for this review, so that we can draw firmer conclusions in the next update of this review.

### Overall asthma control achieved with budesonide / formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy for patients on different treatment steps [^117E1Hzt]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A major objective of the 2006 revision of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines was to simplify the process of assessing patients' treatment needs at both initial and follow-up visits. Instead of assessing "asthma severity" using severity classification tables, a simplified assessment of current asthma control is recommended and treatment is either initiated or altered according to the assessed control status. This approach has, with some modification, been adopted in most international and recent versions of national treatment guidelines and has been well received by practising clinicians. Central to this approach are the treatment steps defining initial maintenance treatment and recommendations for stepping up or stepping down treatment. These are based on treatment response - whether or not current clinical control is achieved and maintained. Thus, patients failing Step 2 treatment, on a low dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), might be moved up to Step 3 where the preferred option for adolescents and adults is the addition of a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA). At Step 4, an increase in ICS dose or the addition of another controller medication (e.g. a leukotriene modifier or sustained-release theophylline) is recommended in order to achieve control. However, in the significant proportion of patients in which control is not achieved, Step 5 management may be considered, recognising that lack of control is associated with a higher risk of exacerbations, poor quality of life and other adverse outcomes.

Difficult-to-Treat and Severe Asthma in Adults and Adolescents

Detailed information is provided in the GINA 2021 pocket guide on difficult-to-treat and severe asthma, including an integrated decision tree for diagnosis and management across primary and specialist care. A brief summary is included below.

Assessment and Optimization of Therapy

Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA treatment or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations.

Severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite good adherence with optimized high-dose ICS–LABA therapy and management of contributory factors or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma.

Assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and to identify and manage factors that commonly contribute to symptoms, poor quality of life, and/or exacerbations. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS–LABA, assess the clinical and inflammatory phenotype, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Refer for expert advice if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing Step 4 or 5 treatment (or earlier, if needed).

### Once-daily fluticasone furoate / vilanterol vs once-daily fluticasone furoate in patients with asthma aged 5 to 17 years [^113Yizrs]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data exist comparing inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus adjunctive therapy vs ICS alone in pediatric asthma patients.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI) vs FF in children and adolescents with asthma.

Methods

This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study (NCT03248128) included participants aged 5 to 17 years with six months or more asthma history uncontrolled on ICS monotherapy. Participants received 4-week open-label fluticasone propionate (100 µg) twice daily before 1:1 randomization to 24-week double-blind FF (50 µg:100 µg) or FF/VI (50/25 µg:100/25 µg) once daily. Two populations with different primary endpoints were analyzed to meet United States (week 12 weighted mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1; 0–4 hours]; participants aged 5–17 years) and European (change from baseline predose morning peak expiratory flow [ΔAM PEF] averaged over weeks 1–12; participants aged 5–11 years) regulatory requirements.

Results

Overall, 902 participants, including 673 children aged 5 to 11 years, were randomized and treated. In participants aged 5 to 17, week 12 weighted mean FEV 1 (0–4 hours) was greater with FF/VI vs FF (difference: 0.083 L; P < .001). In participants aged 5 to 11, ΔAM PEF over weeks 1 to 12 showed numerical improvement with FF/VI vs FF but was not statistically significant (difference: 3.2 L/min; p = 0.228). No drug-related serious adverse events or deaths were reported.

Conclusion

FF/VI significantly improved weighted mean FEV 1 (0–4 hours; participants aged 5–17 years), but not ΔAM PEF (participants aged 5–11 years) vs FF. No new safety concerns were apparent.

Spirometry

The mean FEV1/FVC ratio, FEV1%, and FVC% were 77.1%, 88.8%, and 95.5% in the BUD/FOR group, and 80.9%, 91.6%, and 92.6% in the FF/VIL group. After 12 months of treatment, there was an improvement in FEV1 in patient treated with FF/VIL though it was not significant (Fig. 3). There was no significant difference in the improvement of FEV1 between groups (∆ FEV1%: -0.06% in BUD/FOR vs. 1.26% in FF/VIL; p = 0.186) (Table 2).

### Uncontrolled asthma: a retrospective cohort study in Japanese patients newly prescribed with medium-/ high-dose ICS / LABA [^112fd7Hz]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In general, these findings concur with the evidence from the previous reports on patient-related risk factors for uncontrolled asthma. These findings suggest that patients with uncontrolled asthma represent a more medically "at-risk" group, being older, having more comorbidities, and a higher rate of exacerbations. Therefore, uncontrolled asthma is associated with susceptibility for negative health consequences.

In terms of indicators for uncontrolled asthma in these two cohorts, a treatment step up with LTRA or presentation with moderate exacerbation were the two most frequent reasons identified in both cohorts. It has been suggested that the popularity of LTRA as an add-on treatment for asthma, over other add-on treatment options, may be due to the Japanese patient preference for oral medications over inhaled agents.

For both ICS/LABA cohorts, the predictors suggesting the greatest risk of uncontrolled asthma were prescription of maintenance systemic corticosteroids and evidence of asthma exacerbation in the pre-index period. Evidence of these two factors in the pre-index period may be suggestive of poor asthma control or severe asthma. The association between asthma exacerbation and poor asthma control is well documented, with uncontrolled asthma more likely in those patients with more frequent exacerbations. Exacerbation rate is known to increase with disease severity, and a history of exacerbations is predictive of an increased risk of subsequent exacerbations. Being able to identify and subsequently target patients at risk of exacerbations is likely to lead to more effective asthma management. Index year was also shown to significantly impact patients' risk of uncontrolled asthma, suggesting that asthma patients in earlier years (e.g. 2010) were more likely to be uncontrolled. This may reflect the introduction, in Japan, of different ICS/LABAs (e.g. budesonide/formoterol, fluticasone/formoterol, fluticasone/vilanterol) during the timeframe of 2010 to 2015 (only fluticasone/salmeterol was available before 2010), and therefore asthma patients in subsequent years may have been better controlled as a result. In the present study, female sex was found to be a significant predictor of uncontrolled asthma in both ICS/LABA cohorts. This is in line with previous studies which have shown that female sex was associated with increased risk of time-to-first exacerbations. Factors such as greater susceptibility to allergen triggers and increased prevalence of comorbidities have been suggested to contribute to poor symptom control in female patients with asthma compared to male patients.

### Fluticasone furoate and vilanterol [^117UfPKh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

aAlthough these trials included pediatric patients 12 to 17 years of age, the data only support the efficacy in adult patients.

Patients receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg (Trial 9) or fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg (Trial 10) had significantly greater improvements from baseline in percentage of 24-hour periods without need of beta2-agonist rescue medication use and percentage of 24-hour periods without asthma symptoms compared with patients receiving fluticasone furoate 100 mcg or fluticasone furoate 200 mcg, respectively. In a descriptive analysis (Trial 9), patients receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 200/25 mcg had numerical improvements from baseline in percentage of 24-hour periods without need of beta2‑agonist rescue medication use and percentage of 24-hour periods without asthma symptoms compared with patients receiving fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg.

Trial 12 was a 24- to 76-week event-driven exacerbation trial that evaluated whether fluticasone furoate/vilanterol ELLIPTA 100/25 mcg significantly decreased the risk of asthma exacerbations as measured by time to first asthma exacerbation when compared with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg in patients with asthma. Patients receiving low- to high-dose ICS (fluticasone propionate 100 mcg to 500 mcg twice daily or equivalent) or low- to mid-dose ICS plus a LABA (fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 100/50 mcg to 250/50 mcg twice daily or equivalent) and a history of 1 or more asthma exacerbations that required treatment with oral/systemic corticosteroid or emergency department visit or in-patient hospitalization for the treatment of asthma in the year prior to trial entry, entered a 2-week run-in period during which LABA treatment was stopped. Patients reporting symptoms and/or rescue beta2-agonist medication use during the run-in period were continued in the trial.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Maintenance Treatment of Asthma

The recommended starting dosage of TRELEGY ELLIPTA for maintenance treatment of asthma is fluticasone furoate 100 mcg, umeclidinium 62.5 mcg, and vilanterol 25 mcg (1 actuation of TRELEGY ELLIPTA 100/62.5/25 mcg) or fluticasone furoate 200 mcg, umeclidinium 62.5 mcg, and vilanterol 25 mcg (1 actuation of TRELEGY ELLIPTA 200/62.5/25 mcg) once daily, by oral inhalation.

When choosing the starting dosage strength of TRELEGY ELLIPTA, consider the patients' disease severity; their previous asthma therapy, including the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dosage; as well as the patients' current control of asthma symptoms and risk of future exacerbation.
The maximum recommended dosage is 1 inhalation of TRELEGY ELLIPTA 200/62.5/25 mcg once daily.
For patients who do not respond adequately to TRELEGY ELLIPTA 100/62.5/25 mcg once daily, increasing the dose to TRELEGY ELLIPTA 200/62.5/25 mcg once daily may provide additional improvement in asthma control. For patients who do not respond adequately to TRELEGY ELLIPTA 200/62.5/25 mcg once daily, re-evaluate and consider other therapeutic regimens and additional therapeutic options.
If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (rescue medicine, e.g., albuterol) should be used for immediate relief.

### Fluticasone furoate: once-daily evening treatment versus twice-daily treatment in moderate asthma [^116qcRHg]. Respiratory Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A variety of treatments are available for asthma but there remains potential to improve the level of disease control in adults and children. Failure to achieve asthma control affects patients' daily lives, for example through persistent symptoms, more frequent exacerbations and missed work and school time, placing demands on emergency care facilities. Further improvements to the range of therapeutic options for asthma are needed so that patients can achieve better disease control.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective controller medications for the first-line treatment of asthma in adults and children and are also used at later stages in combination with other medications, specifically long-acting beta 2 agonists (LABA). ICS are typically developed for twice-daily dosing but once-daily evening dosing of an ICS has been reported to significantly improve adherence to therapy compared with twice-daily dosing (93.3% vs. 89.3% [p < 0.001] as measured by automatic dose counter) in an open-label 12 week study of mometasone furoate. This is a benefit that has the potential to improve patient outcomes, given the association between poor adherence rates (particularly for controller medications) and uncontrolled asthma in children and adults, and the reported correlation between falling rates of adherence to ICS and higher rates of asthma-related hospitalization in adults.

Secondary and other efficacy endpoints

The rate of severe asthma exacerbations per patient per year was significantly lower in the FF/VI 100/25 μg group than in the FF 100 μg group (0.14 vs 0.19), a reduction in rate of 25% (95% CI 5% to 40%; p = 0.014). The number of patients experiencing ≥ 1 on-treatment severe asthma exacerbation was also lower in the FF/VI group: 186 patients (18%) with FF (271 exacerbations in total) versus 154 patients (15%) with FF/VI (200 exacerbations in total). The mean duration of a severe asthma exacerbation was 11 days in both groups. Online supplementary figure E4 shows the number and duration of severe asthma exacerbations experienced by individual patients during the study.

Trough FEV 1 increased over the treatment period in both the FF and FF/VI treatment groups (figure 3 and onlineE5). FF/VI demonstrated statistically significant improvements over FF in trough FEV 1, with adjusted mean changes of 83–95 mL (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

In summary, patients treated with FF/VIL as MART showed improvements in ACT scores, while those treated with BUD/FOR as MART exhibited a reduction in FeNO levels. However, the difference between the two treatment groups did not reach clinical significance. Our results indicate that FF/VIL as MART has comparable clinical effectiveness to BUD/FOR as MART. Nevertheless, larger prospective randomized controlled studies are necessary to validate these findings.

Choosing Initial Asthma Treatment

When choosing the track and starting step for initial treatment (Boxes 3–4A–3–4D in Reference), consider not only the patient's current symptoms and risk of exacerbations but also practical issues, including medication access (availability and cost), inhaler technique, likely adherence, and patient preferences. Before starting, record evidence for the diagnosis of asthma, the patient's symptom control and risk factors, including lung function, and check that they can use the inhaler correctly. Provide education and skills training, and schedule a follow-up visit to assess the response (Figure 2).

During ongoing treatment, medication may be adjusted up or down within the same track (i.e. with the same reliever) or may be switched between tracks, depending on patient needs. However, for patients prescribed as-needed-only ICS–formoterol (Steps 1–2) or MART (Steps 3–5), beware of risks to the patient if their ICS–formoterol is switched without consultation (e.g. in health systems where medication substitution by pharmacists or nurses is permitted) to a combination nonformoterol ICS–LABA, as these are not suitable for as-needed use.

Stepping Down to Find the Minimum Effective Dose

When good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2–3 months, consider stepping down to find the lowest effective step. Do not completely withdraw ICS, except if needed temporarily while confirming the diagnosis of asthma. Adults and adolescents with well-controlled asthma while on daily low-dose controller therapy can step down to either as-needed ICS–formoterol or to as-needed ICS + SABA taken together (Box 3–7 in Reference).

Stepping Up if Asthma Remains Uncontrolled

Before considering any sustained step up, first check inhaler technique, adherence, persistent allergen exposure and comorbidities.

There is no evidence to support specific recommendations about when to increase from as-needed-only ICS–formoterol in Steps 1–2 to Step 3 MART by adding maintenance ICS–formoterol, but it should be prompted by factors such as ongoing use of as-needed ICS–formoterol on most days of the week or further exacerbations.

Discussion

In this study of patients aged ≥ 12 years with persistent asthma uncontrolled on a medium dose of ICS, FF/VI 100/25 μg once daily in the evening was not significantly different from FP/SAL 250/50 μg bid for the primary end point of 0- to 24-h serial wmFEV 1 at week 24 or for any of the secondary end points. The AE profiles for both treatments were similar, and those AEs reported with FP/SAL were consistent with those previously reported with this drug combination.

Patients were symptomatic on a medium dose of ICS at baseline. According to current asthma guidelines, these patients would require a step up in their asthma treatment from step 3 to 4. Lack of asthma control in the patient population at baseline was evident by an FEV 1 of approximately 68% of the predicted normal value for both groups and by the fact that ≥ 50% of patients had an Asthma Control Test score of < 20. The goal of asthma treatment is to control asthma symptoms. A number of studies have shown that nonadherence to asthma therapy is an important reason for loss of asthma control in some patients. ‐ Adherence to the treatment schedule was high during the study (> 94% in both groups), although the artificial setting of a clinical trial may have encouraged normally nonadherers to take their medication. If poor adherence to the dosing schedule is an important factor in loss of asthma control, then once-daily dosing (as opposed to bid dosing) such as that provided by FF/VI may represent a more-convenient treatment option for patients in a real-world setting.

### Safety and tolerability of the novel inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone furoate in combination with the β ₂ agonist vilanterol administered once daily for 52 weeks in patients ≥ 12 years old with asthma: a randomised trial [^112wrghC]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended for patients with symptomatic asthma taking as-needed short acting bronchodilators. Long-acting β 2 agonists (LABA) are recommended in combination with ICS for patients who remain symptomatic on low–medium dose ICS alone. The ICS, fluticasone furoate (FF), together with the LABA, vilanterol (VI), are in development as a novel, single-inhaler, once-daily ICS/LABA combination for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. By simplifying the dosing regimen, FF/VI could potentially increase patient adherence and thereby control of asthma symptoms. Results from three dose-ranging phase II studies with FF once daily in asthma (25–200 µg;100–400 µg;200–800 µg) show that FF doses of 100 µg and 200 µg are effective with an acceptable tolerability and safety profile across a range of asthma severities. Separate phase II studies with VI in asthma support administration of 25 µg once daily.

The objectives of this study were to assess the safety and tolerability of 52 weeks of treatment with two strengths of inhaled FF/VI (100/25 µg and 200/25 µg) administered once daily in the evening in patients ≥ 12 years of age with asthma.

Stepping down treatment when asthma is well controlled — once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 2–3 months and lung function has reached a plateau, treatment can often be successfully reduced without loss of asthma control; aims are to find the patient's minimum effective treatment to maintain good control of symptoms and exacerbations and to minimize costs and potential for side-effects, and to encourage continued ICS-containing treatment, noting that patients on maintenance controller treatment often experiment with intermittent treatment and that for patients prescribed GINA Track 1 MART the ICS-formoterol reliever provides a safety net during planned step-down or if adherence with maintenance doses is poor.

### The efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate / umeclidinium / vilanterol (FF / UMEC / VI) on cough symptoms in adult patients with asthma, a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study: chronic cough in asthma (COCOA) study [^113FhNaw]. The Journal of Asthma (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Persistent cough bothers many patients with asthma because it worsens their quality of life; therefore, it must be remedied immediately. The efficacy of triple therapy as a first-line treatment for cough remains unclear. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the triple therapy against persistent cough, the clinical effect of regular treatment with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) or placebo in adult patients with asthma was investigated.

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicenter trial recruited asthma patients with persistent cough from hospitals and primary care clinics between June 2022 and December 2023. Participants were randomly given FF/UMEC/VI 200/62.5/25µg or placebo for 6 wk. The primary endpoint was the average change in the cough symptom score from baseline to week 6. Secondary outcomes were effectiveness on cough-related disease burdens (asthma control questionnaire [ACQ]-5, Leicester cough questionnaire [LCQ] and nighttime awakening). Furthermore, lung function and adverse events were evaluated.

Results

The decrease from baseline in the cough symptom score at week 6 was significantly greater in the FF/UMEC/VI group than in the placebo group (p = 0.006). The ACQ-5 scores showed a greater decrease in the FF/UMEC/VI group than in the placebo group. The change from baseline in morning and evening FEV 1 increased in the FF/UMEC/VI group as with the results of peak expiratory flow. No significant adverse events associated with FF/UMEC/VI were noted.

Conclusions

In asthma patients with persistent cough, FF/UMEC/VI showed an early response and a significant effect on cough and lung function for 6 wk of treatment.

This study is registered with jRCTs031210412.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116bZAF1]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma pharmacotherapy — controller and reliever management: In GINA Track 1, controller treatment is delivered through an anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR), low-dose ICS-formoterol, taken when symptoms occur and before exercise or allergen exposure; in Steps 3–5, the patient also takes maintenance controller treatment as daily or twice-daily ICS-formoterol, which is called "maintenance-and-reliever therapy" (MART), and the dose and regimen of controller medications should be optimized to minimize the risk of medication side-effects, including risks of needing OCS. Reliever medications: all patients should be provided with a reliever inhaler for as-needed relief of breakthrough symptoms, including during worsening asthma or exacerbations. They are also recommended for short-term prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Relievers include the anti-inflammatory relievers ICS-formoterol and ICS-SABA, and SABA, while combination ICS-LABA with non-formoterol LABAs cannot be used as a reliever due to a slower onset of action (e.g. ICS-salmeterol) or due to lack of safety and/or efficacy with more than once-daily use (e.g. ICS-vilanterol, ICS-indacaterol); additionally, ICS-formoterol should not be used as the reliever for patients taking maintenance ICS-LABA with a non-formoterol LABA. Over-use of SABA (e.g., dispensing of three or more 200-dose canisters in a year, corresponding to average use more than daily) increases the risk of asthma exacerbations, and regular SABA also increases the risk of poor symptom control.

### Efficacy and safety of once-daily single-inhaler triple therapy (FF / UMEC / VI) versus FF / VI in patients with inadequately controlled asthma (CAPTAIN): a double-blind, randomised, phase 3A trial [^115Q8BN4]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Background

Despite inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β 2 -agonist (ICS/LABA) therapy, 30–50% of patients with moderate or severe asthma remain inadequately controlled. We investigated the safety and efficacy of single-inhaler fluticasone furoate plus umeclidinium plus vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) compared with FF/VI.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, phase 3A study (Clinical Study in Asthma Patients Receiving Triple Therapy in a Single Inhaler [CAPTAIN]), participants were recruited from 416 hospitals and primary care centres across 15 countries. Participants were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, with inadequately controlled asthma (Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]-6 score of ≥ 1.5) despite ICS/LABA, a documented health-care contact or a documented temporary change in asthma therapy for treatment of acute asthma symptoms in the year before screening, pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 between 30% and less than 85% of predicted normal value, and reversibility (defined as an increase in FEV 1 of ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL in the 20–60 min after four inhalations of albuterol or salbutamol) at screening. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1), via central based randomisation stratified by pre-study ICS dose at study entry, to once-daily FF/VI (100/25 μg or 200/25 μg) or FF/UMEC/VI (100/31.25/25 μg, 100/62.5/25 μg, 200/31.25/25 μg, or 200/62.5/25 μg) administered via Ellipta dry powder inhaler (Glaxo Operations UK, Hertfordshire, UK). Patients, investigators, and the funder were masked to treatment allocation. Endpoints assessed in the intention-to-treat population were change from baseline in clinic trough FEV 1 at week 24 (primary) and annualised moderate and/or severe asthma exacerbation rate (key secondary). Other secondary endpoints were change from baseline in clinic FEV 1 at 3 h post-dose, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score, and ACQ-7 total score, all at week 24. Change from baseline in Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in Asthma total score at weeks 21–24 was also a secondary endpoint but is not reported here. Exploratory analyses of biomarkers of type 2 airway inflammation on treatment response were also done. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02924688, and is now complete.

Findings

Between Dec 16, 2016, and Aug 31, 2018, 5185 patients were screened and 2439 were recruited and randomly assigned to FF/VI (100/25 μg n = 407; 200/25 μg n = 406) or FF/UMEC/VI (100/31.25/25 μg n = 405; 100/62.5/25 μg n = 406; 200/31.25/25 μg n = 404; 200/62.5/25 μg n = 408), with three patients randomly assigned in error and not included in analyses. In the intention-to-treat population, 922 (38%) patients were men, the mean age was 53.2 years (SD 13.1) and body-mass index was 29.4 (6.6). Baseline demographics were generally similar across all treatment groups. The least squares mean improvement in FEV 1 change from baseline for FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 μg versus FF/VI 100/25 μg was 110 mL (95% CI 66–153; p < 0.0001) and for 200/62.5/25 μg versus 200/25 μg was 92 mL (49–135; p < 0.0001). Adding UMEC 31.25 μg to FF/VI produced similar improvements (FF/UMEC/VI 100/31.25/25 μg vs FF/VI 100/25 μg: 96 mL [52–139; p < 0.0001]; and 200/31.25/25 μg vs 200/25 μg: 82 mL [39–125; p = 0.0002]). These results were supported by the analysis of clinic FEV 1 at 3 h post-dose. Non-significant reductions in moderate and/or severe exacerbation rates were observed for FF/UMEC 62.5 μg/VI versus FF/VI (pooled analysis), with rates lower in FF 200 μg-containing versus FF 100 μg-containing treatment groups. All pooled treatment groups demonstrated mean improvements (decreases) in SGRQ total score at week 24 compared with baseline in excess of the minimal clinically important difference of 4 points; however, there were no differences between treatment groups. For mean change from baseline to week 24 in asthma control questionnaire-7 score, improvements (decreases) exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of 0.5 points were observed in all pooled treatment groups. Adding UMEC to FF/VI resulted in small, dose-related improvements compared with FF/VI (pooled analysis: FF/UMEC 31.25 μg/VI versus FF/VI, -0.06 (95% CI -0.12 to 0.01; p = 0.094) FF/UMEC 62.5 μg/VI versus FF/VI, -0.09 (-0.16 to -0.02, p = 0.0084). By contrast with adding UMEC, the effects of higher dose FF on clinic trough FEV 1 and annualised moderate and/or severe exacerbation rate were increased in patients with higher baseline blood eosinophil count and exhaled nitric oxide. Occurrence of adverse events was similar across treatment groups (patients with at least one event ranged from 210 [52%] to 258 [63%]), with the most commonly reported adverse events being nasopharyngitis (51 [13%]-63 [15%]), headache (19 [5%]-36 [9%]), and upper respiratory tract infection (13 [3%]-24 [6%]). The incidence of serious adverse events was similar across all groups (range 18 [4%]-25 [6%)). Three deaths occurred, of which one was considered to be related to study drug (pulmonary embolism in a patient in the FF/UMEC/VI 100/31.25/25 μg group).

Interpretation

In patients with uncontrolled moderate or severe asthma on ICS/LABA, adding UMEC improved lung function but did not lead to a significant reduction in moderate and/or severe exacerbations. For such patients, single-inhaler FF/UMEC/VI is an effective treatment option with a favourable risk-benefit profile. Higher dose FF primarily reduced the rate of exacerbations, particularly in patients with raised biomarkers of type 2 airway inflammation. Further confirmatory studies into the differentiating effect of type 2 inflammatory biomarkers on treatment outcomes in asthma are required to build on these exploratory findings and further guide clinical practice.

### Efficacy and safety of fluticasone furoate / vilanterol compared with fluticasone propionate / salmeterol combination in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma: a randomized trial [^112KAhp2]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

For patients with asthma who remain uncontrolled despite inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy, a long-acting inhaled β 2 -agonist (LABA) may be added. Combination therapy improves symptoms, reduces severe exacerbation rate and achieves better asthma control in more patients than ICS monotherapy.‐ However, poor adherence to bid therapy may account for poor asthma control in some patients. For these patients, once-daily therapy could offer them greater convenience, thereby improving adherence.

Vilanterol (VI) (GW642444M) is a LABA with inherent 24-h activity in development as a once-daily treatment in combination with the novel ICS fluticasone furoate (FF) for asthma and COPD. Three dose-ranging FF studies in patients with persistent asthma showed significant improvements from baseline in lung function relative to placebo, with the 100 and 200 μg doses of FF (over 8 weeks) providing optimal efficacy with an acceptable tolerability profile. ‐ A VI dose-ranging study with concurrent ICS, also in persistent asthma, showed that the 25-μg dose of VI administered once daily over 4 weeks provided the most beneficial therapeutic ratio.

The main aim of the current study was to compare the efficacy of FF/VI 100/25 μg administered once daily in the evening with fluticasone propionate (FP)/salmeterol (SAL) 250/50 μg administered bid over a 24-week treatment period in patients aged ≥ 12 years with persistent asthma uncontrolled on medium-dose of ICS. The dose of FP/SAL selected was considered suitable for the patient population to be studied.
