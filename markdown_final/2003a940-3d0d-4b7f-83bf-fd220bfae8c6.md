## Question

borderline low b12 labs outisde of homocysteine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate borderline low vitamin B12 levels beyond relying on homocysteine alone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes "borderline low" B12 and why serum B12 is an imperfect screening tool. Then, I should verify the limitations of homocysteine and the rationale for preferring methylmalonic acid (MMA) as a confirmatory test. Next, I will consider the role of holotranscobalamin as an early marker, outline a practical diagnostic algorithm that integrates these markers, check for confounders and special populations, define an etiologic workup, frame interpretation using a biologically based model, and finally confirm monitoring and treatment decision points, including when to treat empirically if neurologic symptoms are present.

> Let me first confirm what "borderline low" means and why this matters clinically; serum B12 below 148 pmol/L (200 ng/L) is commonly used to define biochemical deficiency, but clinical deficiency can exist at higher levels, and there is no single gold-standard test, which means results must be interpreted in clinical context and with second-line testing when suspicion is high [^111jsvta] [^112TSbGP] [^115i7Tip].

> Wait, let me verify the pitfalls of homocysteine before I overinterpret it; homocysteine rises in both folate and B12 deficiency and is influenced by renal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, inflammatory states, and vascular events, so it lacks specificity for B12 and can be normal in B12-responsive conditions, meaning it should not be used in isolation to confirm or exclude functional B12 deficiency when serum B12 is borderline low [^114rbYbd] [^111bSo5m] [^112wjH6s] [^116X2VPz].

> I will now examine MMA as the primary confirmatory test because mechanistically MMA accumulates when adenosylcobalamin-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is impaired in B12 deficiency, giving it higher specificity than homocysteine for cellular B12 status; guidelines recommend MMA to clarify uncertainty when serum B12 is normal or low-normal, though I need to ensure I use local reference intervals and account for renal function when interpreting thresholds, since cutoffs such as 250–300 nmol/L vary by lab and kidney function and I almost defaulted to a single universal cut point without checking these nuances [^1119yqiD] [^114rbYbd] [^112TSbGP] [^115i7Tip] [^1137q35K].

> Hold on, I should verify the place of holotranscobalamin (holoTC), the biologically active B12 fraction bound to transcobalamin, which can fall early and may outperform total B12 for detecting early deficiency; BSH supports holoTC as a second-line test when clinical suspicion persists with B12 > 148 pmol/L, and its use is particularly helpful in pregnancy or when renal impairment complicates MMA interpretation, although availability varies and there remains a grey diagnostic zone [^1122MFVF] [^116cZtCK] [^114rnp3w] [^113WenGk] [^112TSbGP].

> Next, I should review an integrated diagnostic sequence rather than relying on any single marker; start with CBC and serum B12, and when B12 is borderline low with symptoms or risk factors, obtain MMA (and consider holoTC), confirm deficiency if MMA is elevated and treat, and if MMA is normal but suspicion remains high, consider holoTC, reassess confounders, or even a therapeutic trial of B12 while monitoring for clinical response, recognizing that a combined indicator approach using B12, MMA, and homocysteine can improve diagnostic accuracy over single markers in population datasets [^117XBUaq] [^112TSbGP] [^1119yqiD] [^1119yqiD].

> I need to ensure I adjust for confounders and special populations because they can obscure interpretation; renal insufficiency raises MMA and homocysteine so GFR-adjusted interpretation or prioritizing holoTC is prudent, small bowel bacterial overgrowth or short-bowel states can paradoxically yield high MMA with normal or high B12, pregnancy physiologically lowers serum B12 making holoTC preferable, post-bariatric surgery warrants MMA-based monitoring irrespective of serum B12, and medications like metformin or PPIs can cause deficiency despite normal B12, prompting use of functional markers [^1154TzaD] [^114Twg2C] [^115MpXif] [^114rnp3w] [^114GZbL6] [^1145Ydz3].

> Let me consider the etiologic workup once functional deficiency is established; pernicious anemia should be assessed with anti–intrinsic factor antibodies, and broader evaluation for malabsorption, dietary patterns, and culprit medications should follow, but I should not delay treatment if neurologic features are concerning, as guidelines prioritize preventing neurologic injury over diagnostic completeness in that circumstance [^112yFs6M] [^112TSbGP] [^114GZbL6].

> I should double-check how to frame interpretation biologically; a hierarchical model helps: adequate status when B12 and functional markers are normal, subclinical deficiency when borderline B12 coexists with elevated MMA, biochemical deficiency when B12 is frankly low with elevated MMA, and clinical deficiency when hematologic or neurologic features accompany biochemical abnormalities, and although emerging neurology literature suggests subtle neurologic impairment may occur at higher B12 levels than traditional cutoffs, I need to contextualize this as evolving evidence that complements but does not replace guideline thresholds [^115wscRB] [^116rzU6b] [^115saQSy].

> Next, I should review monitoring and response expectations; if untreated but under observation, recheck B12, MMA, and CBC in 3–6 months or sooner if symptoms evolve, whereas after initiating therapy, expect reticulocytosis by days 3–5 and MCV normalization within 4–8 weeks, recognize neurologic recovery can take months to years and is primarily a clinical assessment, and while some product labels advise periodic serum B12 monitoring to ensure adequacy, dose titration to biomarkers alone is discouraged for neurologic end-points [^116PAaeS].

> But wait, what if symptoms are severe or predominantly neurologic; I should confirm that in such cases empiric intramuscular B12 is appropriate without waiting for full biomarker confirmation, using BSH-recommended dosing regimens, while in less severe cases both high-dose oral and IM preparations are effective and choice can be individualized by urgency, absorption concerns, and patient preference, keeping in mind that lowering homocysteine alone does not improve cardiovascular outcomes and should not drive therapy decisions [^1129gYP1] [^1155r3od] [^112FxXC7] [^114GZbL6].

For borderline low B12 (148–221 pmol/L) [^1154xs65], **methylmalonic acid (MMA)** [^114rbYbd] is the most specific test for functional deficiency [^116X2VPz] and should be measured when B12 is borderline or clinical suspicion is high [^117XBUaq]. Holotranscobalamin (holoTC) is an **early marker** that can detect deficiency before total B12 falls [^114nWhuF], and a CBC with blood film may show macrocytosis or hypersegmented neutrophils [^117WuFCr] even with borderline B12 [^notfound]. Consider **anti–intrinsic factor antibodies** if pernicious anemia is suspected [^112yFs6M], and interpret all results in clinical context, as no single test is definitive [^112TSbGP].

---

## Methylmalonic acid (MMA)

- **Specificity**: MMA is a specific marker of B12 deficiency [^1154xs65], rising when B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is impaired [^114wg4C9] [^115i7Tip].

- **Clinical utility**: Measure MMA [^116X2VPz] when serum B12 is borderline [^1154xs65] or clinical suspicion persists despite normal B12 [^114wg4C9].

- **Interpretation**: MMA > 280 nmol/L suggests functional B12 deficiency, especially with normal renal function [^115i7Tip].

---

## Holotranscobalamin (holoTC)

- **Early marker**: HoloTC ("active B12") declines before total B12, detecting early deficiency [^114nWhuF].

- **Clinical utility**: Consider holoTC when available [^1122MFVF], particularly in borderline B12 or pregnancy, where total B12 is less reliable [^114rnp3w].

- **Interpretation**: Low holoTC supports early B12 deficiency, even with normal total B12 [^114nWhuF].

---

## Complete blood count (CBC) and blood film

Hematological findings include **macrocytosis** (elevated MCV), oval macrocytes, and **hypersegmented neutrophils** that can occur even with borderline B12 levels [^117WuFCr] [^111KL6H1]. Clinical utility — **CBC and blood film** are first-line tests for suspected B12 deficiency, especially when anemia or neurological symptoms are present [^111KL6H1] [^112tjkkV].

---

## Anti–intrinsic factor antibodies

Pernicious anemia — test for **anti–intrinsic factor antibodies** when pernicious anemia is suspected, even in the absence of anemia or malabsorption [^112yFs6M]. Clinical utility — positive results support **pernicious anemia** as the cause of B12 deficiency [^112yFs6M].

---

## Clinical context and interpretation

Clinical correlation — interpret laboratory results alongside **symptoms and risk factors**, as no single test is definitive [^111jsvta] [^112TSbGP]. Empiric treatment — consider **empiric B12 therapy** when clinical suspicion is strong, even if laboratory findings are inconclusive [^111jsvta] [^116DKJ4k].

---

## Summary of laboratory tests for borderline low B12

| **Laboratory test** | **Clinical utility** | **Interpretation** |
|-|-|-|
| Methylmalonic acid (MMA) | Specific marker of functional B12 deficiency | Elevated (> 280 nmol/L) indicates deficiency |
| Holotranscobalamin (holoTC) | Early marker of B12 deficiency | Low levels indicate early deficiency |
| Complete blood count (CBC) and blood film | Detects hematological abnormalities | - Macrocytosis <br/> - Hypersegmented neutrophils |
| Anti–intrinsic factor antibodies | Identifies pernicious anemia | Positive indicates pernicious anemia |

---

For borderline low B12, **prioritize MMA** for specificity [^116X2VPz], use holoTC for early detection [^114nWhuF], and assess the CBC and blood film for hematologic clues [^111KL6H1]; integrate results with the clinical context [^112TSbGP] and consider empiric treatment when clinical suspicion is high [^116DKJ4k].

### Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid in diagnosis and risk assessment from infancy to adolescence [^114rbYbd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

The concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) in serum and plasma is elevated in both folate and cobalamin deficiencies, whereas methylmalonic acid (MMA) in serum, plasma, or urine is a specific marker of cobalamin function. The combined measurement of both metabolites is useful for the diagnosis and follow-up of these deficiency states. In addition, tHcy is elevated under various pathologic states (e.g. renal failure), and hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnostic utility of tHcy and MMA concentrations as markers of folate and cobalamin deficiencies in healthy and diseased children has been documented.

This article briefly summarizes the biochemical background of tHcy and MMA and their associations with various disease states, focusing on novel data obtained in infants, children, and adolescents with an emphasis on cobalamin status in infants. The utility of tHcy and MMA as indicators of cobalamin and folate deficiencies in adults can be extended to infants and older children. Furthermore, as in adults, tHcy is related to unhealthy lifestyle factors and is a risk factor for vascular disease. High MMA concentrations in newborns, occasionally denoted as benign methylmalonic aciduria, may reflect impaired cobalamin function.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^112TSbGP]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of test results assessing cobalamin status because there is no 'gold standard' test to define deficiency. Serum cobalamin currently remains the first-line test, with additional second-line plasma methylmalonic acid to help clarify uncertainties of underlying biochemical/functional deficiencies. Serum holotranscobalamin has the potential as a first-line test, but an indeterminate 'grey area' may still exist. Plasma homocysteine may be helpful as a second-line test, but is less specific than methylmalonic acid. The availability of these second-line tests is currently limited.

Definitive cut-off points to define clinical and subclinical deficiency states are not possible, given the variety of methodologies used and technical issues, and local reference ranges should be established. In the presence of discordance between the test result and strong clinical features of deficiency, treatment should not be delayed to avoid neurological impairment. Treatment of cobalamin deficiency is recommended in line with the British National Formulary. Oral therapy may be suitable and acceptable provided appropriate doses are taken and compliance is not an issue. Serum folate offers equivalent diagnostic capability to red cell folate and is the first-line test of choice to assess folate status.

### Vitamin B12 and folate levels in healthy Swiss senior citizens: a prospective study evaluating reference intervals and decision limits [^114Twg2C]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Our study on subjectively healthy elderly Caucasian participants from a circumscribed geographical region shows for the first time that holoTC, but also vitamin B12 levels from 60 years onwards, remain within reference intervals set by international expert panels for people of all ages, whereas serum folate concentrations — though not RBC folate — recede to some extent. It was shown that MMA, Hcy, as well as Fedosov's wellness quotient, are more associated with kidney function than with age. Finally, we were able to present reference intervals and decision limits for the different markers investigated in the elderly.

An overwhelming proportion of the literature implies that, with progressing age, vitamin B12 and folate levels in senior citizens fall short of currently validated reference intervals, a finding that is challenged by our data obtained from participants apparently in good health and with a relatively uniracial background. Most other studies, on meta-analysis, reveal cohorts comprised of study subjects seeking treatment, already ill, or even subject to multimorbidity. The recruitment of study subjects apparently devoid of cognitive impairment might further augment the proportion of those with maintained vitamin B12 and folate levels now known to impact cognitive performance. With recent discoveries regarding the indispensable functions of vitamin B12 and folate in living organisms, it comes as little surprise that vitamin B12 and, to a lesser extent, folate, maintain their levels throughout our life cycle, or else the participating subjects would not have been…

### Guidelines for diagnosis and management of the cobalamin-related remethylation disorders cblC, cblD, cblE, cblF, cblG, cblJ and MTHFR deficiency [^113enpz1]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical patterns specific for MTHFR deficiency

MTHFR deficiency mainly presents in early childhood but can potentially present at any age, with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment. Neonates and young infants often manifest with feeding difficulties, decreased consciousness, hydrocephalus, and muscular hypotonia, with apnea being a frequent complication. Older infants and children frequently manifest with seizures and cognitive impairment, often displaying acquired microcephaly. With increasing age, peripheral neuropathy, gait abnormalities, and spasticity may become evident, and some older patients manifest with additional or even isolated behavioral or psychiatric disorders. Individuals with MTHFR deficiency do not usually present with hematological abnormalities. There are just a few reports of older children and adults with megaloblastic anemia in association with long-standing neurological manifestations.

- **Outcome: Timely clinical diagnosis**: We strongly recommend consideration of an acquired or genetic disorder of remethylation in the case of neurological and/or visual and/or hematological symptoms (quality of the evidence: moderate). We also strongly recommend considering an acquired or genetic disorder of remethylation in the case of unexplained thrombosis and/or spinal cord degeneration and/or atypical HUS (quality of the evidence: moderate).

### Fewer US adults had low or transitional vitamin B12 status based on the novel combined indicator of vitamin B12 status compared with individual, conventional markers, NHANES 1999–2004 [^1119yqiD]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2021). Low credibility.

Elevated plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) and/or total homocysteine (tHcy), as well as low serum vitamin B12 and/or holotranscobalamin (holoTC), are indicative of vitamin B12 deficiency. Combined indicators (cB12), which pool some or all four markers into an index, may be a more reliable diagnostic tool to overcome inconclusive diagnoses with individual markers.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to describe different cB12 score combinations and estimate the prevalence of low or transitional vitamin B12 status compared with individual markers.

- **Design**: Using cross-sectional data for B12, MMA, and tHcy in persons ≥ 20 years participating in NHANES 1999–2004 (n = 12,335), we examined raw and covariate-adjusted regression models to assess determinants of 3cB12 (all three markers) and combinations of 2cB12 (two markers).

- **Results**: 3cB12 was significantly associated with B12 (Spearman r = 0.75), MMA (r = -0.70), and tHcy (r = -0.59). The 3cB12 reference interval (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) was -0.538 to 1.60. In covariate-adjusted models, we found no association of 3cB12 with age; adult females and users of B12 supplements had higher, while adults with advanced chronic kidney disease had lower 3cB12 levels regardless of race-Hispanic origin group (self-reported). Only 2.7% of adults had low or transitional vitamin B12 status using the proposed cB12 cutoff of ≤ -0.5, while the prevalence of low (or low-normal) status depended on the selected individual marker and its cutoff: 2.2% and 13% for B12 < 148 and 148–222 pmol/L, respectively; 6.0% for MMA exceeding an age-specific cutoff (250–320 nmol/L).

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: Recognition and management [^112FxXC7]. American Family Physician (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of vitamin B12 deficiency, specifically concerning vitamin B12 supplementation, the 2017 AAFP guidelines recommend administering oral or injectable preparations for vitamin B12 replacement. Injectable therapy is recognized to lead to more rapid improvement. Patients with severe vitamin B12 deficiency should consider receiving injectable vitamin B12 preparations.

### Vitamin B [^116HYE4W]. BMJ (2023). Low credibility.

The clinical picture is the most important factor in assessing the significance of blood test results for cobalamin (B12) status, as there is no "gold standard" test to define deficiency. Neurological symptoms resulting from B12 deficiency may take several months or even years to resolve completely. Measuring serum biomarkers such as B12 or methylmalonic acid is neither helpful nor indicated in assessing or monitoring clinical improvement; neither is titration of injection frequency based on biomarker assessment. Self-administration of intramuscular B12 injections can lead to greater patient satisfaction and better health outcomes.

### Age dependency of plasma vitamin B12 status markers in Dutch children and adolescents [^112EhgiQ]. Pediatric Research (2021). Low credibility.

It is known that individuals with Cbl deficiency may express variable abnormalities in plasma vitamin B12 status markers. Within-reference total Cbl or holoTC concentrations, together with elevated concentrations of either plasma MMA or total plasma homocysteine, are not uncommon. This, in combination with non-specific symptoms and the lack of a gold standard, makes the diagnosis of Cbl deficiency particularly challenging.

Many studies on biochemical markers have been performed in adults. Plasma vitamin B12 status markers, and in particular holoTC concentrations, in children are, however, less well described. This study therefore aimed to study plasma MMA, holoTC, and total Cbl in children and adolescents aged 0–18 years and to derive age-dependent reference intervals.

### Vitamin B12 and folate levels in healthy Swiss senior citizens: A prospective study evaluating reference intervals and decision limits [^114b1m5h]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 and surrogate markers

Spearman rank correlations revealed statistically insignificant associations between vitamin B12 or holoTC and progressing years of age (p = 0.56 and p = 0.68). Total vitamin B12 serum levels and holoTC in the entire cohort remained stable over three arbitrarily defined age groups of 60–69, 70–79, and ≥ 80 years. However, there were significant sex differences in holoTC in the age groups of 60–69 years (p < 0.001) and 70–79 years (p < 0.001), whereas no such differences were detected in persons ≥ 80 years (p = 0.77).

A common reference interval for elderly persons can be determined for those aged ≥ 80 years (21.3, 90% confidence interval, 19.3–24.0–118.2, 90% CI 97–125.3, pmol/L), while sex-specific reference intervals can be provided for persons aged 60–79 years: 24.0, 90% CI 21.0–25.6–115, 90% CI 107.9–119.0 pmol/L in females, and 22.3, 90% CI 21.0–24.5–94.4, 90% CI 85.4–106.2 pmol/L for males. Because the 90% CI's overlap in both age groups and among sexes, a combined lower limit of the reference interval might be justifiable and useful for practical purposes. As the upper limit of the reference interval is of minor clinical importance and the differences among age and sex groups might be regarded as small, similar practical considerations can be extrapolated to the common upper limit of the reference interval. Thus, a combined reference interval for both sexes and persons aged ≥ 60 years is determined at 23, 90% CI 21.9–24–109.3, 90% CI 105–115 pmol/L.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^116rzU6b]. Annals of Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Our findings are of critical importance for rethinking the "biologically sufficient" B12 levels. The population-based studies that defined healthy micronutrient levels may have missed the subclinical manifestations of low or high B12 at the extremes of the population distribution that can affect people without causing overt symptoms. While the clinical features of unambiguous B12 deficiency are well defined as predominantly hematological (most conspicuously macrocytic anemia) and neurological, the condition can manifest with either hematological or neurological syndromes in isolation. Without sensitive tools to detect subtle neurological deficits, the heterogeneous nature of the symptoms remained unexplained.

Notably, during and following B12 repletion therapy, patients often request higher dosing of B12 to treat their neurological symptoms, even after their hematological symptoms have resolved. Our findings support the idea that subtle neurological deficits manifest at higher levels than the threshold defined for deficiency and, most importantly, could provide an explanation for the often-reported discrepancy between hematological and neurological symptoms. When B12 intake or absorption is impaired, the levels of Holo-TC initially decrease in the blood, which can first be compensated by releasing the B12 in storage. This slow progression toward deficiency could be better described by a sliding scale of insufficiency, wherein the tissue levels decline until Holo-TC falls below what is necessary to supply critical cells for biochemical reactions in the nervous system.

### Association of vitamin B12 deficiency and hyperhomocystinemia with acute coronary syndromes - A case series [^113BNSr7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are the most common presentation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in the emergency department. Numerous risk factors, such as smoking, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, metabolic syndrome, high triglycerides, and diabetes, have been implicated in the development of coronary artery disease and ACS. The management tools, instead of focusing on the reversal of these risk factors, rely on lipid-lowering drugs.

Our series of patients suffering from ACS shows a possible association with low serum vitamin B12, high homocysteine, high triglyceride, low HDL, low cholesterol, and low LDL levels. There needs to be a paradigm shift in managing ACS patients and the advice prescribed to them at the time of discharge. It would be prudent for emergency physicians to test for vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels in ACS patients.

### Update on cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine [^112WMVAg]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2003). Low credibility.

Three topics affecting cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine that have generated interest, activity, and advances in recent years are discussed:

- **Application of tools to the diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency**: The variety of tools available has expanded, affecting our understanding of deficiency and improving diagnosis, particularly in difficult and atypical cases. However, diagnosing has become complex due to the absence of a diagnostic gold standard among the many tests available, the predominance of subclinical deficiency cases, and the decreased availability of reliable tests to identify the root causes of cobalamin deficiency.

- **Interaction between homocysteine and vascular disease**: The relationship between homocysteine and vascular disease is influenced by vitamins. Understanding this interaction is crucial for developing preventative and therapeutic strategies.

- **Genetic disorders and polymorphisms**: Improved understanding of relevant genetic disorders and common genetic polymorphisms shows how these interact with environmental influences.

Dr. Carmel discusses the tests, diagnostic issues, and possible approaches to clinical evaluation in detail. It is suggested that no single algorithm fits all cases, and some cases may require more individualized diagnostic approaches.

### Two newborns with nutritional vitamin B12 deficiency: Challenges in newborn screening for vitamin B12 deficiency [^112Wv529]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency causes decreased methionine synthase and L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity and results in the accumulation of homocysteine, methylmalonic acid, and propionylcarnitine. Propionylcarnitine is included in tandem mass spectrometry-based newborn screening programs for the detection of certain inborn errors of metabolism. We report two asymptomatic newborns with vitamin B12 deficiency due to maternal deficiencies. One was detected incidentally at 3 weeks of age; the second on supplemental newborn screening based on elevated propionylcarnitine at 2 days of age.

This illustrates the potential for false-negative results for vitamin B12 deficiency screening by acylcarnitine profiling in newborn screening. Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid may be better markers of vitamin B12 deficiency. In conclusion, we suggest measuring methylmalonic acid, propionylcarnitine, and homocysteine levels in blood spots in expanded newborn screening in order to detect asymptomatic newborns with vitamin B12 deficiency. Further studies are needed to establish the sensitivity of these three markers in screening for vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Neurological consequences of vitamin B12 deficiency and its treatment [^111RQfgA]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2008). Low credibility.

In developed countries, vitamin B12 deficiency usually occurs in children who are exclusively breast-fed by mothers adhering to vegetarian diets, resulting in low stores of vitamin B12. Symptoms typically manifest during the second trimester of life and include failure to thrive, lethargy, hypotonia, and arrest or regression of developmental skills. Megaloblastic anemia may also be present. Half of the infants exhibit abnormal movements before treatment with intramuscular cobalamin, which typically disappear 1 or 2 days after treatment is initiated. More rarely, movement disorders may appear a few days after treatment, even as neurological symptoms improve. These abnormal movements can persist for 2 to 6 weeks. If untreated, vitamin B12 deficiency can result in lasting neurodisability. Therefore, efforts should be directed toward preventing deficiency in pregnant and breast-feeding women on vegan diets, as well as their infants, by administering vitamin B12 supplements. When preventive supplementation fails, it is crucial to promptly recognize and treat an infant presenting with failure to thrive and developmental delays.

### Cumulative incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency in patients with Alzheimer disease [^115BbuF2]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2009). Low credibility.

Although vitamin B12 is routinely measured in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) at the time of the initial diagnosis, it is not known if repeat vitamin B12 measurements are indicated to detect new deficiency cases. We aimed to determine the incidence of de-novo vitamin B12 deficiency over a period of three years in a cohort of AD patients without a prior diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency and with initial vitamin B12 levels greater than 350 ng/L.

- **Methods**: Vitamin B12 levels were measured at the time of AD diagnosis and repeated three years later in 102 consecutive patients, unless a diagnosis of B12 deficiency was made in the interim.

- **Results**: Vitamin B12 deficiency was diagnosed in seven patients, corresponding to a cumulative incidence in the cohort studied of 7.6% after three years of follow-up. Statistical comparison of initial and repeat vitamin B12 measurements in patients that completed follow-up showed a significant reduction in levels (p = 0.003). Among the 79 subjects with follow-up, 17 patients (22%, 95% CI, 13%-32%) had a repeat level less than 350 ng/L. No significant correlates of deficiency incidence were identified.

- **Conclusion**: Our pilot data indicate that vitamin B12 levels decreased in this cohort of AD patients, putting a substantial percentage at risk of deficiency and reaching deficiency state in a meaningful number of patients. Repeat screening for B12 deficiency after approximately two years of follow-up seems warranted in order to prevent hematological and neurological manifestations that may significantly alter their quality of life.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^116DKJ4k]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in terms of vitamin B12 supplementation without neurological involvement, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend considering an empiric trial of oral cyanocobalamin at a dosage of 50 mcg/day for 4 weeks. This treatment is advised for patients with serum levels indicating subclinical deficiency on two separate occasions. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of neuropathy develop. Cobalamin levels should be reassessed after 3 months, and second-line tests should be obtained if there is no improvement.

### Vitamin B12 and folate levels in healthy Swiss senior citizens: A prospective study evaluating reference intervals and decision limits [^1154TzaD]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Whereas the vitamin B12 and holoTC levels remain steady after 60 years of age, we observed a significant increment in MMA levels accompanied by increments in Hcy; the latter is better explained by age-related reduced kidney function than by vitamin B12 insufficiency. Total serum folate levels, but not RBC folate levels, decreased with progressing age. The present work evaluated decision limits for the use of these parameters in the elderly.

The following main questions and outcomes of interest in males and females with any type of onset (early or late) of one of the diseases of interest were addressed (outcomes in parentheses):

- **Which clinical signs are characteristic and allow timely diagnosis**: Timely clinical diagnosis; this outcome is considered important.
- **Which biochemical parameters allow timely and valid diagnosis**: Valid, timely laboratory diagnosis; this outcome is considered important.
- **How can we prevent death and avoid/treat severe organ damage**: Survival, severe organ complications; this outcome is considered critical.
- **How can we prevent or treat eye disease and neurocognitive impairment**: Visual and neurocognitive function; this outcome is considered critical.

In a first step, all reports made available to the panelists were graded according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria by the authors, who had assigned themselves according to their expertise to five major working groups focusing on the topics of clinical signs and symptoms; differential diagnosis; laboratory/biochemical parameters; disease course and outcome; and treatment. Due to the rarity of the diseases, studies and reports of all types of designs (from case reports and case series to meta-analyses) were included; randomized controlled trials were not available.

The working groups prepared drafts on their topics, which were carefully evaluated in moderated discussion groups. Elaboration and grading of recommendations were accomplished by a moderated, consensus-oriented discussion.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency: Recognition and management [^114GZbL6]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and other clinical manifestations. Screening average-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency is not recommended. However, screening may be warranted in patients with one or more risk factors, such as gastric or small intestine resections, inflammatory bowel disease, use of metformin for more than four months, proton pump inhibitors or histamine H2 blockers for more than 12 months, vegans or strict vegetarians, and adults older than 75 years.

Initial laboratory assessment should include a complete blood count and serum vitamin B12 level. Measurement of serum methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low-normal levels of vitamin B12. Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration for correcting anemia and neurologic symptoms. Intramuscular therapy leads to more rapid improvement and should be considered in patients with severe deficiency or severe neurologic symptoms.

Absorption rates improve with supplementation; therefore, patients older than 50 years and vegans or strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 or take vitamin B12 supplements. Patients who have had bariatric surgery should receive 1 mg of oral vitamin B12 per day indefinitely. The use of vitamin B12 in patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease does not reduce the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke, nor alter cognitive decline.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency [^111tiPE5]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of macrocytic anemia and has been implicated in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. The role of B12 deficiency in hyperhomocysteinemia and the promotion of atherosclerosis is only now being explored. Diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is typically based on measurement of serum vitamin B12 levels; however, about 50 percent of patients with subclinical disease have normal B12 levels. A more sensitive method of screening for vitamin B12 deficiency is the measurement of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, which are increased early in vitamin B12 deficiency. Use of the Schilling test for detection of pernicious anemia has been supplanted for the most part by serologic testing for parietal cell and intrinsic factor antibodies. Contrary to prevailing medical practice, studies show that supplementation with oral vitamin B12 is a safe and effective treatment for the B12 deficiency state. Even when intrinsic factor is not present to aid in the absorption of vitamin B12 (pernicious anemia) or in other diseases that affect the usual absorption sites in the terminal ileum, oral therapy remains effective.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cobalamin and folate disorders [^116X2VPz]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for vitamin B12 deficiency, specifically concerning serum homocysteine and MMA, the BSH 2014 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of serum total homocysteine and/or MMA. These tests should be used as supplementary investigations to determine biochemical cobalamin deficiency when there is clinical suspicion of deficiency but an indeterminate serum cobalamin level.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency in the aged: A population-based study [^1151Xb4r]. Age and Ageing (2007). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in the aged, but it is controversial whether only some risk groups should be investigated instead of screening the entire aged population.

- **Objectives**: To describe the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in the Finnish aged population and to determine if subjects especially prone to vitamin B12 deficiency could be identified by risk factors or clinical correlates.

- **Design**: A cross-sectional, population-based study of 1,048 aged subjects (age 65–100 years) was carried out. Data on lifestyle factors and clinical conditions were collected, physical examinations were conducted, and laboratory variables related to vitamin B12 were measured.

- **Results**: Vitamin B12 deficiency had been previously diagnosed in 27 (2.6%) subjects, and a laboratory diagnosis (total vitamin B12 ≤ 15 micromol/l) was made for 97 (9.5%) subjects. Low serum total vitamin B12 (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.4–3.4) and refraining from milk products (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.2–4.4) increased the probability of vitamin B12 deficiency. Anaemia (OR = 1.3, 95% CI 0.7–2.3) or macrocytosis (OR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.6–2.7) did not predict vitamin B12 deficiency.

- **Conclusion**: Undiagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency is remarkably common in the aged, but no specific risk group for screening can be identified. Thus, biochemical screening of unselected individuals is suggested.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency — an update [^111b7Xx4]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

This update addresses the diagnosis and treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be suspected in all patients with unexplained anemia and/or neurological symptoms, as well as in patients at risk, such as the elderly and those with intestinal diseases. Measurement of plasma cobalamins is recommended as the primary analysis, followed by measurement of plasma methylmalonic acid in unsettled cases. Accumulating evidence indicates that the biologically active cobalamin, plasma holotranscobalamin (holoTC), may be superior to plasma cobalamins, and the measurement of holoTC is currently being introduced in the clinical setting.

No consensus exists concerning the evaluation of the cause of vitamin B12 deficiency. The pros and cons of different tests, mainly aimed at assessing the function of the gastric mucosa, are presented. Once the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency is confirmed, effective treatment can be ensured either by injections every 2–3 months or by a daily dose of 1 mg vitamin B12.

### Paradoxical elevation of both serum B12 and methylmalonic acid levels in assessing B12 status in children with short-bowel syndrome [^115MpXif]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

Measurement of vitamin B12 (B12) levels is routinely used to monitor B12 sufficiency. However, its accuracy may not be reliable in patients with short-bowel syndrome (SBS). The presence of elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels can also be used as a marker for B12 deficiency. Therefore, our aim was to analyze serum B12 and MMA levels simultaneously in a cohort of children with SBS to evaluate the accuracy of these markers in the assessment of B12 status.

- **Methods**: Children ages 1–18 with intestinal failure were eligible for enrollment. MMA and B12 levels were checked simultaneously in all patients, with 93 sets of labs obtained over 2 years. Fifty percent of the patients were receiving parenteral nutrition. B12 injections were administered to 14 patients who had simultaneously elevated MMA and B12, and a repeat MMA level was measured 4–6 weeks after injection. Data were collected retrospectively.

- **Results**: Forty-eight percent of the lab pairs showed evidence of both elevated MMA and high or normal B12, which contradicted the expected inverse relationship of these markers. There was a statistically significant decrease in mean MMA values after treatment with B12 injections (412.7 vs. 1037.5, P = 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Paradoxical elevation of MMA with normal or elevated serum B12 is common in children with SBS. Caution should be used when interpreting serum B12 and MMA values in this setting. This may be related to effects of small-bowel bacterial overgrowth, a condition commonly seen in these patients.

### Improved biochemical and neurodevelopmental profiles with high-dose hydroxocobalamin therapy in cobalamin C defect [^1134jp1K]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Low credibility.

The achievement of borderline-normal Hcy levels in Group A did not require an increase in betaine dosage, as attempted in Groups B1 and B2. As demonstrated by multiple linear regression analysis, the higher Met levels in Group A were not dependent on the betaine dose but reflected the higher OH-Cbl dosage.

Clinically, patients treated with "high-dose" OH-Cbl and diagnosed by NBS maintained a normal cognitive profile over the three-year follow-up. Conversely, patients treated with "low-dose", including those identified by NBS, showed a lower DQ. Analysis of the subscales demonstrated substantially stable developmental profile trajectories in the "high-dose" patients and a significant drop in verbal skills in both "low-dose" groups, regardless of the mode of diagnosis (i.e. NBS vs. clinically driven diagnosis). The worst outcomes observed in B2 patients may result from the impact of a late diagnosis combined with a low OH-Cbl regimen. These findings are similar to those reported in our previous study, which showed a selective decline in the verbal subscale between the second and third years of life in non-screened "low-dose" treated patients. Similar to what was observed in Group B1, impaired neurodevelopmental and adaptive functioning have been reported also in NBS diagnosed patients treated with "low-dose" OH-Cbl, maintaining circulating levels of Hcy well above the normal range. Consistently, our study showed that Hcy significantly predicted neurocognitive outcomes and that OH-Cbl predicted the Hcy levels.

Differently from cognitive outcomes, maculopathy resulted equally represented in our pa.

### Maternal B12, folate and homocysteine concentrations and offspring cortisol and cardiovascular responses to stress [^1142DWGW]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Associations with cortisol responses to stress

Offspring of mothers with low B12 status had significantly lower baseline cortisol concentrations compared to those of mothers with normal B12 levels (median: 6.3 ng/mL [interquartile range 4.8–8.2] vs. 7.1 ng/mL [5.1–9.8] in the normal B12 group; adjusted P = 0.03). There were no significant associations between maternal folate or homocysteine concentrations and offspring baseline cortisol concentrations.

- **Longitudinal offspring cortisol responses**: In a mixed model analysis, maternal low B12 status, as a binary outcome, was associated with a higher cortisol response to stress (0.36 SD [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16, 0.57 SD] increase from baseline in peak cortisol response at 30 minutes in the maternal low B12 group, compared to the normal B12 group; P < .001). Maternal B12 concentration, as a continuous outcome, was negatively associated with cortisol response (–0.13 [–0.22, –0.03] P = 0.01), although this association was nonsignificant when tested at the Bonferroni adjusted significance level of P = 0.001.

- **Figures and tables**: Table data supports these findings, showing associations of maternal low B12 status and maternal B12, folate, and homocysteine concentrations with the offspring's cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency [^111hVKBh]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Biochemical diagnosis (statement #4: grade of recommendation C)

Plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) should be the frontline test for diagnosis of CBS deficiency. Plasma free homocystine (fHcy) only becomes detectable at tHcy concentrations above approximately 50–60 μmol/L; its measurement is not recommended because of its low sensitivity and reproducibility and the demanding pre-analytical requirements. In untreated patients with CBS deficiency, tHcy concentrations are usually above 100 μmol/L, but they may be lower. The diagnosis is very likely if elevated tHcy is accompanied by high or borderline high plasma Met concentrations and further supported if sensitive methods demonstrate low plasma cystathionine concentrations with an increased Met-to-cystathionine ratio.

CBS deficiency is characterised biochemically by an accumulation of Hcy, decreased synthesis of cystathionine and cysteine, and usually by increased Met. However, the classical pattern is not always observed in all variants of CBS deficiency.

Two indices of plasma homocysteine levels have been widely used: the free homocystine (fHcy) — the concentration of non-protein-bound disulfide homocystine — and the total homocysteine (tHcy) — the sum of all free and bound homocysteine species after treating plasma with a reducing agent. Measurement of fHcy has been possible since the 1960s, whereas tHcy has only been widely available since the late 1990s. The plasma fHcy determined by an AA analyser is an insensitive marker of CBS deficiency.

### Cobalamin-responsive disorders in the ambulatory care setting: Unreliability of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine testing [^112wjH6s]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Early recognition of cobalamin (Cbl)-responsive disorders in the ambulatory care setting is essential to prevent irreversible neurologic deficits. However, diagnostic algorithms using Cbl, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and homocysteine (HCys) measurements reflect studies in academic centers, and their negative predictive values have not been established. Thus, records of 456 ambulatory patients evaluated for Cbl deficiency at a staff model HMO were reviewed. Pretherapy Cbl, MMA, and HCys values in individual patients varied by 23%, 23%, and 17%, respectively, over 2 to 6 weeks.

Hematologic or neurologic responses to pharmacologic doses of Cbl occurred in 37 of the 95 evaluable patients. In these patients, pretherapy Cbl, MMA, and HCys values were normal in 54%, 23%, and 50%, respectively. If therapy had been restricted to symptomatic patients with both low or intermediate Cbl levels and increased metabolite values, 63% of responders would not have been treated. Twenty-five patients did not respond to treatment, including 5 of 11 patients (45%) with low Cbl, 22 of 49 patients (45%) with high MMA, and 13 of 30 patients (43%) with high HCys values.

It is concluded that Cbl, MMA, and HCys levels fluctuate with time and neither predict nor preclude the presence of Cbl-responsive hematologic or neurologic disorders.

### Vitamin B deficiency [^113VrFbh]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2017). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (B12; also known as cobalamin) is a B vitamin that has an important role in cellular metabolism, especially in DNA synthesis, methylation, and mitochondrial metabolism. Clinical B12 deficiency with classic hematological and neurological manifestations is relatively uncommon. However, subclinical deficiency affects between 2.5% and 26% of the general population depending on the definition used, although the clinical relevance is unclear.

B12 deficiency can affect individuals at all ages, but most particularly elderly individuals. Infants, children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age are also at high risk of deficiency in populations where dietary intake of B12-containing animal-derived foods is restricted. Deficiency is caused by either inadequate intake, inadequate bioavailability, or malabsorption. Disruption of B12 transport in the blood, or impaired cellular uptake or metabolism causes an intracellular deficiency.

Diagnostic biomarkers for B12 status include decreased levels of circulating total B12 and transcobalamin-bound B12, and abnormally increased levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid. However, the exact cut-offs to classify clinical and subclinical deficiency remain debated. Management depends on B12 supplementation, either via high-dose oral routes or via parenteral administration. This primer describes the knowledge surrounding B12 deficiency and highlights improvements in diagnostic methods as well as shifting concepts about the prevalence, causes, and manifestations of B12 deficiency.

### Nascobal [^116PAaeS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). High credibility.

Prior to initiating treatment with Nascobal, it is essential to obtain hematocrit, reticulocyte count, vitamin B12, folate, and iron levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Consider the potential for concomitant drugs to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate diagnostic blood assays [see Drug Interactions (7)]. In patients with suspected cobalamin hypersensitivity, administering an intradermal test dose of parenteral vitamin B12 prior to using Nascobal is advisable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Recommended dosage**: The recommended initial dose of Nascobal is one spray (500 mcg) administered in one nostril once weekly. Administer Nascobal at least one hour before or one hour after ingestion of hot foods or liquids, as hot foods may cause nasal secretions and a resulting loss of medication. Defer the use of Nascobal in patients with nasal congestion, allergic rhinitis, or upper respiratory infections until symptoms have subsided.

- **Monitoring, dosage modifications, and treatment duration**:
	- **Monitoring for response and safety**: Monitor serum B12 levels periodically during therapy to establish adequacy of treatment. Obtain a serum B12 level and peripheral blood count one month after treatment initiation, then subsequently at intervals of 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
	- **Dosage modifications**: If serum levels of B12 decline after one month of treatment with Nascobal, consider increasing the dose. Assess serum B12 level one month after each dose adjustment. If serum B12 levels are persistently low, consider alternative therapy.

### Vitamin B12 and homocysteine levels predict different outcomes in early Parkinson's disease [^116TNUAC]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

In moderately advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), low serum vitamin B12 levels are common and associated with neuropathy and cognitive impairment. However, little is known about B12 in early PD.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence of low vitamin B12 status in early PD and whether it is associated with clinical progression.

- **Methods**: We measured vitamin B12 and other B12 status determinants (methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, and holotranscobalamin) in 680 baseline and 456 follow-up serum samples collected from DATATOP participants with early, untreated PD. Borderline low B12 status was defined as serum B12 < 234pmol/L; 317pg/mL and elevated homocysteine as > 15µmol/L. Outcomes included the UPDRS, ambulatory capacity score (sum of UPDRS items 13–15, 29 & 30), and MMSE, calculated as annualized rates of change.

- **Results**: At baseline, 13% had borderline low B12 levels, 7% had elevated homocysteine, while 2% had both. Elevated homocysteine at baseline was associated with worse scores on the baseline MMSE. Analysis of study outcomes showed that compared with the other tertiles, participants in the low B12 tertile developed greater morbidity as assessed by greater annualized worsening of the ambulatory capacity score. Elevated homocysteine was associated with greater annualized decline in MMSE (-1.96 vs. 0.06; P = 0.001). Blood count indices were not associated with B12 or homocysteine status.

- **Conclusions**: In this study of early PD, low B12 status was common. Low B12 at baseline predicted greater worsening of mobility, whereas elevated homocysteine was associated with cognitive decline.

### How I treat cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency [^1123to9s]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

The challenges in medical management of cobalamin deficiency lie in attention to the unique pathophysiology that underlies cobalamin deficiency, more than in the mechanics of therapy. The central physiologic principles are that clinically important deficiency is more likely to occur (and progress) when intrinsic factor-driven absorption fails than when diet is poor, and most causes take years to produce clinically obvious deficiency. Transient defects have little clinical impact. The key management principle is the importance of follow-up, which also requires knowing how the deficiency arose. The virtues of these principles are not always fully appreciated.

Recent developments have made diagnosis and management more difficult by diminishing the ability to determine cobalamin absorption status. Clinicians must also grapple with premature medicalization of isolated, mild biochemical changes that added many asymptomatic cases of still undetermined medical relevance to their caseload, often expanded by inflated cobalamin level criteria. The potential for misattribution of cobalamin-unrelated presentations to nongermane cobalamin and metabolite abnormalities has grown.

Pathophysiologically based management requires systematic attention to each of its individual components: correctly diagnosing cobalamin deficiency, reversing it, defining its underlying cause, preventing relapse, managing the underlying disorder and its complications, and educating the patient.

### Post renal transplant anemia: severity, causes and their association with graft and patient survival [^116tnmDh]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Total serum vitamin B12 is not a reliable biomarker of vitamin B12 availability. We chose to define B12 deficiency as less than 300 pmol/L, as suggested by others for borderline and deficiency.

Graft failure was defined as chronic (≥ 3 months) treatment with hemodialysis, re-transplantation, or death with a functioning graft. Acute rejection was defined by renal biopsy showing rejection with a Banff score of 1A or higher. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined according to the KDIGO criteria.

- **Data collection**: Patients' characteristics were collected at baseline. For each patient, we documented all available episodes of anemia. Diagnosis of an episode of anemia was defined as the first time a decreased level of hemoglobin (Hb) was documented, according to the WHO criteria. For each episode of anemia, a full laboratory workup was collected. For patients without anemia, laboratory data were collected at six months following transplantation. Acute infections based on culture, serological results, and biopsy-proven acute graft rejections were collected from the electronic chart. All possible causes of anemia for each episode were reviewed by two researchers (AS and BRZ) and, in case of disagreement, a third researcher evaluated the case (AG).

- **Outcomes**: The primary outcome was the composite endpoint of graft failure (return to dialysis or re-transplantation) and all-cause mortality at the end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were death-censored graft failure (defined as re-establishment of long-term dialysis therapy or the need for re-transplantation) and all-cause mortality with a functioning graft.

### Efficacy of B vitamins in lowering homocysteine in older men: Maximal effects for those with B12 deficiency and hyperhomocysteinemia [^113oVPpr]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

A higher plasma concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular events. Previous studies, largely in younger individuals, have shown that B vitamins lowered tHcy by substantial amounts and that this effect is greater in people with higher tHcy and lower folate levels.

- **Methods**: We undertook a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 299 men aged ≥ 75 years, comparing treatment with a daily tablet containing 2 mg of folate, 25 mg of B6, and 400 µg of B12 or placebo. The study groups were balanced regarding age (mean ± SD, 78.9 ± 2.8 years), B vitamins, and tHcy at baseline.

- **Results**: Among the 13% with B12 deficiency, the difference in mean changes in treatment and control groups for tHcy was 6.74 µmol/L (95% CI, 3.94 to 9.55 µmol/L) compared with 2.88 µmol/L (95% CI, 0.07 to 5.69 µmol/L) for all others. Among the 20% with hyperhomocysteinemia, the difference between mean changes in treatment and control groups for men with high plasma tHcy compared with the rest of the group was 2.8 µmol/L (95% CI, 0.6 to 4.9 µmol/L). Baseline vitamin B12, serum folate, and tHcy were significantly associated with changes in plasma tHcy at follow-up (r = 0.252, r = 0.522, and r = -0.903, respectively; P = 0.003, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively) in the vitamin group.

- **Conclusions**: The tHcy-lowering effect of B vitamins was maximal in those who had low B12 or high tHcy levels. Community-dwelling older men, who are likely to be deficient in B12 or have hyperhomocysteinemia, may be particularly responsive to B vitamin supplementation.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: Is routine screening and supplementation justified [^116Kpc4h]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient required for optimal hematopoietic, neuro-cognitive, and cardiovascular function. Biochemical and clinical vitamin B12 deficiency has been demonstrated to be highly prevalent among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It presents with diverse clinical manifestations, including impaired memory, dementia, delirium, peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, megaloblastic anemia, and pancytopenia. This review article offers a perspective on the physiological roles of vitamin B12, proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of vitamin B12 deficiency, screening for vitamin B12 deficiency, and vitamin B12 supplementation among patients with diabetes mellitus.

### Holotranscobalamin, a marker of vitamin B-12 status: Analytical aspects and clinical utility [^113WenGk]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Approximately one-quarter of circulating cobalamin (vitamin B-12) binds to transcobalamin (holoTC) and is thereby available for the cells of the body. For this reason, holoTC is also referred to as active vitamin B-12. HoloTC was suggested as an optimal marker of early vitamin B-12 deficiency over 20 years ago. This suggestion led to the development of suitable assays for measurement of the compound and clinical studies that aimed to show the benefit of measuring holoTC rather than vitamin B-12.

Today, holoTC can be analyzed by three methods: direct measurement of the complex between transcobalamin and vitamin B-12, measurement of vitamin B-12 attached to transcobalamin, or measurement of the amount of transcobalamin saturated with vitamin B-12. These methods give similar results; however, direct measurement of the holoTC complex is preferable in the clinical setting from a practical point of view.

HoloTC measurement has proven useful for identifying the few patients who suffer from transcobalamin deficiency. In addition, holoTC is part of the CobaSorb test and is therefore useful for assessing vitamin B-12 absorption. Clinical studies that compare the ability of holoTC and vitamin B-12 to identify individuals with vitamin B-12 deficiency (elevated concentration of methylmalonic acid) suggest that holoTC performs better than total vitamin B-12.

As of the time of writing, holoTC has not been used for population-based assessments of vitamin B-12 status, but we suggest that holoTC is a better marker than total vitamin B-12 for such studies.

### Vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with diabetes mellitus: Is routine screening and supplementation justified [^115fNUkC]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Screening for vitamin B12 deficiency among patients with T1DM reveals that there are no clear guidelines available for such screening. However, due to the high prevalence of pernicious anemia and subsequent vitamin B12 deficiency among T1DM patients, as reported in most cross-sectional studies, a pragmatic approach would be to screen at diagnosis, then yearly for the first 3 years, and subsequently every five years or when there is any clinical indication. Vitamin B12 deficiency can develop at any time. Screening should involve the assessment of serum vitamin B12 levels and markers of gastric autoimmunity, like PCA and AIF, especially among T1DM patients with GAD-65 and thyroid peroxidase antibodies. The presence of these autoantibodies increases the likelihood of developing vitamin B12 deficiency.

- **Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency among diabetic patients**: Treatment does not differ regardless of the etiology. All patients deficient in vitamin B12 should receive replacement therapy with either oral or parenteral vitamin B12. Both formulations have been demonstrated to induce comparable desirable hematological and neurological improvements irrespective of the etiology of the deficiency. In adult patients with T2DM, intramuscular or oral vitamin B12 in doses of 1000 μg daily for a week, then once every week for 4 weeks, is sufficient to correct vitamin B12 deficiency.

Among young patients with T1DM and co-existing vitamin B12 deficiency, replacement therapy with daily intramuscular or oral vitamin B12 in the dose of 100 μg for a week and thereafter…

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of oral vitamin B12 supplementation in older patients with subnormal or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations [^112HHdyc]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

To determine the effect of small doses of oral cyanocobalamin supplements in older patients with low or borderline serum vitamin B12 concentrations but no other evidence of pernicious anemia (PA), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. The study assessed the efficacy of oral cyanocobalamin at doses of 10 micrograms and 50 micrograms daily for 1 month in two geriatric hospitals within the North Western Health Care Network, Melbourne, Australia.

Thirty-one inpatients, with serum vitamin B12 levels between 100 and 150 pmol/L and without PA, other malabsorption disorders, or progressive neurological or terminal illness, participated in the study. The mean age was 81.4 years.

After obtaining informed consent, a comprehensive medical and drug history was recorded, and each patient completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A dietitian assessed oral cobalamin intake. Baseline measurements included blood tests for serum vitamin B12, serum and red cell folate assay, full blood examination, fasting serum gastrin, parietal and intrinsic factor antibodies, fasting serum homocysteine, and creatinine levels. Patients were then randomized to receive 10 micrograms oral cyanocobalamin, 50 micrograms oral cyanocobalamin, or a placebo for 1 month. After the intervention period, the investigations and clinical examinations were repeated.

- **Measurements**: The primary measurement was the percentage change in the level of vitamin B12, homocysteine, folate, and red cell parameters. Absolute changes in the MMSE were also calculated and compared between groups. The number of responders who improved their level of B12 by 20% was noted. Chi-square calculations were performed to evaluate changes in serum vitamin B12.

### Vitamin B12 Deficiency: Recognition and Management [^114ij34x]. American family physician (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for vitamin B12 deficiency, more specifically with respect to vitamin B12 supplementation, with neurological involvement, AAFP 2017 guidelines recommend to administer vitamin B12 preparations in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency. Consider administering injectable vitamin B12 preparations in patients with severe neurologic symptoms.

### Serum vitamin B12 concentrations within reference values do not exclude functional vitamin B12 deficiency in PKU patients of various ages [^112rTbz3]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Homocysteine (Hcy) and, in particular, methylmalonic acid (MMA) are considered reliable parameters for vitamin B(12) status in healthy individuals. Phenylketonuria (PKU) patients are at risk for functional vitamin B(12) deficiency based on their diet.

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of functional vitamin B(12) deficiency in continuously treated PKU patients and the association of parameters of vitamin B(12) and metabolic control.

- **Methods**: In 75 continuously treated PKU patients aged 1–37 years, serum vitamin B(12) concentrations, plasma Hcy, MMA, and phenylalanine concentrations were studied.

- **Results**: Eight patients had vitamin B(12) concentrations below normal. Of these eight patients, two had elevated MMA and/or Hcy concentrations. Ten other patients with normal vitamin B(12) concentrations had elevated concentrations of MMA and/or Hcy.

- **Conclusions**: A vitamin B(12) concentration within the reference range does not automatically imply a sufficient vitamin B(12) status. We recommend measuring serum MMA, or alternatively plasma Hcy, yearly in all PKU patients to diagnose functional vitamin B(12) deficiency.

### Vitamin B12 levels association with functional and structural biomarkers of central nervous system injury in older adults [^115saQSy]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

In the United States, the cutoff value for a B12 "deficiency" state is currently defined as below 148 pmol/L. This value was calculated as 3 standard deviations below the U.S. population average, independent of clinical observations. The American Society for Nutrition criticized this approach in 2010, arguing that more than 5% of patients with a syndrome consistent with B12 deficiency, who respond to B12 supplementation, have blood levels above that threshold. Other studies demonstrated that B-vitamin supplementation was beneficial in people with clinical features of cobalamin deficiency, regardless of the measured levels in the blood. Selecting a cutoff value based on clinical observations would better reduce disparities in B12 deficiency diagnosis and management.

Cases of biochemical B12 deficiency, wherein suboptimal B12 levels have been reported without overt clinical manifestation, have been reported as subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD). SCCD is most prevalent in the elderly and is associated with greater WMH burden and cognitive decline over time. In this context of B12 insufficiency, age might act as a vulnerability factor, accentuating the deleterious effects of low B12. While defining a threshold for optimal B12 levels based on clinical findings is crucial to prevent SCCD, sensitive tools to detect subtle neurological changes have not yet been used. The recording of visual evoked potentials (VEP) is a validated and non-invasive tool to assess myelin function in the visual pathway, but at the commencement of our study, it had not yet been applied to a cohort.

### Low cobalamin levels as predictors of cobalamin deficiency: Importance of comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress [^1137q35K]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Cobalamin (B12) deficiency can lead to irreversible neurocognitive changes if unrecognized. Screening involves measurement of serum cobalamin levels, but the sensitive metabolic indicators of cobalamin deficiency, methylmalonic acid (MMA) and homocysteine (HCys), may be normal when cobalamin values are low and elevated when cobalamin values are normal. Because cobalamin is inactivated by oxidation, the relationship between these metabolites and comorbidities associated with increased oxidative stress (oxidant risks) in subjects with low and low-normal cobalamin levels was studied.

- **Methods**: A retrospective record-review was conducted of community-dwelling adults evaluated for cobalamin deficiency during a 12-year period with serum cobalamin values in the low (≤ 200 pg/mL; n = 49) or low-normal (201–300 pg/mL; n = 187) range and measurement of MMA.

- **Results**: When "No" oxidant risk was present, elevated MMA (> 250 nmol/L) and HCys (> 12.1 μmol/L) values occurred in 50% and 30% of subjects, respectively (P < 0.01). In contrast, when "Three or More" oxidant risks were present, mean MMA and HCys values were significantly higher, and elevated MMA and HCys values occurred in 84% and 78% of these subjects, respectively (P ≤ .012). Pharmacologic doses of cyanocobalamin significantly decreased metabolite values in ≥ 94% of treated subjects.

- **Conclusion**: In subjects with low or low-normal cobalamin values, metabolic evidence of cobalamin deficiency is more frequent when 3 or more oxidant risks are present. Thus, defining a low serum cobalamin level to screen for cobalamin deficiency is crucial.

### The homocysteine controversy [^111gJnSV]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

While awaiting the results of forthcoming studies, a clear evidence-based recommendation for managing high-risk patients is currently impossible. Based on the evidence collected thus far, a single high-dose B-vitamin therapy in all patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) does not reduce events after five years. Given the discussion, the following policy may be considered:

- **Screening**:
	- Do not screen for hyperhomocysteinemia routinely in high-risk patients unless:
	- An inborn error of 1-carbon metabolism is suspected based on the clinical phenotype.
	- CVD occurs prematurely (i.e. before 50 years, with the cutoff depending on the conventional risk-factor profile) in the patient or their family.
	- B-vitamin depletion is suspected based on history or comorbidity.

- **Treatment**:
	- Do not treat mild hyperhomocysteinemia routinely, but consider treatment only if fasting levels exceed a certain threshold, for example, 20–25 μmol/l. Upon deciding to treat:
	- Do not use high-dose B-vitamin preparations routinely.
	- Start with a multivitamin containing moderate amounts of folate, B12, and B6.
	- Switch to high-dose B vitamins only if homocysteine remains clearly elevated.

Remain attentive to developments in the literature as new evidence emerges.

### Elevated plasma vitamin B12 levels as a marker for cancer: A population-based cohort study [^117JpGBz]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2013). Low credibility.

We identified 352,831 persons without prevalent cancer who had plasma Cbl levels ≥ 200 pmol/L. Of these, 19,164 patients were receiving Cbl therapy at the time of plasma Cbl measurement and were therefore excluded. Of the patients included in the study, 19,665 (6%) had levels greater than the upper reference limit (≥ 601 pmol/L).

The total number of person-years of follow-up was 1,421,512, and the median follow-up time was 3.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.9–6.2 years). The median age was 55.1 years (IQR = 40.2–69.2 years). The distribution of outpatients and inpatients was 276,229 (83%) and 57,438 (17%), respectively. A total of 22,652 (7%) patients in the study cohort subsequently developed cancer during the period from 1998 to 2010.

### The homocysteine controversy [^113dPwKP]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2011). Low credibility.

Mild to moderate hyperhomocysteinemia has been identified as a strong predictor of cardiovascular disease, independent from classical atherothrombotic risk factors. In the last decade, a number of large intervention trials using B vitamins have been performed and have shown no benefit of homocysteine-lowering therapy in high-risk patients. In addition, Mendelian randomization studies failed to convincingly demonstrate that a genetic polymorphism commonly associated with higher homocysteine levels (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase 677 C > T) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

Together, these findings have cast doubt on the role of homocysteine in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, and the homocysteine hypothesis has turned into a homocysteine controversy. In this review, we attempt to find solutions to this controversy.

- **Mendelian randomization analyses**: We explain that these analyses have limitations that preclude final conclusions.

- **Characteristics of intervention trials**: Several characteristics limit the interpretation and generalizability of their results.

- **Homocysteine lowering and side effects**: The possibility that homocysteine lowering is beneficial but offset by adverse side effects of B vitamins on atherosclerosis deserves serious attention. Such side effects may relate to direct adverse effects of the B-vitamin regimen (in particular, the use of high-dose folic acid) or to proinflammatory and proproliferative effects of B vitamins on advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: a critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^115wscRB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). High credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common, but the great majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys have subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD), not classical clinical deficiency. Because SCCD has no known clinical expression, its diagnosis depends solely on biochemical biomarkers, whose optimal application becomes crucial yet remains unsettled. This review critically examines the diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations. Their exploration begins with understanding that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not just in degree of deficiency but in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks. The causation of these by SCCD awaits proof by randomized clinical trials. Conclusions from SCCD data, therefore, often may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa.

Although many investigators view cobalamin testing as unreliable, cobalamin, like all diagnostic biomarkers, performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency but less well in SCCD. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to weigh the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined outside their relations to each other. Variable cutoff selections affect diagnostic conclusions heavily and need to be much better rationalized. The maximization of reliability and specificity of diagnosis is far more important today than the identification of ever-earlier stages of SCCD.

### Homocysteine and dementia: An international consensus statement [^114XD9B6]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The question of whether lowering total homocysteine (tHcy) can slow cognitive decline or prevent cognitive impairment in humans has been the focus of several clinical trials in which B vitamins were administered to normal elderly individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or patients with dementia. Critical reviews of these homocysteine-lowering trials and the meta-analyses based on them have been published. These reviews noted the futility of conducting trials where the placebo group showed no cognitive decline during the trial period. As one review stated, "you cannot prevent something that is not occurring".

It is unfortunate that 76% of the 20,431 participants in the largest meta-analysis did not have baseline measures of cognitive function, making it impossible to assess cognitive decline in the placebo group. In two of the trials within this meta-analysis, involving 2,825 participants, cognitive decline was observed in the placebo group. Significant beneficial cognitive effects from B vitamin treatment were noted among participants with high tHcy or poor B vitamin status at baseline. The authors of the meta-analysis attributed these findings to chance, despite these being the only trials capable of answering whether homocysteine-lowering with B vitamins can slow cognitive decline.

A meaningful clinical trial in this field should meet a set of criteria to provide a valid outcome.

### The limited value of methylmalonic acid, homocysteine and holotranscobalamin in the diagnosis of early B12 deficiency [^1116xjzh]. Haematologica (2006). Low credibility.

Treatment of B12 deficiency is important to prevent progressive neurological and/or hematologic disease but requires a secure diagnosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate second-line tests of B12 status as prognostic indicators of a hematologic response to vitamin B12 therapy. Forty-nine patients referred with low serum vitamin B12 concentrations were treated with intramuscular B12 and reassessed after three months. Methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, holotranscobalamin, and neutrophil hypersegmentation index were measured before and after treatment. Before treatment, 27 out of 49 patients were anemic or macrocytic, of whom 15 had a clear hematologic response. All the tests had similar prognostic accuracy. Symptomatic improvement did not correlate with hematologic response. Supplementary tests of vitamin B12 status were not significantly better than total serum B12 concentration as predictors of a hematologic response to vitamin B12 therapy.

### Laboratory assessment of vitamin B12 status [^115i7Tip]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

The detection and correction of vitamin B12 (B12) deficiency prevent megaloblastic anemia and potentially irreversible neuropathy and neuropsychiatric changes. B12 status is commonly estimated using the abundance of the vitamin in serum, with approximately 148 pmol/L (200 ng/L) typically set as the threshold for diagnosing deficiency. Serum B12 assays measure the sum of haptocorrin-bound and transcobalamin-bound (known as holotranscobalamin) B12. It is only holotranscobalamin that is taken up by cells to meet metabolic demand.

Although receiver operating characteristic curves show holotranscobalamin measurement to be a moderately more reliable marker of B12 status than serum B12, both assays have an indeterminate range. Biochemical evidence of metabolic abnormalities consistent with B12 insufficiency is frequently detected despite an apparently sufficient abundance of the vitamin. Laboratory B12 status markers that reflect cellular utilization rather than abundance are available.

- **B12-dependent reactions**: Two forms of B12 act as coenzymes for two different reactions. Methionine synthase requires methylcobalamin for the remethylation of methionine from homocysteine. A homocysteine concentration greater than 20 µmol/L may suggest B12 deficiency in folate-replete patients. In the second B12-dependent reaction, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase uses adenosylcobalamin to convert methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. In B12 deficiency, excess methylmalonyl-CoA is hydrolyzed to methylmalonic acid. A serum concentration greater than 280 nmol/L may suggest suboptimal status in young patients with normal renal function.

### Serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine in major depressive disorder, part 1: Predictors of clinical response in fluoxetine-resistant depression [^115pNtzc]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

In the present study, we assessed the relationship between serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine levels and clinical response in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had previously failed to respond to open treatment with fluoxetine 20 mg/day. These patients were enrolled in a 4-week, double-blind trial of either (1) fluoxetine dose increase, (2) lithium augmentation of fluoxetine, or (3) desipramine augmentation of fluoxetine.

Fifty-five outpatients, with a mean age of 41.7 years (SD = 10.6 years; 50.9% women), diagnosed with MDD using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R, were part of this double-blind trial. Serum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine measurements were completed at baseline, prior to the initiation of fluoxetine treatment. Folate levels were classified as either low (or = 13.2 micromol/L) or normal. Using logistic regression, we assessed the relationship between:

- **Low or normal folate levels**
- **Normal or low B12 levels**
- **Elevated or normal homocysteine levels**:

These factors were then compared with clinical response to the double-blind treatment. The study was conducted from November 1992 to January 1999.

- **Results**: Low serum folate levels (chi2 = 3.626, p = .04) were significantly associated with poorer response to treatment. Elevated homocysteine (p > .05) and low vitamin B12 levels (p > .05) were not associated with response. The response rates for patients with low folate levels (N = 14) and without low folate levels (N = 38) were 7.1%.

Outcome: Valid, timely laboratory diagnosis.

- **Recommendation 3**: Elevated plasma tHcy is the hallmark of remethylation disorders. We strongly recommend that investigations in patients with a suspected remethylation disorder should start with the measurement of total homocysteine in blood. We recommend the blood sample for tHcy to be centrifuged within an hour and kept at +4°C or frozen until analysis. Immunoassays or chromatographic methods are suitable for tHcy measurement (quality of the evidence: moderate).

- **Recommendation 4**: We strongly recommend against measuring free homocysteine instead of total homocysteine (quality of the evidence: moderate).

- **Recommendation 5**: We strongly recommend that in the case of high total homocysteine, plasma and urine samples for determination of MMA, methionine, folate, and vitamin B12 are to be obtained before treatment is started (quality of the evidence: moderate).

### Holotranscobalamin — a first choice assay for diagnosing early vitamin B deficiency [^114nWhuF]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The performance of holotranscobalamin (holoTC) was compared with other markers of vitamin B12 deficiency, examining the influence of age, renal function, and thyroid status.

- **Design and interventions**: We examined 937 individuals not treated with vitamin B12 but suspected to have vitamin B12 deficiency due to a plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) level above 0.28 micromol L(-1) in the past four years. In addition to laboratory tests, a structured interview and neurological examination were conducted among 534 individuals. Of these, 140 qualified for a randomized trial (MMA 0.40–2.00 micromol L(-1)). Participants were randomized to receive either vitamin B12 injections or placebo and were re-examined after three months.

- **Setting**: One university hospital in Aarhus, Denmark.

- **Results**: The ROC curves indicate that holoTC (AUC: 0.90) compared favorably with plasma vitamin B12 (AUC: 0.85) for identifying individuals likely to have vitamin B12 deficiency (MMA ≥ 0.75 micromol L(-1) and plasma total homocysteine [tHcy] ≥ 15 micromol L(-1)) and suggest that holoTC (AUC: 0.91) might replace combined testing with plasma vitamin B12 and metabolites. No association was observed between biochemical markers and symptoms/signs possibly related to vitamin B12 deficiency. HoloTC, TC saturation, plasma vitamin B12, MMA, and tHcy showed significant associations with plasma creatinine (all with P < 0.001). Only tHcy was significantly associated with thyroid stimulating hormone (P = 0.02).

Conclusions indicate that holoTC shows promise as a first-line test for diagnosing early vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Update on vitamin B12 deficiency [^114wg4C9]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is a common cause of megaloblastic anemia, various neuropsychiatric symptoms, and elevated serum homocysteine levels, especially in older individuals. Several risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency exist, including prolonged use of metformin and proton pump inhibitors.

No major medical organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, have published guidelines on screening asymptomatic or low-risk adults for vitamin B12 deficiency. However, high-risk patients, such as those with malabsorptive disorders, may warrant screening. The initial laboratory assessment for a patient with suspected vitamin B12 deficiency should include a complete blood count and a serum vitamin B12 level.

- **Measurement considerations**: Measurements of serum vitamin B12 may not reliably detect deficiency, and measurement of serum homocysteine and/or methylmalonic acid should be used to confirm deficiency in asymptomatic high-risk patients with low normal levels of vitamin B12.

- **Treatment approach**: Oral administration of high-dose vitamin B12 (1 to 2 mg daily) is as effective as intramuscular administration in correcting the deficiency, regardless of etiology. Because crystalline formulations are better absorbed than naturally occurring vitamin B12, patients older than 50 years and strict vegetarians should consume foods fortified with vitamin B12 and vitamin B12 supplements, rather than attempting to obtain vitamin B12 strictly from dietary sources.

Administration of vitamin B12 to patients with elevated serum homocysteine levels has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular outcomes.
