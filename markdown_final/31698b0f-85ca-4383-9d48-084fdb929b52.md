Many tip noodle small in the end of palate it colour sims normal

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a small, normal-colored lesion at the tip of the hard palate, including its possible causes, how to evaluate it, and how it should be managed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the anatomic location and the significance of "normal color". Then, I should build a prioritized differential of small, non-pigmented palatal lesions. Next, I will outline the focused history and examination elements that separate benign from concerning features. After that, I should specify when imaging or biopsy is indicated and when observation is appropriate. Finally, I will synthesize a practical management plan and provide reassurance thresholds grounded in evidence-based oral evaluation principles.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and terminology. "Tip of the palate" most plausibly refers to the anterior hard palate near the incisive papilla. "Small" suggests a few millimeters, and "normal color" implies the lesion matches surrounding palatal mucosa rather than appearing white, red, blue, or darkly pigmented, which helps deprioritize inflammatory, vascular, or melanocytic processes. I should double-check that normal mucosa here is pink and keratinized, and that a normal-colored nodule in this location is often a benign mucosal or bony variant rather than a neoplasm, which aligns with standard oral examination descriptors of mucosal color and texture variation [^113wcxpV].

> Now, I will construct a prioritized differential, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I need to ensure each entity fits "small" and "normal color". High on the list are torus palatinus variants or small midline exostoses, which present as firm, smooth, mucosa-covered bony protuberances along the midline and are typically asymptomatic and stable; they are common developmental variants rather than tumors, and imaging confirms cortical continuity with the palate if needed [^113uB87p]. Next, I should consider oral focal mucinosis, a rare benign fibromucinous lesion that can appear as a small, dome-shaped, normally colored mucosal swelling, often in the posterior hard palate but occasionally anterior; histology is diagnostic when uncertainty persists [^1153YgsE]. Less likely but still plausible are small mucoceles from minor salivary glands, which are usually fluctuant and may blanch or show translucency, and very small fibromas or irritation fibromas, which are firm and match mucosal color when small [^113j9EHK]. I should also keep in mind that a foreign body granuloma could mimic a small mucosal nodule if there is a history of trauma or insertion, though this would more often be inflamed or erythematous [^112BN4vk].

> Wait, let me verify the features that truly distinguish these entities on exam. Torus palatinus feels rock-hard and bony, is immobile, and is contiguous with the palatal bone; focal mucinosis and fibroma are softer and compressible but still firm, mobile over deeper tissues, and non-tender; mucoceles are soft and may exhibit light translucency or blanching; malignancies and potentially malignant disorders more often show color change, surface irregularity, induration, fixation, ulceration, or growth, which are not described here as "normal color" and would contradict a reassuring exam [^113uB87p] [^1153YgsE] [^111Qo5AQ]. I should confirm there is no history of rapid enlargement, pain, bleeding, or functional interference, as these would shift pretest probabilities away from benign variants.

> Next, I should review the focused history that refines risk. I need to check onset and tempo — congenital or long-standing stable lesions favor tori or developmental nodules; recent or changing lesions prompt closer scrutiny. I should ask about trauma, hot foods, or denture irritation that could trigger reactive fibroma or foreign body reaction; about systemic symptoms or syndromic features that would raise concern for systemic disease with oral manifestations; and about tobacco or alcohol exposure that increases risk for oral cancer, even though a normal-colored, small, non-ulcerated lesion is low risk here [^1154qn5V]. Hold on, I should verify that no red flags are elicited — if none are present, observation with clear return precautions is reasonable.

> I will now examine the lesion systematically. Let me consider size, location relative to the incisive papilla and midline, surface texture, mobility, compressibility, translucency, and whether it is sessile or pedunculated. I should palpate to distinguish bony hardness from firm soft tissue and look for pulsation that would suggest vascular etiology. I need to ensure the overlying mucosa is intact and the color truly matches adjacent tissue, and I should inspect the rest of the oral cavity for additional lesions or contributory factors like sharp cusps or appliances. If I find classic features of torus palatinus — midline, hard, immobile, mucosa-covered — I can be confident in a clinical diagnosis without further testing in most cases [^113uB87p].

> But wait, what if the diagnosis remains uncertain after clinical examination? I should confirm whether imaging is warranted. For suspected torus or exostosis, a panoramic radiograph or limited CBCT can document bony continuity and exclude other bony pathology; for suspected soft-tissue lesions where depth, cystic change, or salivary origin is unclear, ultrasound can characterize cystic versus solid lesions, while MRI best delineates soft-tissue extent and perineural spread if malignancy is a concern; CT is helpful if there is suspected bony involvement or erosion. Given the vignette's "small, normal color" descriptor and lack of aggressive features, advanced imaging is likely unnecessary unless the lesion grows, becomes symptomatic, or shows atypical features on exam [^113uB87p] [^112cQbKq].

> Hold on, I should verify when to biopsy. Indications include persistence beyond 2–3 weeks without a clear diagnosis, growth, color change, ulceration, induration, fixation, or patient risk factors for malignancy. A systematic review supports that conventional oral examination has moderate sensitivity and specificity for cancer and potentially malignant disorders, so any non-diagnostic lesion persisting beyond two weeks warrants biopsy rather than continued observation. In this case, if the lesion is long-standing, stable, and classic for a torus or a small fibroma, observation with photographic documentation is appropriate. If it is new, changing, or atypical, an excisional or incisional biopsy is the gold standard for definitive diagnosis [^111Qo5AQ] [^113wcxpV].

> Let me synthesize the most likely diagnosis and immediate management. Given a small, normal-colored lesion at the anterior hard palate without symptoms or red flags, the leading consideration is a small torus palatinus or mucosal-covered bony exostosis, with oral focal mucinosis or a tiny fibroma as alternatives if the consistency is not bony. I should provide reassurance, explain benign nature and stability, and arrange follow-up in 6–12 months to confirm stability; I need to ensure the patient knows to return sooner if the lesion enlarges, changes color, ulcerates, becomes painful, or interferes with function. No treatment is indicated for asymptomatic tori or small benign mucosal nodules unless they interfere with prosthesis, traumatize, or are cosmetically concerning, in which case conservative excision can be considered [^113uB87p].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what if this is actually a mucocele mimicking a normal-color nodule? I should double-check for fluctuance and translucency. If present, aspiration or ultrasound can support a cystic salivary origin, and management would still be conservative unless symptomatic or recurrent, with marsupialization or excision reserved for persistent cases. Conversely, if on follow-up the lesion grows, becomes firm and fixed, or the mucosa changes, I should reconsider the differential to include salivary neoplasms and other submucosal processes and proceed with imaging and tissue diagnosis per the palatal lump algorithm [^112cQbKq] [^111Qo5AQ].

> Finally, I need to ensure my counseling is clear and safety-netting is in place. I will document baseline measurements and take a clinical photograph, explain red flags that warrant earlier reassessment, and emphasize that most small, normal-colored palatal nodules are benign developmental or reactive lesions. I should confirm that the patient understands the plan and provide written instructions, aligning with best practices for oral lesion evaluation and surveillance in primary care and dental settings [^1154qn5V] [^113wcxpV].

A small, normal-colored nodule at the palate tip is most often a **benign mucosal nodule** (fibroma, papilloma, or mucocele) [^113j9EHK] or a **torus palatinus** (midline bony exostosis) [^113uB87p]. These are common, asymptomatic, and require no treatment unless symptomatic or cosmetically bothersome. If the lesion changes, grows, or persists, obtain a **clinical evaluation and consider biopsy** to exclude malignancy [^111Qo5AQ] [^113wcxpV].

## Clinical evaluation

- **History**: Onset, duration, growth, symptoms, trauma, smoking/alcohol, systemic symptoms [^1154qn5V].
- **Examination**: Size, color, consistency, mobility, ulceration, induration, lymphadenopathy [^113wcxpV].
- **Imaging**: Not routine; consider CT/MRI if large, atypical, or suspected malignancy [^112cQbKq].

---

## Indications for biopsy or excision

- **Change in size, color, or shape**.
- **Persistence beyond 2 weeks without diagnosis** [^113wcxpV].
- **Suspicion of malignancy (firm, ulcerated, indurated, non-healing)** [^111Qo5AQ].
- **Patient preference or cosmetic concern**.

---

## Management and follow-up

Observation is appropriate for small, asymptomatic, **benign-appearing lesions** [^notfound]. Excision is indicated for symptomatic, cosmetically bothersome, or **suspicious lesions** [^111Qo5AQ]. Follow-up should include reassessment if the lesion changes or new symptoms develop [^notfound].

---

A small, normal-colored nodule at the palate tip is usually **benign** (fibroma, papilloma, mucocele, or torus palatinus) [^notfound]. Observation is reasonable unless the lesion changes or becomes symptomatic; biopsy or excision is warranted if suspicion for malignancy arises or the patient requests removal [^111Qo5AQ].

### Maxillary reconstruction using the scapular tip free flap: a radiologic comparison of 3D morphology [^116Q1Vxh]. Head & Neck (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Scapular tip osteomyogenous free flaps have been described for complex palate reconstruction. Minimal osteotomies are needed because of the similar shapes of the scapula and palate. We compared the bony morphology of the palate and scapular tip to determine the suitability of the scapular tip for palate reconstruction.

Methods

We analyzed facial and chest CT images of 10 patients, comparing the morphology of 3 simulated palate resection specimens (total palate, subtotal palate, and hemipalate) with corresponding simulated scapular tip bone flaps from the same patient.

Results

Conformance distances between palates and simulated flaps were small, indicating close shape similarity. Median conformance distances were 3.44 mm for hemipalatectomy, 3.56 mm for subtotal palatectomy, and 3.71 mm for total palatectomy. Six outlier observations accrued from 2 patients.

Conclusions

Based on this analysis, there is close similarity between the shapes of the palate and the scapular tip. This similarity supports use of the scapular tip flap for selected palate defects.

### A unique presentation of epignathus [^112aBfjR]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Palatal clefts in conjunction with space-occupying lesions of the oral or nasal cavities are of interest because they may represent a developmental etiology of palatal clefts. Epignathus is a rare space-occupying tumor of the nasopharynx that can arise from the upper jaw, palate, and sphenoid. It can protrude through the mouth, causing respiratory embarrassment and death. The pathogenesis of epignathus is unknown, but several theories have been proposed. Management depends on the size of the tumor and requires a multidisciplinary approach.

Torus palatinus, torus mandibularis and torus maxillaris

Torus palatinus (TP) is an exostosis occurring along either side of the midline suture of the hard palate. Torus mandibularis (TM) is an exostosis occurring along the lingual surface of the mandible, whereas torus maxillaris (TMax) occurs on the palatal or vestibular side of the alveolar process of the maxilla. According to anthropological studies, tori appear to be more common among populations living in the northern hemisphere as compared to those residing in the south. Although both tori clinically present around the age of 20 years, they are thought to be detectable during infancy too. Since both tori present as an intraoral swelling covered by intact mucosa, they may constitute a diagnostic dilemma (Fig. 6). Although tori usually have no clinical significance, they can be a cause for major parental concern. Most tori do not undergo surgery unless they interfere with dentition and function. The radiologic aspect is straightforward on CT/CBCT or MRI, which depicts a classical exostosis in a typical location (Fig. 6). Although TM and TMax are often bilateral, they may be unilateral or asymmetric, thereby rendering the diagnosis more challenging. Based on radiological findings, it is difficult to misinterpret tori as malignant bone lesions considering their typical aspect and position in association with absent involvement of the overlying soft tissues. However, in some cases, the soft tissues covering the bone growth can become ulcerated and the torus is perceived as new and worrisome, either by the patient him-/herself or at clinical examination.

2.3 Administration

The immediate-release tablets can be taken as whole, dispersed or crushed tablets by mouth, or as dispersed tablets through a nasogastric or orogastric tube (French size 10 or larger). The suspension may be prepared ahead of time and stored at room temperature for up to 8 hours.

Administration of Dispersed Tablets or Crushed Tablets by Mouth

Place the appropriate number of tablets for the prescribed dose into a suitable container. If desired, the tablets may be crushed. Add the appropriate volume of drinking water (other liquids have not been tested) to make a suspension (see Table 1 below).
Swirl the container gently to keep the particles from settling, and administer the suspension before it settles. The mixture will have a bitter taste.
Rinse the container with 15 mL of drinking water and administer the rinse water.
Repeat Step 3. Visually confirm that no particles are left in the container. If particles remain, repeat Step 3.

Administration of Dispersed Tablets through a Nasogastric (NG) or Orogastric (OG) Tube

Remove the cap (if applicable) and plunger out of a 50 or 60 mL catheter-tip compatible syringe or equivalent. Add two tablets into the syringe body and place the plunger back in the syringe. Only two tablets can be administered via NG or OG tube at a time.
Draw 30 mL of drinking water (other liquids have not been tested) into the syringe and hold the syringe with the tip pointing upward. Pull the plunger further to a higher volume position to have some air space in the syringe. Place the cap back on the syringe (if applicable). Shake the syringe well (careful not to spill the contents) for about 30 to 45 seconds or until the tablets are completely dispersed.
Once the tablets are completely dispersed in the syringe, remove the cap from the syringe again (if applicable) and attach the syringe to the NG or OG tube and administer the dispersion before it settles.
Draw 15 mL of water using the same syringe and flush through the same NG or OG tube.
Repeat Step 4 and make sure no particles are left in the syringe by visual inspection. If particles remain, repeat Step 4.
For doses of 800 mg (four 200 mg tablets) and 1,200 mg (six 200 mg tablets) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)], repeat Steps 1–5 until prescribed dose is reached. The same syringe, NG or OG tube can be used.

### Pediatric oral medicine [^113KVsmM]. Dermatologic Clinics (2003). Low credibility.

A thorough examination of the oral mucosa can provide helpful clues toward making a diagnosis in a number of developmental, neoplastic, inflammatory, and infectious conditions. A number of oral lesions seen in infants and children are benign and of no medical significance. In these instances, the ability of the physician to confidently identify the diagnosis, and reassure parents that a lesion is not worrisome, carries significant value. Likewise, the ability to recognize an underlying systemic illness or genetic disease based on an oral examination can also be of tremendous value, particularly when oral involvement is the presenting feature.

### Three-dimensional nasal morphology in cleft lip and palate operated adult patients [^1113Tdqy]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Nasal morphology was assessed three-dimensionally in 18 cleft lip and palate operated patients aged 19 to 27 years, and in 161 sex- and age-matched control subjects. Comparisons were performed by Student t and Watson-Williams' tests. No differences were found in nasal volume or surface. Nasal width, alar base width, and inferior width of the nostrils were significantly larger in male patients than in the reference men. The nasal bridge was shorter. Similar differences were found in the female patients. In addition, the right nostril was larger and the nasal height shorter. In men, the nasolabial and the nasal tip angles were smaller in the patients than in the reference subjects, whereas the facial convexity angle was larger in the patients. In conclusion, the nose of adult operated cleft lip and palate patients differed from that of normal control subjects. Surgical corrections of the cleft lip and palate failed to provide a completely normal appearance. The methods might be used to indicate where additional procedures might be performed to approximate a reference population.

### Importance of muscle movement for normal craniofacial development [^1128tcvL]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

After the craniofacial structures have completed embryologic development, movement of facial muscles begins. Paraxial mesoderm of the first (mastication) and second pharyngeal (facial expression) arches gives rise to the muscles of the craniofacial area. Muscles derived from the third and fourth pharyngeal arches are involved in swallowing and vocalization. For the human newborn face to have a normal morphologic appearance, contractions of these muscles must occur to stimulate forward growth of bone, cartilage growth, and facial muscle bulk. Facial muscles begin to contract between 6 and 8 weeks of embryonic development and can be observed on prenatal ultrasound by 9 weeks after fertilization. Lack of craniofacial muscle contractions may lead to ocular hypertelorism, flat zygoma and midface, high bridge of the nose, depressed tip of the nose, small and open mouth, trismus, microretrognathia, small tongue, and abnormal palate (high arch, bifid uvula, submucous cleft, and cleft palate).

Orthognathic Surgery

Orthognathic surgery to correct facial disharmony was part of the normal follow-up in our institution for children born with uCLP. When maxillary growth deficiency was obvious, it was confirmed by an analysis of cephalometric measurements. These measurements were made regularly, because bone growth of individual parts could happen at different speeds, and a good articular congruence with a good esthetic profile could deteriorate quite quickly during puberty. When planning corrective surgery, facial aesthetics, profile harmony and intermaxillary occlusal relationships are essential parameters to consider. Objective indications for orthognathic surgery are based on cephalometric variables: intermaxillary relationship in the sagittal plane: SNA, SNB, and ANB angles (S = sella, N = nasion, A = subspinal, and B = supramental) and Wits appraisal (perpendiculars from points A and B onto the occlusal plane). The distance from the upper lip to the e-Line (line drawn from the tip of the nose to the chin) is one of the measurements used to assess soft tissue profile harmony. A maxillary advancement with a Le Fort I osteotomy was the most common orthognathic procedure. Due to a possible transversal collapse of the maxillary arches on each side of the cleft, caused by the scarring tissue, this advancement could not always be achieved in one piece. In these cases, the maxilla needed to be segmented into 2 or 3 pieces. Surgical treatment was correlated with the orthodontic treatment and performed at the end of the growth period, between the ages of 16 and 18. The cranio-facial surgeon, always present in the team, did all the bone grafts and the maxillary advancements.

Rhinoplasty

Ideally, rhinoplasty was planned at the end of growth and after completion of orthodontic treatment. The operation involved a small incision below the nose and necessitated a cartilage graft harvested from the ear. The deviation of the nasal septum was also corrected during the same surgical procedure. A thermoformable splint was used for several days or weeks. This surgery represented the final step in the mutlidisciplinary follow-up.

### Pediatric tongue lesions: an often-overlooked but important collection of diagnoses [^117Nfq46]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to discuss imaging techniques and provide a pictorial review of pediatric tongue lesions. CONCLUSION. Pediatric tongue lesions represent an often-overlooked collection of abnormalities with a variety of clinical and radiologic features. The location of these lesions places the patient at risk for airway compromise. Systematic imaging evaluation of pediatric tongue lesions can help the radiologist arrive at a correct and timely diagnosis, thus improving and expediting patient care.

### Myosin-dependent short actin filaments contribute to peripheral widening in developing stereocilia [^1177kjB1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To assess the consequence of myosin loss on tip filaments in IHC stereocilia, Myo3a and Myo3b were mutated with CRISPR/Cas9 that was delivered to E0.7 embryos in situ by the i-GONAD technique, which generated a variety of small deletions in early exons of each gene that encode N-terminal kinase domains (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Myo3a Δ14/Δ14 Myo3b Δ12/Δ12 IHCs in mice bred from a G 0 founder (mutant 2 alleles, Supplementary Fig. 6a) had long and thin IHC stereocilia at P4 that resembled those from previously described Myo3a/b double knockouts(Fig. 7b). The mutant IHC stereocilia had markedly reduced His-TMOD1 staining at row 1 and row 2 stereocilia tips compared to cells from wild-type tissue, or from littermate mice heterozygous at both loci (Fig. 7b, c). Using a similar approach, we also generated a Myo15a mutant mouse with a 25-base pair deletion in exon 19, which encodes the motor domain. Homozygous Myo15a Δ25/Δ25 IHCs had reduced pointed-end labeling as compared to heterozygous littermates (Fig. 7d-e), though the decrease was less than for the Myo3a/b mutants. A similar reduction in His-TMOD1 staining was observed in mice homozygous for the well-characterized Myo15a shaker allele (Supplementary Fig. 6d), which has a mutation in the motor domain thought to abolish the function of all isoforms. In addition, one G 0 CRISPR/Cas9 Myo15a mutant had a mosaic phenotype where hair cells with normal morphology and His-TMOD1 staining were adjacent to cells with short stereocilia and reduced His-TMOD1 levels (Supplementary Fig. 6c). Finally, MYO3A localized normally in the Myo15a Δ25/Δ25 mutant (Supplementary Fig. 6e). Similarly, MYO15A localized to stereocilia tips at normal levels in the Myo3a/b double mutant (Supplementary Fig. 6f), suggesting that each myosin independently contributes to tip filament levels.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional oral examination for detecting oral cavity cancer and potentially malignant disorders in patients with clinically evident oral lesions: systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Qo5AQ]. Head & Neck (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Oral cancer (OC), defined as cancers of the lips, tongue, cheeks, floor of the mouth, hard and soft palate, sinuses, and pharynx, has an incidence of more than 300 000 cases per year. The prognosis of OC is improved when it is detected at an early stage, with a 5 year survival rate of 75% for stage I disease which is drastically reduced to 30% at stage IV of the disease. This review focusses on cancer of the oral cavity, including the lips, the lining inside the cheeks and lips, the front two thirds of the tongue, the upper and lower gums, the floor of the mouth under the tongue, the bony roof of the mouth, and the small area behind the wisdom teeth.

The diagnostic pathway for identifying oral cavity cancers (OCC) and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) in patients with a clinically evident lesion starts with a full clinical history, followed by conventional oral examination (COE), which includes a thorough head and neck examination, evaluation of oral mucosa by visual inspection under incandescent overhead light or halogen illumination available on the dental chair, and palpation. Features of COE which may be indicative of OCC or oral dysplastic lesions include non‐homogenous appearance such as changes in surface texture, color and size; loss of surface integrity; alteration in the surface, for example, slightly raised lesions; nonhealing ulceration or tethering of the tissues (suggesting deeper invasion). The suspicious lesion then undergoes histological examination using either incisional or excisional biopsy, the gold standard for diagnosing cancer or epithelial dysplasia. However, this diagnostic pathway approach has limitations in that the findings of COE are subjective and dependent on the experience and expertise of the clinician, while biopsy is invasive and can lead to morbidity. Although various aids and adjuncts to COE have been developed, there is little consensus on which, if any, are most reliable, and standard care in many countries remains COE followed by biopsy, if needed.

This systematic review evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of COE (visual inspection) compared with incisional or excisional biopsy (gold standard) for the diagnosis of OCC and/or OPMDs in patients with a clinically evident oral lesion.

### Diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (ASTMH) [^114rc5VV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cryotherapy — regimen, combination with intralesional antimony, outcomes, and safety are described as follows: An example approach is liquid nitrogen with a cotton-tipped applicator for 15–20 seconds until 1–2 mm of circumferential skin appears frozen, then thaw for 20–60 seconds, repeat the freeze step, and repeat the process at 3-week intervals until healing occurs. In 2 controlled clinical trials in Iran, intralesional (IL) SbV, cryotherapy, or both were administered every 1–2 weeks for 6–8 weeks; combined treatment arms had higher therapeutic success rates (89% and 91%). Lesions most responsive were small (< 30 mm width), on the face or neck, and older than 3 months. When cryotherapy is combined with IL SbV, the cryo is completed with no second freeze step and the skin allowed to normalize in color before SbV injection a few seconds later. Adverse effects include immediate iceball formation, erythema, swelling, and burning pain; both hypo- and hyperpigmentation occur and generally improve by 6–12 months of follow-up, though keloids may form. Cryotherapy should be considered in smaller, recent-onset, uncomplicated CL lesions, including nonulcerative forms; it has been well tolerated on the face, but avoidance of eyelids, lips, nose, and ears is recommended. It can be used during pregnancy and at lactation. Success depends on operator skill and complete, careful application, and treatment should extend into normal-appearing tissue around lesions.

### Facial characterization of infants with cleft lip and palate using a three-dimensional capture technique [^112cfG5Q]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To characterize the soft tissue features of infants with unilateral cleft lip (UCL) and unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (UCLP) prior to primary surgery and compare with noncleft controls.

Design

Prospective controlled capture of the facial morphology of infants using a noninvasive three-dimensional stereophotogrammetry method.

Participants

23 children with presurgical cleft: 11 UCL (M = 6, F = 5); 12 UCLP (M = 9, F = 3), and 21 noncleft controls (M = 7, F = 14) were imaged at approximately 3 months of age (range 10 to 16 weeks).

Main Outcome Measure

Accurate, repeatable quantification of facial soft tissues in infants with clefts prior to surgery.

Results

Significant differences (p < .05) were found between the UCLP group and UCL and control groups in anatomical and soft nose width, cleft-side alar wing length, and nasal tip horizontal displacement. Both cleft groups were significantly different from controls and from each other in cleft-side nostril dimensions, alar wing angulation, columella angle, and alar base to corner of mouth dimension; alar base width; and soft tissue defect in nose and the lip and philtrum length bordering the cleft. Significant differences between clefts and controls were identified in the nostril and philtrum on the noncleft side.

Conclusions

The use of children with UCL as controls for UCLP studies is inappropriate. This technique overcame the limitations of direct measurement of infant faces to aid the surgeon in the planning and subsequent re-evaluation of surgical rationale.

### Impact of gender-affirming rhinoplasty techniques on objective facial appearance [^112a5Mwa]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

In our cohort, we found that alar base and nasal width, nasolabial and nasofrontal angles were consistently decreased postoperatively, and in a fashion that was in line with prior population studies evaluating these measures, as well as previously established norms in the Facial Plastic literature. Tip width was found to be challenging to appropriately measure in retrospective fashion using image analysis, due in part to the fact that tip width is best measured in photographs taken from below the patient's face pointed upward, which does not allow for normalization by iris diameter. However, to the best of our ability to measure the light reflections of the tips in frontal view, tip width was found to decrease, which is consistent with the female nose. Only nasofacial angle was not found to change significantly, and this is likely due to the fact that this measure is significantly impacted by a number of nonnasal measures including mandibular projection, which is commonly separately altered during GFS. In our cohort, mandibuloplasty was performed at a high rate of 87.9%.

### Long-term control of nasal tip position: quantitative assessment of caudal septal extension graft [^114jcq5D]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Control of nasal tip position is critical to final rhinoplasty outcomes. Two frequent methods of exerting tip control are columellar strut and caudal septal extension graft (SEG). Past work has demonstrated that SEG are better able to preserve tip position. However, there is no quantitative data describing long-term projection and rotation. The purpose of this study was to analyze long-term maintenance of tip projection and rotation following SEG.

Methods

A retrospective study of adult patients undergoing open rhinoplasty was conducted. Three-dimensional photogrammetric evaluation of nasal tip position was performed. Anthropometric points were analyzed preoperatively and postoperatively. Outcome variables were tip projection, tip rotation, and nasal length.

Results

Twenty patients were included with an average follow-up time of 3.3 years (2.0–6.6 years). From postoperative week 1 to 6, there was a statistically significant decrease in rotation (-4.3%, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant decreases in projection, rotation, or nasal length from 6 weeks postoperative to 2 years postoperative, or from 6 weeks postoperative to final follow-up (2.0–6.6 years).

Conclusions

Nasal tip projection and rotation appear to decrease from the immediate postoperative position, likely due to resolving edema. In this study, patients that underwent open rhinoplasty with SEG experienced modest loss of projection and rotation until 6 weeks postoperative, but projection and rotation were maintained from 6 weeks postoperative to 2 years and beyond. This study provides evidence that SEG maintains long-term changes in tip projection and rotation.

### Triple strut concept for the nasal tip projection in small lower lateral cartilages and septum [^111EWrHK]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the triple strut graft technique for nasal tip projection in Asian patients with weak and small lower lateral cartilages and septum. The technique uses a combination of septal angle strut and, columellar strut grafts and lateral crural repositioning to provide support for the nasal tip.

Methods

The study included 30 Asian patients who underwent primary rhinoplasty using this technique between January 2019 and December 2021. The surgical procedure involved making an open rhinoplasty incision and performing a scroll area release. A small triangular-shaped septal angle strut graft was then placed, and the lower lateral cartilages were suspended anteriorly and placed on the anterior end of the septal angle after a columellar strut graft was performed between both medial crura. The lateral crura of the lower lateral cartilages were transposed medially on top of the upper lateral cartilages and maintained in place by spanning sutures at the cephalic margins of both lateral crura.

Results

The triple strut graft technique was shown to be effective in providing stable tip projection in Asian noses with weak and small lower lateral cartilages and septum. Statistically significant differences were found between the preoperative and postoperative values of the nasal tip projection ratio and Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

The triple strut graft tip projection technique can be an effective surgical option for Asian patients who have weak and small medial crura combined with a small septum, providing stability for the nasal tip projection.

### Anthropometric evaluation of complete unilateral cleft lip nose with cone beam CT in early childhood [^117QrbWy]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Anthropometric evaluation of cleft lip nasal growth has generally been done based on Mulliken's method. However, this method does not allow sufficient evaluation of nasal tip position. Nasal tip position is the most important parameter for evaluation of nasal growth. Therefore, an anthropometric study was performed including vertical nasal tip position.

Methods

Fifteen normal subjects in early childhood (Normal Group), 15 age-matched subjects with complete unilateral cleft lip and alveolus or complete unilateral cleft lip, alveolus, and palate without rhinoplasty (No Rhinoplasty Group), and 16 age-matched subjects with complete unilateral cleft lip and alveolus or complete unilateral cleft lip, alveolus, and palate with synchronous rhinoplasty during primary repair of cleft lip (Primary Rhinoplasty Group) were compared. Nasolabial angle (beta), nasal tip angle (alpha), nasal width (al-al), columellar length (sn-c'), nasal tip protrusion (sn-prn), and vertical nasal tip position (sn'-prn'/sn'-n') were measured.

Results

With the exception of vertical nasal tip position, the measurement data of the Primary Rhinoplasty Group were excellent. In the cleft lip groups, vertical nasal tip position was significantly higher than that in the Normal Group.

Conclusions

Our results showed that the nasal tips of cleft lip patients showed significant congenital upward deviation in comparison with normal children. In Mulliken's method, this upward deviation cannot be evaluated properly. After synchronous rhinoplasty, measurement results showed improvement in our patients without significant deterioration of tip position. These findings represent evidence in support of synchronous rhinoplasty.

### Primary cleft palate repair [^114s2unB]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several factors to consider when planning cleft palate repair. It is important to review the patient's associated comorbidities, as they impact decisions on perioperative management and family counseling. Many comorbidities change the risk of postoperative airway obstruction, velopharyngeal insufficiency, or fistula formation. It is also critical to determine the type of cleft palate to be addressed, as this influences the decision on which technique is most appropriate for optimal patient outcome. Common surgical techniques for palatoplasty are reviewed in detail and outcomes are discussed as it relates to various techniques. Intraoperative photographs are included to detail the procedures.

### Imaging of palatal lumps [^112cQbKq]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Palatal tumours are relatively rare and of variable aetiology, rendering radiological evaluation a daunting process for many. A systematic approach to the imaging of a palatal lump is therefore essential. The hard and soft palates are oral cavity and oropharyngeal structures, respectively. They have different tissue compositions, and therefore, lesions occur with different frequencies at each site. The hard palate has the highest concentration of minor salivary glands in the upper aerodigestive tract and most tumours here are salivary in origin, whereas most tumours at the soft palate are epithelial in origin, i.e., squamous cell carcinomas, in line with other oropharyngeal subsites. The most common malignant tumours of the palate, after squamous cell carcinoma, are minor salivary gland tumours, predominantly adenoid cystic and mucoepidermoid carcinomas. These tumours have a propensity to spread perineurally; understanding the anatomy and imaging features of perineural spread is vital, as it can have significant implications for patient management and tumour resectability. When confronted with a palatal lump, it is important to consider the following: its location on the hard or soft palate; whether it is mucosal or submucosal; the frequently occurring lesions at that site; the most suitable imaging techniques (ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging); whether there are typical imaging features for any of the common lesions; and whether there are aggressive features, such as bone erosion or perineural spread. This approach allows the radiologist to narrow the differential diagnosis and assist the clinicians with planning treatment.

### "I smile, but without showing my teeth": the lived experience of cleft, lip, and palate in adults [^114vmUMY]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

To integrate the looks from others

Many participants mentioned appearance in terms such as "no big problem", while at the same time saying that one had to accept one would never to be "the prettiest girl in class". At the time they were newly born, their parents could have been recommended not to take pictures of their child and also to restrict visits from siblings. Some felt that their cleft was a taboo, and 1 participant had to ask her dentist for the only pictures she knew existed of her as a baby.

My dentist was very nice, and at my last consultation, he asked me: "Is there anything I can do for you, (name)?" Yes, I said, I would very much like to have the pictures you have of me before the cleft was closed.

Both during childhood and as adults, they could be hesitant about being photographed or they adjusted their appearance when photos were taken, like the experience of this man.

Of course, with regard to photos. One wishes to have a good smile, a winning smile. So, I smile, but like without (showing my) teeth.

Typically, the mirror also reminded them of the cleft.

I do check my profile in the mirror whenever I have the chance, and it is certainly the reason (the cleft).

Awareness of one's own profile could also influence the preferred place of seating, for example, in a bus or plane, so they could show their best profile and hide the profile they appreciated least.

An example of what I would have experienced as very unpleasant is to sit next to someone on the bus. If they looked out of the window, they would see my face in profile; that is unpleasant.

All the participants appreciated and valued the results of surgery in regard to functioning and appearance.

Beside the operations when I was a baby, to move the jaw forward and avoid underbite and to correct the leaning nose I had before, to get it more straight, it has certainly done something for my self-image and self-confidence.

To a varying extent, the participants had noticed and interpreted stares from others both during childhood and as adults. People they met could still ask for an explanation of their appearance, for example, whether they had broken their nose or had been a boxer. Moreover, mirrors and pictures reminded them of the objectifying looks, causing some to adjust their habitual behavior, hide their smile, or change their profile.

### Management of the cleft palate [^116jYrDb]. Facial Plastic Surgery Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Oral clefts are among the most common of all birth defects. The exact etiology of palatal clefting is unclear, however, it is believed to be a multifactorial disruption of embryologic morphogenesis. Evaluation of these patients is complex and requires a thorough understanding of palatal anatomy and embryology. A team approach is used to addresses the varied anatomic, genetic, and psychosocial issues that surround these patients and their families. This article reviews the anatomy, embryology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of children with cleft palate.

### Binderoid complete cleft lip / palate [^114f5JT2]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

A small subset of infants with complete cleft lip/palate look different because they have nasolabiomaxillary hypoplasia and orbital hypotelorism. The authors' purpose was to define the clinical and radiographic features of these patients and to comment on operative management, classification, and terminology. The authors reviewed 695 patients with all forms of incomplete and complete cleft lip/palate and identified 15 patients with nasolabiomaxillary hypoplasia and orbital hypotelorism. All 15 patients had complete labial clefting (5 percent of 320 patients with complete cleft lip/palate), equally divided between bilateral and unilateral forms. The female-to-male ratio was 2:1. Of the seven infants with unilateral complete cleft lip/palate, one had an intact secondary palate and all had a hypoplastic septum, small alar cartilages, narrow basilar columella, underdeveloped contralateral philtral ridge, ill-defined Cupid's bow, thin vermilion-mucosa on both sides of the cleft, and a diminutive premaxilla. Of the eight infants with bilateral complete cleft lip, one had an intact secondary palate. The features were the same as in patients with unilateral cleft, but with a more severely hypoplastic nasal tip, conical columella, tiny prolabium, underdeveloped lateral labial elements, and small/mobile premaxilla. Central midfacial hypoplasia and hypotelorism did not change during childhood and adolescence. Intermedial canthal measurements remained 1.5 SD below normal age-matched controls. Skeletal analysis (mean age, 10 years; range, 4 months to 19 years) documented maxillary retrusion (mean sagittal maxillomandibular discrepancy, 13.7 mm; range, 3 to 17 mm), absent anterior nasal spine, and a class III relationship. The mean sella nasion A point (S-N-A) angle of 74 degrees (range, 65 to 79 degrees) and sella nasion B point (S-N-B) angle of 81 degrees (range, 71 to 90 degrees) were significantly different from age-matched norms (= 0.0007 and = 0.004, respectively). The ipsilateral central and lateral incisors were absent in all children with unilateral cleft, whereas a single-toothed premaxilla was typically found in the bilateral patients. Several modifications were necessary during primary nasolabial repair because of the diminutive bony and soft-tissue elements. All adolescent patients had Le Fort I maxillary advancement and construction of an adult nasal framework with costochondral or cranial graft. Other often-used procedures were bony augmentation of the anterior maxilla; cartilage grafts to the nasal tip and columella; and dermal grafting to the median tubercle, philtral ridge, and basal columella. Infants with complete unilateral or bilateral cleft lip/palate in association with nasolabiomaxillary hypoplasia and orbital hypotelorism do not belong on the holoprosencephalic spectrum because they have normal head circumference, stature, and intelligence, nor should they be referred to as having Binder anomaly. The authors propose the term cleft lip/palate for these children. Early recognition of this entity is important for counseling parents and because alterations in standard operative methods and orthodontic protocols are necessary.

### Three-dimensional analyses of nasal forms after secondary treatment of bilateral cleft lip-nose deformity in comparison to those of healthy young adults [^111GiEkq]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To 3-dimensionally analyze outcomes after the secondary treatment of bilateral cleft lip-nose deformity at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Kagoshima University Hospital, Kagoshima, Japan.

Patients and Methods

Ten Japanese male young adults with bilateral cleft lip with or without palate (BCL ± P) who had undergone definitive nose correction and were followed up for 1 to 4 years were enrolled in this study. Ten unaffected race- and gender-matched young adults were used as controls. All patients underwent secondary correction of the nose by open rhinoplasty through a bilateral reverse-U incision, columellar strut graft, and medial-upward advancement of the nasolabial components with vestibular expansion by use of a free mucosal graft. In 3 patients with an extremely short columella, an inferiorly based small pedicle flap from rim skin rotated into the columellar base was added for columella lengthening. Nasal forms were periodically measured by use of a 3-dimensional noncontact laser scanner. The angular and linear measurements and the curvature of the alar groove arch were compared between patients and control subjects.

Results

Comparison of the preoperative and postoperative nasal forms showed significant improvements in the nasal dorsum and tip angles, as well as nasal height. The size of the nasal alar grooves was also increased to the same size range as the control subjects. There were persistent differences between postoperative columellar angle and nasal width in patients and those in the control subjects.

Conclusions

Our surgical procedures can provide an acceptably protruded nasal form for patients with BCL ± P without damaging the upper lip tissue, but further improvement to prevent nasal tip overprojection may be useful.

### Histologic aspect of the curved vomerine mucosa in cleft lip and palate [^116VWJpA]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Relevance for Cleft Lip and Palate Repair

The vomer mucosa showed no specific signs of nasal mucosa. From this histological point of view, surgical techniques should be reconsidered. We must challenge the pure use of the entire vomer mucosa as a cranial pedicled flap for nasal floor reconstruction (eg, 2-flap palatoplasty). Veau (1931) has already subdivided the cleft palate into vomer and the true cleft (Figure 2B). The former spanning across the noncleft nasal floor and bottom of the osseous septum, the latter spanning across the absent nasal floor that opens into the nasal cavity on the cleft side. This distinct division of the palatal cleft area has not been given the full attention in surgical and presurgical protocols so far. In staged surgical concepts, typically the first step — whether lip or soft palate repair — has the mere intention to simplify or make the subsequent hard palate cleft repair less invasive. Whereas cleft orthopedics has shaped the definition and measurements of cleft palate width and cleft area mostly ignoring the vomer region. The vomer region is more difficult to identify on cleft impressions, even more so after the first step of surgical repair that leads to growth alteration. In contrast, in unilateral clefts without surgical treatment with undisturbed growth after birth until adulthood, the vomer area and true cleft area can be clearly distinguished, as can be seen repeatedly in photographs of unoperated adults. The vomer region has been generally considered as part of the nose without question. This has shaped outcome research to quantify the change in cleft palate morphology as well as led to clinical recommendations for the timing of surgery. Although this central region of the vomer has not been studied, it has had and continues to have an impact on treatment approaches. Therefore, the concept of the nasal opening "the true cleft" has not been widely used in surgical concepts or in measuring the effect of orthodontic treatment. Current research on cleft palate morphology and thus surgical concepts still imply that the vomer belongs to the cleft palate. Considering the true cleft described by Veau and the finding that the vomer mucosa is not a nasal mucosa, the exact definition of cleft palate needs to be challenged. What we define as cleft palate and how we translate it into orthodontic research and surgery should be reopened for discussion based on our findings. The clinical relevance of our results will therefore depend on whether we as cleft surgeons and orthodontists have the flexibility to rethink "the center of our field of action". To anatomically reconstruct a symmetrical nasal floor, only a small part of the vomer mucosa is necessary. Figure 3A shows an incision outline on the vomer that contributes minimally to the reconstruction of the nasal layer and leaves substantial tissue for oral closure. We propose allocation of the vomer tissue to reconstruct the oral and nasal layer likewise. If only as little as necessary is used for the symmetrical reconstruction of the nasal floor, most of the vomer mucosa can be used to reconstruct the oral layer. This would support the hypothesis that the structures are present in the case of a cleft and they are only modified by the cleft. Technically, a small 5/8 needle with a cone point (eg, FR-10 Art.6O15132 T; Serag Wiessner) is advisable to sew the nasal layer tightly in spite of limited vomer tissue turnover. Without previous lip surgery (Figure 3), the nasal layer can be sutured from the oral side, and especially in the case of narrow clefts, it is technically easier to suture the nasal layer anteriorly from the vestibular (extraoral) side. From a biological point of view, additional tissue to close the oral layer could enable minimal lateral incisions or eliminate the need for lateral relief incisions even in unilateral cleft lip and palate repair. Reduced secondary healing lead to less scarring, having a negative impact on growth. The preservation of vascularity could also facilitate primary wound healing to achieve lower fistula rates. The amount of tissue required to close the true cleft depends on treatments performed prior to hard palate cleft repair. With passive presurgical orthopedics or lip taping, the true cleft can be reduced in a clinically relevant amount even without prior lip surgery. By combining presurgical reduction of the hard palate cleft and limiting reconstruction to the true cleft by proportional distribution of vomer tissue, cleft palate repair could be facilitated. In this regard, prior lip surgery aiming to reduce the hard palate cleft could be questioned. When the curved vomer mucosa is surgically rotated into the oral cavity, it retains its difference in color from the palatal mucosa. However, it remains uncertain as to whether the vomer mucosa would ever transform into a typical nasal mucosa when it is surgically turned into the nasal cavity. It also remains unclear whether the vomerine mucosa is embryologically formed as a typical nasal mucosa and undergoes reparative adaptive changes or whether it is a mucosal transition zone between the oral and nasal mucosa. This is supported by the common, yet unspecific characteristics of both types of mucosa found in the vomer mucosa. Even if the macroscopic aspect of the vomer mucosa differs from the palatal mucosa, our histological results indicate that the vomerine tissue is adequate for use in oral reconstruction from a histoanatomical point of view. These findings should be considered when further refining the optimal anatomical reconstruction method to apply to cleft palates.

### Three-dimensional anthropometric analysis of racial and ethnic differences in unilateral and bilateral cleft nasal deformity [^117GgvVQ]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study used three-dimensional measurements to provide a nasolabial analysis of patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP), and controls across different races and ethnicities.

Design

A retrospective comparative study.

Setting

Tertiary care pediatric institution.

Patients, Participants

The study included 90 patients with UCLP, 43 patients with BCLP, and 90 matched controls. Patients are separated as self-identified Caucasian, Hispanic, or African American.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Nasal length, nasal protrusion, columellar height, columellar width, tip width, alar width, alar base width, nasolabial angle, upper lip length, philtrum length, nostril height, and nostril width.

Results

All UCLP groups had significantly greater columella and tip widths and decreased nasolabial angles than controls. All BCLP groups had significantly greater columella width, tip width, nasolabial angle, and nostril widths. Upper lip length, philtrum length, and nostril height were significantly decreased in BCLP compared to controls. Across UCLP groups, African Americans had significantly decreased nasal protrusion and columella height and a significantly increased columella width compared to Caucasians and Hispanics. Alar and alar base widths were significantly different between all groups. Across BCLP groups, the Caucasian nostril width was significantly less than the African Americans.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that when correcting nasolabial characteristics in patients with cleft lip, it is important to consider racial and ethnic differences to achieve a normal appearance. Specifically, goals for alar width, alar base width, nasal tip, and projection should be tailored to the patient's race and ethnicity.

### Triple strut concept for the nasal tip projection in small lower lateral cartilages and septum [^112c2xU4]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction:

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the triple strut graft technique for nasal tip projection in Asian patients with weak and small lower lateral cartilages and septum. The technique uses a combination of septal angle strut and, columellar strut grafts and lateral crural repositioning to provide support for the nasal tip.

Methods:

The study included 30 Asian patients who underwent primary rhinoplasty using this technique between January 2019 and December 2021. The surgical procedure involved making an open rhinoplasty incision and performing a scroll area release. A small triangular-shaped septal angle strut graft was then placed, and the lower lateral cartilages were suspended anteriorly and placed on the anterior end of the septal angle after a columellar strut graft was performed between both medial crura. The lateral crura of the lower lateral cartilages were transposed medially on top of the upper lateral cartilages and maintained in place by spanning sutures at the cephalic margins of both lateral crura.

Results:

The triple strut graft technique was shown to be effective in providing stable tip projection in Asian noses with weak and small lower lateral cartilages and septum. Statistically significant differences were found between the preoperative and postoperative values of the nasal tip projection ratio and Rhinoplasty Outcome Evaluation (P < 0.05).

Conclusions:

The triple strut graft tip projection technique can be an effective surgical option for Asian patients who have weak and small medial crura combined with a small septum, providing stability for the nasal tip projection.

### Unraveling a major burden of orofacial clefts analyses: classification of cleft palate fistulas by cleft surgeons [^112XPNvb]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cleft palate fistulas can be a complication of cleft palate repair. Three recent reviews indicate an incidence of 4.9–17.9% of the patients after primary palatoplasty, while a higher incidence seems to be correlated to the width of the cleft at the time of primary closure. – Fistulas can have a substantial impact on patient quality of life as they may negatively affect speech (eg, nasal air loss on high-pressure consonants, perpetuation of the use of compensatory articulation, cause discomfort when liquids pass through the fistula from the oral to the nasal cavity, and lead to dental and oral hygiene problems, including halitosis. – Another problem is the high recurrence risk after secondary surgery.

Palatal fistulas can occur in multiple locations of the palate and in different degrees of severity. They can be located in the anterior section of the palate (ie, located labial-alveolar and in the anterior part of the hard palate), in the mid-palate (ie, dorsal part of the hard palate), at the junction of the hard and soft palate and in the soft palate. Sizes of postoperative fistulas vary widely, from 1–2 millimeters up to multiple centimeters (the equivalent of an unrepaired cleft or larger in the case of prior tissue losses). As Folk et al. mentioned, in order to optimize operative planning, the size, shape and location of the fistula should be described as accurately as possible. The three-dimensional nature of the fistula should be examined through radiological techniques. But also, the nature of the fistula is important information. Is it the result of suboptimal healing after palate repair, or left untreated intentionally? Is it a primary or recurrent fistula? All these aspects are relevant when considering different surgical approaches.

### Oral melanoacanthoma of the palate: an unusual presentation of an uncommon entity [^111mPtdB]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The first case of oral MA was reported by Tomich in 1978. Since his initial report, fewer than 100 cases of this entity have been documented. The etiology of oral MA is not fully understood, but it is believed to be a reactive process. A history of trauma has been documented in some cases. Clinically, oral MAs present as well-defined dark-brown to black, smooth, flat, or slightly elevated lesions. They are typically asymptomatic; however, in some cases pruritus, pain, or burning has been reported.MAs rapidly increase in size and can reach a diameter of several centimeters within a few weeks. Because of this alarming presentation, biopsies are often performed to rule out melanoma. On microscopic examination, the melanin-producing dendritic melanocytes, which are normally limited to the basal epithelial layer, are heavily scattered throughout the surface epithelium. It is the dispersal of melanocytes into epithelial layers other than the basal epithelium that causes the discoloration and facilitates diagnosis. Epithelial acanthosis, spongiosis, and increased numbers of basal melanocytes are also important microscopic findings. Once a diagnosis of MA is rendered, no additional treatment is required. MA often regresses spontaneously and has no malignant potential.

Although cutaneous MAs have also been observed, the cutaneous variant is distinctly different from its oral counterpart. Cutaneous MA, first described by Bloch in 1927, is a benign mixed proliferation of keratinocytes and melanocytes and is considered to be a variation of seborrheic keratosis. Most cases of cutaneous MA have been seen in middle-age white adults without a gender predilection. The trunk is the most frequently affected site, and lesions present with a roughened or papillary surface. This appearance is in contrast to that of oral MA, which frequently appears as a rapidly expanding flat or slightly elevated pigmented lesion, usually involving the buccal mucosa. Unlike cutaneous cases, oral MA favors African-American women, with a mean age of presentation in the fourth to fifth decades of life.

The clinical differential diagnosis for oral MA may include other pigmented mucosal lesions such as physiologic pigmentation, medication-induced pigmentation, mucosal (intraoral) nevi, focal melanosis, and most importantly, melanoma. Most of these entities can be excluded with an accurate history, as only oral MA will achieve such a rapid growth in size during a period of only a few weeks. However, in cases in which such a history cannot be ascertained or is unknown, the histologic examination provides the definitive diagnosis.

Fig. 2
Definitions of main parameters on the midsagittal plane. In a, the two lines drawn from the hard palate, near the top of the oral cavity, and the hyoid, which are also normal to the posterior wall, define the two ends of the upper airway. The parameter h, a part of the upper airway length, is the distance from the upper edge of the second cervical vertebra to the hard palate plane. The average thickness of the posterior cervical soft tissue T ST is calculated from the area surrounded by the three lines and skin dividing the distance between the two parallel lines passing through the upper and lower edges of the second cervical vertebra. In b, the long axis of the tongue L LAX starts from the central point of the hyoid bone and ends at a point farthest from the hyoid on the tongue surface, and the short axis L SAX is the perpendicular bisector of L LAX ending on the tongue surfaces. The average thickness of the posterior cervical fat T NF is calculated by the area of the fat beneath the skin, from the bottoms of the second to the sixth cervical vertebrae, dividing the length of the central line. In c, The angles α and β represent the relative positions among the occipital bone, cervical vertebra, and nasion: β is the angle between the posterior wall of the upper airway and the occipital bone line drawn from the sellar to the tip of the clivus, and α is the angle between the occipital bone line and the line drawn from the nasion to the sellar. θ is the angle between the posterior wall of the upper airway and the line drawn from the nasion to the sellar.

### Histologic aspect of the curved vomerine mucosa in cleft lip and palate [^116Lfg88]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The number of examined cases is small, but they showed a uniform histological aspect. However, in the area of this malformation, the collection and examination of tissue is limited and can only be done from an ethical point of view as in our case with excess tissue. Since von Langenbeck described the palatal cleft closure in 1861, we are now able to describe to cleft surgeons, on the basis of a small number of cases, the histology of "the center of its field of action" in cleft, lip, and palate malformations, which must be emphasized as a strength. Further analysis of other centers with larger numbers of cases is necessary to confirm the consistency of our findings. Following findings on the histology of the vomer mucosa, different techniques should be investigated for their influence on tissue perfusion and wound healing. We used a presurgical orthopedic plate without any contact with the examined vomer. To exclude the possibility of metaplasia due to presurgical treatment, an external control without any pretreatment is planned. Further evidence of tissue differentiation could be provided by molecular differentiation and testing for specific antigens.

### Common oral manifestations of systemic disease [^114MSzvU]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Oral manifestations of systemic diseases are potential indicators of an array of conditions. Truly the oral cavity is a mirror that reflects and unravels many of the human body's internal secrets. Some of these manifestations are disease specific and help raise a high degree of suspicion for the alert clinician. Because oral manifestations may accompany many systemic diseases, it is essential that these are appropriately recognized to provide correct diagnosis and referral for treatment and patient care. Multiple entities involving the various areas of the oral cavity like the soft palate, hard palate, tongue, gingiva, oral mucosa, the dentition, periodontium, and the salivary gland tissue have been enlisted. Although this article is not all-inclusive, the authors highlight lesions or conditions that are directly related to or are caused by some of the more common systemic diseases, and hope to provide ample insight for physicians, dentists, and clinicians in otolaryngologic practice.

### Differences and similarities between Eastern and Western rhinoplasty: features and proposed algorithms [^111MVdxL]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Typical Eastern Undesirable Features

In Eastern rhinoplasty, the undesirable features are those opposite of Western rhinoplasty patients'. Most common complaints when rhinoplasty patients come are that their noses are "too small, too short, or upturned". Figure 4 shows the front and profile photos of a typical female Eastern rhinoplasty patient. From the front view, the dorsum appears wide because of the low dorsal height especially at the radix. Tip is bulbous despite very small and weak underlying LLC. The tip appears big often because of the thick skin envelope and subcutaneous tissue, in contrast to the etiology of large LLC in Western patients. On profile view, the tip is short and overrotated because of the small septum lacking support caudally for the tip cartilages. The same short septum is also responsible for the retracted columella. The low dorsum also exaggerated the tip upturned look. These features are listed in detail with their potential etiologies in Table 1.

FIGURE 4
An Eastern rhinoplasty patient with common undesirable features of a short upturned tip and low dorsum. The cartoon shows the underlying etiologies of low bony dorsum and a short septum lacking support to the tip.

Common Surgical Techniques and Algorithm for Eastern Rhinoplasty

The tip is the most important part of an Eastern rhinoplasty. It is also the most difficult part to improve. The tip lower lateral cartilages are often small and poorly supported, so determining the proper projection and/or derotation is the most essential task. Once the tip is optimized then dorsal augmentation can be easily achieved with the selected material carved to fit the new tip height. Hence, in Eastern rhinoplasty, the surgical sequence is reversed from the Western algorithm: the tip is first, then dorsum, and then additional tip refinement if necessary (Fig. 2).

One of the most versatile tools to control tip projection and create derotation is the septal extension graft. Adding an end-to-end septal extension graft is essentially turning a short Eastern septum into a long septum seen in Western patients. The bilateral lower lateral cartilages then can be released from original tethering structures and reanchored at a more projected and derotated position on the septal extension graft, much similar to the concept of the tongue-in-groove technique used in Western patients. Tip derotation is not always necessary, but projection is almost always required to improve an Eastern nose.

### Papillary cystadenocarcinoma of the hard palate [^111WxDXD]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Papillary cystadenocarcinoma (PCC) is an uncommon malignant tumour of the salivary gland, sometimes involving the minor salivary gland. Previously this entity was classified as an atypical type of adenocarcinoma, malignant papillary cystadenoma, low-grade papillary adenocarcinoma or mucus producing adenopapillary carcinoma. PCC is a glandular tumour with an indolent biological behaviour characterised by cysts and papillary endophytic projections. We report two cases of PCC involving the minor salivary gland of the hard palate. Both the patients presented with a swelling in the palate with difficulty in chewing. MRI revealed an extensively destructive lesion involving hard palate, alveolar ridge and maxillary antrum. Clinical and radiological features suggested the malignant nature of the lesion. Histopathology of incisional biopsy revealed tumour proliferation in a multicystic pattern, with extensive papillary proliferation. Diverse and cellular cytomorphology, and cellular and nuclear pleomorphism with few mitotic figures were the prominent features. Both the lesions were confirmed as PCC.

### Visualization of the fetal lip and palate: is brain-targeted MRI reliable? [^1143nBDF]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Objective: To evaluate the ability of brain-targeted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the anatomy of the fetal upper lip and palate. Design: Two independent readers made a blind retrospective review of 60 brain-targeted MRIs of fetuses from 20 to 38 gestational weeks (GW). Fifty-five MRIs were normal and five had orofacial anomalies, including one isolated cleft lip and four cleft lip and palate. Both normal and cleft MRIs had postnatal confirmation. The upper lip, primary palate, secondary palate, and nasal septum were scored into four levels, from evidently normal to evidently abnormal. In case of a suspected pathology, the readers attempted a diagnosis. Setting: Collaboration between a university hospital and a large private practice MRI center. Results: Interobserver agreement (weighted kappa) was 0.79 for the upper lip, 0.70 for the primary palate, 0.86 for the secondary palate, and 0.90 for the nasal septum. The scoring levels of the readers did not change significantly across gestational age. Normality was correctly scored in 96% to 100% of the normal lips and primary palates and in 93% to 97% of the normal secondary palates depending on the reader. A deviated septum was only scored in two fetuses with unilateral cleft palates. The readers identified all pathological cases. Conclusion: Brain-targeted fetal MRI in experienced hands seems to be highly accurate for the evaluation of the lip and palate in fetuses above 20 GW, regardless of gestational age. The assessment of the secondary palate may be slightly more limited than the lip or primary palate.

### Complications of central venous port systems: a pictorial review [^113vv9WA]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Normal imaging appearance after implantation

No universally accepted definition of the ideal position of the catheter tip exists. However, it has been advocated that the catheter tip is ideally located in the distal superior vena cava (SVC) in port systems implanted in the internal jugular or the subclavian vein: the large volume of blood in a wide caliber vein immediately dilutes administered medication and reduces risk of vascular damage. This is especially important in chemotherapeutic drugs, which are administered in solutions with high osmolality. They are known to damage the vascular wall with subsequent possible complications like infection and thrombotic occlusion and narrowing of the venous caliber — hence suboptimal tip position may lead to delayed complications.

On chest radiographs, the distal SVC projects over the right main/intermediate bronchus. Thus, placement of the tip at the crossing of the SVC and right main bronchus will provide adequate positioning (Fig. 1 a, b). During flow confirmation studies, complete filling of the port chamber with contrast material should be seen. Contrast material fills the venous tube without leakage, coming out of the tip to flow freely in the SVC (Fig. 1 c, d).

Fig. 1
Normal position of implanted port system. a Chest radiograph shows the tip of the venous catheter projecting onto the intersection with the intermediate bronchus, which suggests position in the SVC. b Coronal MDCT reformation (soft tissue window and minimum intensity projection of lung window) shows that intersection of the tip with intermediate bronchus indicates correct position in the SVC. c, d Flow confirmation study (c) before and (d) after injection of contrast. The port chamber is completely opacified (arrow), the venous tube does not show leakage, and contrast material exits freely at the tip flowing in antegrade direction (small arrows)

### Orofacial clefts | CDC… [^116u6Bkp]. archive.cdc.gov (2021). Medium credibility.

Cleft palate only is more often associated with additional birth defects and syndromes, so a careful physical examination with appropriate internal organ assessment is strongly recommended. Fig.
4. 22. Cleft palate, including hard and soft palate. Notes:

- Q35 is the generic code for cleft palate. However, avoid using this code if more specific information is available.
- A simple alternative approach to classification and coding is the LAHSAL method, used often by plastic surgeons to assess for treatment outcomes. In surveillance it is best used in addition to, rather than instead of, the ICD codes. Postnatal. Cleft palate can be missed at the external newborn examination if the palate is not systematically and carefully examined. This requires visualization of the entire length of the palate.

When examining the palate, check for the presence of lower lip pits, which are a diagnostically useful sign of a specific autosomal dominant condition, and for signs of Pierre Robin sequence. Clinically, a cleft palate might manifest with nasal regurgitation of feeds or difficulty feeding. Cleft palate occurs with a birth prevalence of approximately 6 per 10 000 births, but with a very wide variation in different studies and populations. Outside of methodologic factors, the main factor in variability appears to be ethnicity, with higher prevalence in people of Northern European, Native American/First People, and Asian ancestry. Note any "lip pits" in the lower lip. This finding in the context of cleft lip is indicative of an autosomal dominant condition called van der Woude syndrome Fig.

Tessier type clefts are substantially rarer than cleft palate with cleft lip. Amniotic band spectrum can cause facial disruptions that involve both the lip and palate, and often include atypical skull and brain lesions. Photographs can also help reviewers detect "lip pits" in the lower lip. This finding in the context of cleft lip is indicative of an autosomal dominant condition called van der Woude syndrome.

### Transillumination of the occult submucous cleft palate [^111eewRe]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Occult submucous cleft palate is a congenital deformity characterized by deficient union of the muscles that normally cross the velum and aid in elevation of the soft palate. Despite this insufficient muscle coverage, occult submucous cleft palate by definition lacks clear external anatomic landmarks. This absence of anatomic signs makes diagnosis of occult submucous cleft less obvious, more dependent on ancillary tests, and potentially missed entirely. Current diagnostic methodologies are limited and often are unrevealing in the presurgical patient; however, a missed diagnosis of occult submucous cleft palate can result in velopharyngeal insufficiency and major functional impairment in patients after surgery on the oropharynx. By accurately and easily diagnosing occult submucous cleft palate, it is possible to defer or modify pharyngeal surgical intervention that may further impair velopharyngeal function in susceptible patients. In this report, we introduce transillumination of the soft palate using a transnasal or transoral flexible endoscope as an inexpensive and simple technique for identification of submucous cleft palate. The use of transillumination of an occult submucous cleft palate is illustrated in a patient case and is compared to other current diagnostic methodologies.

How do Shigella bacteria spread. Shigella spread easily; it takes just a small number of bacteria to make someone ill. People with a Shigella infection can spread the infection to others for several weeks after their diarrhea ends. You can get infected by swallowing Shigella. Some ways Shigella can get into your mouth are: What are the symptoms of Shigella infection and how long do they last. Most people with Shigella infection experience:

- Diarrhea that can be bloody or prolonged
- Fever
- Stomach pain
- Feeling the need to pass stool even when the bowels are empty Symptoms usually start 1–2 days after infection and last 7 days.

In some cases, bowel habits do not return to normal for several months. How can Shigella infection be diagnosed. Many kinds of germs can cause diarrhea. Knowing which germ is causing an illness is important to help guide appropriate treatment. Healthcare providers can order laboratory tests to identify Shigella germs in the stool of an infected person. How can Shigella infection be treated. People who have shigellosis usually get better without antibiotic treatment in 5 to 7 days. People with mild shigellosis may need only fluids and rest. Bismuth subsalicylate may be helpful. 1, 2, but people sick with shigellosis should not use medications that cause the gut to slow down and interfere with the way the body digests food, such as loperamide or diphenoxylate with atropine 3.

Figure 3
Structure of the Satb2 tetramerisation domain and upper incisors in the patient with intragenic SATB2 duplication. (A) The four subunits of the tetramer are shown in different colours and those parts, which are duplicated in the mutant, are shown in space-filled presentation. This duplication will affect the interfaces between the dimers that form the tetramer (black arrows). Thus, the intragenic duplication is expected to hamper formation of the tetramer, which was suggested to play an important role for long-range chromatin organisation and coordination in gene regulation.(B) Double row of upper incisors in the patient with 32 kb pathogenic duplication within SATB2 at age 3 3/12 years.

This patient was a 4-year-old boy born at term with normal measurements (51 cm; 3330 g) to healthy unrelated parents. After birth hypotonia, feeding difficulties and a cleft soft palate were noted and at age 1 year a double row of upper incisors became evident (figure 3 B). At age 3 3/12 years, he was remarkably hypotonic and had borderline microcephaly (OFC 49 cm, 3rd centile) with normal height and weight. The face was long, flat and hypotonic with hypersalivation, an impression of mild hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, mild ptosis, flat nasal bridge, anteverted nares, long flat philtrum and mild micrognathia. He had large ears, low posterior hair line, mild pectus excavatum, mildly wide spaced mammillae, bilateral 5th finger camptodactyly, mild cutaneous syndactyly of toes 2 and 3, and a 1×1.5 cm depigmented spot on the leg. The facial features of this patient resembled patient 1 with a SATB2 deletion published by Rosenfeld et al. Psychomotor development was mildly delayed with walking age 18 months and fine motor problems, but expressive speech development was remarkably delayed with few single words, hyperactivity and stereotypic movements at the age of 4 years.

### Finesse in caucasian endonasal rhinoplasty: the S.O.F.T. concept [^1148g8AN]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The nasal anatomy of Caucasian people includes thin skin, limited soft tissue volume, a high dorsum, strong cartilaginous framework, and narrow elliptical nasal inlets. A smooth dorsal contour, a well-defined tip, a naturally soft-feeling tip, and a functionally patent nasal valve constitute key objectives for Caucasian rhinoplasty. The author's focus on minimal-impact surgery has resulted in multiple novel techniques, embedded in a coherent algorithmic concept termed the S.O.F.T. (surgery and ongoing care free of trauma) concept. The foundation is the endonasal operation for the entire spectrum of primary and secondary deformities and maximal preservation of anatomic structures.

### Imaging of the eustachian tube and its function: a systematic review [^114LAjjR]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Three studies utilised spot and cine x-ray with a contrast agent injected into the middle ear via a perforation or grommet. It was demonstrated that the ET lumen could be visualised in healthy individuals, and that in patients with ETD, lumen narrowing could be seen either at localised points, or throughout the length of the tube. Bluestone used the technique in patients with cleft palate and otitis media. He found that contrast failed to clear from the middle ear, or in some cases, even enter the opening of the ET within the middle ear, but that this improved significant only 2 weeks after grommet insertion. The same authors also used cine x-ray to examine the reflux of contrast introduced to the nasopharynx, and found that it entered the ET and was actively ejected in healthy individuals, but obstruction at the nasopharyngeal end prevented entry from the nasopharynx in patients with cleft palate or otitis media.

Another imaging technique that has been successfully used to directly assess ET function is scintigraphy, with four studies published. Isotope-labelled human albumin introduced via a perforation in the tympanic membrane to the middle ear has been used to demonstrate reduced tube patency and clearance of middle ear secretions in ETD, with slower and incomplete passage of tracer along the tube. Labelled Xenon gas has been used to study middle ear ventilation by introducing it at both the nasopharyngeal and tympanic ends of the ET. It was demonstrated that less gas reached the middle ear during Valsalva in ETD patients, and that gas exchange back down the tube was also reduced.

The final imaging technique that has shown promise in ETD case-control trials is an indirect measure of ET function. Shim et al. used CT to examine the ET of patients undergoing middle ear surgery. They calculated the maximum cross sectional area of the aerated lumen in patients with chronic otitis media and not only found that it was significantly smaller than in healthy controls, but also that pre-operative size correlated with post operative success in the form of an aerated middle ear. They hypothesised that CT could therefore be used as a method of stratifying patients for surgical outcomes.

### Bimaxillary oral focal mucinosis [^1153YgsE]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Oral focal mucinosis is considered as oral counterpart of cutaneous focal mucinosis. The preoperative diagnosis of mucinosis is almost impossible because of its rarity and clinical similarity to other lesions of various etiologies. The histological diagnosis of oral mucinosis is important to better understand the etiopathogenesis, treatment modalities, and any recurrence of the lesion besides differentiating from the other soft tissue lesions. The purpose of this paper is to report the first case of bimaxillary involvement with dome-shaped elevated, rounded, asymptomatic, normally colored swelling in left posterior palatal mucosa and left mandibular posterior region in a 25-year old woman who was diagnosed as oral focal mucinosis histopathologically.

### The reproducibility of the jaw index in the measurement of healthy newborns [^112pTaiF]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

From February until April 2017, 52 healthy newborns were enrolled for inclusion at the obstetric and delivery ward at our hospital.

All newborns were included by one of the authors in collaboration with the obstetrician or nurse, and newborns were defined as healthy if they could be discharged within 1 week after birth.

Newborns were included if they were born full term (≥ 37 weeks gestational age), without any respiration or feeding problems and without congenital malformations or facial deformities due to birth trauma (eg, breech position). Both parents had to sign an informed consent. Patients were excluded if they were uncooperative or parents were unable to read and understand the written information.

For this study, the dimensions of the jaw index were done following the protocol of. The jaw index is defined as "Alveolar overjet × (Maxillary arch/Mandibular arch)", measured in millimeters. For the measurements, 3 facial features were important. First the tragion, described as the point situated in the notch just above the tragus of the ear and which is visual as being a small projection in front of the external opening of the ear. Furthermore, the pogonion, described as the most projecting median point on the anterior surface of the chin. Finally, the subnasal point, described as the point where the nasal septum and the upper lip meet in the midsagittal plane. Every measurement was done with the neonate in a lying position. To measure the maxillary arch and the mandibular arch, no distinction was made between an awake, asleep, or a crying neonate. But for the alveolar overjet measurements, if the neonate was crying, we decided to come back at a later moment that day.

### Screening for oral cancer: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^113wcxpV]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Screening for oral cancer — screening tests, scope, and adjuncts: The primary screening test for oral cancer is a systematic clinical examination of the oral cavity, and an oral cancer screening examination should include a visual inspection of the face, neck, lips, labial mucosa, buccal mucosa, gingiva, floor of the mouth, tongue, and palate; the examination also includes palpating the regional lymph nodes, tongue, and floor of the mouth, and any abnormality that lasts for more than 2 weeks should be reevaluated and considered for biopsy; because oropharyngeal cancer is difficult to visualize and is usually located at the base of the tongue (the posterior third of the tongue), the tonsils, and the side and back walls of the throat, a comprehensive examination of the oropharynx may require referral to a dental provider or specialist, which is outside the scope of this recommendation. Additional tests proposed as adjuncts to the oral cancer screening examination include toluidine blue dye staining, chemiluminescent and autofluorescent lighting devices, and brush cytopathology, but these screening and adjunct tests have not been adequately tested in primary care non-dental settings, and currently, no screening test for oral HPV infection has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This recommendation is intended for primary care providers and does not pertain to dental providers or otolaryngologists.

### Associated factors and persistence of palatal groove in preterm infants: a cohort study [^114efMa3]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

One of the limitations of this study is that we did not have access to the oral conditions immediately after extubation and/or discharge, which could help in identifying the occurrence of an eventual palatal groove that may have disappeared by the first dental consultation. However, as the median age at the beginning of monitoring was three months, and most of the infants stayed in the NICU for a median time of approximately one month, it is believed that this factor did not negatively affect the results.

Another point to be discussed is the palatal groove diagnosis, which in this study was strictly visual, while other studies used models and other measuring devices. However, the examiners in this study were systematically trained to identify the palatal groove. Moreover, due to the difficulties in thoroughly assessing the oral mouth of infants, as it can make them extremely irritated, we did not repeat oral exams to estimate inter- and intra-rater agreement. Instead, we opted for a consensus diagnosis between pairs of examiners, and therefore we believe this limitation does not invalidate our data.

Thus, the results of this study suggest that the occurrence of the palatal groove in infants is transient and associated with local traumatic factors, which most likely lead to growth of the oral soft tissues and "printing" of the tube on the palate. In any event, additional studies in infants are needed to investigate whether other changes in palate morphology involve environmental or genetic factors.

### Evaluation of postoperative outcomes following early and late palate repair: a preclinical study [^112f22Ht]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Evaluation of a Full-Thickness Mucoperiosteal Flap Model in Newborn Versus Neonatal Pups

The majority of human CMF growth occurs within the first year of life; in mice, the majority of CMF growth occurs within the first 2 months of life. To test whether performing a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap surgery disrupted CMF growth, 2 experimental groups were created: (1) in one group, surgical intervention was performed at post-natal day 17 (P17; gold bar, Fig. 1 A) and (2) in the second group, surgical intervention was performed at P30 (orange bar, Fig. 1 A). A unoperated group of mice served as a growth control (grey bar, Fig. 1 A). The surgical intervention involved the premaxillary and maxillary sutures (Fig. 1 B) and consisted of raising a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap that was elevated then promptly repositioned (Fig. 1 C-F). Three weeks later, animals from the 3 groups were sacrificed and analyzed by μCT imaging.

Elevation of a Mucoperiosteal Flap in the Early Surgical Intervention Group Causes Maxillary Hypoplasia

Morphometric analyses made use of established landmarks to assess the effects of surgical intervention on CMF growth (Fig. 2 A). Measurements were performed on sagittal [anteroposterior (AP)] dimensions and compared with unoperated controls (grey bars, Fig. 2 B), mice that underwent late surgical intervention (orange bars) showed no significant effects on growth of the premaxilla (P = 0.8523; Fig. 2 B). In contrast, mice that underwent early surgical intervention (gold bars) showed a significant arrest in premaxillary growth (P = 0.0223; Fig. 2 B). Palatal length was not significantly affected in the late surgical intervention group (P = 0.1684) but was significantly impacted in mice who underwent early surgical intervention (P = 0.0403; Fig. 2 B). Other measurements, including maxillary length, were not significantly impacted by surgical intervention in either group (late surgical intervention group P = 0.8527; early surgical intervention group P = 0.6868; Fig. 2 B; also see Supplemental Digital Content, Fig. 1). Representative 3D μCT images from a mouse in the early surgical intervention group were superimposed on the skull of a control mouse, which illustrated the extent of AP growth arrest (Fig. 2 C).

### Does 3D phenotyping yield substantial insights in the genetics of the mouse mandible shape? [^112rzDtz]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

3D phenotyping: manual landmarks and simulated 2D phenotyping

Thirteen 3D landmarks from the right mandible (Figure 1) were acquired twice from 3D renderings of original image stacks of the complete skull using 3D Slicer. The sets were averaged as the best estimate of the landmark location. These landmarks correspond to the classical set of ∼15 landmarks used in previous studies of mouse mandible genetics. We initially acquired more landmarks but we found some gross or systematic errors on several of them, which were consequently removed. On the remaining set of 13, no systematic error between landmarking sessions was found, and the percentage of measurement error was 4.38% and ranged from 2.6–7.55% per landmark.

Figure 1
Mandibular 3D surface, landmark, and semilandmark templates. Light blue and gray dots are manual 3D landmarks. Small green dots represent the semilandmark template. The two gray landmarks and the small purple dot were used as the initial reference plane for 2D flattening prior to optimization.

For a fair comparison with existing results based on 2D imaging, and to better evaluate the gain from the third dimension independently of the gain of denser genotyping, we artificially flattened the mandibular 3D landmarks. To do that, we first aligned each mandible to its main axes, then chose three landmarks to start (dark gray and purple landmarks in Figure 1): the lower point of the angular process, the lower end of symphysis, and an additional landmark (purple landmark) at the top of the inner ridge meeting the molar alveolus. Positions of the first two were refined iteratively based on the innermost vertex of the mesh along the normal to the plane they defined with the third landmark. These three landmarks defined an approximate natural plane on which the mandible would lay. All 13 landmarks were then orthogonally projected according to the normal to this plane.

### Parents of children with nonsyndromic orofacial clefting show altered palate shape [^114i8yLf]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The unaffected relatives of individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts have been shown to exhibit subtle craniofacial differences compared with the general population. Here, we investigate whether these morphological differences extend to the shape of the palate.

Design

We conducted a geometric morphometric analysis to compare palate shape in the clinically unaffected parents of children with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate and adult controls of European, Asian, and African ancestry. We conducted pairwise group comparisons using canonical variates analysis, and then confirmed and characterized findings of shape differences using Euclidean distance matrix analysis.

Results

Significant differences in palate shape were detected in unaffected mothers (but not fathers) compared to demographically matched controls. The differences in shape were ancestry-specific; mothers of Asian-derived and African-derived ancestry showed wider and shorter palates with higher posterior palatal vaults, while mothers of European-derived ancestry showed narrower palates with higher anterior palatal vaults.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that altered palate shape is a subclinical phenotypic feature, which may be indicative of elevated orofacial cleft risk. The risk phenotype varied by sex and ancestry, suggesting possible etiologic heterogeneity among demographic groups. Understanding the genetic basis of these informative palate shape traits may reveal new genes and pathways relevant to nonsyndromic orofacial clefting.

### Evaluation of postoperative outcomes following early and late palate repair: a preclinical study [^1152yu2Y]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Measurements were performed in vertical dimensions using anatomical landmarks that were chosen based on published literature (Fig. 2 G). When compared with unoperated controls (grey bars), mice that underwent early surgical intervention (light green bars) showed a significant vertical growth arrest at the anterior pharyngeal height (P = 0.0036) and maxillary height (P = 0.0008; Fig. 2 H). Mice that underwent late surgical intervention (dark green bars) did not exhibit significant differences in vertical growth compared with controls (Fig. 2 H). Taken together, these morphometric analyses supported the conclusion that mucoperiosteal flap elevation in P17 but not P30 pups impacted specific regions of facial growth. Identifying the basis for this localized growth inhibition was the focus of our next analyses.

Surgically Related Mediolateral Growth Inhibition Can be Traced Back to Premature Fusion of the Mid-Palatal Suture

Midfacial growth in the transversal (ML) plane is influenced by growth at the mid-palatal suture; consequently, our next analyses focused on identifying whether the mid-palatal suture was impacted by early surgical intervention. Between P10 and ~P35, the mid-palatal suture expands in the transversal plane through endochondral ossification of midline cartilaginous growth plates. The sulfated glycosaminoglycan-rich cartilage growth plates were visualized by Safranin O/Fast green staining; in controls, the red-stained cartilage is normally separated by a turquoise-colored fibrous interzone (Fig. 3 A, B). In mice that underwent late surgical intervention, the position and appearance of the cartilage growth plates and fibrous interzone were unchanged (compare control Fig. 3 A, B with C). In mice that underwent early surgical intervention, the cartilage growth plates were nonexistent (Fig. 3 D). Quantification of glycosaminoglycan-rich tissues revealed a complete absence of cartilage in mice that underwent early surgical intervention (Fig. 3 E). In mice that underwent the late surgical intervention, cartilage tissue was also significantly reduced compared with controls (P < 0.05, red bar, Fig. 3 E).

### Congenital fibrous hamartoma of the tip of the tongue: a novel peculiar entity [^1142TZyc]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Congenital fibrous hamartoma of the tip of the tongue, a peculiar and novel entity, consists of one or two asymptomatic pearly or yellowish nodules, not exceeding 0.5 cm in maximum diameter, at the tip of the tongue, ventrally or dorsally. Unlike other localizations, congenital fibrous hamartoma of the tip of the tongue is not associated with cleft lip or palate, or with feeding problems. Surgical excision should be avoided, reserved only for dubious cases, since the lesions are benign and stable over time.

### What's new in cleft palate and velopharyngeal dysfunction management? [^114NHg1V]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Have a clear understanding of the evolution of concepts of velopharyngeal dysfunction, especially as it relates to patients with a cleft palate. 2. Explain the subjective and objective evaluation of speech in children with velopharyngeal dysfunction. 3. On the basis of these diagnostic findings, be able to classify types of velopharyngeal dysfunction. 4. Develop a safe, evidence-based, patient-customized treatment plan for velopharyngeal dysfunction founded on objective considerations.

Summary

Velopharyngeal dysfunction is improper function of the dynamic structures that work to control the velopharyngeal sphincter. Approximately 30 percent of patients having undergone cleft palate repair require secondary surgery for velopharyngeal dysfunction. A multidisciplinary team using multimodal instruments to evaluate velopharyngeal function and speech should manage these patients. Instruments may include perceptual speech analysis, video nasopharyngeal endoscopy, multiview speech videofluoroscopy, nasometry, pressure-flow, and magnetic resonance imaging. Velopharyngeal dysfunction may be amenable to surgical or nonsurgical treatment methods or a combination of each. Nonsurgical management may include speech therapy or prosthetic devices. Surgical interventions could include palatal re-repair with repositioning of levator veli palatini muscles, posterior pharyngeal flap, sphincter pharyngoplasty, or soft palate or posterior wall augmentation. Treatment interventions should be based on objective assessment and rating of the movement of lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls and the palate to optimize speech outcomes. Treatment should be tailored to specific anatomical and physiologic findings and the overall needs of the patient.
