## Question

Are there any specific scenarios where barbiturates may be used for pupil dilation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there are any specific scenarios where barbiturates are used to dilate the pupil. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of barbiturates and their expected effects on pupil size. Then, I should verify whether any authoritative sources list mydriasis as a therapeutic or diagnostic indication for barbiturates. Next, I will check for any indirect or paradoxical scenarios where barbiturates might be associated with dilation. Finally, I will contrast this with standard mydriatic agents and synthesize a conclusion with clinical implications.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology. Barbiturates are central nervous system depressants that enhance inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission. Clinically they cause sedation, respiratory depression, and in overdose can produce coma, with pupillary effects that are typically constriction rather than dilation, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret rare observations as indications [^116ccU9q] [^112FZnr3].

> Wait, let me verify the expected pupillary effects in overdose. The FDA labeling for pentobarbital and phenobarbital states that acute intoxication manifests with CNS and respiratory depression and constriction of the pupils to a slight degree, with paralytic dilation only in severe poisoning, which is a toxicologic endpoint rather than a therapeutic goal, so this does not constitute a clinical indication to use barbiturates for dilation [^116ccU9q] [^112FZnr3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check for any labeled or guideline-supported indications for barbiturate-induced mydriasis. I need to check authoritative sources and standard references for ophthalmic mydriasis: approved agents include alpha-1 agonists like phenylephrine and anticholinergics like tropicamide, with fixed-dose combinations such as tropicamide/phenylephrine for diagnostic mydriasis, and I find no role for barbiturates in these protocols, which strongly argues against any legitimate indication for barbiturates to dilate pupils [^111Q9bkz] [^113QsnSH] [^113Ggnzh].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could combination products blur this picture? Some older combination drugs pair phenobarbital with belladonna alkaloids. I should double-check whether the mydriasis in those products is due to the barbiturate or the anticholinergic components. The adverse effect profiles consistently list mydriasis and cycloplegia as effects of the anticholinergic alkaloids, not the barbiturate, so the dilation is attributable to atropine/scopolamine rather than phenobarbital, and using such combinations to achieve mydriasis would be an indirect and imprecise approach compared with standard mydriatics [^113fcu9u] [^115tPVQw] [^113CqZ2m].

> I will now examine indirect or paradoxical associations. In status epilepticus, aggressive barbiturate therapy can produce very high serum levels with systemic toxicity that may include pupillary changes, but again this is an adverse effect profile rather than a therapeutic indication for dilation; similarly, case descriptions of very-high-dose phenobarbital for refractory status report pupillary dilation as part of a toxicodynamic response, not as a desired mydriatic effect, so I should not conflate these with clinical indications [^113CqZ2m].

> But wait, what if the question is about diagnostic pupillary testing in neurology or ophthalmology where sedation is sometimes needed? Let me consider whether barbiturates are ever used to facilitate pupillary examination. Standard practice for diagnostic mydriasis relies on topical mydriatics such as phenylephrine, tropicamide, cyclopentolate, or combinations, and when sedation is required for cooperation, clinicians use non-barbiturate sedatives while still applying ophthalmic mydriatics; barbiturates are not used as mydriatic agents in these workflows, reinforcing that there is no valid scenario for barbiturate-induced dilation [^111Q9bkz] [^113QsnSH] [^113Ggnzh] [^111r4kZV].

> I should confirm the bottom line. There are no specific scenarios where barbiturates are used to dilate the pupil; their expected pupillary effect is constriction, and any observed dilation occurs in toxicologic contexts or as a result of co-administered anticholinergics, not as a therapeutic mydriatic strategy, so using barbiturates to achieve mydriasis would be inappropriate and potentially dangerous given their hemodynamic and respiratory depressant effects [^116ccU9q] [^113CqZ2m] [^115tPVQw].

Barbiturates are **not used to induce pupil dilation**; they typically cause miosis or have minimal pupillary effect, and any dilation observed is usually due to co-administered anticholinergics or other agents [^116ccU9q] [^113CqZ2m] [^115tPVQw]. Clinically, barbiturates are used for sedation, anesthesia, seizure control, and refractory intracranial hypertension — not for mydriasis [^115BSrHs] [^111WTehe]. For diagnostic mydriasis, use **standard mydriatics** such as tropicamide, phenylephrine, or cyclopentolate [^113Ggnzh] [^111Q9bkz] [^1166L9i4].

## Pharmacological effects of barbiturates on pupil size

Barbiturates primarily depress the central nervous system, including the areas controlling **pupil size**. Their typical pupillary effect is **miosis** (pupil constriction) or minimal change, not dilation [^116ccU9q] [^113CqZ2m]. This is due to their enhancement of GABAergic inhibition, which reduces sympathetic outflow and generally leads to constriction or minimal pupillary change.

---

## Clinical scenarios involving barbiturates and pupil dilation

While barbiturates themselves do not cause mydriasis, certain clinical scenarios may involve both barbiturate use and pupil dilation, albeit indirectly:

- **Co-administration with anticholinergic agents**: Barbiturates are sometimes combined with anticholinergic medications (e.g. atropine, scopolamine) for specific therapeutic purposes. These anticholinergic agents are known to cause mydriasis by blocking parasympathetic input to the iris sphincter muscle, resulting in pupil dilation [^113fcu9u] [^114EAGRN] [^114Hiotq].

- **Overdose or toxicity**: In cases of barbiturate overdose, pupils may initially constrict but later dilate due to severe central nervous system depression, hypoxia, or brainstem involvement. This dilation is not a therapeutic effect but rather a sign of severe toxicity or impending brainstem herniation [^116ccU9q] [^113CqZ2m].

- **Withdrawal syndromes**: Withdrawal from barbiturates or other sedative-hypnotics can cause autonomic instability, including sympathetic overactivity, which may result in pupil dilation. This is a withdrawal phenomenon rather than a direct pharmacological effect of barbiturates [^113qzq9t].

---

## Clinical indications for pupil dilation

Pupil dilation (mydriasis) is clinically indicated for several diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, including:

- **Ophthalmic examinations**: Mydriasis is routinely induced to facilitate comprehensive retinal examinations, fundoscopy, and refractive assessments [^113Ggnzh] [^1136byqb].

- **Ophthalmic surgery**: Mydriasis is essential during cataract surgery, retinal surgery, and other intraocular procedures to provide optimal visualization and access to intraocular structures [^1129oj8S].

- **Diagnostic testing**: Mydriasis is used in diagnostic tests such as the pupillary response assessment, visual field testing, and imaging studies.

---

## Medications commonly used for pupil dilation

Several classes of medications are **specifically indicated** for inducing pupil dilation, including:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** |
|-|-|-|
| Anticholinergic agents | - Tropicamide <br/> - Atropine <br/> - Cyclopentolate | Block parasympathetic input to the iris sphincter muscle, causing dilation [^115vWA7w] |
| Sympathomimetic agents | - Phenylephrine <br/> - Epinephrine | Stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors in the iris dilator muscle, causing dilation [^111Q9bkz] [^115vWA7w] |
| Combination agents | - Tropicamide + phenylephrine | Combine anticholinergic and sympathomimetic effects for enhanced dilation [^113QsnSH] |

---

## Risks and complications of pupil dilation

While pupil dilation is generally safe, potential risks and complications include:

- **Acute angle-closure glaucoma**: Pupil dilation can precipitate acute angle-closure glaucoma in patients with narrow anterior chamber angles [^116arTPU].

- **Photophobia and blurred vision**: Temporary light sensitivity and blurred vision are common after dilation [^notfound].

- **Systemic absorption and toxicity**: Excessive systemic absorption of mydriatic agents, particularly in pediatric or elderly patients, can cause systemic anticholinergic toxicity [^1166L9i4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus statements **do not recommend** barbiturates for pupil dilation. Barbiturates are indicated for sedation, anesthesia, seizure control, and refractory intracranial hypertension, not for mydriasis [^115BSrHs] [^111WTehe]. For pupil dilation, standard mydriatic agents such as tropicamide, phenylephrine, and cyclopentolate are recommended [^113Ggnzh] [^111Q9bkz].

---

## Conclusion

Barbiturates are **not used to induce pupil dilation**. They typically cause miosis or minimal pupillary change, and any observed dilation is usually due to co-administered anticholinergic agents, overdose, or withdrawal phenomena. Clinically indicated mydriasis is achieved with standard mydriatic agents such as tropicamide, phenylephrine, and cyclopentolate [^113Ggnzh] [^111Q9bkz] [^1166L9i4].

### Confidence controls perceptual evidence accumulation [^116nPKsX]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

To clarify this relationship, we asked observers to make the same Type-I judgement but in three distinct Type-II contexts. In all three contexts, the Type-I judgement required observers to make a two-alternative categorisation decision after viewing a series of visual stimuli (a variation of the weather prediction task). Based on the work of Drugowitsch et al.each orientation offered a specific amount of evidence in favour of each category, such that the quality and quantity of Type-I evidence can be carefully monitored over the course of each trial. This allowed for the disambiguation of different suboptimalities affecting observers' Type-I decision-making using computational modelling. Given the suggestion that Type-II evidence accumulation may continue after the Type-I decision bound has been reached, we were especially motivated to understand the relationship between Type-I and Type-II decision-making relative to the point at which the Type-I evidence crosses the decision bound. In the first Type-II context we therefore measured observers' ability to set and maintain appropriate bounds on their Type-I evidence accumulation by asking them to make their Type-I judgement when they thought they had reached an instructed target performance level. We used the second Type-II context to measure observers' default bound — i.e. how much evidence each observer feels they need to accumulate to commit to a perceptual decision. Last, in the third Type-II context, we tested whether observers implement a covert bound when they are presented with more evidence than needed to reach their default bound, as measured in the second context. In this third Type-II context, observers also rated their confidence that their Type-I decision was correct on each trial — i.e. an explicit Type-II decision. In addition to behavioural responses, pupil dilation was monitored throughout the experiment, as the literature has suggested strong links between pupil dilation and Type-I, and Type-II, decision-making via pupil-linked dynamics of the noradrenergic system. Both behaviour and pupillometry reflect a partial dissociation between Type-I and Type-II evidence, which could allow for a confidence-regulated accumulation-to-bound process that controls perceptual decision-making even in the absence of an explicit speed-accuracy trade-off.

Barbiturates and propofol for intracranial pressure (ICP) management — recommendations: Administration of barbiturates to induce burst suppression measured by EEG as prophylaxis against the development of intracranial hypertension is not recommended. High-dose barbiturate administration is recommended to control elevated ICP refractory to maximum standard medical and surgical treatment. Hemodynamic stability is essential before and during barbiturate therapy. Although propofol is recommended for the control of ICP, it is not recommended for improvement in mortality or 6-month outcomes. Caution is required as high-dose propofol can produce significant morbidity.

Eye drops can help to diagnose and prevent complications of neurological disorders. Guttae ophthalmicae (eye drops) are generally safe because the drugs rarely achieve significant systemic concentrations, although there are rare exceptions. This article covers contemporary pharmacological pupil testing; how to dilate a pupil safely; common reasons why pupils do not respond to drops; and corneal lubrication to prevent complications of weak eye closure.

### Spectral edge frequency and dilation pupillary velocity in critically ill patients: a pilot study [^117RpJkn]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Linear correlation between dilation velocity (DV) and spectral edge frequency (SEF) at baseline (left panel), after sedation regimen modification (central panel) and between absolute changes in DV and SEF after sedation changes (right panel)

In this pilot study, pupillary DV did not correlate with baseline values or changes over time in SEF measured on pEEG in non brain-injured critically ill patients. In another study including 163 paired AP and pEEG measurements from 38 critically ill, sedated, and mechanically ventilated patients, the pupillary constriction rate following light stimulation increased as sedation depth decreased. Significant correlations were noted between changes in pupillary constriction rate and SEF. Although changes in AP parameters and pEEG were analysed using a generalized estimating equation model to adjust for within-subject repeated measurements, no specific AP or pEEG assessments were conducted before and after sedation adjustments. In another study, significant differences in constriction velocity and rate were observed patients with low (e.g. < 40) and high (e.g. between 40 and 60) bispectral index (BIS) during sedation in mechanically ventilated patients; however, no assessment after changes in sedation regimens was provided. As such, the role of AP to monitor the depth of sedation in critically ill patients remains controversial. Importantly, DV values were not recalculated or independently verified using raw data from an Excel spreadsheet; as the rate of pupil dilation after a light flash is not linear and may vary depending on the specific time intervals analysed, this could account as an important limitation. Also, baseline pupil size and constriction reflex amplitude were not collected; these pupillary characteristics are very sensitive to sedation adjustments in the operative room. However, it is conceivable that critically ill ICU patients, who often present with additional factors influencing EEG (e.g. metabolic disturbances, acidemia, shock, sepsis, etc.), might modify the relationship between pupillometric changes and EEG dynamics. Finally, additional earlier and repeated measurements would have been necessary to thoroughly evaluate the temporal relationship between AP and EEG findings in this patients population.

### Anticipatory eye gaze as a marker of memory [^115LB6kn]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

To further distinguish MEGA from context recognition, we focused on pupil dilation as an index of familiarity upon repeated stimulus presentation –. Specifically, previous findings suggest that pupil dilation is increased for recognized words compared to unrecognized words. In line with this literature, we also found that pupil size was larger for the second viewing compared to the first viewing (pupil size 1st v = 4436 ± 378, pupil size 2nd v = 4648 ± 378, t(29) = −5.5, p = 6.3e −06, Cohen's D = −1, CI [−1.44, −0.56]). Next, we compared changes in pupil size across repeated movie viewings in relation to the verbal report. To this end, we computed a normalized pupil size score using the same formula used for the MEGA score (pre-event time window, negative values reflect a larger increase in pupil size). We found a larger increase in pupil size for movies that were recognized compared to movies that were not recognized (higher pupil size score for 'not recognized' in Fig. 4g). ANOVA with pupil dilation score as the dependent variable and the explicit memory questions as a factor revealed a significant main effect (F(2,87) = 5.05, p = 0.008, η² = 0.1, 95% CI [0.02, 1.00]). Post-hoc pairwise comparison revealed a significantly higher pupil score for movies where the event was recollected in full (M event = −0.059 ± 0.048, M no-recognition = −0.021 ± 0.054, p Tukey = 0.013) and for movies where the context was recognized (M context = −0.054 ± 0.049, M no-recognition = −0.021 ± 0.054, p Tukey = 0.033) compared to unrecognized movies. Crucially, pupil dilation score did not differ between the movies with event recollection and context recognition, suggesting no specific relationship with event memory (event vs context: p Tukey = 0.93, BF₁₀ = 0.30 ± 0.03%, default prior = 0.707). This was stable over the whole pre-event time interval (Supplementary Fig. S5). These findings suggest that while the pupil is indicative of recognition of the context alone, the anticipatory gaze is guided by a richer memory that includes the recollection of event details, such as its location within the context.

### The diagnostic value of the neurological examination in coma of unknown etiology [^113xDGKF]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

And not least, iatrogenic sedation (e.g. in recently intubated patients) may have masked neurological signs that should be present following a causal brain lesion. In our cohort, patients who eventually turned out to have acute structural brain damage were slightly more likely to be sedated at the time of examination (57% vs. 51% in patients without acute structural brain damage) and thus even more difficult to discriminate by clinical findings. However, in a time-critical emergency, clinicians need to focus and rely on robust decision-supporting tools that can be applied regardless of unswayable factors such as pre-hospital application of sedatives.

Calculating sensitivity and specificity for single items of a neurological examination is a somewhat artificial approach to determine their diagnostic value since these items usually only test for a specific dysfunction and not for any kind of brain damage. However, the approach is not too far from clinical reality, where examiners are faced with a variety of testing methods on the one hand and an even wider variety of conditions to be detected on the other hand. There is no single test that is sufficient and there are tests that are statistically insignificant on their own. However, there appears to be a selection of tests better suited to the problem than others as is reflected by their relatively higher sensitivity and, in fewer cases, statistical significance in regression models. This seems to be true for pupil size even regardless of sedation. Predefined answers recorded in the examination protocol applied in this study (Fig. 1) did not map the complete range of subtle, yet possibly meaningful findings in unconscious patients, resulting in a reduction of complexity. This was intended to adapt the protocol to the limited possibilities in a real-life emergency. Even for dedicated specialists, it is extremely difficult to perform and record an exhaustive clinical evaluation of an unconscious patient — whose status may or may not be influenced by iatrogenic sedation — in limited time and in a crowded emergency room.

### Pupillary reflex measurement predicts insufficient analgesia before endotracheal suctioning in critically ill patients [^116AFUVB]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

PDR has been studied for nearly two decades as a potential marker of response to noxious stimulation in volunteers and surgical patients. By incorporating a tetanic stimulator with the pupillometer, we were able to accurately record a 10 second time course of pupil diameter changes in response to a standardized painful stimulus. PDR has been mostly studied on anesthetized patients and had been shown to be a useful tool to predict the level of analgesia. PDR had also been used to check the level of an epidural analgesia during general anesthesia. As the mechanisms for PDR involve a sympathetic component, PDR might be different in anesthetized and unanesthetized conditions. A very recent publication concluded that, regardless of the mechanisms, PDR in conscious patients following emergence from anesthesia was a reliable predictor of the level of analgesia. As the mechanisms for PDR involve a sympathetic component, PDR might be different in anesthetized and unanesthetized conditions. In ventilated patients, PDR is lower in heavily sedated patients (BIS < 40) compared with lighter sedation (40 < BIS < 60). The sedative regimen may therefore alter the PDR. In an exploratory subgroup analysis, the PDR during a 20 mA stimulation was not different in patients receiving propofol/sufentanyl compared with patients receiving midazolam/fentanyl (data not shown). Patients in ICU are sedated, which means that they are neither deeply anesthetized as for a surgical purpose nor fully awake. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to show that PDR can predict the quality of analgesia before procedural pain in deeply sedated patients. As in prior studies, we confirmed that pupil size is highly reactive to nociception and is a more sensitive tool when compared with other physiologic responses.

### The eye examination in the evaluation of child abuse – 2023 [^112tbz6i]. AAO (2023). High credibility.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) — eye examination methods and timing prioritize indirect ophthalmoscopy by an ophthalmologist with strategies to preserve neurologic monitoring. The indirect ophthalmoscope provides a wide and stereoscopic field of view and enables the ophthalmologist to examine the anterior retinal edges (ora serrata), which is not possible using the direct ophthalmoscope even if the pupils are dilated, and eye examination for this purpose is best performed by an ophthalmologist. When indicated, a slit lamp inspection of the anterior segment to identify signs of trauma (eg, hyphema) can be helpful, and examination for an afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil) before pharmacologic pupillary dilation can be performed to identify optic nerve injury. For the presence of RHs, a full view of the retina and characterization of the number, type, location, and pattern of the hemorrhages require consultation by an ophthalmologist by using indirect ophthalmoscopy, preferably with a dilated pupil; when there is a concern about transiently stopping pupillary reactivity, techniques such as dilation of 1 eye at a time, use of short-acting mydriatics, and use of a lens that affords some view through an undilated pupil can be used to allow indirect ophthalmoscopy, preferably within the first 24 hours and ideally within 72 hours after the child's acute presentation because some RHs resolve quickly. Even if the need for an eye examination is realized after 72 hours, ophthalmologic consultation may still be useful to identify persistent abnormalities, such as hemorrhages, retinoschisis, choroidal scars, and papilledema.

### Pupil maximum constriction velocity predicts post-induction hypotension in patients with lower ASA status: a prospective observational study [^117T26EH]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

In this analysis, older patients were found to be at a higher risk of PIH, consistent with the results of a large retrospective study conducted by Riech et al. in which individuals > 50 years old were at a 2.25-fold higher risk of PIH relative to younger patients. Even so, age was not identified as an independent predictor of PIH status in this study following logistic regression analyses using Model 2. This may be attributable to the limited sample size in this study or the fact that patients over 64 years of age were excluded from this trial. In follow-up trials, additional patients will thus be incorporated to facilitate a more robust stratified analysis aimed at ensuring these results can be generalized.

Relative to prior studies, the present study is innovative in several respects. First, autonomic neuropathy is a common diabetic complication that is important in the context of PIH development. As such, patients with hypertension and diabetes were excluded from this study to avoid any potential impact of these comorbidities on the results of this analysis. Second, the selected induction protocol is routinely used in our country, with propofol and sufentanil being selected for use in order to maximize the generalizability of these results. Third, in contrast to other studies that have employed noninvasive approaches to monitoring blood pressure, all patients in this study underwent invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring, thus ensuring that continuous, accurate blood pressure data were collected in real-time. Fourth, while one prior study identified a link between dynamic pupillometry and PIH, their analyses did not take the potential impact of multiple endotracheal intubations on blood pressure into account, and failed to analyze the forecast effect, with the present study thus addressing these gaps in knowledge.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^113ujkp9]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Changes from the 3rd Edition — ICP monitoring indications note that in the 3rd Edition there were three sections about ICP monitoring (Indications, Technology, and Thresholds), and Indications for ICP Monitoring was organized around sub-questions on who to monitor, the utility of information from the monitor, and the influence of the information on outcomes for patients. For the first and second sub-questions, the studies in the 3rd Edition do not meet the inclusion criteria for this update and therefore have been dropped; for the third sub-question, four Class 3 studies have been maintained and two studies rated Class 2 in the 3rd Edition have been excluded. Study-specific notes indicate that Eisenberg, 1988 was an RCT of barbiturates and was not designed to test ICP-directed management, while Palmer 2001 was a pre/post natural experiment comparing cohorts before and after guideline implementation in which all patients had ICP monitors and there was no non-monitored comparison group, resulting in exclusion as not designed to assess the impact of using a monitor to guide treatment on outcomes.

### Phenobarbital sodium [^113CqZ2m]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The toxic dose of barbiturates varies considerably. Barbiturate intoxication may be confused with alcoholism, bromide intoxication and various neurological disorders.

For sedation, therapeutic blood levels of phenobarbital range from 5–40 μg/mL; the lethal blood level is greater than 80 μg/mL and usually ranges from 100–200 μg/mL.

Acute overdosage with barbiturates is manifested by CNS and respiratory depression which may progress to Cheyne-Stokes respiration, areflexia, constriction of the pupils to a slight degree (though in severe poisoning, they may show paralytic dilation), oliguria, tachycardia, hypotension, lowered body temperature and coma. Typical shock syndrome (apnea, circulatory collapse, respiratory arrest and death) may occur.

In extreme overdose, all electrical activity in the brain may cease, in which case a "flat" EEG normally equated with clinical death cannot be accepted. This effect is fully reversible unless hypoxic damage occurs. Consideration should be given to the possibility of barbiturate intoxication even in situations that appear to involve trauma.

Complications such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure and renal failure may occur. Uremia may increase CNS sensitivity to barbiturates if renal function is impaired. Differential diagnosis should include hypoglycemia, head trauma, cerebrovascular accidents, convulsive states and diabetic coma. To obtain up-to-date information about the treatment of overdosage, a good resource is your certified Regional Poison Control Center. Telephone numbers of certified poison control centers are listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR). In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug overdose, interaction among drugs and the unusual drug kinetics in your patient.

### Effects of intravenous d9-THC on pupillary reaction and pupil size: a prospective, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers not regularly consuming cannabis [^114eWtPa]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

The pupil size before application of the light stimuli was smaller after THC administration compared to the placebo group, hence indicating that against common belief THC much rather leads to miosis and not mydriasis, similar to other drugs such as opioids, neuroleptic drugs, cholinergic drugs like pilocarpine and acetyl-cholinesterase inhibitors like neostigmine and pyridostigmine that are known to cause miosis.

We suggest that for forensic assessments the combination of an assessment of the plasma level (which demonstrates the presence of the substance) plus pupillography (with a reduced relative amplitude that demonstrates the physical drug effect) is much better suited to judge the influence of THC on driving ability or workplace considerations than one or the other alone. We believe this is particularly true since THC is a lipophilic drug and the plasma level might not always correspond to the degree of physical effects. Pupillography could therefore be used as an easy screening test for THC plus it could serve to fortify plasma testing by proving the physical effects caused by THC.

Limitations

The very limited number of volunteers that could be included as a result of the design of the main pharmacokinetic study reduced the power to detect statistically significant effects. The study was not randomized and only single-blinded as a result of the design of the main pharmacokinetic study in which all volunteers expressing rare genetic variants of CYP2C9 received THC to allow for pharmacokinetic modelling of intravenous THC. This means that all study personnel was unblinded, but volunteers were blinded. Since effects of THC were very obvious (for both study personnel and volunteers), complete blinding would not have been possible in any way. Also, the study was not a cross-over study and hence it does not allow for within-subject comparisons. THC is usually administered orally or by inhalation, but very rarely intravenously. The intravenous route was chosen to enable pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic modelling and to study the effects of THC without the confounder of the extremely variable bioavailability with the oral and the inhalational route. The first pupillographic measurement after THC administration was done after 20 min, when concentrations in arterial and venous blood can be expected to have equilibrated. This was because a lot of blood sampling was done in the first 20 min to acquire proper pharmacokinetic data and because most volunteers in the THC group were too "high" within the first 20 min to cooperate with pupillographic measurements. It is theoretically possible that with the plasma peak of THC and THC-OH pupils dilate and that this dilation had already disappeared after 20 min.

### Phenobarbital (donnatal) [^116Ginok]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions may include xerostomia; urinary hesitancy and retention; blurred vision; tachycardia; palpitation; mydriasis; cycloplegia; increased ocular tension; loss of taste sense; headache; nervousness; drowsiness; weakness; dizziness; insomnia; nausea; vomiting; impotence; suppression of lactation; constipation; bloated feeling; musculoskeletal pain; severe allergic reaction or drug idiosyncrasies, including anaphylaxis, urticaria and other dermal manifestations; and decreased sweating. Elderly patients may react with symptoms of excitement, agitation, drowsiness, and other untoward manifestations to even small doses of the drug. Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect. In patients habituated to barbiturates, abrupt withdrawal may produce delirium or convulsions.

Adverse reactions may include xerostomia; urinary hesitancy and retention; blurred vision; tachycardia; palpitation; mydriasis; cycloplegia; increased ocular tension; loss of taste sense; headache; nervousness; drowsiness; weakness; dizziness; insomnia; nausea; vomiting; impotence; suppression of lactation; constipation; bloated feeling; musculoskeletal pain; severe allergic reaction or drug idiosyncrasies, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, and other dermal manifestations; and decreased sweating.

Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma, urticaria, angioedema, and similar conditions. Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling, particularly of the eyelids, cheeks, or lips, and erythematous dermatitis. Rarely, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever, delirium, and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases, megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital.

Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect.

### Pupil-linked arousal is driven by decision uncertainty and alters serial choice bias [^111XaekK]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Decisions about an observer's sensory environment do not only depend on the momentary sensory input but also on the behavioural context. One such contextual factor is the history of preceding choices and stimuli, which robustly biases even highly trained decision-makers. Although such serial choice biases were first identified in psychophysical tasks about a century ago, their determinants have remained poorly understood. Previous treatments of serial choice biases have conceptualized experimental history as sequences of binary external events (past stimulus identities, choices, or feedback). We here established that these serial biases were also modulated by the decision-maker's pupil-linked arousal state on the previous trial, which, in turn, reflected the uncertainty about the observer's choice.

Several important features of our approach allowed us to move beyond previous work linking human pupil dynamics to uncertainty and performance monitoring. First, different from most previous studies, we here unravelled the temporal evolution of uncertainty information in the pupil response, enabling inferences about not only the existence, but also the time course of this information (see ref.for a similar approach). Second, the model-based definition of decision uncertainty we used helped dissociate decision uncertainty from error detection, which has previously been linked to pupil dilation. In a two-choice task, a signal encoding decision uncertainty should predict behavioural performance over a range from 100% to 50% correct (corresponding to 50% for the maximum uncertainty signal, or larger when encoding is imprecise). By contrast, an error detection signal should predict performance over the range 100% to 0% correct. Our measurements were more consistent with decision uncertainty than error detection (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Third, in our task, decision uncertainty critically depended on internal noise (the primary source of the variance in Fig. 1a). By contrast, previous studies linking uncertainty to pupil dynamicshave used tasks in which the primary source of uncertainty was in the observers' environment. Last, in contrast to most previous pupillometry studieswe comprehensively quantified the predictive effects of pupil-linked arousal on the parameters of choice beyond the current trial, thereby complementing recent work on the effects of pupil-linked arousal on learning. Taken together, our results critically advance the understanding of how internal decision uncertainty is encoded in pupil-linked arousal in humans, in a way that builds a direct bridge to single-unit recording studies of decision uncertainty in animals.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^116JzcAg]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Pupillary reactivity and pupillometry — The pupillary light response is an important element of the neurologic exam because it provides useful diagnostic and prognostic information, and new pupillary asymmetry can indicate compression of the brainstem with impending uncal herniation, triggering the need for further evaluation and intervention; a unilateral unreactive pupil is consistent with an ipsilateral mass lesion, while bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils portend a poor overall prognosis for functional recovery. In older adults, evaluation of the pupillary response may be confounded by preexisting chronic ophthalmic diseases, and although quantitative pupillometry may be of limited value in postsurgical pupils after cataract surgery, this does not influence pupillary light reflex parameters measured by automated pupillometry; in these patients, a medical history is essential to correctly interpret findings. Both the inter‑rater and intra‑rater reliability of the standard clinical determination of pupillary size and reactivity are relatively poor, whereas quantitative pupillometers provide increased reliability and consistency; the quantitative pupillometer is a small handheld device that uses both visible and infrared light to measure a pupil, capture its response to a light stimulus, and quantify the pupil's characteristics, with outputs including starting diameter (mm), ending diameter (mm), % change, latency (s), average constriction velocity (mm/s), and average dilation velocity (mm/s). In pediatric patients, developmental changes in myelination during infancy can alter the normal latency observed, potentially limiting the application of a priori thresholds. Clinical experience shows that quantitative pupillometry can facilitate a more accurate clinical assessment by providing an objective and reliable assessment of pupillary reactivity; pupillary changes may be detected before a provider's clinical assessment, quantitative pupillometry can assess reactivity even when opioids and other drugs result in small pupils, and the pupillometry output can be directly entered into the patient's electronic medical record.

### Cardiac arrest after severe traumatic brain injury can be survivable with good outcomes [^112eLWLk]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Pupil diameter and reactivity to light provide vital information on the extent of brain damage. A dilated unreactive pupil indicates compression of the oculomotor nerve, often due to midline shift and uncal herniation, and thus worse prognosis. This was reflected in our results that most of the patients who survived had bilaterally reactive pupils, whereas almost all of those with non-reactive and dilated pupils did not survive. Previous report has also shown that pupillary reactivity is a reliable prognostic indicator of mortality in sTBI both on the field and at admission, compared with GCS, making it a more useful early indicator of survival. One limitation of pupil reactivity is that it could be affected by sedative medications. However, most of our patients only had light sedation on arrival to the ED. It is important to note that previous studies have made the effort to combine GCS score and pupil response to provide more accurate prognosis of patients with sTBI, highlighting the importance of both clinical assessments in evaluating severe brain trauma. Our study is in concordance with these findings in that GCS score and pupil response are the single two most important indicators of survival.

The most common initial rhythm before cardiac arrest in our study is PEA, followed by asystole. These two cardiac rhythms are most commonly associated with obstructive, hypovolemic, and cardiogenic shock as well as tissue hypoxia. Although closely related to traumatic injury, no specific cardiac rhythm was significantly associated with mortality in our study. Other general clinical characteristics related to trauma, such as mechanisms of injury, intubation status on the scene, and the location of cardiac arrest, also did not significantly contribute to mortality in our cohort, which is consistent with current literature on TCA with larger sample sizes. Studies focusing on the relationship between age and mortality from TCA have mixed findings. Majority shows that older age is associated with worse outcome. In our study, however, there was no difference in age between patients who survived and those who did not. This result could be attributed to the fact that we excluded patients with severe chronic comorbidities and cardiac arrest due to medical causes. Both of these conditions have increased incidence with age and forebode worse outcomes seen in elderly patients.

### Antiepileptic drug treatment of rolandic epilepsy and panayiotopoulos syndrome: clinical practice survey and clinical trial feasibility [^115ihoty]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Panayiotopoulos syndrome

In Panayiotopoulos syndrome (PS), seizure semiology involves prominent autonomic symptoms. At onset, nausea, retching and vomiting are characteristic, often accompanied by other autonomic symptoms, such as pupillary changes, pallor/flushing, alterations in heart rate, breathing irregularities and temperature instability. Syncope-like episodes may occur. Impairment of consciousness develops as the seizure progresses, often accompanied by eye and head deviation. Seizures may end in hemi or generalised convulsions. Two-thirds of seizures occur during sleep. Seizures are often prolonged, most lasting over 10 min and many over 30 min (autonomic, non-convulsive status epilepticus). Potentially life-threatening cardiorespiratory arrest has been described in PS. As in RE, cognitive and behavioural difficulties have been associated with PS. Prognosis for remission of seizures is excellent.

When treated, carbamazepine and lamotrigine are recommended as first-line monotherapy by NICE (see table 1) and others, although the evidence base is acknowledged to be poor, and there are theoretical risks of carbamazepine exacerbating the seizures or EEG abnormalityand also speech production. International practice beyond the UK diverges widely, as does expert opinion on the subject. Sulthiame is considered first-line in Germany, Austria and Israel, although it may have adverse effects on cognition; sodium valproate in France; while levetiracetam is popular in the USA. Thus, the rationale for treatment versus non-treatment is not established and the evidence base in favour of specific AEDs is unknown amid widespread national and international variation in practice. This equipoise scenario sets the stage for an RCT, for which it would be important to learn the treatment preferences of physicians likely to recruit to such a trial, in order to assess various aspects of design feasibility. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, (1) to examine current clinical practice for RE and PS in relation to NICE guidance, specifically asking what proportion of patients are routinely not treated and (2) to explore the feasibility of alternative syndrome-specific RCT designs for RE and PS. We specifically address the questions of clinicians' attitudes towards placebo-controlled designs, and which AEDs would be either preferred or unpopular comparators.

### An interesting case of a unilaterally dilated pupil [^111JxJhx]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Facial lacerations from minor trauma are a common presenting complaint to the emergency department. With the increasing availability of topical anesthetics, there is a decrease in the need for injectable local anesthetic and sedation services, facilitating the ease of facial laceration repairs for young children. One such topical anesthetic is a widely used pharmacy preparation of lidocaine 4%-epinephrine 0.1%-tetracaine 0.5% gel (LET). Although the use of LET has decreased the need for injectable lidocaine and sedation for facial lacerations, both of which can be unpleasant for children with potentially life-threatening adverse events, it may still lead to unexpected and untoward adverse events. We explore here a little-known adverse effect of LET in a child who presented to a pediatric emergency department with an eyelid laceration after minor head trauma.

### A systematic review assessing the current state of automated pupillometry in the neuroICU [^1174Bsov]. Neurocritical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the current state of automated pupillometry technology and its application in the neurointensive care unit (neuroICU). We performed a literature search using the PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases from database inception through a search end date of October 18, 2018, to identify studies reporting on the use of automated pupillometry in the care of critically ill patients with neurological impairment. Two independent reviewers reviewed all titles and abstracts in two filtering phases. Data were extracted independently. One hundred and forty-one articles/abstracts have been published on the use of automated pupillometry in critical care since inception of the PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases. We selected and reviewed 22 full-text articles and 8 abstracts, of which 26 were prospective, 2 were retrospective, and 2 were larger case series. Automated pupillometry increased precision, reliability, and reproducibility compared with the manual pupillary examination; detected subtle and early pupillary changes; detected pupillary changes that indicate a rise, or impending rise, in intracranial pressure detected level of analgesia and depth of sedation; served as a prognostic indicator; estimated the clinical severity of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; and served as a noninvasive monitor of response to osmotic therapy. At present, no consensus guidelines exist endorsing routine use of automated pupillometry in the neuroICU. However, an increasing quantity of research supports the usefulness of automated pupillometry in this setting. Further large-scale prospective studies are needed before updated consensus guidelines recommending widespread adoption of automated pupillometry are produced.

OVERDOSAGE

The toxic dose of barbiturates varies considerably. In general, an oral dose of 1 gram of most barbiturates produces serious poisoning in an adult. Death commonly occurs after 2 to 10 grams of ingested barbiturate. Barbiturate intoxication may be confused with alcoholism, bromide intoxication, and with various neurological disorders.

Acute overdosage with barbiturates is manifested by CNS and respiratory depression which may progress to Cheyne-Stokes respiration, areflexia, constriction of the pupils to a slight degree (though in severe poisoning they may show paralytic dilation), oliguria, tachycardia, hypotension, lowered body temperature, and coma. Typical shock syndrome (apnea, circulatory collapse, respiratory arrest, and death) may occur.

In extreme overdose, all electrical activity in the brain may cease, in which case a "flat" EEG normally equated with clinical death cannot be accepted. This effect is fully reversible unless hypoxic damage occurs. Consideration should be given to the possibility of barbiturate intoxication even in situations that appear to involve trauma.

Complications such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and renal failure may occur. Uremia may increase CNS sensitivity to barbiturates. Differential diagnosis should include hypoglycemia, head trauma, cerebrovascular accidents, convulsive states, and diabetic coma. Blood levels from acute overdosage for some barbiturates are listed in Table 1.

### Neurobehavioral meaning of pupil size [^114qA5MS]. Neuron (2024). Medium credibility.

Pupil size is a widely used metric of brain state. It is one of the few signals originating from the brain that can be readily monitored with low-cost devices in basic science, clinical, and home settings. It is, therefore, important to investigate and generate well-defined theories related to specific interpretations of this metric. What exactly does it tell us about the brain? Pupils constrict in response to light and dilate during darkness, but the brain also controls pupil size irrespective of luminosity. Pupil size fluctuations resulting from ongoing "brain states" are used as a metric of arousal, but what is pupil-linked arousal and how should it be interpreted in neural, cognitive, and computational terms? Here, we discuss some recent findings related to these issues. We identify open questions and propose how to answer them through a combination of well-defined tasks, neurocomputational models, and neurophysiological probing of the interconnected loops of causes and consequences of pupil size.

Neurocritical Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Neurocritical care — clinical scales of consciousness: All clinical scales of consciousness should account for the effects of sedation and neuromuscular blockade, and while inter-rater reliability varies, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a strong prognostic marker and indicator of need for surgery in traumatic brain injury, of clinical outcome in posterior circulation stroke, and following cardiac arrest. In isolation, the GCS is disadvantaged by endotracheal intubation and lack of pupillary measurement, but pupillary responses can be integrated with the GCS to provide greater specificity of outcome prediction, and newer devices objectively measure pupillary diameter and response though further research is needed. Sedation, potent analgesics, and neuromuscular blockade remain a problem for any clinical scale; in non-sedated (or lightly sedated but responsive) patients, the Full Outline of Unresponsiveness (FOUR) score may provide a more complete assessment of brainstem function, although volume assist ventilator modes may confound differentiation between the two lowest consciousness scores. Current evidence suggests that both the GCS and FOUR score provide useful and reproducible measures of neurological state and can be routinely used to chart trends in clinical progress.

### Risk of neurotoxicity with multiple general anaesthetics for examination under anaesthesia in paediatric ophthalmology – A cause for concern? [^113xEBbs]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

What is Known Regarding Neurocognitive Risk of Individual Anaesthetic Agents or Delivery Methods?

No individual anaesthetic agent, delivery method, or combination of agents to date has conclusively demonstrated neuroprotective or more potent neurotoxic effects over another in the context of multiple GA exposures". Balanced anaesthesia" is achieved through small and safe doses from 3 categories of drugs (ie, analgesic, anaesthetic and muscle relaxation drugs) during the three key phases of induction, maintenance, and emergence. The underpinning concept is maximizing the beneficial effects of each agent while avoiding potential adverse effects associated with larger doses of any single agent.

Pain itself has a neurotoxic effect, and must be balanced with the increased risk (apnoea, respiratory depression, tolerance, and hypoxia) of intraoperative analgesic agents (eg, opioids including fentanyl). Increased fentanyl concentrations are found in the brain tissue of neonates and young infants due to an immature blood-brain barrierthrough direct causation with neurotoxic injury has not been established.

Most elective paediatric GA in Ireland are typically managed with inhalational sevoflurane/isoflurane ± nitrous oxide for induction and maintenance, When induction and maintenance of anaesthesia is through IV agents this is referred to as "total intravenous anaesthesia" (TIVA) and is preferentially employed in certain circumstances (eg, history of severe post-operative nausea and vomiting, certain day case procedures, trainee teaching, anticipated difficult airway management, etc.).TIVA can involve a combination of agents with synergistic effects, eg, remifentanil potentiates the effects of propofol, reducing required propofol dose by ~50%. It has not been established if TIVA can offer a reduced neurotoxic risk over inhalational methods; however, lower required drug doses would imply less risk.

What is Known Regarding Neurocognitive Risk Through Single GA Exposure?

There exists considerable controversy on this question, with conflicting published data.

Animal studies (eg, nematodes, rodents, and primates) have demonstrated histopathological changes in their developing brains following GA exposure. Proposed mechanisms include apoptotic injury, reactive oxygen species damage, neuroinflammation, and variable expression at N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) receptors. Virtually all anaesthetic agents in common clinical practice are implicated, exerting effects as NMDA antagonists (eg, ketamine, nitrous oxide) and GABA agonists (eg, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, propofol, volatile anaesthetics)It is difficult to extrapolate these findings to the developing human brain for several reasons and thankfully these findings have failed to replicate in human studies.

### Unilateral pharmacologic mydriasis in a patient with respiratory compromise… [^114jaPcR]. JAMA Network (1997). Excellent credibility.

Acute unilateral mydriasis can be the heralding sign of a neuro-ophthalmologic emergency. Textbooks often assert that pupillary dilation may be the first and only sign of third nerve dysfunction from aneurysmal or tumoral compression, tentorial herniation, or meningeal inflammation or infiltration. Evaluation for these entities frequently involves extensive, costly, and invasive testing. Less harmful causes of an acutely dilated pupil — specifically, pharmacologic dilation — must also be considered. We describe a patient in whom an aerosolized anticholinergic solution caused unilateral mydriasis. Report of a Case. A 17-year-old white male with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome was hospitalized with complications following a bone marrow transplant and was, subsequently, intubated for respiratory compromise.

Results

For convenience of discussion, the bucking mode number 'n' was defined according to the number of local maxima across the iris structure in our simulations. Table 1 details the initial critical buckling pressure for all the simulations, and details the results (as a percentage increase ratio) to the 5 mm undilated normal iris to provide a context for comparison of magnitude for iris billowing behaviour.

Comparison of the critical pressures to initiate iris buckling of different iris models with different material parameters, detailing the true value and the increased percentage ratio when compared with the normal undilated 5 mm iris.

The increase ratio 'R' can be calculated by using the following equation:

where 'P' is the iris initial critical buckling pressure in different cases, and ' P N ' is the initial critical buckling pressure of the normal undilated 5 mm iris model.

Initiation of buckling of normal iris with undilated or dilated pupil

The first occurring buckling mode of the normal iris with the undilated pupil (diameter 5 mm) and dilated pupil (7 mm) illustrates that the required critical pressures to cause iris buckling increases with increasing pupil dilation. Specifically, buckling occurred at a critical pressure of 19.92 mmHg for the undilated iris, whereas it occurred at 28.00 mmHg with the pupil dilated to 7 mm (40.56% increased ratio) (see Fig. 1).

### Chronic barbiturate intoxication… [^113bWmDz]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

IN RECENT years abuse of barbiturates has become a problem of increasing concern to physicians, various lay groups, law enforcement officers and legislators. The production of barbiturates has steadily increased and now appears to exceed greatly the amount needed for therapeutic purposes. 1 In 1948 the total production of barbiturates in the United States was 672, 000 pounds, an amount roughly equivalent to 3, 057, 730, 000 capsules or tablets of 0. 1 Gm. each, or approximately 24 doses for each person in the United States. Acute intoxication with barbiturates accounts for about 25 per cent of all patients with acute poisoning admitted to general hospitals2; and more deaths are caused by barbiturates, either accidentally ingested or taken with suicidal intent, than by any other poison. 3 Various articles in the lay press4 have attributed automobile accidents and various crimes to barbiturate intoxication and have also stated that illegal trafficking in.

Neuromonitoring

ICP monitoring is usually not available in spoke centers and during transfer to hub centers. However, different tools can help us to estimate the risk of intracranial hypertension. A basic neurological evaluation, including GCS and pupil examination (size and reaction), is very helpful to identify neurological deterioration associated with an increase of ICP. The motor response is the most easily evaluable component of the GCS (especially in conditions where verbal response and eye opening can be difficult to obtain, as in the case of tracheal intubation, facial injuries, etc.). Pupillary shape/diameter and reactivity to light should be carefully evaluated. These evaluations are essential before tracheal intubation and sedation. However, discontinuation of sedation to obtain a reliable neurological evaluation can be dangerous in patients with radiological signs of increased ICP. Although not specific, certain CT radiological signs are suggestive of intracranial hypertension such as the compression of the basal cisterns, midline shift and sulcal effacement.

Brain ultrasonography, when performed by a skilled operator, can estimate intracranial hypertension by the evaluation of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), pulsatility index (PI), etc.

Automated pupillometry accurately measures the pupil size and several dynamic variables such as pupillary constriction, latency and constriction/dilation velocity. The integration of the latter into an algorithm provides the Neurological Pupil index (NPi — values 0–5; pathological < 3). Episodes of raised ICP are associated with a concomitant decrease of the NPi. Considering the above, we recommend performing serial neurologic evaluations (GCS + pupil examination) in the spoke center and during transfer to the hub center to detect neuro-worsening in the absence of radiological signs of intracranial hypertension (i.e. midline shift, compression of the basal cisterns, sulcal effacement, etc.). In this scenario, only pupillary evaluation (shape/diameter and reactivity to light), especially during transfer, could be useful. We were unable to reach a consensus on the utilization of brain ultrasonography and automated pupillometry as a screening non-invasive tool for detection of intracranial hypertension in the spoke center. This could be related, at the moment, to the absence of robust data deriving from well-powered studies on this topic. The possible utilization of brain ultrasonography and automated pupillometry, by experienced operators, should not significantly delay the patient's transfer.

### Confidence controls perceptual evidence accumulation [^1165Vdax]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Perceptual decisions are accompanied by feelings of confidence that reflect the likelihood that the decision was correct. Here we aim to clarify the relationship between perception and confidence by studying the same perceptual task across three different confidence contexts. Human observers were asked to categorize the source of sequentially presented visual stimuli. Each additional stimulus provided evidence for making more accurate perceptual decisions, and better confidence judgements. We show that observers' ability to set appropriate evidence accumulation bounds for perceptual decisions is strongly predictive of their ability to make accurate confidence judgements. When observers were not permitted to control their exposure to evidence, they imposed covert bounds on their perceptual decisions but not on their confidence decisions. This partial dissociation between decision processes is reflected in behaviour and pupil dilation. Together, these findings suggest a confidence-regulated accumulation-to-bound process that controls perceptual decision-making even in the absence of explicit speed-accuracy trade-offs.

### Control and coding of pupil size by hypothalamic orexin neurons [^113ArAJ4]. Nature Neuroscience (2023). High credibility.

Source data

Next, we tested how disruption of orexin neuropeptide signaling affected pupil size in awake and anesthetized animals. To distinguish the contribution of orexin neurotransmission to pupil dilation from other neurotransmitters emitted by orexin neurons, we repeated the optogenetic stimulation experiment (Fig. 1) while specifically blocking orexin receptors with the antagonist almorexant (ALM) (Fig. 2a and Methods). ALM reduced both tonic pupil dilation (Fig. 2b–d) and the extent of pupil dilation during the orexin cell optostimulation-evoked response (Fig. 2b–d and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Interestingly, rapid dilation at optostimulation onset was initially similar between the ALM and vehicle conditions, but diverged after 1–2 s, with slower and smaller dilation occurring in ALM-injected mice thereafter (Extended Data Fig. 1b). This suggests that fast transmitter(s) released by orexin cellscaused the initial dilation. Overall, these results establish a causal link between orexin neurotransmission and pupil size.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions may include xerostomia; urinary hesitancy and retention; blurred vision; tachycardia; palpitation; mydriasis; cycloplegia; increased ocular tension; loss of taste sense; headache; nervousness; drowsiness; weakness; dizziness; insomnia; nausea; vomiting; impotence; suppression of lactation; constipation; bloated feeling; musculoskeletal pain; severe allergic reaction or drug idiosyncrasies, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, and other dermal manifestations; and decreased sweating.

Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma, urticaria, angioedema, and similar conditions. Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling, particularly of the eyelids, cheeks, or lips, and erythematous dermatitis. Rarely, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever, delirium, and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases, megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital.

Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect.

### Pupil-linked arousal is driven by decision uncertainty and alters serial choice bias [^116B5k7S]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

While judging their sensory environments, decision-makers seem to use the uncertainty about their choices to guide adjustments of their subsequent behaviour. One possible source of these behavioural adjustments is arousal: decision uncertainty might drive the brain's arousal systems, which control global brain state and might thereby shape subsequent decision-making. Here, we measure pupil diameter, a proxy for central arousal state, in human observers performing a perceptual choice task of varying difficulty. Pupil dilation, after choice but before external feedback, reflects three hallmark signatures of decision uncertainty derived from a computational model. This increase in pupil-linked arousal boosts observers' tendency to alternate their choice on the subsequent trial. We conclude that decision uncertainty drives rapid changes in pupil-linked arousal state, which shape the serial correlation structure of ongoing choice behaviour.

General design

The main experiment was composed of 60 or 75 inductions that were divided into 2 or 3 sessions with short breaks in between (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for an illustration of the differences between studies). The 10-s emotion induction relied on a specific imagery scenario (only used once) presented as a text vignette in a red coloured font that was luminance-adjusted to the grey background to minimize the effect on pupil dilation. The vignette was accompanied by music (except for neutral inductions), which kept on playing during choices in order to maximize the expected emotional spill-over. Participants made a short series of risk, delay, and effort choices, interleaved with a 1–2 s jittered fixation cross. The minimum decision time was fixed to 0.5 s. The number of decisions presented after an induction differed between studies, ranging from 6 to 12. At the end of the choice battery, music stopped playing and participants rated their emotions. To ensure proper emotional washout before the following induction, the screen was then turned black for 8 s with a message that stated: "Please relax and empty your mind as you await the next trial". Then, a 2-s fixation cross preceded the next emotion induction.

### Causes… [^115vWA7w]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Mydriasis is the dilation of the pupil, usually having a non-physiological cause, or sometimes a physiological pupillary response. Non-physiological causes of mydriasis include disease, trauma, or the use of certain types of drugs. It may also be of unknown cause. Normally, as part of the pupillary light reflex, the pupil dilates in the dark and constricts in the light to respectively improve vividity at night and to protect the retina from sunlight damage during the day. A mydriatic pupil will remain excessively large even in a bright environment. The excitation of the radial fibres of the iris which increases the pupillary aperture is referred to as a mydriasis. More generally, mydriasis also refers to the natural dilation of pupils, for instance in low light conditions or under sympathetic stimulation. Mydriasis is frequently induced by drugs for certain ophthalmic examinations and procedures, particularly those requiring visual access to the retina.

Fixed, unilateral mydriasis could be a symptom of raised intracranial pressure. The opposite, constriction of the pupil, is referred to as miosis. Both mydriasis and miosis can be physiological. Anisocoria is the condition of one pupil being more dilated than the other. Causes There are two types of muscle that control the size of the iris: the iris sphincter, composed of circularly arranged muscle fibers, and the iris dilator, composed of radially arranged muscle fibers. The sphincter is controlled by nerves of the parasympathetic nervous system, and the dilator by the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic stimulation of the adrenergic receptors causes the contraction of the radial muscle and subsequent dilation of the pupil. Conversely, parasympathetic stimulation causes contraction of the circular muscle and constriction of the pupil. The mechanism of mydriasis depends on the agent being used.

It usually involves either a disruption of the parasympathetic nerve supply to the eye or overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system. Pupil diameter also increases in reaction to cognitive tasks requiring memory and attention, and this phenomenon is used as an indicator of mental activation in psychophysiological experiments. Drugs A mydriatic is an agent that induces dilation of the pupil. Drugs such as tropicamide are used in medicine to permit examination of the retina and other deep structures of the eye. Mydriatics typically also have a cycloplegic effect, reducing or paralyzing the accommodation reflex which may also be used for certain ophthalmic examinations or treatments, such as reducing painful ciliary muscle spasm. One effect of administration of a mydriatic is intolerance to bright light. Purposefully-induced mydriasis via mydriatics is also used as a diagnostic test for Horner's syndrome.

Mydriasis can be induced via modulation of adrenergic or cholinergic signalling. Drugs that can cause mydriasis include:

- Stimulants such as amphetamines, cocaine, MDMA, and mephedrone.
- Anticholinergics such as diphenhydramine, atropine, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine antagonize the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the eye. Blocking acetylcholine receptors reduces the pupillary muscles' ability to constrict and causes dilation. The antimuscarinic, tropicamide, may be used as a mydriastic agent during surgery.
- Serotonergics such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline and 2C-B. These drugs are typically hallucinogens. Similarly, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can cause mydriasis.

### Pharmacologic interventions for mydriasis in cataract surgery [^1129oj8S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cataract surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide. Achieving appropriate intraoperative mydriasis is one of the critical factors associated with the safety and performance of the surgery. Inadequate pupillary dilation or constriction of the pupil during cataract surgery can impair the surgeon's field of view and make it difficult to maneuver instruments.

Objectives

To evaluate the relative effectiveness of achieving pupillary dilation during phacoemulsification for cataract extraction using three methods of pupillary dilation: topical mydriatics, intracameral mydriatics, or depot delivery systems. We also planned to document and compare the risk of intraoperative and postoperative complications following phacoemulsification for cataract extraction, as well as the cost-effectiveness of these methods for pupillary dilation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2021, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 22 January 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomized controlled trial (RCTs) in which participants underwent phacoemulsification for cataract extraction.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology.

Main Results

We included a total of 14 RCTs (1670 eyes of 1652 participants) in this review. Of the 14 trials, 7 compared topical versus intracameral mydriatics, 6 compared topical mydriatics versus depot delivery systems, and 1 compared all three methods. We were unable to calculate overall estimates of comparative effectiveness for most outcomes due to statistical heterogeneity among the estimates from individual studies or because outcome data were available from only a single study. Furthermore, the certainty of evidence for most outcomes was low or very low, due primarily to imprecision and risk of bias. Comparison 1: topical mydriatics versus intracameral mydriatics Four RCTs (739 participants, 757 eyes) of the 8 RCTs that had compared these two methods reported mean pupillary diameters at the time surgeons had performed capsulorhexis; all favored topical mydriatics, but heterogeneity was high (I² = 95%). After omitting 1 RCT that used a paired-eyes design, evidence from three RCTs (721 participants and eyes) suggests that mean pupil diameter at the time of capsulorhexis may be greater with topical mydriatics than with intracameral mydriatics, but the evidence is of low certainty (mean difference 1.06 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 mm to 1.31 mm; I² = 49%). Four RCTs (224 participants, 242 eyes) reported mean pupillary diameter at the beginning of cataract surgery; the effect estimates from all trials favored topical mydriatics, with very low-certainty evidence. Five RCTs (799 participants, 817 eyes) reported mean pupillary diameter at the end of cataract surgery. Data for this outcome from the largest RCT (549 participants and eyes) provided evidence of a small difference in favor of intracameral mydriasis. On the other hand, 2 small RCTs (78 participants, 96 eyes) favored topical mydriatics, and the remaining 2 RCTs (172 participants) found no meaningful difference between the two methods, with very low-certainty evidence. Five RCTs (799 participants, 817 eyes) reported total intraoperative surgical time. The largest RCT (549 participants and eyes) reported decreased total intraoperative time with intracameral mydriatics, whereas 1 RCT (18 participants, 36 eyes) favored topical mydriatics, and the remaining 3 RCTs (232 participants) found no difference between the two methods, with very low-certainty evidence. Comparison 2: topical mydriatics versus depot delivery systems Of the 7 RCTs that compared these two methods, none reported mean pupillary diameter at the time surgeons performed capsulorhexis. Six RCTs (434 participants) reported mean pupillary diameter at the beginning of cataract surgery. After omitting 1 RCT suspected to be responsible for high heterogeneity (I² = 80%), meta-analysis of the other 5 RCTs (324 participants and eyes) found no evidence of a meaningful difference between the two methods, with very low-certainty evidence. Three RCTs (210 participants) reported mean pupillary diameter at the end of cataract surgery, with high heterogeneity among effect estimates for this outcome. Estimates of mean differences and confidence intervals from these three RCTs were consistent with no difference between the two methods. A fourth RCT reported only means for this outcome, with low-certainty evidence. Two small RCTs (118 participants) reported total intraoperative time. Surgical times were lower when depot delivery was used, but the confidence interval estimated from one trial was consistent with no difference, and only mean times were reported from the other trial, with very low-certainty evidence. Comparison 3: Intracameral mydriatics versus depot delivery systems Only one RCT (60 participants) compared intracameral mydriatics versus depot delivery system. Mean pupillary diameter at the time the surgeon performed capsulorhexis, phacoemulsification time, and cost outcomes were not reported. Mean pupil diameter at the beginning and end of cataract surgery favored the depot delivery system, with very low-certainty evidence. Adverse events Evidence from one RCT (555 participants and eyes) comparing topical mydriatics versus intracameral mydriatics suggests that ocular discomfort may be greater with topical mydriatics than with intracameral mydriatics at one week (risk ratio (RR) 10.57, 95% CI 1.37 to 81.34) and one month (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.65) after cataract surgery, with moderate-certainty evidence at both time points. Another RCT (30 participants) reported iris-related complications in 11 participants in the intracameral mydriatics group versus no complications in the depot delivery system group, with very low-certainty evidence. Cardiovascular related adverse events were rarely mentioned.

Authors' Conclusions

Data from 14 completed RCTs were inadequate to establish the superiority of any of three methods to achieve mydriasis for cataract surgery, based on pupillary dilation at different times during the surgery or on time required for surgery. Only one trial had a sample size adequate to yield a robust effect estimate. Larger, well-designed trials are needed to provide robust estimates for the comparison of mydriasis approaches for beneficial and adverse effects.

### Determination of brain death / death by neurologic criteria: the world brain death project [^115CET2x]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

There are inconsistencies in concept, criteria, practice, and documentation of brain death/death by neurologic criteria (BD/DNC) both internationally and within countries.

Objective

To formulate a consensus statement of recommendations on determination of BD/DNC based on review of the literature and expert opinion of a large multidisciplinary, international panel.

Process

Relevant international professional societies were recruited to develop recommendations regarding determination of BD/DNC. Literature searches of the Cochrane, Embase, and MEDLINE databases included January 1, 1992, through April 2020 identified pertinent articles for review. Because of the lack of high-quality data from randomized clinical trials or large observational studies, recommendations were formulated based on consensus of contributors and medical societies that represented relevant disciplines, including critical care, neurology, and neurosurgery.

Evidence Synthesis

Based on review of the literature and consensus from a large multidisciplinary, international panel, minimum clinical criteria needed to determine BD/DNC in various circumstances were developed.

Recommendations

Prior to evaluating a patient for BD/DNC, the patient should have an established neurologic diagnosis that can lead to the complete and irreversible loss of all brain function, and conditions that may confound the clinical examination and diseases that may mimic BD/DNC should be excluded. Determination of BD/DNC can be done with a clinical examination that demonstrates coma, brainstem areflexia, and apnea. This is seen when (1) there is no evidence of arousal or awareness to maximal external stimulation, including noxious visual, auditory, and tactile stimulation; (2) pupils are fixed in a midsize or dilated position and are nonreactive to light; (3) corneal, oculocephalic, and oculovestibular reflexes are absent; (4) there is no facial movement to noxious stimulation; (5) the gag reflex is absent to bilateral posterior pharyngeal stimulation; (6) the cough reflex is absent to deep tracheal suctioning; (7) there is no brain-mediated motor response to noxious stimulation of the limbs; and (8) spontaneous respirations are not observed when apnea test targets reach pH < 7.30 and Paco2 ≥ 60 mm Hg. If the clinical examination cannot be completed, ancillary testing may be considered with blood flow studies or electrophysiologic testing. Special consideration is needed for children, for persons receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and for those receiving therapeutic hypothermia, as well as for factors such as religious, societal, and cultural perspectives; legal requirements; and resource availability.

Conclusions and Relevance

This report provides recommendations for the minimum clinical standards for determination of brain death/death by neurologic criteria in adults and children with clear guidance for various clinical circumstances. The recommendations have widespread international society endorsement and can serve to guide professional societies and countries in the revision or development of protocols and procedures for determination of brain death/death by neurologic criteria, leading to greater consistency within and between countries.

### Ocular cyclopentolate: a mini review concerning its benefits and risks [^1166L9i4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

To prevent the systemic adverse effects of cyclopentolate, the literature recommends avoiding the use of 2% cyclopentolate and instead employing solutions with lower concentrations that still produce cycloplegia, such as 0.2%, 0.5%, or 1% concentrations, preferably with another mydriatic such as phenylephrine. Also, a limited dosage (instill one drop in the eye followed by a second drop after an interval of 5 to 15 minutes in the case of the unequivocal failure of cycloplegia and mydriasis) is recommended. Likewise, the occlusion of the nasolacrimal duct after instillation limits the drug's absorption, reducing the risk of systemic adverse events.,

When present, early recognition of signs and symptoms of systemic toxicity is essential. The treatment of cyclopentolate toxicity is essentially symptomatic. In case of severe adverse effects on the nervous system, the drug of choice is physostigmine, although it can be complicated to obtain in some countries since it is not always commercially available; in those cases, the options are benzodiazepines such as diazepam or midazolam. Unfortunately, commonly used anticholinesterase agents such as neostigmine, pyridostigmine, and edrophonium, do not cross the blood–brain barrier, and hence are not helpful in treating these effects.

Several authors mention that the instillation of cyclopentolate should be used with caution in children, patients with neurological disorders, patients with Down's syndrome and patients exposed to anticholinergics. On the other hand, although the abuse of cyclopentolate is infrequent, special care should be taken in patients with a history of drug abuse and those who request an excessive amount of cyclopentolate.

### Modelling floppy iris syndrome and the impact of pupil size and ring devices on iris displacement [^113g7a5Z]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The aim of this paper was to further develop a previously described finite element model which equates clinical iris billowing movements with mechanical buckling behaviour, simulating floppy iris syndrome. We wished to evaluate the impact of pupil dilation and mechanical devices on normal iris and floppy iris models.

Methods

Theoretical mathematical modelling and computer simulations were used to assess billowing/buckling patterns of the iris under loading pressures for the undilated and dilated normal iris, the undilated and dilated floppy iris, and additionally with a mechanical ring device.

Results

For the normal iris, billowing/buckling occurred at a critical pressure of 19.92mmHg for 5mm pupil size, which increased to 28.00mmHg (40.56%) with a 7mm pupil. The Malyugin ring device significantly increased critical initiating buckling pressures in the normal iris scenario, to 34.58mmHg (73.59%) for 7mm ring with boundary conditions I (BC I) and 34.51mmHg (73.24%) with BC II. For the most floppy iris modelling (40% degradation), initiating buckling value was 18.04mmHg (-9.44%), which increased to 28.39mmHg (42.52%) with the 7mm ring. These results were much greater than for normal undilated iris without restrictive mechanical expansion (19.92mmHg).

Conclusion

This simulation demonstrates that pupil expansion devices inhibit iris billowing even in the setting of floppy iris syndrome. Our work also provides a model to further investigate the impact of pupil size or pharmacological interventions on anterior segment conditions affected by iris position.

### The value of pupillary dilation in pre-emptive analgesia: is there more to this than meets the eye? [^113EsNc6]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The pupillary dilatation reflex may present an objective method of predicting whether sedated patients require additional analgesia for painful procedures. Behavioural pain assessment tools identify pain only once it has occurred and are unable to guide pre-emptive management. The pupillary dilatation reflex response to a tetanic stimulus has been utilised to assess analgesic requirements in patients under anaesthesia and for those with postoperative pain. This tool appears promising to assess pain in the critically ill; however, a number of questions remain unanswered regarding the influence of sedation on this response. These questions require further exploration before the pupillary dilatation reflex can be widely adopted into clinical practice.

### Atropine and pralidoxime chloride (ATNAA atropine and pralidoxime chloride) [^112khNgP]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1	Symptoms

Atropine

Manifestations of atropine overdose are dose-related and include flushing, dry skin and mucous membranes, tachycardia, widely dilated pupils that are poorly responsive to light, blurred vision, and fever (which can sometimes be dangerously elevated). Locomotor difficulties, disorientation, hallucinations, delirium, confusion, agitation, coma, and central depression can occur and may last 48 hours or longer. In instances of severe atropine intoxication, respiratory depression, coma, circulatory collapse, and death may occur.

Pralidoxime Chloride

It may be difficult to differentiate adverse events caused by pralidoxime chloride from those caused by organophosphorus nerve agent poisoning. Symptoms of pralidoxime chloride overdose may include dizziness, blurred vision, diplopia, headache, impaired accommodation, nausea, and tachycardia. Transient hypertension caused by pralidoxime chloride may last several hours.

10.2	Treatment

For atropine overdose, supportive treatment should be administered. If respiration is depressed, artificial respiration with oxygen is necessary. Ice bags, a hypothermia blanket, or other methods of cooling may be required to reduce atropine-induced fever, especially in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Catheterization may be necessary if urinary retention occurs. Since atropine elimination largely takes place through the kidney, urinary output must be maintained and increased if possible; intravenous fluids may be indicated. Because of atropine-induced photophobia, the room should be darkened.

A benzodiazepine may be needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. However, large doses for sedation should be avoided because the central nervous system depressant effect may coincide with the depressant effect occurring late in severe atropine poisoning. Barbiturates are potentiated by the anticholinesterases; therefore, barbiturates should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions. Central nervous system stimulants are not recommended.

### The use of propofol for procedural sedation in emergency departments [^113Bdicm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There is increasing evidence that propofol is efficacious and safe for procedural sedation (PS) in the emergency department (ED) setting. However, propofol has a narrow therapeutic window and lacks of a reversal agent. The aim of this review was to cohere the evidence base regarding the efficacy and safety profile of propofol when used in the ED setting for PS.

Objectives

To identify and evaluate all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing propofol with alternative drugs (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, etomidate and ketamine) used in the ED setting for PS.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1950 to September week 2 2013) and EMBASE (1980 to week 2 2013). We searched the Current Controlled Trials metaRegister of Clinical Trials (compiled by Current Science) (September 2013). We checked the reference lists of trials and contacted trial authors. We imposed no language restriction. We re-ran the search in February 2015. We will deal with the one study awaiting classification when we update the review.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing propofol to alternative drugs (benzodiazepines, barbiturates, etomidate and ketamine) used in the ED setting for PS in participants of all ages.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently performed data extraction. Two authors performed trial quality assessment. We used mean difference (MD), odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to measure effect sizes. Two authors independently assessed and rated the methodological quality of each trial using The Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias.

Main Results

Ten studies (813 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Two studies only included participants 18 years and younger; six studies only included participants 18 years and older; one study included participants between 16 and 65 years of age and one study included only adults but did not specify the age range. Eight of the included studies had a high risk of bias. The included studies were clinically heterogeneous. We undertook no meta-analysis. The primary outcome measures of this review were: adverse effects (as defined by the study authors) and participant satisfaction (as defined by the study authors). In one study comparing propofol/fentanyl with ketamine/midazolam, delayed adverse reactions (nightmares and behavioural change) were noted in 10% of the ketamine/midazolam group and none in the propofol/fentanyl group. Seven individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in adverse effects between intravenous propofol, with and without adjunctive analgesic agents, and alternative interventions. Three individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in pain at the injection site between intravenous propofol and alternative interventions. Four individual studies reported no evidence of a difference in participant satisfaction between intravenous propofol, with and without adjunctive analgesic agents, and alternative interventions (ketamine, etomidate, midazolam). All the studies employed propofol without the use of an adjunctive analgesic and all, except one, were small (fewer than 100 participants) studies. The quality of evidence for the adverse effects and participant satisfaction outcomes was very low. Nine included studies (eight comparisons) reported all the secondary outcome measures of the review except mortality. It was not possible to pool the results of the included studies for any of the secondary outcome measures because the comparator interventions were different and the measures were reported in different ways. Seven individual studies reported no evidence of difference in incidence of hypoxia between intravenous propofol, with and without adjunctive analgesic agents, and alternative interventions.

Authors' Conclusions

No firm conclusions can be drawn concerning the comparative effects of administering intravenous propofol, with or without an adjunctive analgesic agent, with alternative interventions in participants undergoing PS in the ED setting on adverse effects (including pain at the injection site) and participant satisfaction. The review was limited because no two included studies employed the same comparator interventions, and because the number of participants in eight of the included studies were small (fewer than 100 participants).

### Abnormal pupillary activity in a brainstem-dead patient [^11696Kki]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

The pupils in brainstem-dead patients are classically fixed and dilated. We present a case of a brainstem-dead patient whose pupils displayed persistent asynchronous pupillary constriction and dilatation independent of external physical stimuli. Central causes for the phenomenon were excluded leaving an unexplained peripheral cause as the most likely explanation. Early recognition of this phenomenon prevents delay in the diagnosis of brainstem death, lessening to some extent the distress for the family, and facilitating earlier organ donation and allowing the better use of resources.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Symptoms

Manifestations of atropine overdose are dose-related and include flushing, dry skin and mucous membranes, tachycardia, widely dilated pupils that are poorly responsive to light, blurred vision, and fever (which can sometimes be dangerously elevated). Locomotor difficulties, disorientation, hallucinations, delirium, confusion, agitation, coma, and central depression can occur and may last 48 hours or longer. In instances of severe atropine intoxication, respiratory depression, coma, circulatory collapse, and death may occur.

Treatment

For atropine overdose, supportive treatment should be administered. If respiration is depressed, artificial respiration with oxygen is necessary. Ice bags, a hypothermia blanket, or other methods of cooling may be required to reduce atropine-induced fever, especially in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Catheterization may be necessary if urinary retention occurs. Since atropine elimination takes place through the kidney, urinary output must be maintained and increased if possible: intravenous fluids may be indicated. Because of atropine-induced photophobia, the room should be darkened.

A benzodiazepine may be needed to control marked excitement and convulsions. However, large doses for sedation should be avoided because the central nervous system depressant effect may coincide with the depressant effect occurring late in severe atropine poisoning. Barbiturates are potentiated by the anticholinesterases; therefore, barbiturates should be used cautiously in the treatment of convulsions. Central nervous system stimulants are not recommended.

### Why you may need a neurologist to see a comatose patient in the ICU [^1152E5Kp]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Neurologic examination is more than a coma scale

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a trauma tool and has made a major difference in communication to neurosurgeons. The GCS is not a neurologic examination. Important elements in neurologic examinations, such as spontaneous eye movements, brainstem-reflex testing, and assessment of abnormal movements and tone, are not included, and these assessments are potentially relevant. The reliability of the GCS is questionable. Alternatively, the FOUR Score provides considerably more useful information but is also not a full neurologic examination of the comatose patient. Many subtleties may swing one way or another, but initially in a comatose patient, the motor responses and brainstem reflexes can be considered together and lead to decisions on tests that narrow the probable causes of coma If any, it is crucial to identify an embolus to the basilar artery which can be removed endovascularly (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Initial thoughts on coma in the ICU. This algorithm is a simplification of clinical practice. Localization and withdrawal motor responses are most probably not associated with brainstem involvement, and therefore the dichotomy is made. Once abnormal brainstem reflexes are found, two options are likely — acute hemispheric mass or acute brainstem lesion. Bihemispheric injury is structural or physiological and further differentiated into specific locations and suggestions for tests. ABG arterial blood gas, CSF cerebrospinal fluid, CT computed tomography, CTA computed tomography angiography, EEG electroencephalogram, SAH Subarachnoid hemorrhage

Confounders are found everywhere

Evaluating coma has not become any easier. The analgosedative protocols have improved care but have not been "friendly" to neurologists. Drugs linger particularly in patients treated with targeted temperature management or in those with multiorgan failure. Neurologists can determine whether certain signs are more suggestive of new structural injury than drug-induced dysfunction. It is no exaggeration to say that most misjudgments of coma occur when there has been prior drug use or sedation.

Not all pupils are alike

Most literature compares clinical examination of pupillary reflex with quantitative pupillometry (often comparing nursing staff with a device), but ICU studies fail to describe pupil size with pupil light reflex such as mid-position pupils or, the most important localizing finding, anisocoria. We care less about very wide or pinpoint pupils. Extremely wide pupils often respond and are medication induced. Pinpoint pupils often do not respond, artifactually, and are also commonly opioid related.

### Pupillary dysfunction during hypothermic circulatory arrest: insights from automated pupillometry [^1132n3M1]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Summary of different neurophysiological parameters, according to different body temperatures

SACP Selective antegrade cerebral perfusion; NPi Neurologic Pupil Index; PSI Patient state index; rSO₂ Regional brain saturation

After the placement of SACP, left and right rSO₂ were 58 and 59%, respectively; the PSI value was 1 (i.e. suppressed EEG), and left and right NPi were 1.2 and 1.5, respectively. During the rewarming phase, left and right NPi increased to 4.0 and 4.0 at 28 °C, with an EEG still suppressed, and eventually to 4.1 and 4.8, respectively, at 35 °C. Following the surgery, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation after 16 h. No postoperative delirium or new neurological dysfunction was observed. On the third day of ICU admission, the patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery ward for continued care.

This represents the first case report of extremely low NPi values observed during hypothermic circulatory arrest for aortic arch surgery, without any associated brain injury. The relationship between hypothermia and the observed results remains uncertain. As NPi values are insensitive to propofol and fentanyl, the substantial decrease in NPi values might be attributed to either reduced body temperature or suppressed neuronal activity. However, the NPi increased while the EEG background remained suppressed, suggesting that hypothermia is the most plausible explanation for our findings. Hypothermia is known to cause an increase in pupillary size with bilateral mydriasis; however, these results were obtained in healthy individuals undergoing eye surface cooling and no NPi was assessed. In cardiac arrest survivors treated with hypothermia at temperatures between 33 and 36 °C, low NPi values were associated with other predictors of poor outcomes, implying that abnormal NPi may be indicative of brain injury within this range of body temperatures. During cardiac surgery without profound hypothermia and SACP, pupil dilatation (17–53%) was observed, which was unaffected using fentanyl.

### Approach to anisocoria in the emergency department [^115J2f66]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Anisocoria describes asymmetric pupillary diameter, which can result from traumatic, pharmacologic, inflammatory, or ischemic effects on the eye. In many cases, anisocoria represents a normal physiologic variant. Morbidity associated with anisocoria is directly related to the inciting cause and can vary from benign to life-threatening. A thorough understanding by emergency physicians of normal ocular neuroanatomy, and of common causes of pathologic anisocoria, including medication-induced anisocoria, can facilitate appropriate resource utilization and timely subspecialty consultation, and can help prevent irreversible ocular injury and patient morbidity. We describe a patient who presented to the emergency department with acute onset of blurry vision with anisocoria.

### Effect of asphyxia on the pupils of brain dead subjects [^117CToNx]. Resuscitation (2002). Low credibility.

The pupils dilate following cardiac arrest but the mechanism is unknown. If pupillary dilation represents inadequate blood supply to the midbrain, pupil size might be a rough guide to the adequacy of the resuscitation effort. The brain dead organ harvest patient presents a unique opportunity to study pupillary activity in the absence of an intact midbrain and to examine the effects of asphyxia on the pupil. Because the midbrain is dead in these subjects, the pupil has no supraspinal autonomic control and following aortic cross clamp, no blood can be delivered to the orbit. Ten brain dead patients scheduled for organ harvest were studied. Pupil size was measured from the right eye every minute for 9 min before and every minute for 10 min following aortic cross-clamp. Dapiprazole eye drops were instilled into the left eye at least 1 h before cross clamp in five cases and pupillary measurements were intermittently taken before and after cross clamp. Pupil size was stable before cross clamp. Following cross clamp, the pupil dilated in all cases, reaching 10.6 mm in one case. Mean dilation was 1.8 ± 0.9 mm. Time to peak dilation was 4.3 ± 1.4 min and latency of dilation was 1.4 ± 1.2 min. Dapiprazole eye drops prevented the pupillary dilation in contralateral eye of the five cases in which it was used. The cause of this sympathetic activity is either a short burst of neuronal activity in the peripheral sympathetic system innervating the dilator muscle, or release of stored norepinephine from the presynaptic terminals, as asphyxia intervenes.

### The pupillary light-off reflex in acute disorders of consciousness [^113XLQxa]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, in terms of pathophysiology, future research must meticulously investigate the effects of opioids and general anesthesia on the pupillary light-off reflex and how this reflex may reemerge (or not) when sedation is stopped in people with acute brain injury. Opioids appear effective in blocking pupillary reflex dilation (which is not the same as the pupillary light-off reflex) without altering the light reflex. As opioids block inhibitory pathways into the Edinger–Westphal nucleus, do unresponsive patients lack a pupillary light-off reflex because of the drugs or because of central nervous system injury? Of the seven unresponsive patients with a preserved pupillary light-off reflex, four received high to very high levels of sedation, showing that at least in a subset of sedated patients the pupillary light-off reflex remains intact. Complicating this matter further, however, tolerance to the effects of opioids on the pupil does occur. The effects of opioids on the pupillary light-off reflex after brain injury may thus change over time and perhaps with the etiology of the brain injury. Although we accounted for sedation in the statistical analysis, all these considerations must be addressed by replication studies with serial pupillary measurements of DoC cohorts with large enough numbers to account for the heterogeneity of sedation and brain injury etiologies.

### Effect of an educational intervention on therapeutic inertia in neurologists with expertise in multiple sclerosis: a randomized clinical trial [^111Sogme]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Experimental Procedures

The study was conducted in an ambulatory clinic–type setting to increase ecological validity. Room temperature, light conditions (100 lumens), and participant sitting positions were held constant. We calculated z scores for pupil time-series scored within each participant to allow comparison of pupil dilation between and within simulated case scenarios, critical periods, and participants. The mean pupil size (measured at T0, ie, 1500 ms - 500 ms before scenario onset) was taken as pupil baseline. For each simulated case scenario, we estimated autonomic arousal responses by subtracting the mean baseline pupil diameter from the peak pupil dilation during each critical period (T1-T3) (Figure 2 B). Further details are available in the eAppendix in Supplement 2.

Sample Size

Our study was underpowered to evaluate differences in TI between groups. The observed 15.5% absolute difference between groups (unadjusted results)would require a sample size of a minimum of 78 participants per group with an α = .05 and β = .2. The power to determine differences in phasic pupil response in relation to TI was 99%.

### Pupil-linked arousal signals track the temporal organization of events in memory [^1129PMDG]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We find that distinct temporal characteristics of pupil responses to event boundaries lead to changes in subjective (time dilation) and objective (impaired recency discrimination) aspects of temporal memory. Trial-level analyses reveal that greater variability in pupil diameter over more prolonged periods of time is also associated with these segmentation-like effects in memory. We conclude that dynamic fluctuations in pupil-linked arousal states may track multiple mental processes that promote the formation of discrete episodic memories.

### Prognostication in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest: an advisory statement from the European Resuscitation Council and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^111B5huQ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Recommendations

We recommend:
Using the bilateral absence of both pupillary and corneal reflexes at 72 h or more from ROSC to predict poor outcome in comatose survivors from cardiac arrest, either TH-treated or non-TH-treated.
Prolonging observation of clinical signs beyond 72 h when interference from residual sedation or paralysis is suspected, so that the possibility of obtaining false positive results is minimised.

We do not suggest using an absent or extensor motor response to pain (M ≤ 2) alone to predict poor outcome in those patients, given its high false positive rate. However, due to its high sensitivity, this sign may be used to identify the population with poor neurological status needing prognostication or to predict poor outcome in combination with other more robust predictors.

Knowledge gaps

Prospective studies are needed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of sedative drugs and neuromuscular blocking drugs in post-cardiac arrest patients, especially those treated with controlled temperature.
Clinical studies are needed to evaluate the reproducibility of clinical signs used to predict outcome in comatose post-arrest patients. In particular, clinical examination tends to underestimate the presence of pupillary reflex, which can be detected and quantified using pupillometry.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) ocular examination — components and dilation considerations: Perform an ocular motility, confrontational visual fields, pupil status, and a careful "front-to-back" examination on each child with suspected AHT, and use a portable slit lamp or other form of illuminated magnification to evaluate anterior segment structures. A dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy is performed in cases of suspected AHT unless a child is considered to be at very low risk for retinal hemorrhages (e.g., no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, normal mental status, and no bruising of the head or face). Give serious consideration regarding the need for a dilated fundus exam in a child at low risk for retinal hemorrhages. Retinal hemorrhages in AHT victims typically involve the posterior pole that can be viewed with the direct ophthalmoscope. Mydriatic drugs are commonly used to dilate the pupils in children, but infants less than age 3 months may have adverse effects associated with systemic absorption.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reactions may include xerostomia; urinary hesitancy and retention; blurred vision; tachycardia; palpitation; mydriasis; cycloplegia; increased ocular tension; loss of taste sense; headache; nervousness; drowsiness; weakness; dizziness; insomnia; nausea; vomiting; impotence; suppression of lactation; constipation; bloated feeling; musculoskeletal pain; severe allergic reaction or drug idiosyncrasies, including anaphylaxis, urticaria and other dermal manifestations; and decreased sweating.

Acquired hypersensitivity to barbiturates consists chiefly in allergic reactions that occur especially in persons who tend to have asthma, urticaria, angioedema and similar conditions. Hypersensitivity reactions in this category include localized swelling, particularly of the eyelids, cheeks, or lips, and erythematous dermatitis. Rarely, exfoliative dermatitis (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) may be caused by phenobarbital and can prove fatal. The skin eruption may be associated with fever, delirium, and marked degenerative changes in the liver and other parenchymatous organs. In a few cases, megaloblastic anemia has been associated with the chronic use of phenobarbital.

Phenobarbital may produce excitement in some patients, rather than a sedative effect. In patients habituated to barbiturates, abrupt withdrawal may produce delirium or convulsions.

### Dynamic threat-reward neural processing under semi-naturalistic ecologically relevant scenarios [^112v8HtK]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

This constitutes a limitation of our experimental paradigm, as there was no true "safe" period to compare to the threat periods. Given the desire to collect monetary dots while simultaneously avoiding the ghost threats, participants were often in close proximity to environmental threats. Although the co‐occurrence of environmental threats and rewards was intentional, it did not enable participants to seek shelter and wait for opportune moments to seek the dots. Future work will be needed to assess threat and reward processing under semi‐naturalistic scenarios where a safe space or period of time is present, to more fully encompass the range of contexts in a natural environment.

Finally, while the use of continuous variables as predictors in a GLM used to model BOLD signals is not new, it is only common in specific fields where continuous measures are taken, and thus may be unfamiliar. One particularly good example is correlating continuous measures of pupil dilation with BOLD signal (Schneider et al; Yellin et al.). To do this, the dilation measure is resampled at the BOLD acquisition rate and then convolved with the HRF. This is the same treatment given to the extended predictors in our models. Despite the precedent set by work with pupil dilation, it is possible that the assumption of linearity of the BOLD signal may have been violated in our analyses. We think this is unlikely for the following reasons. As pointed out in previous articles (Monti; Poline & Brett,) the GLM may not be an ideal model for fMRI analyses and assumptions of the GLM are often violated. The most pertinent question, however, is whether those violations produce false positives. In Monti's treatment of linearity assumptions, he notes that convolution with the HRF in cases of violation of linearity produces a model that expects larger signals than are actually produced. In general, poor model fits produce weak inferential statistics, which increases false negatives. In the specific case of a model that expects smaller signals than are actually produced, some false positives could result. However, with a model that expects larger signals than are actually produced, only false negatives can result. Given the robustness of our findings, we find it unlikely that our models are producing a preponderance of false negatives, which suggests that the model fits were satisfactory, which further suggests that assumptions of linearity were unlikely to have been violated.

### Pupil… [^117N4tNj]. Wikipedia (2002). Low credibility.

The iris contains two groups of smooth muscles; a circular group called the sphincter pupillae, and a radial group called the dilator pupillae. When the sphincter pupillae contract, the iris decreases or constricts the size of the pupil. The dilator pupillae, innervated by sympathetic nerves from the superior cervical ganglion, cause the pupil to dilate when they contract. These muscles are sometimes referred to as intrinsic eye muscles. Effect of light The pupil gets wider in the dark and narrower in light. When narrow, the diameter be 1. 5 to 4 millimeters. In the dark it will be the same at first, but will approach the maximum distance for a wide pupil 3 to 8 mm. However, in any human age group there is considerable variation in maximal pupil size. For example, at the peak age of 15, the dark-adapted pupil can vary from 4 mm to 9 mm with different individuals. After 25 years of age, the average pupil size decreases, though not at a steady rate.

At this stage the pupils do not remain completely still, therefore may lead to oscillation, which may intensify and become known as hippus. The constriction of the pupil and near vision are closely tied. In bright light, the pupils constrict to prevent aberrations of light rays and thus attain their expected acuity; in the dark, this is not necessary, so it is chiefly concerned with admitting sufficient light into the eye. When bright light is shone on the eye, light-sensitive cells in the retina, including rod and cone photoreceptors and melanopsin ganglion cells, will send signals to the oculomotor nerve, specifically the parasympathetic part coming from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, which terminates on the circular iris sphincter muscle. When this muscle contracts, it reduces the size of the pupil. This is the pupillary light reflex, which is an important test of brainstem function. Furthermore, the pupil will dilate if a person sees an object of interest.

Clinical significance Effect of drugs If the drug pilocarpine is administered, the pupils will constrict and accommodation is increased due to the parasympathetic action on the circular muscle fibers, conversely, atropine will cause paralysis of accommodation and dilation of the pupil. Certain drugs cause constriction of the pupils, such as opioids. Other drugs, such as atropine, LSD, MDMA, mescaline, psilocybin mushrooms, cocaine and amphetamines may cause pupil dilation. The sphincter muscle has a parasympathetic innervation, and the dilator has a sympathetic innervation. In pupillary constriction induced by pilocarpine, not only is the sphincter nerve supply activated but that of the dilator is inhibited. The reverse is true, so control of pupil size is controlled by differences in contraction intensity of each muscle. Another term for the constriction of the pupil is miosis. Substances that cause miosis are described as miotic.

Dilation of the pupil is mydriasis. Dilation can be caused by mydriatic substances such as an eye drop solution containing tropicamide. Diseases A condition called bene dilitatism occurs when the optic nerves are partially damaged. This condition is typified by chronically widened pupils due to the decreased ability of the optic nerves to respond to light. In normal lighting, people affected by this condition normally have dilated pupils, and bright lighting can cause pain. At the other end of the spectrum, people with this condition have trouble seeing in darkness. It is necessary for these people to be especially careful when driving at night due to their inability to see objects in their full perspective. This condition is not otherwise dangerous. Not all variations in size are indicative of disease however. In addition to dilation and contraction caused by light and darkness, it has been shown that solving simple multiplication problems affects the size of the pupil.

### Very-high-dose phenobarbital for childhood refractory status epilepticus [^112FZnr3]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

This report describes the management of three children, ranging in age from 7 to 9 years, who had refractory status epilepticus. This condition was likely the result of viral encephalitis; it manifested initially as generalized tonic-clonic seizure and later frequent subtle eye staring and twitching of mouth or limbs as well as tachycardia and dilatation of pupils. The seizures were not responsive to treatment with conventional doses of intravenous phenobarbital, phenytoin, and midazolam infusion. Very-high-dose phenobarbital was administered at accumulated daily doses up to 80 mg/kg, with a resulting serum level of more than 1000 mumol/L. It was effective in achieving seizure control, with milder adverse effects compared with thiopental infusion.

### Pupillary dynamics as a marker of acute cannabis inhalation [^111pYHqQ]. Clinical Toxicology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute cannabis use has been found to affect pupil size and pupillary dynamics. Law enforcement may consider ocular changes in their examinations to determine drug impairment and the source, including from cannabis. A limited number of studies have used pupillometer technology to provide an objective measure of pupillary changes associated with cannabis use. The purpose of the study was to examine the sensitivity and specificity of pupil size and dynamics, measured with a pupillometer, associated with recent cannabis inhalation.

Methods

Participants (n = 126) completed a pupillometer assessment, using the NeurOptics PLR-3000 at three times. Of the 126 participants, 95 completed assessments at baseline, and at 40min and 100min following 15min of ad libitum inhalation of self-provided cannabis flower or concentrate products. Thirty-one participants completed the same assessments without using cannabis. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated for pupil size and dynamics measures associated with recent cannabis use versus no use, for both post-use time points. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator models were used to identify the combination of ocular metrics that were most predictive and parsimonious.

Results

Following cannabis use, the pupillary measure with the highest area under the curve was percent change in pupil size, which decreased after cannabis use, with an area under the curve of 0.73 at 40min and 0.75 at 100min following cannabis use. Considering variables together in a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model did not meaningfully improve prediction over individual measures.

Discussion

Consistent with some prior studies, we did not find that cannabis use was associated with substantial and consistent change in the maximum pupil size (measured in darkness) relative to controls. However, diminished pupil dynamics, such as constriction in response to light and recovery dilation, were more predictive of recent cannabis use, consistent with limited prior studies.

Conclusions

Pupillary dynamics, when measured with an objective test, may contribute to providing an indication of recent cannabis inhalation.

Pupils — Pupillary assessment involves eliciting direct and consensual responses to light on both sides, checking for an afferent pupillary defect, and examining the response to accommodation. The swinging light test is used to evaluate for an afferent pupillary defect: have the patient fixate on an object at least 10 feet away and shine a bright light on one eye from slightly below, then swing the light between eyes; a normal response is that the pupil maintains a similar size, and dilation of one pupil indicates an afferent pupillary defect. The response to accommodation is assessed by alternately looking between the same 10-foot target and a second target 6 inches from the face while illuminating both pupils from below.

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including clomipramine may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.

Seizures

During premarket evaluation, seizure was identified as the most significant risk of clomipramine use.

The observed cumulative incidence of seizures among patients exposed to clomipramine at doses up to 300 mg/day was 0.64% at 90 days, 1.12% at 180 days, and 1.45% at 365 days. The cumulative rates correct the crude rate of 0.7%, (25 of 3519 patients) for the variable duration of exposure in clinical trials.

Although dose appears to be a predictor of seizure, there is a confounding of dose and duration of exposure, making it difficult to assess independently the effect of either factor alone. The ability to predict the occurrence of seizures in subjects exposed to doses of CMI greater than 250 mg is limited, given that the plasma concentration of CMI may be dose-dependent and may vary among subjects given the same dose. Nevertheless, prescribers are advised to limit the daily dose to a maximum of 250 mg in adults and 3 mg/kg (or 200 mg) in children and adolescents (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Caution should be used in administering clomipramine to patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing factors, e.g., brain damage of varying etiology, alcoholism, and concomitant use with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold.

Rare reports of fatalities in association with seizures have been reported by foreign postmarketing surveillance, but not in U.S. clinical trials. In some of these cases, clomipramine had been administered with other epileptogenic agents; in others, the patients involved had possibly predisposing medical conditions. Thus a causal association between clomipramine treatment and these fatalities has not been established.

Physicians should discuss with patients the risk of taking clomipramine while engaging in activities in which sudden loss of consciousness could result in serious injury to the patient or others, e.g., the operation of complex machinery, driving, swimming, climbing.

DRESS

Rare cases of drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported with the use of clomipramine. In the event of severe acute reactions such as DRESS, discontinue clomipramine therapy immediately and institute appropriate treatment.

### Validity of simple measurement to diagnose pupillary dilation [^115Pvm7e]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The aim of the study was to compare the validity of 3 methods of detecting pupillary dilation: bright-light measurement, room-light measurement, and gestalt judgment.

Methods

In reach volunteer, by random assignment, placebo was instilled in one eye and dilute phenylephrine in the other. Emergency care providers judged whether each pupil was dilated and measured it in bright light (> 54,000 lux) and in room light (2700–5400 lux) while the other eye was covered. Test characteristics for measurement were determined according to published cut-points, and measurement methods were compared using receiver operating curve analysis.

Results

There were 136 pupillary assessments-68 in placebo and 68 in phenylephrine eyes. Compared with gestalt judgment, bright-light measurement had higher specificity (0.94 vs 0.68) but lower sensitivity (0.43 vs 0.79). Bright-light measurement was more discriminating than room-light measurement.

Conclusion

Bright-light measurement has higher specificity, but lower sensitivity, than gestalt judgement, and is superior to room-light measurement.

### Pupillary response to light is preserved in the majority of patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation [^112pWYRk]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine whether pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade with succinylcholine or rocuronium during emergency rapid sequence intubation affects pupillary response to light.

Methods

This was a prospective case series of patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation between February 2008 and February 2009. Two blinded, independent emergency physicians assessed pupillary response after administration of neuromuscular blockade and intubation. Cases without pupillary response before rapid sequence intubation were excluded. The primary outcome measure was clinically observable pupillary response.

Results

We studied 94 patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation, including 67 (71%) receiving succinylcholine and 27 (31%) receiving rocuronium. Of patients receiving succinylcholine, 61 of 67 (91%; 95% confidence interval 82% to 97%) demonstrated pupillary response after rapid sequence intubation. All patients receiving rocuronium demonstrated preserved pupillary reflexes. κ For interobserver agreement was 0.66.

Conclusion

Succinylcholine and rocuronium do not appear to inhibit pupillary response in patients undergoing emergency department rapid sequence intubation.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest [^111nyCWo]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Of note, awakening from coma following cardiac arrest is variably defined in the literature as follows: a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score > 8; a Richmond Agitation Sedation Score > − 2; orientation to either person, situation, or place; and (most commonly) the ability to follow commands as documented by a GCS motor score of 6. "Early" awakening has also been variably defined: within 72 h from ROSC, 48 h from rewarming, 72 h from rewarming, 48 h from cessation of sedation, 5 days from ROSC, 7 days from ROSC, and 7 days from rewarming. Regardless of definition, patients who awaken early are more likely to have a good functional outcome at 3–6 months than patients who awaken late: 82–97% vs. 67–93%.

Good Practice Statement 2

We recommend that assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest be performed in the absence of sedation or other potential confounders (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded).

Rationale

Sedation will delay awakening following cardiac arrest, and waiting an appropriate length of time for sedation to clear may permit awakening and render neuroprognostication unnecessary. Sedation may also confound EEG, and the use of opioids may result in pupillary constriction, confounding the subjective evaluation of pupillary reactivity. The duration of sedative effect is dependent on medication half-life, duration of infusion, hepatic and renal function, drug interactions, patient age, temperature, and comorbidities, among others. The involvement of a clinical pharmacist may help clarify the expected duration of sedative effect in complex critically ill patients. Other factors that may confound the neurological examination and delay awakening following cardiac arrest include, but are not limited to, seizures, hypothermia, sepsis, renal failure, delirium, and hepatic encephalopathy. A defined time period of waiting cannot be recommended to cover all potential confounders. Instead, this time period must be individualized with careful consideration of all relevant factors. Some predictors, such as SSEP and quantitative pupillometry, may be less subject to confounding.

Good Practice Statement 3

We recommend that factors that impact overall prognosis, such as a poor baseline level of functioning, preexisting illness associated with limited life-expectancy, and multiorgan failure, be considered prior to, and distinct from, assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded).

### Modelling floppy iris syndrome and the impact of pupil size and ring devices on iris displacement [^116UHog7]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Specifics of modelling

Iris geometry and three-dimensional modelling

In our numerical model, the iris was modelled as an axisymmetric annular disc with a central aperture. According to previously published data, we assumed that a normal iris had a uniform thickness of T I = 0.34 mm, the pupil diameter was D P = 5 mm and the diameter of the iris external edge was 11 mm. A 7 mm dilated pupil diameter was used to mimic the addition of the Malyugin ring. Assuming volume conservation (due to material incompressibility), the thickness of the iris model was 0.3904 mm with the 7 mm Malyugin ring. A cylindrical coordinate system was adopted for the analysis, with its origin located at the centre of the outer circle of the iris model, and its radial direction R, azimuthal direction θ and longitudinal direction Z defined as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. A.

Iris properties

The material of the iris was assumed to be linear elastic and homogeneously orthotropic. To assist with the modelling, a Poisson's ratio of 0.499 was applied to ensure the iris was incompressible. Furthermore, the azimuthal elastic modulus E θ and radial elastic modulus E r were set to be 2.97 kPa, and 4.00 kPa, respectively. The other material properties, such as longitudinal modulus E z and the shear modulus G rz, G θz and G rθ, were determined using the previously described methodology.

Boundary and loading conditions

As the iris is anatomically attached to the ciliary body (i.e. secured at the peripheral boundary), the outer edge of the iris model was assumed to be fixed in all our simulations.

Testing scenarios

Initiation of iris buckling in normal iris (undilated and dilated)

In the first instance, assessment of the normal iris and subsequent buckling patterns following incremental loading pressures in the setting of undilated and dilated pupils was conducted without the inclusion of pupil expansion devices. The inner edge of the iris model was set free. A 10 mmHg base pressure was simultaneously applied on the upper and lower surfaces of the iris as well as the inner edge, which was then gradually increased with a constant increment of 1 mmHg to evaluate the potential buckling of the iris model. This method of testing, in conjunction with the iris properties, boundary and loading conditions provide a reduced model of the iris shape as a circular disc, secured peripherally with a central opening and enables comparison of size and magnitude of iris displacement under various testing conditions.

PRECAUTIONS:

General.

To avoid excessive systemic absorption, the lacrimal sac should be compressed by digital pressure for two to three minutes after installation. To avoid inducing angle closure glaucoma, an estimation of the depth of the angle of the anterior chamber should be made. Excessive topical use of this drug can potentially lead to a confusional state characterized by delirium, agitation, and rarely coma. This state is more apt to occur in the pediatric and geriatric age groups. The specific anti-dote for this systemic anticholinergic syndrome is injectable physostigmine salicylate.

Information to Patients.

Patient should be advised not to drive or engage in other hazardous activities while pupils are dilated. Patient may experience sensitivity to light and should protect eyes in bright illumination during dilation. Parents should be warned not to get this preparation in their child's mouth and to wash their own hands and the child's hands following administration. Do not touch dropper tip to any surface, as this may contaminate the solution.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest [^116sFNwB]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Good Practice Statement 4 — use a multimodal approach and the complete clinical scenario: We recommend that assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest be multimodal, with consideration of the complete clinical scenario, and never based on a single variable (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). As previously described, an element of uncertainty is inherent with neuroprognostication and therefore a thorough assessment should be performed in every patient; the use of multiple modalities of assessment, such as clinical examination, imaging, and electrophysiological studies, will mitigate the risk of error from a single modality, exemplified by questioning a subjective determination of nonreactive pupils in a patient with a withdrawal motor response, reactive EEG, and normal brain imaging at 72 h.
