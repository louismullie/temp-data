## Question

Initial work up for acute renal failure in a young male less than 50 years old?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the initial workup for acute renal failure (acute kidney injury) in a young male under 50 years old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and staging using KDIGO criteria. Then, I should verify the baseline creatinine and how to estimate it if unknown. Next, I will classify the etiology into prerenal, intrinsic, or postrenal, followed by a targeted history and exam. After that, I need to order core labs and urinalysis with indices, decide on imaging, and consider advanced diagnostics. Finally, I should outline immediate management, monitoring, and follow-up, while double-checking for pitfalls and special considerations in this population.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and stage severity using KDIGO criteria, because misclassification at the outset can derail management. AKI is defined by a rise in serum creatinine of at least 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, an increase to at least 1.5 times baseline within 7 days, or urine output less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours, and staging is based on the magnitude of creatinine rise or urine output decline, which guides urgency and actions [^afcc1436] [^4d498821].

> Wait, let me verify the baseline creatinine before I jump to conclusions about acuity. If a recent baseline is unavailable, I should estimate it using the MDRD equation assuming a GFR of 75 mL/min/1.73 m², but I need to ensure I adjust for age, sex, and race and then immediately evaluate for unrecognized CKD to avoid mislabeling chronic disease as acute, especially in a young male where baseline is often near 0.8–1.0 mg/dL [^b18d4161] [^84f05578] [^4c4b615d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without a structured framework. I should classify AKI into prerenal azotemia, intrinsic renal parenchymal injury, or postrenal obstruction because this directs testing and treatment; in young men, obstruction is less common but still essential to exclude early, and prerenal causes like volume depletion, NSAIDs, or ACEi/ARBs are frequent, while intrinsic causes include ATN, glomerulonephritis, interstitial nephritis, and vasculitis [^0eadb61b] [^3aed8928].

> I will now examine the history with a focus on exposures and systemic features. I need to check for nephrotoxic drugs such as NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, contrast, PPIs, and antihypertensives that affect renal hemodynamics, assess volume status and recent fluid losses, screen for infection or sepsis, and ask about rash, arthralgia, hematuria, or edema suggesting glomerulonephritis or vasculitis, while also noting any prior kidney disease, diabetes, or hypertension that would shift pretest probabilities [^0eadb61b] [^03899f8c].

> Next, I should review the physical examination carefully. I need to assess intravascular volume with orthostatics, jugular venous pressure, and mucous membranes, look for edema or pulmonary congestion, check for a palpable bladder or flank masses suggesting obstruction, and search for stigmata of systemic disease such as rash, joint swelling, or livedo reticularis that would push me toward glomerulonephritis or vasculitis [^0eadb61b] [^f38a4823].

> Let me think about the core laboratory evaluation. I should confirm serial serum creatinine and BUN to establish trajectory, obtain electrolytes including potassium and bicarbonate, a complete blood count to evaluate for anemia or infection, and urinalysis with microscopy to look for proteinuria, hematuria, dysmorphic RBCs, and casts. I should also calculate the fractional excretion of sodium if oliguria is present to help distinguish prerenal from intrinsic causes, keeping in mind that FENa is less reliable in diuretic use or CKD [^0eadb61b] [^03899f8c].

> I should double-check the imaging strategy because missing obstruction delays recovery. Renal ultrasound is the first-line test in essentially all patients with AKI to assess kidney size and echogenicity and to detect hydronephrosis, and I should obtain it urgently, ideally within 24 hours, and within 6 hours if I suspect pyonephrosis or high-grade obstruction, since early decompression can salvage function [^66588d09] [^f4de984a].

> But wait, what if ultrasound is negative and suspicion remains high. In that case, I need to consider CT urography or a noncontrast CT to identify stones, strictures, or retroperitoneal fibrosis, and I should remember that early obstruction may show minimal dilation, so clinical correlation is key and a low threshold for further imaging is warranted when the story fits [^145ef219].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to advanced diagnostics. If I see active urinary sediment with RBCs and RBC casts, proteinuria, or systemic features, I should order ANCA, anti-GBM antibodies, ANA, complement levels, hepatitis serologies, and consider HIV testing to evaluate for rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis or vasculitis, and if the cause remains unclear after noninvasive testing, I should consider kidney biopsy, particularly in stage 3 AKI or suspected intrinsic disease [^623164e1] [^0eadb61b].

> I need to ensure immediate management addresses reversible factors while I continue the workup. That means stopping nephrotoxins, correcting volume status with isotonic crystalloids if prerenal or using diuretics if volume overloaded, treating electrolyte disturbances such as hyperkalemia, and avoiding hyperglycemia. I should also adjust drug dosing to current kidney function and avoid radiocontrast when possible, documenting risk–benefit if contrast is unavoidable [^0eadb61b] [^03899f8c] [^ba8b2e2b].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring cadence and triggers for escalation. Frequent creatinine and urine output checks, typically every 12–24 hours initially, allow early detection of progression, and I should involve nephrology for stage 3 AKI, uncertain diagnosis, suspected glomerulonephritis, need for renal replacement therapy, or preexisting CKD, while planning follow-up to assess for resolution or new CKD at about 3 months [^0eadb61b] [^750cc830] [^38a8b487].

> Let me reconsider special pitfalls in this population. Young men may have higher muscle mass, so a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL could represent normal baseline rather than CKD, and I should be cautious not to overcall chronicity. Conversely, a small rise from 0.8 to 1.1 mg/dL may actually reflect a significant GFR decline and should not be dismissed, and I should also remember that community-acquired AKI is common and often underrecognized, so a low threshold for evaluation is prudent [^84f05578] [^4cb4ce99].

> In summary, I should confirm AKI with KDIGO criteria, establish baseline creatinine thoughtfully, classify the mechanism with history, exam, urinalysis, and FENa, obtain prompt renal ultrasound to exclude obstruction, add targeted serologies and consider biopsy when indicated, and implement immediate supportive measures while arranging close monitoring and structured follow-up to detect nonrecovery and CKD risk [^afcc1436] [^0eadb61b] [^66588d09] [^26d69f51].

The initial workup for acute renal failure in a young male (< 50 years) should be **structured and rapid** to identify reversible causes and prevent progression. Start with a focused history (recent illness, medications, trauma, urinary symptoms), exam (volume status, rash, joint pain), and **core labs** (serum creatinine/BUN, electrolytes, CBC, urinalysis with microscopy, and urine electrolytes/creatinine for FeNa/FeUrea) [^0eadb61b] [^03899f8c]. Obtain a **renal ultrasound within 24 hours** to exclude obstruction, assess kidney size, and guide next steps [^66588d09] [^f4de984a]. If ultrasound is inconclusive and obstruction is suspected, proceed to CT urography or MRI [^3fb7fdb7]. Early nephrology input is indicated for stage 3 AKI, uncertain diagnosis, or suspected glomerulonephritis/vasculitis [^0eadb61b].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough history and physical examination are essential to identify **risk factors and potential causes** of ARF [^0eadb61b].

Key historical elements include:

- **Recent illnesses**: Infections, fevers, sore throat, skin infections, gastrointestinal illness, or respiratory symptoms [^notfound].
- **Medication use**: NSAIDs, antibiotics (e.g. aminoglycosides), ACE inhibitors, ARBs, diuretics, contrast exposure, or illicit drugs [^03899f8c].
- **Trauma or surgery**: Recent procedures, crush injuries, or rhabdomyolysis.
- **Urinary symptoms**: Dysuria, hematuria, flank pain, or oliguria/anuria.
- **Systemic symptoms**: Rash, joint pain, edema, or hypertension suggesting glomerulonephritis or vasculitis [^notfound].

Physical examination should assess:

- **Volume status**: Hypovolemia or hypervolemia (jugular venous pressure, edema, lung crackles) [^03899f8c].
- **Abdomen**: Flank tenderness, palpable bladder, or masses.
- **Skin**: Rash, purpura, or livedo reticularis suggesting vasculitis.
- **Joints**: Swelling or tenderness suggesting systemic autoimmune disease.

---

## Laboratory evaluation

Laboratory tests are critical to confirm ARF, assess severity, and identify the **underlying cause**:

| **Test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|
| Serum creatinine and BUN | Confirm ARF, assess severity, and monitor progression [^afcc1436] |
| Electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO3) | Identify electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis) [^0eadb61b] |
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Detect anemia, infection, or bleeding [^03899f8c] |
| Urinalysis with microscopy | Identify proteinuria, hematuria, casts, and infection [^614c0619] |
| Urine electrolytes and creatinine | Calculate FeNa and FeUrea to differentiate prerenal from intrinsic renal failure [^0eadb61b] |
| Serum calcium, phosphate, and uric acid | Identify metabolic complications of ARF [^notfound] |

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging is essential to exclude obstruction and assess renal structure. Renal ultrasound is the **first-line imaging modality** and should be obtained within 24 hours in most patients with ARF [^66588d09] [^f4de984a]. It evaluates kidney size, echogenicity, and hydronephrosis. If ultrasound is inconclusive and obstruction remains suspected, CT urography or MRI can provide detailed anatomical information [^notfound].

---

## Indications for nephrology consultation

Early nephrology consultation is recommended in the following scenarios:

- **Stage 3 AKI**: Serum creatinine ≥ 3.0 times baseline or ≥ 4.0 mg/dL, or urine output < 0.3 mL/kg/h for ≥ 24 hours or anuria for ≥ 12 hours [^4d498821].
- **Uncertain diagnosis**: Suspected glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or interstitial nephritis [^623164e1].
- **Need for renal replacement therapy**: Refractory hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, volume overload, or uremic symptoms [^f38a4823].
- **Progressive AKI**: Rising creatinine despite supportive measures [^0eadb61b].

---

## Summary of initial workup

- **Confirm ARF**: Serum creatinine/BUN, urinalysis, and urine output monitoring [^afcc1436].
- **Identify cause**: History, physical exam, urinalysis, and FeNa/FeUrea [^0eadb61b].
- **Exclude obstruction**: Renal ultrasound within 24 hours [^f4de984a].
- **Assess complications**: Electrolytes, acid-base status, and CBC [^03899f8c].
- **Early nephrology**: For severe AKI, uncertain diagnosis, or suspected glomerulonephritis/vasculitis [^0eadb61b].

---

The initial workup for ARF in a young male should be **comprehensive and timely**, integrating history, examination, laboratory tests, and imaging to rapidly identify reversible causes and guide management.

### Acute kidney injury: a guide to diagnosis and management [^f38a4823]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury is characterized by abrupt deterioration in kidney function, manifested by an increase in serum creatinine level with or without reduced urine output. The spectrum of injury ranges from mild to advanced, sometimes requiring renal replacement therapy. The diagnostic evaluation can be used to classify acute kidney injury as prerenal, intrinsic renal, or postrenal. The initial workup includes a patient history to identify the use of nephrotoxic medications or systemic illnesses that might cause poor renal perfusion or directly impair renal function. Physical examination should assess intravascular volume status and identify skin rashes indicative of systemic illness. The initial laboratory evaluation should include measurement of serum creatinine level, complete blood count, urinalysis, and fractional excretion of sodium. Ultrasonography of the kidneys should be performed in most patients, particularly in older men, to rule out obstruction. Management of acute kidney injury involves fluid resuscitation, avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and contrast media exposure, and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) is indicated for refractory hyperkalemia; volume overload; intractable acidosis; uremic encephalopathy, pericarditis, or pleuritis; and removal of certain toxins. Recognition of risk factors (e.g., older age, sepsis, hypovolemia/shock, cardiac surgery, infusion of contrast agents, diabetes mellitus, preexisting chronic kidney disease, cardiac failure, liver failure) is important. Team-based approaches for prevention, early diagnosis, and aggressive management are critical for improving outcomes.

Conclusion

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome defined by a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output as per KDIGO classification. Future definitions are likely to incorporate novel functional and damage biomarkers to characterise AKI better. Early diagnosis and appropriate diagnostic work-up are essential to determine the underlying aetiology and to identify cases of AKI that require specific and timely therapeutic interventions. The exact diagnostic investigations depend on the clinical context and should include routine baseline tests as well as more specific and novel tools.

Diagnosis of acute kidney disease

AKI is defined as occurring over 7 days and CKD starts when kidney disease has persisted for more than 90 days. Based on epidemiological studies and histological case series, it is clear that some patients have a slow but persistent (creeping) rise in serum creatinine over days or weeks but do not strictly fulfil the consensus criteria for AKI. To classify this phase between the early stage of AKI (first 7 days) and the onset of CKD (beyond 3 months), the KDIGO expert group proposed the term "acute kidney disease" (AKD) and suggested the following criteria: a GFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² for < 3 months, a decrease in GFR by ≥ 35%, and an increase in serum creatinine by > 50% for < 3 months or evidence of structural kidney damage for < 3 months. These criteria are currently under revision (personal communication with the ADQI group).

Acute kidney injury is a clinical problem of growing incidence in hospitalized patients. It increases the risk of poor outcomes, length of stay and the cost of hospitalization. Successful management of acute kidney injury requires early recognition and diagnosis through detailed medical history, careful physical exam, judicious use of laboratory and radiologic tests and timely renal consultation. Subsequent management is tailored to the likely mechanism of injury with emphasis on limiting both further injury and systemic consequences. A common sense approach to acute kidney injury is essential for hospitalists aiming to limit further injury, prevent acute complications and lessen the risk of chronic morbidity.

### Acute kidney injury: diagnosis and management [^0eadb61b]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate and resultant accumulation of metabolic waste products. Acute kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular events, and progression to chronic kidney disease. Severity of acute kidney injury is classified according to urine output and elevations in creatinine level. Etiologies of acute kidney injury are categorized as prerenal, intrinsic renal, and postrenal. Accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause is key to successful management and includes a focused history and physical examination, serum and urine electrolyte measurements, and renal ultrasonography when risk factors for a postrenal cause are present (e.g., older male with prostatic hypertrophy). General management principles for acute kidney injury include determination of volume status, fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid, treatment of volume overload with diuretics, discontinuation of nephrotoxic medications, and adjustment of prescribed drugs according to renal function. Additional supportive care measures may include optimizing nutritional status and glycemic control. Pharmacist-led quality-improvement programs reduce nephrotoxic exposures and rates of acute kidney injury in the hospital setting. Acute kidney injury care bundles are associated with improved in-hospital mortality rates and reduced risk of progression. Nephrology consultation should be considered when there is inadequate response to supportive treatment and for acute kidney injury without a clear cause, stage 3 or higher acute kidney injury, preexisting stage 4 or higher chronic kidney disease, renal replacement therapy, and other situations requiring subspecialist expertise.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^03899f8c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury evaluation and stage-based management — Initial assessment, monitoring, nephrotoxin exposure, hemodynamic assessment, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk management are outlined as follows: Laboratory parameters — including SCr, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and electrolytes, complete blood count and differential — should be obtained, and urine analysis and microscopic examination as well as urinary chemistries may be helpful in determining the underlying cause of AKI; imaging tests, especially ultrasound, are important components of the evaluation for patients with AKI. Individualize frequency and duration of monitoring based on patient risk, exposure and clinical course, and it is advisable to tailor management to AKI stage. While stage-based actions provide a starting point, they are neither complete nor mandatory for an individual patient, and the measurement of urine output does not imply that the urinary bladder catheterization is mandatory for all patients. Nephrotoxic drugs account for some part of AKI in 20–30% of patients, and it seems prudent to limit exposure to these agents whenever possible and to weigh the risk of developing or worsening AKI against the risk associated with not using the agent. To ensure adequate circulating blood volume, static variables like central venous pressure are not nearly as useful as dynamic variables, such as pulse-pressure variation, inferior vena cava filling by ultrasound and echocardiographic appearance of the heart. Since AKI is a risk factor for CKD, it is important to evaluate patients with AKI for new onset or worsening of pre-existing CKD; if patients have CKD, manage patients as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline (Guidelines 7–15), and if patients do not have CKD, consider them to be at increased risk for CKD and care for them as detailed in the KDIGO CKD Guideline 3 for patients at increased risk for CKD.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^6fc7e06c]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) risk assessment and research needs — Among patients who developed AKI after hospital admission, there was "an unacceptable delay in recognizing AKI in 43% of those that developed the condition after admission", and "in a fifth of such patients its development was predictable and avoidable"; accordingly, "Their recommendations were simple: risk assessment for AKI as part of the initial evaluation of emergency admissions, along with appropriate serum biochemistry on admission and at frequent intervals thereafter". Research priorities include "Better delineation of risk for hospital- and community- acquired AKI is needed" and "Better delineation of the effects of age on the risk for AKI is needed", plus that "Studies are needed to develop and validate scoring systems for AKI risk prediction in various settings, in addition to cardiac surgery and exposure to radiocontrast material", that "Genome-wide association studies are needed to determine risk of AKI in different hospital settings and with respect to long-term outcomes", and that "Studies are needed on risk factors for the development of, recovery from, and long-term outcomes of community-acquired AKI, including sepsis, trauma, tropical infections, snake bites, and ingestion of toxic plants, etc".

### Sex-based disparities in acute kidney injury [^a8fa4384]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Sex-based disparities in acute kidney injury are related to differential access to diagnostic tests, testing thresholds, and nonharmonized data collection and acute kidney injury reporting across the globe. Differential exposure to acute kidney injury risk factors and sex-based social risk and discrimination, affect accurate acute kidney injury reporting. In animal models of acute kidney injury, males are at consistently higher risk likely driven by hormonal, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Female protection generally wanes in older animals; however, in humans, the risk of acute kidney injury is more difficult to describe because of inconsistent definitions, inconsistent statistical and reporting techniques, and lack of sex-stratified gold standard tests. Hospital-acquired, including acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and community-acquired acute kidney injury studies show a higher propensity among men, except for certain specific circumstances. The recent use of standardized acute kidney injury definitions and careful comorbidity adjustment has debunked the notion that women are at higher acute kidney injury risk as reported in past studies referencing certain clinical scenarios. The heterogeneity of epidemiologic reports from around the world does not allow for reliable inferences about sex-based acute kidney injury risk. In this review we present a summary of the greater literature on biologic drivers of acute kidney injury sex differences and the various complexities involved in describing epidemiologic sex-based acute kidney injury patterns.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^907bb576]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) diagnostic timeframes and staging — diagnosis uses either change in serum creatinine (SCr) within 1 week or a 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) increase within 48 hours (Recommendation 2.1.1). The 1-week or 48-hour periods may occur at any time and are for diagnosis, not staging; staging spans the entire episode, such that a 50% SCr increase in 5 days that ultimately reaches a three-fold increase over 3 weeks would be diagnosed as AKI and staged as Stage 3.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of acute kidney injury: a KDIGO summary (part 1) [^0b9ba918]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem affecting millions and causing death and disability for many. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes completed the first ever, international, multidisciplinary, clinical practice guideline for AKI. The guideline is based on evidence review and appraisal, and covers AKI definition, risk assessment, evaluation, prevention, and treatment. In this review we summarize key aspects of the guideline including definition and staging of AKI, as well as evaluation and nondialytic management. Contrast-induced AKI and management of renal replacement therapy will be addressed in a separate review. Treatment recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant trials. Appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and a detailed rationale for each recommendation is provided.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^046a729f]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) baseline creatinine and acuity inference — the second serum creatinine (SCr) may be a prior baseline or estimated from the MDRD equation; clinicians should consider how far back a value remains valid and how to infer acuity at first presentation. In patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD), a SCr obtained 6 months or even 1 year previously may reflect the premorbid baseline, whereas in CKD with slow increases over several months, baseline may require extrapolation. When recent illness suggests acuity (e.g., 5-day history of fever and cough with an infiltrate), if SCr is found to be ≥ 50% increased from baseline this fits the definition of AKI, and evidence that SCr is changing helps establish acuity.

### Intrinsic acute renal failure… [^ee981fe7]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Diminished renal blood flow causes ischemia in the renal parenchyma. If the ischemia is prolonged, acute tubular necrosis may develop. Early restoration of renal blood flow should shorten the ischemic time and prevent parenchymal injury. A response to the restoration of renal blood flow should occur in 24 to 48 hours. The keys to therapy are treating the underlying disorder, maintaining euvolemia and eliminating offending agents. 2 Renal injury evolves during the initiation phase, which lasts hours to days. In the maintenance phase, which lasts days to weeks, the glomerular filtration rate reaches its nadir and urine output is at its lowest. The recovery phase lasts days, often beginning with post-acute tubular necrosis diuresis. Hypovolemia from excess urine output is a concern during this phase. Despite recovery of urine production, patients can still have difficulty with uremia and homeostasis of electrolytes and acid because tubular function is not completely recovered.

Diligent monitoring is indicated throughout all phases of acute tubular necrosis. 3 One of the first evaluation steps in most patients with acute renal failure is to determine whether a patient has postrenal acute renal failure, because treatment is frequently relatively easy and the potential for recovery of renal function is often inversely related to the duration of obstruction. 3 Bladder catheterization may be diagnostic and therapeutic in patients with bladder or urethral obstruction. General Treatment of Acute Renal Failure Initial treatment should focus on correcting fluid and electrolyte balances and uremia while the cause of acute renal failure is being sought. A volume-depleted patient is resuscitated with saline. More often, however, volume overload is present, especially if patients are oliguric or anuric. 16 Finally, all medications should be reviewed, and their dosages should be adjusted based on the glomerular filtration rate and the serum levels of medications.

Between 20 and 60 percent of patients require short-term dialysis, particularly when the BUN exceeds 100 mg per dL and the serum creatinine level exceeds the range of 5 to 10 mg per dL. Indications for dialysis include acidosis or electrolyte disturbances that do not respond to pharmacologic therapy, fluid overload that does not respond to diuretics, and uremia. In patients with progressive acute renal failure, urgent consultation with a nephrologist is indicated.

### Acute kidney injury in older adults [^00086aef]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Aging kidneys undergo structural and functional changes that decrease autoregulatory capacity and increase susceptibility to acute injury. Acute kidney injury associates with duration and location of hospitalization, mortality risk, progression to chronic kidney disease, and functional status in daily living. Definition and diagnosis of acute kidney injury are based on changes in creatinine, which is an inadequate marker and might identify patients when it is too late. The incidence of acute kidney injury is rising and increases with advancing age, yet clinical studies have been slow to address geriatric issues or the heterogeneity in etiologies, outcomes, or patient preferences among the elderly. Here we examine some of the current literature, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest potential research questions regarding acute kidney injury in older adults. Answering these questions will facilitate the integration of geriatric issues into future mechanistic and clinical studies that affect management and care of acute kidney injury.

### Trends in hospitalizations for acute kidney injury-United States, 2000–2014 [^201c246a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury increases the risk of developing or exacerbating underlying chronic kidney disease (gradual loss of kidney function over time). National health (Healthy People 2020;) objectives call for renal evaluation of patients hospitalized for acute kidney injury 6 months after discharge to monitor kidney function and prevent or delay onset of chronic kidney disease. CDC's Chronic Kidney Disease Surveillance System monitors the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and its risk factors (including acute kidney injury) in the U.S. population and tracks progress in its prevention, management, and control.

Improving both patient and provider awareness that diabetes, hypertension, and advancing age are frequently associated with acute kidney injury is important for reversing these trends. Elderly persons have physiologically reduced kidney function and functional reserve with the appearance of global sclerosis, but also more comorbidity than do young adults, all of which heighten older persons' susceptibility to nephrotoxic medicines, dyes used for imaging, and even dehydration, all preventable risks for acute kidney injury. Better recognition of risk factors for acute kidney injury by health care providers might improve the effectiveness of treatment of underlying conditions and prevent or mitigate additional kidney insult to patients, particularly among those hospitalized or in long-term care.

Diagnosis of AKI

The diagnosis of AKI is traditionally based on a rise in serum creatinine and/or fall in urine output. The definition has evolved from the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage (RIFLE) criteria in 2004 to the AKI Network (AKIN) classification in 2007. In 2012, both were merged resulting in the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification. Accordingly, AKI is diagnosed if serum creatinine increases by 0.3 mg/dl (26.5 μmol/l) or more in 48 h or rises to at least 1.5-fold from baseline within 7 days (Table 1). AKI stages are defined by the maximum change of either serum creatinine or urine output. The importance of both criteria was confirmed in a recent study in > 32,000 critically ill patients which showed that short- and long-term risk of death or renal replacement therapy (RRT) were greatest when patients met both criteria for AKI and when these abnormalities persisted for longer than 3 days.

Table 1
KDIGO definition and classification of AKI

AKI acute kidney injury, GFR glomerular filtration rate, KDIGO Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, RRT renal replacement therapy

Several studies in various different patient populations have confirmed an association between stages of AKI and short- and long-term outcomes. However, serum creatinine and urine output are markers of excretory function only and do not provide any information about any other roles of the kidney, i.e. metabolic, endocrine, or immunological functions. They are also not kidney specific and need to be interpreted within the clinical context. Some patients fulfil the AKI definition but do not have AKI, and there are also patients with clear evidence of renal injury who do not meet the creatinine or urine criteria for AKI (Table 2).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^a6af8f3a]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease (CKD) chronicity assessment — differentiating CKD from acute kidney disorders emphasizes that the major challenge for defining chronicity is to differentiate CKD from acute kidney diseases (AKDs) such as acute glomerulonephritis (GN), including acute kidney injury (AKI), which may require different timelines for initiation of treatments, different interventions, and have different etiologies and outcomes. The duration of kidney disease may be documented or inferred based on the clinical context; for example, a person with decreased GFR or kidney damage during an acute illness, without prior documentation of kidney disease, may be inferred to have AKD, and resolution over days to weeks would confirm the diagnosis of AKI. A person with similar findings in the absence of an acute illness may be inferred to have CKD and, if followed over time, would be confirmed to have CKD. In both cases, repeat ascertainment of GFR and kidney damage is recommended for accurate diagnosis and staging, and the timing of the evaluation depends on clinical judgment, with earlier evaluation for those suspected of having AKI and later evaluation for those suspected of having CKD. For people with risk factors for CKD, delaying diagnosis for the sake of confirming chronicity can delay care, and initiating treatment both allows for earlier intervention and also indicates to people the importance of the disease.

### Diagnostic work-up and specific causes of acute kidney injury [^d190984b]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients and associated with grim short- and long-term outcome. Although in the vast majority of cases AKI is multifactorial, with sepsis, shock and nephrotoxicity accounting for most episodes, specific causes of AKI are not uncommon. Despite remaining uncertainties regarding their prevalence in the ICU, prompt recognition of specific aetiologies of AKI is likely to ensure timely management, limit worsening of renal dysfunction, and ultimately limit renal and systemic consequences of AKI. The ability to recognize conditions that may be associated with specific aetiologies and the appropriate use of clinical imaging, biological and immunological tests, along with optimal assessment of the need for renal biopsies, should be part of routine ICU care. In this review, we summarize uncertainties, current knowledge and recent advances regarding specific types of AKI. We describe the most common specific causes as well as rare aetiologies requiring urgent management, and outline available tools that may be used during the diagnostic work-up along with their limitations.

### Risk factors for community-acquired acute kidney injury in patients with and without chronic kidney injury and impact of its initial management on prognosis: a prospective observational study [^e03a9028]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

We aimed to describe clinical characteristics of patients with community-acquired acute kidney injury (CA-AKI), the effectiveness of initial management of CA-AKI, its prognosis and the impact of medication on its occurrence in patients with previous chronic kidney injury (CKI).

Methods

We undertook a prospective observational study within the Emergency Department (ED) of a University Hospital, screening for any patient > 16 years admitted with an eGFR < 60 ml/mn/1.73 m² and a rise in serum creatinine as compared to previous values. Patients' medical files were reviewed by a panel of nephrologists in the subsequent days and at one and three-years follow-up.

Results

From May 1st to June 21st 2013, there were 8464 admissions in the ED, of which 653 had an eGFR < 60 ml/mn/1.73 m 2. Of these, 352 had previous CKI, 341 had CA-AKI, and 104 had CA-ACKI (community-acquired acute on chronic kidney injury). Occurrence of superimposed CA-AKI in CKI patients was associated with male gender and with use of diuretics, but not with use of ARBs or ACEIs.

Adequate management of CA-AKI defined as identification, diagnostic procedures and therapeutic intervention within 24 h, was recorded in 45% of the cases and was not associated with improved outcomes.

Three-year mortality was 21 and 48% in CKI and CA-ACKI patients respectively, and 40% in patients with only CA-AKI (p < 0.001). Mortality was significantly associated with age, hypertension, ischemic heart disease and CA-AKI.

Progression of renal insufficiency was associated with male gender and age.

Conclusions

CA-AKI is more frequently encountered in male patients and those treated with diuretics and is an independent risk factor for long-term mortality. Its initial adequate management failed to improve outcomes.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) risk assessment, testing, and follow-up — The cause of AKI should be determined whenever possible. We recommend that patients be stratified for risk of AKI according to their susceptibilities and exposures (1B), and manage patients according to their susceptibilities and exposures to reduce the risk of AKI. Test patients at increased risk for AKI with measurements of SCr and urine output to detect AKI. Evaluate patients with AKI promptly to determine the cause, with special attention to reversible causes. Monitor patients with AKI with measurements of SCr and urine output to stage the severity, according to Recommendation 2.1.2. Manage patients with AKI according to the stage (see Figure 4) and cause. Evaluate patients 3 months after AKI for resolution, new onset, or worsening of pre-existing CKD; if patients have CKD, manage these patients as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline (Guidelines 7–15); if patients do not have CKD, consider them to be at increased risk for CKD and care for them as detailed in the KDOQI CKD Guideline 3 for patients at increased risk for CKD.

Purpose Of Review

Expanding rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) coupled with increasing awareness of its short-term and long-term sequelae have focused efforts to identify patients at risk for this disease and its complications. This review details the recent attempts to identify novel risk factors for AKI, describes further refinements in the diagnostic and prognostic approach using biological markers of injury, and highlights the features of AKI that independently predict poor long-term outcomes.

Recent Findings

The presence of proteinuria predicts the development of AKI independently of estimated glomerular filtration rate. Initial results from a large prospective study of AKI biomarkers in cardiac surgery indicate lower agreement with serum creatinine as an AKI standard than observed in early studies. AKI severity and duration are important predictors of chronic kidney disease and long-term mortality. A minority of patients surviving AKI with decreased kidney function is seen by a nephrologist.

Summary

Although the pathophysiologic link is unclear, proteinuria is an easily measurable risk factor for AKI worth considering before anticipated procedures or medication exposures carrying nephrologic risk. Investigation extending beyond agreement with serum creatinine is needed to fully understand the diagnostic and prognostic value of AKI biomarkers. Severity and duration are components of AKI that can help risk-stratify survivors in need of monitoring or nephrology referral.

KDIGO AKI staging — baseline serum creatinine (SCr) estimation and case-based staging emphasize using clinical data to estimate baseline and apply stage definitions. By using all available clinical data it should be possible to estimate baseline SCr, and the lowest SCr during hospitalization is usually equal to or greater than baseline; "This SCr should be used to diagnose and stage AKI". For unknown baseline in Case A, a 20-year-old white male has an estimated baseline of 0.8 mg/dl (71 μmol/l) making diagnosis possible on day 1 by "criterion 1, > 50% increase from baseline", whereas a 20-year-old black male has an estimated baseline of 1.5 mg/dl (133 μmol/l) and admission SCr is used until day 7 when the true baseline is seen. For staging, "the next step is to stage it (Recommendation 2.1.2)", with Case A's maximum stage being 2 because reference SCr is 1.0 mg/dl (88 μmol/l) and maximum SCr is 2.0 mg/dl (177 μmol/l); if reference SCr were 0.6 mg/dl (53 μmol/l) the maximum stage would be 3. Case F was staged using the lowest SCr 1.0 mg/dl [88 μmol/l] as reference; if this patient were a 35-year-old white male, estimated baseline 1.2 mg/dl (106 μmol/l) would make admission (day 1) stage 2, but after recovery to 1.0 mg/dl (88 μmol/l) on day 7 he could be restaged as Stage 3.

Caring for super obese patients (body mass index > 50 kg/m²) presents a number of complex and unique clinical challenges, particularly when acute kidney injury is present. We describe our experience treating the heaviest individual with acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy reported to date. A 24-year-old black man was admitted to our hospital with fever, vomiting, progressive weakness, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis. Admission weight was 1,024 lbs (466 kg), height was 6 ft 4 in (1.9 m), and body mass index was 125 kg/m². During hospitalization, the patient experienced oligoanuric acute kidney injury and required initiation of continuous and subsequently intermittent renal replacement therapy. This clinical scenario identifies the many challenges involved in caring for super obese patients with acute kidney injury and may be a harbinger of what awaits the nephrology community in the obesity pandemic era.

### Renal angina: concept and development of pretest probability assessment in acute kidney injury [^1047511a]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The use of advanced diagnostics (that is, beyond history and physical examination) forms a cornerstone of modern medicine. For any given diagnostic test, the context of that test is a critical component for the interpretation of the results. This context is referred to as pretest probability and forms the basis for the interpretation of any diagnostic test. For instance, if a young healthy pregnant woman presented for a medical examination and had a very elevated prostate specific antigen value, the patient's physician can safely dismiss this as a specious result. However, if the patient was a 70-year-old man with nocturia with the same elevated prostate specific antigen value, the clinician would arrive at a different conclusion. While this is an extreme example, it demonstrates the simple rule that all clinicians follow: the value of any diagnostic study without clinical context is minimized. The assessment of pretest probability for any diagnosis is informed by all of the core aspects of a medical examination (that is, history, physical examination, and all available medical information). The integration of these data then informs a differential diagnosis that guides the selection and interpretation of diagnostic studies.

1. The definition needs to be broad enough to accommodate variations in clinical presentation over age groups, locations, and clinical situations.

2. Sensitive and specific markers for kidney injury are not currently available in clinical practice. Several groups are working on developing and validating biomarkers of kidney injury and GFR which may be used in the future for diagnosis and prognosis.

3. There is accumulating evidence that small increments in serum creatinine are associated, in a variety of settings, with adverse outcomes that are manifest in short-term morbidity and mortality and in longer-term outcomes, including 1-year mortality. Current clinical practice does not focus much attention on small increments in serum creatinine, which are often attributed to lab variations. However, the coefficient of variation of serum creatinine with modern analyzers is relatively small and therefore increments of 0.3 mg/dl (25 μmol/l) are unlikely to be due to assay variation. Changes in volume status can influence serum creatinine levels. Because the amount of fluid resuscitation depends on the underlying clinical situation, the group agreed that application of the diagnostic criteria would be used only after an optimal state of hydration had been achieved.

4. A time constraint of 48 hours for diagnosis was selected based on the evidence that adverse outcomes with small changes in creatinine were observed when the creatinine elevation occurred within 24 to 48 hours and to ensure that the process was acute and representative of events within a clinically relevant time period. In the two aforementioned studies, there was no distinction of underlying CKD or de novo AKI. However, in the study by Chertow and colleagues, the odds ratio for mortality with a change in creatinine of 0.3 mg/dl (25 μmol/l) was 4.1 (confidence interval 3.1 to 5.5) adjusting for CKD. There is no requirement to wait 48 hours to diagnose AKI or initiate appropriate measures to treat AKI. Instead, the time period is designed to eliminate situations in which the increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 is very slow and thus is not 'acute'.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) — estimating baseline serum creatinine (SCr) when unknown: Many patients will present with AKI without a reliable baseline SCr on record. Baseline SCr can be estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation assuming that baseline GFR is 75 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (Table 9), and Table 9 shows the range of estimated SCr obtained by back-calculation for various age, sex, and race categories. When the baseline SCr is unknown, an estimated SCr can be used provided there is no evidence of CKD, but since many cases of CKD are not identified it is essential to evaluate a patient with presumed AKI for CKD to avoid mislabeling unidentified CKD as AKI.

### Biomarkers for the early detection and prognosis of acute kidney injury [^aa15ded5]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

AKI is an increasingly common disorder that is strongly linked to short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Despite a growing heterogeneity in its causes, providing a timely and certain diagnosis of AKI remains challenging. In this review, we summarize the evolution of AKI biomarker studies over the past few years, focusing on two major areas of investigation: the early detection and prognosis of AKI. We highlight some of the lessons learned in conducting AKI biomarker studies, including ongoing attempts to address the limitations of creatinine as a reference standard and the recent shift toward evaluating the prognostic potential of these markers. Lastly, we suggest current gaps in knowledge and barriers that may be hindering their incorporation into care and a full ascertainment of their value.

Similar problems may occur when defining AKI stage 3 by the RRT criterion. The optimal timing of RRT for AKI is not known and clinical practice is very variable. As such, AKI staging depends directly on the decision-making process of the clinician rather than underlying renal function.

Finally, single serum creatinine values do not provide any information about specific stages of the AKI process. Importantly, they do not indicate whether a patient is still in the progression phase or if recovery has already begun. Also, eGFR formulae are not valid to determine renal function in AKI.

Limitations of urine-based criteria for AKI

Urine output is an important clinical marker but, like creatinine, is not renal specific. In fact, urine output may persist until renal function almost ceases. Similarly, oliguria may be an appropriate physiological response of functioning kidneys during periods of prolonged fasting, hypovolaemia, after surgery, and following stress, pain, or trauma. In these situations, the action of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) can result in the generation of very concentrated urine with osmolarities up to 1400 mmosm/l. Assuming a daily solute load of 700 mosmoles, the urine volume may physiologically decrease to 500 mL (i.e. 0.28 ml/kg/h in a 70 kg person) as a result of normal kidney function.

The KDIGO criteria for AKI are based on the presence of oliguria for a minimum of 6 h. Several experts have questioned the validity of this arbitrary cut-off and suggest using either a longer minimum period (e.g. 12 h) or a lower threshold for urinary output (e.g. 0.3 ml/kg/h instead of 0.5 ml/kg/h) to reach sufficient specificity for diagnosing AKI.

Finally, in obese patients, weight-based urine output criteria may be particularly misleading (Table 2). In fact, the European Renal Best Practice Guidelines (2012) recommend using the ideal weight rather than the true weight when calculating urine output in ml/min/kg to avoid an overdiagnosis of AKI.

Adjunctive diagnostic tools to diagnose AKI

In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to use additional tools to diagnose AKI, especially where creatinine and urine values change only slowly, are misleading, or cannot be interpreted accurately. This is particularly relevant for critically ill patients where the presence of fluid overload, muscle wasting, sepsis, and reduced effective circulating volume may completely mask the diagnosis of AKI.

### KDIGO clinical practice guidelines for acute kidney injury [^30721da6]. Nephron: Clinical Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

KDIGO acute kidney injury (AKI) — research recommendations state that the role of biomarkers other than SCr in the early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and prognosis of AKI patients should be explored, including early detection where the gold standard is AKI by clinical diagnosis after the fact and the biomarker is compared to existing markers (SCr and urine output) at the time of presentation; prognosis where a biomarker is used to predict risk for AKI or risk for progression of AKI; and prognosis where a biomarker is used to predict recovery after AKI vs. death or need for long-term RRT. The influence of urinary output criteria on AKI staging needs to be further investigated, and influence of fluid balance, percent volume overload, diuretic use, and differing weights (actual, ideal body weight, lean body mass) should be considered; also, it is currently not known how urine volume criteria should be applied. The influence of whether SCr or eGFR criteria are used should be tested through simulation, and whether relative and absolute SCr increments or eGFR decrements at different time points and with differently ascertained baseline values requires further exploration and validation in various populations.

1.3. Further follow-up of AKI

1.3.1 Assess patients 2 months after AKI to evaluate the completeness of resolution, the detection of new onset CKD or worsening of pre-existing CKD. (1C)

Rationale

Observations in recently published epidemiological studies show that in a considerable number of patients who survive the acute clinical condition, CKD develops or worsens. Thus, management of patients should extend even beyond the condition of AKI, and should include monitoring for new-onset CKD. Although the follow-up interval after which an assessment should occur is a matter of clinical judgement, we feel that in high-risk in-patients kidney function should be re-assessed not later than 2 months after hospital discharge. Patients should be managed according to appropriate guidelines if CKD is detected.

We present a case of a man in his late 50s with a history of metastatic prostate carcinoma requiring bilateral ureteric stenting. He was admitted with increasing confusion and lethargy. He was diagnosed with sepsis and an acute kidney injury (AKI). Clinical suspicions of an obstructive component to his AKI were not confirmed by an ultrasound scan, which showed a unilateral hydronephrosis unchanged from a scan 1month previously. A nephrostomy was performed, and frank pus aspirated. The patient's clinical state improved steadily thereafter. Patients who are dehydrated, or who have suffered from malignant or fibrotic processes affecting the retroperitoneum, may present with urinary obstruction without a corresponding increase in urinary tract dilation. Additionally, there must be a suspicion of pyonephrosis in a symptomatic patient with known hydronephrosis. Clinicians should be aware that clinical suspicions of urinary obstruction not demonstrated on ultrasound scanning require further investigation.

Clinical guidelines are intended to help the clinician make an informed decision based on review of the currently available evidence. Due to the generic nature of guidelines, it is sometimes difficult to translate a guideline for a particular individual patient who may have specific clinical circumstances. To illustrate this point, we have discussed the interpretation of the KDIGO guideline in patients who have subtleties in their clinical presentation, which may make treatment decisions less than straightforward.

### Acute kidney injury [^3aed8928]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute kidney injury:

- **Definition**: AKI is a sudden decrease in kidney function resulting from structural or functional injury that is characterized by decreased GFR, increased serum creatinine, and oliguria.
- **Pathophysiology**: AKI has multiple possible causes, including renal hypoperfusion, intrinsic renal dysfunction (glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis), or obstruction to the emptying of the kidneys (post-renal AKI).
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of AKI in the US is estimated at 179–317 cases per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: Hypoperfusion of the kidneys with resultant ischemic injury represents the most important group of etiologies, mediating AKI through cellular injury caused by a mismatch between oxygen and nutrient delivery to the nephrons.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Approximately 40% of patients with AKI do not recover renal function by hospital discharge. In this group of patients, AKI is associated with 1-year age-adjusted mortality of approximately 60%, compared to approximately 10% in patients who recovered renal function within 7 days.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder comprising several etiological factors and occurring in multiple settings. The disorder has a variety of clinical manifestations that range from minimal elevation in serum creatinine level to anuric renal failure. We describe the formation of a multidisciplinary collaborative network focused on AKI. This Acute Kidney Injury Network has proposed uniform standards for diagnosing and classifying AKI. These proposed standards will need to be validated in future studies, a process that will be facilitated by the Acute Kidney Injury Network, which offers a forum that encourages acquisition of knowledge to improve patient outcomes.

1. Proposal for uniform standards for definition and classification of AKI

Definition and diagnostic criteria of AKI

For any condition, the clinician needs to know whether the disease is present and, if so, where and when the patient falls in the natural history of the disease. The former facilitates recognition whereas the latter defines time points for intervention. Unfortunately, there has been no uniformly accepted definition of AKI. Studies describe ARF or AKI based on serum creatinine changes, absolute levels of serum creatinine, changes in blood urea nitrogen or urine output, or the need for dialysis. The wide variation in definitions has made it difficult to compare information across studies and populations.

Diagnostic criteria

Recognition of AKI requires the delineation of easily measured criteria that can be widely applied. Serum creatinine levels and changes in urine output are the most commonly applied measures of renal function; however, they are each influenced by factors other than the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and do not provide any information about the nature or site of kidney injury. The proposed diagnostic criteria (Table 1) were based on consideration of the following concepts:

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury

The above criteria include both an absolute and a percentage change in creatinine to accommodate variations related to age, gender, and body mass index and to reduce the need for a baseline creatinine but do require at least two creatinine values within 48 hours. The urine output criterion was included based on the predictive importance of this measure but with the awareness that urine outputs may not be measured routinely in non-intensive care unit settings. It is assumed that the diagnosis based on the urine output criterion alone will require exclusion of urinary tract obstructions that reduce urine output or of other easily reversible causes of reduced urine output. The above criteria should be used in the context of the clinical presentation and following adequate fluid resuscitation when applicable. Note: Many acute kidney diseases exist, and some (but not all) of them may result in acute kidney injury (AKI). Because diagnostic criteria are not documented, some cases of AKI may not be diagnosed. Furthermore, AKI may be superimposed on or lead to chronic kidney disease.

Prolonged difficulties in diagnosis

Participants were distressed because of a delayed diagnosis of kidney stones - "I actually struggled to get care initially. It was really hard to get anyone to help me. I couldn't get any care". (Female, 60–69 years old). Some explained they had presented to emergency departments multiple times with excruciating pain felt often ignored by clinicians and were commonly dismissed after the stone had passed without consideration of referral for metabolic workup and assessment to receiving an underlying metabolic cause of their kidney stones.

Some believed clinicians needed to be able to identify risk factors for kidney stones for a more timely and accurate diagnosis. However, they emphasised the need for guidelines to include identification of those not considered conventionally to be at risk of kidney stones. Participants who didn't fit the "typical" kidney stones profile (i.e. Caucasian, male, older age) described clinicians often not considering kidney stones a possibility– "… A few doctors said to me, 'I think you might have kidney stones, but you just don't fit the demographic'… " (Female, 20–29 years old)

For some, the initial onset of acute pain occurring during adolescence resulted in clinicians dismissing their pain and attributing the pain to "female issues" [menstrual symptoms] or "urinary tract infections".

### Clinical evidence of acute mesoamerican nephropathy [^1c30e722]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Mesoamerican nephropathy (MeN), an epidemic of unexplained kidney disease in Central America, affects mostly young, healthy individuals. Its etiology is a mystery that requires urgent investigation. Largely described as a chronic kidney disease (CKD), no acute clinical scenario has been characterized. An understanding of the early disease process could elucidate an etiology and guide treatment and prevention efforts. We sought to document the earliest clinical signs in patients with suspected MeN in a high-risk population in Nicaragua. Physicians at a local hospital identified suspect cases and documented clinical/laboratory data, demographics, and medical histories. Over a 1-year period, physicians identified 255 mostly young (median 29 years), male (89.5%) patients with elevated creatinine or reduced creatinine clearance. Mean serum creatinine (2.0 ± 0.6 mg/dL) revealed a 2-fold increase from baseline, and half had stage 2 or 3 acute kidney injury. Leukocyturia (98.4%), leukocytosis (81.4%), and neutrophilia (86.2%) predominated. Nausea (59.4%), back pain (57.9%), fever (54.6%), vomiting (50.4%), headache (47.3%), and muscle weakness (45.0%) were common. A typical case of acute MeN presented with elevated (or increased ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or ≥ 1.5-fold from baseline) creatinine, no hypertension or diabetes, leukocyturia, and at least two of fever, nausea or vomiting, back pain, muscle weakness, headache, or leukocytosis and/or neutrophilia. Rapid progression (median 90 days) to CKD was recorded in 8.5% of patients. This evidence can serve as the basis of a sensitive and urgently needed case definition for disease surveillance of early-stage, acute MeN.

Conclusions

In summary, a large number of diagnostic tests are available for the evaluation of AKI, and determining which test to order should be based on estimates of pre-test probability and performance characteristics of the test. Our data suggest that many of the currently available tests have limited clinical utility, even when they are abnormal or "positive". Thus, developing better diagnostic tests that provide reliable and actionable data on AKI diagnosis or management should be a priority in AKI research. The dearth of such tests may be a key reason why therapeutic advances to improve outcomes in AKI have been largely unsuccessful.

The clinical calculator "KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury" for acute kidney injury.

The KDIGO diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury is a clinical tool designed for the identification and classification of acute kidney injury (AKI). It serves a crucial role in the early detection of AKI, facilitating timely intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.

The primary components of the KDIGO criteria include changes in serum creatinine and urine output. Specifically, the criteria are met if any of the following conditions are present: an increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL [≥ 26.5 mcmol/L] within 48 hours, an increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days, or a urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours.

The result is determined based on the presence or absence of these conditions. If any of the conditions are met, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are fulfilled. Conversely, if none of these conditions are present, the diagnostic criteria for AKI are not met. This straightforward approach allows for rapid assessment and diagnosis in a clinical setting.

The tool assesses whether a person meets the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI). It evaluates three specific medical measurements provided by the user. Each measurement is checked against defined thresholds to determine if the criteria for AKI are met.

The tool uses the following diagnostic criteria:

The first criterion checks for an increase in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dL (or 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours. If this is true, it indicates a potential diagnosis of AKI.

The second criterion evaluates whether there is an increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 times the baseline level in the previous 7 days. Again, a positive result supports a diagnosis of AKI.

The third criterion assesses urine volume, specifically whether it is 0.5 mL/kg/hour or less over 6 hours. If this condition is met, it further supports the diagnosis of AKI.

The tool processes the inputs by checking which of these conditions have been met:

| **Criterion description** | **Condition** |
|-|-|
| Increase in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (≥ 26.5 mcmol/L) within 48 hours| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| Increase in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.5 times baseline within the previous 7 days| If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| Urine volume of ≤ 0.5 mL/kg/hour for 6 hours | If this condition is true, it supports AKI diagnosis. |
| All conditions false | "Diagnostic criteria are not met" |
| At least one condition true | "Diagnostic criteria are met" |

### Acute kidney injury 2016: diagnosis and diagnostic workup [^fa823747]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Serum creatinine is measured as a concentration and is therefore affected by variations in volume status. As a result, the diagnosis of AKI may be delayed or missed in patients with significant fluid shifts or fluid overload. This was highlighted in a post-hoc analysis of the Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial. It revealed that AKI was unmasked or classified differently in up to 18% of patients after serum creatinine levels were adjusted for net fluid balance and estimated total body water. Affected patients had mortality rates similar to those with AKI that was present before adjustment.

Another important limitation of all creatinine-based definitions of AKI is that they require a reference value to describe "baseline" renal function. Ideally, this value should reflect the patient's steady-state kidney function just before the episode of AKI. However, information on pre-hospital kidney function is not always available so that various surrogate estimates are frequently used. These may include inpatient results or the imputation of values such as back-calculating a baseline creatinine and using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 75 ml/min per 1.73 m² in patients with missing data. Unfortunately, these methods can inflate as well as reduce the true incidence of AKI. At present, there is no standard approach to determining baseline renal function.

Creatinine-based criteria for AKI often do not take into account underlying renal reserve. In patients with normal kidney function, a rise in serum creatinine by 0.3 mg/dl may indeed be due to an important reduction in GFR. In contrast, in patients with underlying CKD, absolute rises in serum creatinine represent variable changes in GFR, and a rise by 0.3 mg/dl may be within the acceptable daily variation and simply reflect an inconsequential change in GFR. This is particularly relevant when diagnosing KDIGO AKI stage 3 which is defined by a rise in serum creatinine to > 4.0 mg/dl (≥ 353.6 μmol/l). A patient with a baseline serum creatinine of 3.9 mg/dl (345 μmol/l) who experiences a creatinine rise by 0.3 mg/dl in 48 h would be classified as having KDIGO AKI stage 3, whereas such a rise would be defined as AKI stage 1 in a patient with normal baseline renal function.

### Acute kidney injury: global health alert [^a3b51c0b]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly prevalent in developing and developed countries and is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Most etiologies of AKI can be prevented by interventions at the individual, community, regional and in-hospital levels. Effective measures must include community-wide efforts to increase an awareness of the devastating effects of AKI and provide guidance on preventive strategies, as well as early recognition and management. Efforts should be focused on minimizing causes of AKI, increasing awareness of the importance of serial measurements of serum creatinine in high-risk patients, and documenting urine volume in acutely ill people to achieve early diagnosis; there is as yet no definitive role for alternative biomarkers. Protocols need to be developed to systematically manage prerenal conditions and specific infections. More accurate data about the true incidence and clinical impact of AKI will help to raise the importance of the disease in the community, and increase awareness of AKI by governments, the public, general and family physicians and other healthcare professionals to help prevent the disease. Prevention is the key to avoid the heavy burden of mortality and morbidity associated with AKI.

Introduction

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a heterogeneous group of conditions, typically occurring in the context of acute or chronic illness, characterized by a rapid decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), accompanied by an increase in serum creatinine concentration or a decrease in urine output. The term "acute" refers to kidney dysfunction occurring within hours to days, while "kidney injury" implies a potentially reversible condition that, if not promptly addressed, may progress to acute kidney disease (AKD) and even chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI affects 15–20% of hospitalized patients, doubling the risk of in-hospital mortality and increasing the risk of CKD by fourfold. Current clinical diagnosis relies on serum creatinine levels, but its lagging nature limits the early diagnosis and treatment of AKI. As a marker of GFR, creatinine only increases when there is a significant drop in GFR or substantial parenchymal damage, and it does not reflect specific pathological processes. AKI primarily affects the tubules, with changes in GFR typically occurring only after tubular damage has progressed. The absence of changes in creatinine levels may lead to false reassurance, resulting in inappropriate medication dosing or delays in discontinuing nephrotoxic agents, thereby increasing the risk of worsening kidney injury.

Biomarkers are defined and categorized according to the BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) resource from the joint task force of the FDA and NIH, covering functions such as diagnosis, monitoring, prognosis, and prediction, and guiding the application of clinical and surrogate endpoint biomarkers. Ideally, biomarkers should be validated in multicenter and prospective cohorts, and tested in clinical trials for their impact on patient outcomes. As many researchers have advocated, in AKI, an ideal biomarker may not replace serum creatinine (SCr) and urine output but should be considered of additional value. In recent years, biomarkers for tubular injury, inflammation and repair, renal filtration, and oxidative stress have shown significant potential in the early detection and prognosis of AKI (Fig. 1). However, their clinical implementation faces challenges in terms of technology and validation, requiring large-scale studies to confirm their effectiveness. This review summarizes the current state of early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AKI, exploring their prospects in clinical practice and providing guidance to improve the diagnosis and treatment of AKI.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for acute kidney injury [^a47d2cda]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

RIFLE and AKIN criteria for acute kidney injury — adult thresholds — define severity by serum creatinine (SCr) change and urine output. Risk is "Increased SCr to > 1.5× baseline" or urine output " < 0.5 mL/kg/h for > 6 h". Injury is "Increased SCr to > 2× baseline" or urine output " < 0.5 mL/kg/h for > 12 h". Failure is "Increased SCr to > 3× baseline; or an increase of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL to a value of ≥ 4 mg/dL" or urine output " < 0.3 mL/kg/h for > 12 h or anuria for > 12 h". AKIN staging aligns as: Stage 1 "Increase in SCr ≥ 0.3 mg/dL or increase in SCr to ≥ 150%-200% of baseline", Stage 2 "Increase in SCr to > 200%-300% of baseline", and Stage 3 "Increase in SCr to > 300% of baseline; or to ≥ 4 mg/dL with an acute increase of ≥ 0.5 mg/dL; or on RRT". Progression categories include "Loss Need for RRT for > 4 wk" and "End stage Need for RRT for > 3 mo". Timing qualifiers specify "For RIFLE, the increase in SCr should be both abrupt (within 1–7 days) and sustained (> 24 hours)" and "For AKIN, the increase in SCR must occur in less than 48 hours", and abbreviations define "RRT" and "SCr".

### A case of acute kidney injury due to complex, partial, multifocal ureteral strictures [^3fb7fdb7]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

An 89-year-old man with a history of prostate cancer who had undergone radical prostatectomy 15 years ago presented with hyperkalemia (serum potassium level 6.9 mmol/l) and kidney failure (serum creatinine level 937 micromol/l [10.6 mg/dl]). Ultrasound scan of his kidneys showed mild bilateral hydronephrosis. Although placement of a bladder catheter led to an initial increase in glomerular filtration rate, the improvement was delayed and incomplete. Subsequently, the patient's glomerular filtration rate decreased acutely. This unusual biphasic course of kidney injury begged explanation.

Investigations

Physical examination, measurements of serum creatinine level and electrolytes, imaging of the urinary tract (ultrasound and CT scans), and nephrostograms.

Diagnosis

Acute kidney injury due to upper (multiple ureteral strictures bilaterally) and lower (urethral) urinary tract obstruction.

Management

Placement of bladder catheter and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes followed by bilateral internal ureteral stents.
