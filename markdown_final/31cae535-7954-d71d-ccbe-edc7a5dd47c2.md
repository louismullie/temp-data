## Question

In a comatose OHCA patient without ST-elevation who is hemodynamically stable, should I activate the cath lab immediately based on TOMAHAWK?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether immediate activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory is indicated for a comatose, hemodynamically stable out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patient without ST-elevation, and whether the TOMAHAWK trial supports that approach. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and the key decision factors. Then, I should verify what TOMAHAWK actually showed and how to interpret its results. Next, I will review other randomized trials and meta-analyses to confirm consistency. After that, I need to check contemporary guideline positions. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note exceptions where immediate angiography is still warranted.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: comatose after ROSC, no ST-elevation or new LBBB, hemodynamically stable, and presumed cardiac etiology. The question is whether immediate cath lab activation improves survival or neurologic outcomes compared with a delayed or selective strategy, and whether TOMAHAWK answers that question definitively [^13160e09] [^6815a9b6].

> I will now examine TOMAHAWK itself. Wait, let me verify the primary endpoint and magnitude. The NEJM publication shows that immediate angiography did not improve 30-day survival and in fact trended toward higher mortality: 54.0% vs 46.0% with delayed/selective angiography, HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00–1.63, P = 0.06, with a similar signal for death or severe neurologic deficit, and no advantage in secondary outcomes including myocardial infarction or rehospitalization for heart failure at 1 year, which confirms the lack of benefit and raises a concern for potential harm with immediate angiography in this exact population [^13160e09] [^d89c7afd] [^f4197f0b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from a single trial. I should confirm consistency across RCTs. The COACT trial likewise found no survival benefit at 90 days or 1 year for immediate versus delayed angiography in stable, non-STEMI post-arrest patients, and the EMERGE trial showed no difference in 180-day survival with favorable neurologic outcome between emergency and delayed angiography, reinforcing that immediate angiography does not improve outcomes in this setting [^007b7a96] [^b7a7f41d].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. The 2025 ACC/AHA/ACEP ACS guideline explicitly recommends against immediate angiography in comatose, electrically and hemodynamically stable post-arrest patients without STEMI, assigning a COR 3: No Benefit designation, and the 2025 AHA Post–Cardiac Arrest Care guideline concurs, advising that angiography can be deferred until after neurological awakening unless STEMI, shock, electrical instability, or ongoing ischemia are present, which directly addresses this scenario [^31d647a4] [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf].

> But wait, what if there are subgroups where immediate angiography still helps despite the overall neutral RCTs? Observational data suggest potential benefit in patients with shockable rhythms or other favorable prognostic features, yet these are confounded by selection bias; importantly, even in stable patients, acute coronary occlusion occurs in roughly 20–30% and is not reliably predicted by hemodynamics alone, which argues for a selective rather than universal immediate approach pending neurologic assessment or instability [^399a9495] [^d4d009d8].

> I should double-check the practical implications for bedside decision-making. The balance of evidence supports deferring immediate cath lab activation in this exact patient: comatose, no STEMI, hemodynamically stable, and no recurrent ventricular arrhythmias or ongoing ischemia. Instead, prioritize targeted temperature management, hemodynamic optimization, and neurologic prognostication, with coronary angiography performed after awakening or if instability develops, consistent with contemporary guidelines and the neutral RCT data [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf] [^e350d2dd].

> Exceptions where immediate angiography is still indicated include STEMI or STEMI-equivalent patterns, cardiogenic shock, recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, or persistent ischemia. In those cases, the benefit of emergent reperfusion outweighs the risks, and guidelines endorse immediate angiography regardless of coma, which I need to keep front-of-mind to avoid inappropriate delays when true indications are present [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf] [^d96bcf18].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly: No, you should not activate the cath lab immediately in a comatose, hemodynamically stable OHCA patient without ST-elevation based on TOMAHAWK. The best available randomized evidence shows no benefit and a possible signal of harm with immediate angiography, and current guidelines recommend a delayed or selective strategy unless specific high-risk features emerge, so the appropriate course is to defer angiography and focus on neuroprotective and hemodynamic care with reassessment over the next 24–72 hours [^13160e09] [^31d647a4] [^878ae956].

Do not activate the cath lab immediately for a comatose, hemodynamically stable OHCA patient without ST-elevation. The **TOMAHAWK trial** showed no survival benefit and a trend toward harm with immediate angiography in this exact population [^13160e09] [^d89c7afd]. Current guidelines recommend a **delayed or selective strategy** unless there is STEMI, shock, recurrent VT/VF, or ongoing ischemia [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf]. Immediate angiography should be reserved for patients with STEMI, hemodynamic instability, recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, or persistent ischemia [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf].

## Summary of the TOMAHAWK trial

- **Design**: Multicenter, randomized, open-label trial comparing immediate coronary angiography versus delayed/selective angiography in 554 comatose OHCA patients without ST-elevation.
- **Primary outcome**: 30-day all-cause mortality was 54.0% with immediate angiography vs 46.0% with delayed/selective angiography (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.00–1.63; P = 0.06).
- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant differences in myocardial infarction, severe neurologic deficit, or major bleeding.
- **Conclusion**: Immediate angiography did not improve outcomes and showed a trend toward higher mortality [^13160e09] [^d89c7afd].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Current guidelines align with TOMAHAWK and recommend a **delayed or selective strategy** in stable, non-STEMI post-arrest patients:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| ACC/AHA 2025 | - Do not perform immediate angiography in comatose, hemodynamically stable patients without STEMI [^31d647a4] [^cdcbce25] [^54b837ec] |
| AHA 2025 | - Emergency angiography is not recommended over delayed/selective strategy in stable, non-STEMI patients [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf] |
| ESC 2023 | - Consider delayed rather than immediate angiography in hemodynamically stable patients without STEMI after OHCA [^780d1e0b] [^ddb0ed6c] |

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting immediate angiography

Immediate angiography is indicated when any of the following are present:

- **STEMI or STEMI-equivalent**: Persistent ST-elevation or new LBBB on post-arrest ECG [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf].
- **Hemodynamic instability**: Cardiogenic shock or persistent hypotension requiring vasoactive support [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf].
- **Recurrent ventricular arrhythmias**: Sustained VT or VF despite initial stabilization [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf].
- **Ongoing ischemia**: Persistent chest pain or dynamic ischemic ECG changes [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf].

---

## Risks and benefits of immediate angiography

Potential benefits include identifying and treating acute coronary lesions, which may improve outcomes in selected patients [^d4d009d8]. Potential risks include procedural complications, delays in neuroprotective care (e.g. targeted temperature management), and futile interventions in patients with poor neurologic prognosis [^f0d77b50].

---

## Alternative strategies

A **delayed or selective strategy** allows time for neurologic assessment, targeted temperature management, and hemodynamic stabilization. Angiography is then performed if the patient awakens or if instability develops. This approach balances the need to identify coronary causes with the risk of futile interventions and delays in neuroprotective care [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Based on TOMAHAWK and current guidelines, **do not activate the cath lab immediately** for a comatose, hemodynamically stable OHCA patient without ST-elevation. Use a delayed or selective strategy unless STEMI, shock, recurrent VT/VF, or ongoing ischemia are present [^13160e09] [^878ae956] [^1971fcbf].

### ILCOR scientific knowledge gaps and clinical research priorities for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care: a consensus statement [^91481f6f]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Post–cardiac arrest coronary angiography in non–ST-segment elevation — knowledge gaps and active randomized trials are highlighted: There are no published randomized studies on emergency angiography and primary percutaneous coronary intervention after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and multiple prospective trials are in progress. Specific knowledge gaps include identifying which subgroups of patients with non–ST-segment elevation are most likely to benefit and which may not benefit at all. Ongoing trials include COACT, a prospective randomized study of immediate versus delayed coronary angiography for post-ROSC patients with non–ST-segment elevation with a primary outcome of 90-day survival; PEARL, a US multicenter study assessing the safety and efficacy of early (< 120 minutes) angiography in adults without ST-segment elevation on ECG after ROSC; and TOMAHAWK, which will address the timing of angiography with a primary outcome of 30-day survival. Additional studies include DISCO comparing the safety and efficacy of these 2 approaches, ARREST exploring transfer to a cardiac arrest center and immediate percutaneous coronary intervention in patients without ST-segment elevation on postresuscitation ECG, and ACCESS comparing early cardiac catheterization with activation only after ICU admission and consideration by the cardiology and treatment teams. These studies will help to determine whether emergency angiography should be performed in all comatose patients after ROSC or whether there should be clearer criteria for selection.

Patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST-segment elevation are a heterogenic group with a variety of underlying causes. Up to one-third of patients display a significant coronary lesion compatible with myocardial infarction as OHCA trigger. There are no randomized data on patient selection and timing of invasive coronary angiography after admission. METHODS AND RESULTS: The TOMAHAWK trial randomly assigns 558 patients with return of spontaneous circulation after OHCA with no obvious extracardiac origin of cardiac arrest and no ST-segment elevation/left bundle-branch block on postresuscitation electrocardiogram to either immediate coronary angiography or initial intensive care assessment with delayed/selective angiography in a 1:1 ratio. The primary end point is 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary analyses will be performed with respect to initial rhythm, electrocardiographic patterns, myocardial infarction as underlying cause, neurological outcome, as well as clinical and laboratory markers. Clinical follow-up will be performed at 6 and 12 months. Safety end points include bleeding and stroke. CONCLUSION: The TOMAHAWK trial will address the unresolved issue of timing and general indication of angiography after OHCA without ST-segment elevation.

Importance

Myocardial infarction is a frequent cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The long-term effect of early coronary angiography on patients with OHCA with possible coronary trigger but no ST-segment elevation remains unclear.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes of early unselective angiography with the clinical outcomes of a delayed or selective approach for successfully resuscitated patients with OHCA of presumed cardiac origin without ST-segment elevation at 1-year follow-up.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The TOMAHAWK trial was a multicenter, international (Germany and Denmark), investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolling 554 patients between November 23, 2016, to September 20, 2019. Patients with stable return of spontaneous circulation after OHCA of presumed cardiac origin but without ST-segment elevation on the postresuscitation electrocardiogram were eligible for inclusion. A total of 554 patients were randomized to either immediate coronary angiography after hospital admission or an initial intensive care assessment with delayed or selective angiography after a minimum of 24 hours. All 554 patients were included in survival analyses during the follow-up period of 1 year. Secondary clinical outcomes were assessed only for participants alive at 1 year to account for the competing risk of death.

Interventions

Early vs delayed or selective coronary angiography and revascularization if indicated.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Evaluations in this secondary analysis included all-cause mortality after 1 year, as well as severe neurologic deficit, myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for congestive heart failure in survivors at 1 year.

Results

A total of 281 patients were randomized to the immediate angiography group and 273 to the delayed or selective group, with a median age of 70 years (IQR, 60–78 years). A total of 369 of 530 patients (69.6%) were male, and 268 of 483 patients (55.5%) had a shockable arrest rhythm. At 1 year, all-cause mortality was 60.8% (161 of 265) in the immediate angiography group and 54.3% (144 of 265) in the delayed or selective angiography group without significant difference between the treatment strategies, trending toward an increase in mortality with immediate angiography (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 0.99–1.57; P = 0.05). For patients surviving until 1 year, the rates of severe neurologic deficit, myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for congestive heart failure were similar between the groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study found that a strategy of immediate coronary angiography does not provide clinical benefit compared with a delayed or selective invasive approach for patients 1 year after resuscitated OHCA of presumed coronary cause and without ST-segment elevation.

### Cardiac arrest: a treatment algorithm for emergent invasive cardiac procedures in the resuscitated comatose patient [^3e14f1a3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest continue to be a challenge, with high mortality. Although there is an American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Class I recommendation for performing immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (when indicated) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, no guidelines exist for patients without ST-segment elevation. Early introduction of mild therapeutic hypothermia is an established treatment goal. However, there are no established guidelines for risk stratification of patients for cardiac catheterization and possible percutaneous coronary intervention, particularly in patients who have unfavorable clinical features in whom procedures may be futile and affect public reporting of mortality. An algorithm is presented to improve the risk stratification of these severely ill patients with an emphasis on consultation and evaluation of patients prior to activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on out of hospital cardiac arrest [^6271c43e]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) — initial electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns and invasive strategy utilization show that 41% of the 939 patients had acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) on their initial ECG, and, in the International Cardiac Arrest (INTCAR) Registry, among 746 comatose post-arrest patients (79% OHCA), 26.5% presented with STEMI and 73.5% without STEMI; 91% of STEMI patients had immediate angiography whereas 33% without STEMI had immediate angiography. Survival was 55.1% in the STEMI group versus 41.3% in those without STEMI on the initial ECG, and lower time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was the highest predictor of survival with good neurological function. The ECG should not be the sole determinant when activating the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) and instead should be paired with the clinical presentation and the patient's clinical findings when considering invasive assessment and potential therapies.

Terminology for invasive management — The statement supports using cardiac cath Lab (CCL) activation rather than angiography to encompass other invasive procedures, and states, "We recommend use of terminology — "Definite" or "Defer" activation of CCL along a decision-making continuum at initial and subsequent encounters based on clinical history, presence of favorable/unfavorable resuscitation factors, initial rhythm, ECG and hemodynamic status."

### Angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation [^13160e09]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study TOMAHAWK was published by Steffen Desch and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Cardiac arrest. In the TOMAHAWK study, the trial question was: is immediate angiography superior to delayed angiography in patients with resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation? In the TOMAHAWK study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the TOMAHAWK study, the population was: 530 patients (161 female, 369 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with successfully resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of possible cardiac origin. The key exclusion criteria were ST-segment elevation or new LBBB; no return of spontaneous circulation upon hospital admission; the need for immediate coronary angiography/intervention; obvious extra-cardiac etiology or in-hospital cardiac arrest. In the TOMAHAWK study, the interventions were: n = 265 immediate-angiography (immediate coronary angiography) n = 265 delayed-angiography (initial intensive care assessment with delayed or selective angiography). In the TOMAHAWK study, the primary outcome was: borderline significant increase in death from any cause at day 30 (54% vs. 46%; HR 1.28, 95% CI 1 to 1.63). In the TOMAHAWK study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in death or severe neurologic deficit at day 30 (64.3% vs. 55.6%; RR 1.16, 95% CI 1 to 1.34) No significant difference in myocardial infarction (0% vs. 0.8%;) No significant difference in severe neurologic deficit (18.8% vs. 12.7%; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.67). In the TOMAHAWK study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in moderate or severe bleeding, stroke, acute kidney failure leading to RRT. In the TOMAHAWK study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with successfully resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of possible cardiac origin, immediate-angiography was inferior to delayed-angiography with respect to death from any cause at day 30.

### Angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation [^d89c7afd]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

Myocardial infarction is a frequent cause of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. However, the benefits of early coronary angiography and revascularization in resuscitated patients without electrocardiographic evidence of ST-segment elevation are unclear.

Methods

In this multicenter trial, we randomly assigned 554 patients with successfully resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of possible coronary origin to undergo either immediate coronary angiography (immediate-angiography group) or initial intensive care assessment with delayed or selective angiography (delayed-angiography group). All the patients had no evidence of ST-segment elevation on postresuscitation electrocardiography. The primary end point was death from any cause at 30 days. Secondary end points included a composite of death from any cause or severe neurologic deficit at 30 days.

Results

A total of 530 of 554 patients (95.7%) were included in the primary analysis. At 30 days, 143 of 265 patients (54.0%) in the immediate-angiography group and 122 of 265 patients (46.0%) in the delayed-angiography group had died (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00 to 1.63; P = 0.06). The composite of death or severe neurologic deficit occurred more frequently in the immediate-angiography group (in 164 of 255 patients [64.3%]) than in the delayed-angiography group (in 138 of 248 patients [55.6%]), for a relative risk of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.34). Values for peak troponin release and for the incidence of moderate or severe bleeding, stroke, and renal-replacement therapy were similar in the two groups.

Conclusions

Among patients with resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation, a strategy of performing immediate angiography provided no benefit over a delayed or selective strategy with respect to the 30-day risk of death from any cause.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on out of hospital cardiac arrest [^d7c1529c]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

Consensus statement on out of hospital cardiac arrest recommendations — In all comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients, the panel states "we recommend dynamic clinical decision-making of 'definite' or 'defer' transport to CCL" based on situational awareness across care. For initial non-shockable rhythms, "we recommended deferring transport to CCL at an initial encounter." In selected comatose OHCA patients with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) exhibiting STEMI on ECG, "we recommend a definite invasive strategy," whereas without STEMI in hemodynamically stable comatose OHCA patients, "we recommend deferring invasive strategy at initial encounter." For access during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), "we recommend choosing the access site as per the operator's expertise and local standard catheterization lab protocols," and "we recommend the safe access site practices to reduce the risk of bleeding." Regarding antiplatelet therapy, "we recommend ticagrelor or prasugrel as the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor in OHCA patients undergoing PCI." For anticoagulation, "we recommend the use of unfractionated heparin with monitoring as the pre-procedural anticoagulant" due to reversal availability and "reduced risk of acute stent thrombosis compared to bivalirudin." For target temperature management (TTM), "we recommend against the use of prehospital TTM using cold intravenous crystalloids" and "we recommend initiating TTM inpatient as soon as possible." Concerning barriers and public reporting, "SCAI advocates making OHCA exclusion based on exceptional risk from public reporting analysis of PCI outcomes," with the principle that "Public reporting of outcomes in high-risk patients, if done at all, should accurately reflect the performance of those operators and institutions."

Red Cross Guidelines — post-cardiac arrest coronary angiography states that an early or a delayed approach is reasonable for unresponsive patients without ST-elevation when coronary angiography is being considered, and that early coronary angiography should be considered in comatose patients with ST-elevation. An updated ILCOR systematic review of early versus late coronary angiography included a single new RCT and reported that the overall results of the revised meta-analyses are unchanged and the ILCOR treatment recommendations are unchanged, with insufficient evidence to show improved outcomes with early coronary angiography in patients without ST-segment elevation on ECG; early coronary angiography is an accepted standard of care for ST-elevation myocardial infarction without cardiac arrest.

Management of patients presenting with cardiac arrest — ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) actions specify that resuscitated patients with cardiac arrest and STEMI should preferentially be transferred by emergency medical services (EMS) to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-capable center; resuscitated patients who are noncomatose or are comatose with favorable prognostic features and with evidence of STEMI should undergo primary PCI (PPCI) to improve survival; for comatose patients with unfavorable prognostic features and evidence of STEMI, PPCI may be reasonable after individualized assessment; and in resuscitated comatose patients who are electrically and hemodynamically stable and without evidence of STEMI, immediate angiography is not recommended due to lack of benefit.

### Part 11: post-cardiac arrest care: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^e3328df8]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Post–cardiac arrest coronary angiography in comatose OHCA without STEMI — In multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of stable comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients without ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), there was no evidence of improved overall survival or favorable neurologic outcome with early invasive coronary angiography (eg, within 2 hours) versus delayed or selective invasive coronary angiography, with some studies suggesting potential harm with early angiography; in the delayed angiography group, up to 40% did not receive invasive coronary angiography due to lack of awakening and up to 17% crossed over to early intervention due to hemodynamic or electrical instability or severe myocardial ischemia. Invasive coronary angiography can be safely deferred until after neurological awakening in comatose OHCA patients without any of the following: STEMI or STEMI-equivalent patterns, cardiogenic shock (CS), recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, or evidence of significant myocardial ischemia.

### Risk-adjusted outcome prediction with initial post-cardiac arrest illness severity: implications for cardiac arrest survivors being considered for early invasive strategy [^51fa15f5]. Resuscitation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Early CATH is recommended for cardiac arrest survivors with STEMI or suspicion for coronary ischemia. Comatose patients are at risk of death from neurologic injury irrespective of CATH, but post-procedural mortality data do not distinguish between causes of death. Pittsburgh Post Cardiac Arrest Category (PCAC) is a validated, early post-cardiac arrest illness severity score based on initial cardiopulmonary dysfunction and neurologic examination. We evaluated the association between early coronary angiography (CATH) and patient outcome after adjusting for initial post-cardiac arrest illness severity.

Methods

Retrospective study of a prospective cardiac arrest database at a single site. We included 1011 adult survivors of non-traumatic in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from 2005 to 2012, then stratified by PCAC and immediate CATH. Logistic regression tested the association between immediate CATH and patient outcomes, adjusting for PCAC.

Results

Overall, 273 (27%) received immediate CATH. Patients with immediate CATH had higher proportions of good outcome in all but the most severe stratum of illness severity (11% vs. 6%; p = 0.11). The primary mode of death was neurologic for all but the least severe stratum. Adjusting for PCAC, immediate CATH was associated with favorable discharge disposition (OR 1.92; 95%CI 1.20, 3.07; p = 0.006) and modified Rankin scale (OR 1.95; 95%CI 1.12, 3.38; p = 0.02).

Conclusions

The benefit of CATH is less clear in the most severe stratum of illness, in which the high risk of mortality is primarily from neurologic causes. PCAC is a risk-stratification tool that provides pre-procedural risk-adjusted outcome prediction for post-cardiac arrest patients being evaluated for immediate CATH.

### Appropriate cardiac cath lab activation: optimizing electrocardiogram interpretation and clinical decision-making for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^2ccd5315]. American Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

During the last few decades, acute ST-elevation on an electrocardiogram (ECG) in the proper clinical context has been a reliable surrogate marker of acute coronary occlusion requiring primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). In 2004, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) guidelines specified ECG criteria that warrant immediate angiography in patients who are candidates for primary PPCI, but new findings have emerged that suggest a reappraisal is warranted. Furthermore, as part of integrated and efficient STEMI systems, emergency department and emergency medical services providers are now encouraged to routinely make the time-sensitive diagnosis of STEMI and promptly activate the cardiac catheterization laboratory (Cath Lab) team. Our primary objective is to provide a practical summary of updated ECG criteria for emergency coronary angiography with planned PPCI, thus allowing clinicians to maximize the rate of appropriate Cath Lab activation and minimize the rate of inappropriate Cath Lab activation. We review the evidence for ECG interpretation strategies that either increase diagnostic specificity for "classic" STEMI and left bundle-branch block or improve diagnostic sensitivity in identifying 4 STEMI-equivalents: posterior MI, acute left main occlusion, de Winter ST/T-wave complex, and certain scenarios of resuscitated cardiac arrest.

### Cardiac catheterization laboratory management of the comatose adult patient with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^a238ed54]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death, accounting for ≈50% of all cardiovascular deaths. The prognosis of such individuals is poor, with < 10% surviving to hospital discharge. Survival with a favorable neurologic outcome is highest among individuals who present with a witnessed shockable rhythm, received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, achieve return of spontaneous circulation within 15 minutes of arrest, and have evidence of ST-segment elevation on initial ECG after return of spontaneous circulation. The cardiac catheterization laboratory plays an important role in the coordinated Chain of Survival for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The catheterization laboratory can be used to provide diagnostic, therapeutic, and resuscitative support after sudden cardiac arrest from many different cardiac causes, but it has a unique importance in the treatment of cardiac arrest resulting from underlying coronary artery disease. Over the past few years, numerous trials have clarified the role of the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the management of resuscitated patients or those with ongoing cardiac arrest. This scientific statement provides an update on the contemporary approach to managing resuscitated patients or those with ongoing cardiac arrest.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to post-resuscitation evaluation, coronary angiography, ESC 2021 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining delayed as opposed to immediate angiography in hemodynamically stable patients without ST-segment elevation successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

### Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: in-hospital intervention strategies [^e350d2dd]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

The prognosis after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has improved in the past few decades because of advances in interventions used outside and in hospital. About half of patients who have OHCA with initial ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and who are admitted to hospital in coma after return of spontaneous circulation will survive to discharge with a reasonable neurological status. In this Series paper we discuss in-hospital management of patients with post-cardiac-arrest syndrome. In most patients, the most important in-hospital interventions other than routine intensive care are continuous active treatment (in non-comatose and comatose patients and including circulatory support in selected patients), cooling of core temperature to 32–36°C by targeted temperature management for at least 24 h, immediate coronary angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention, and delay of final prognosis until at least 72 h after OHCA. Prognosis should be based on clinical observations and multimodal testing, with focus on no residual sedation.

### Outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest at centers with and without on-site coronary angiography: a Nationwide analysis [^1be6eca4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

The AHA has long emphasized the need for regionalized care systems to optimize outcomes in cardiac arrest. Within this framework, Level I resuscitation centers are designated as facilities equipped to provide comprehensive, evidence‐based postresuscitation care, including 24/7 access to PCI. The 8.5% absolute mortality difference observed in our study between patients with OHCA admitted to facilities with versus without onsite coronary angiography highlights the potential role of centers with coronary angiography capability within the AHA model. Among those admitted to coronary angiography capable centers, 12.8% underwent coronary angiography, 4.3% received PCI, 4.1% required mechanical circulatory support, and 1.3% underwent coronary artery bypass graft, whereas none of these interventions were performed at hospitals without onsite coronary angiography. This difference is notable given that 1.1%, 6.6%, and 6.5% of patients at centers without onsite coronary angiography presented with STEMI, NSTEMI, and cardiogenic shock, respectively. Many of these patients would likely have benefited from coronary angiography to assess revascularization candidacy and from mechanical circulatory support to optimize hemodynamics. Moreover, although the COACT (Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest) and TOMAHAWK (Immediate Unselected Coronary Angiography Versus Delayed Triage in Survivors of Out‐of‐Hospital Cardiac Arrest Without ST‐Segment Elevation) randomized control trials did not demonstrate a mortality benefit for immediate coronary angiography over delayed or selective strategy in patients with OHCA without STEMI, a substantial proportion of patients in the delayed or selective arm in these trials ultimately proceeded to invasive evaluation – 64.9% (172/265) in COACT and 62.2% (165/265) in TOMAHAWK – with 24.2% (64/265) and 26.4% (70/265) of patients undergoing PCI, respectively. Therefore, onsite coronary angiography capability remains vital in managing patients with OHCA whose clinical presentation ultimately suggests a cardiac cause. Beyond procedural gaps, the improved outcomes observed at centers with onsite coronary angiography in our study may reflect the broader availability of institutional resources, including specialized cardiac critical care units and adherence to standardized postarrest care pathways. Although these factors were not directly evaluated in our study, they likely contribute to the observed survival difference, emphasizing the essential role of centers with onsite coronary angiography in delivering high‐quality postresuscitation care.

### Randomized pilot clinical trial of early coronary angiography versus No early coronary angiography after cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation: the PEARL study [^67f0b4dc]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The benefit of emergency coronary angiography after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is uncertain for patients without ST-segment elevation. The aim of this randomized trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early coronary angiography and to determine the prevalence of acute coronary occlusion in resuscitated patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation.

Methods

Adult (> 18 years) comatose survivors without ST-segment elevation after resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were prospectively randomized in a 1:1 fashion under exception to informed consent regulations to early coronary angiography versus no early coronary angiography in this multicenter study. Early angiography was defined as ≤ 120 minutes from arrival at the percutaneous coronary intervention-capable facility. The primary end point was a composite of efficacy and safety measures, including efficacy measures of survival to discharge, favorable neurologic status at discharge (Cerebral Performance Category score ≤ 2), echocardiographic measures of left ventricular ejection fraction > 50%, and a normal regional wall motion score of 16 within 24 hours of admission. Adverse events included rearrest, pulmonary edema on chest x-ray, acute renal dysfunction, bleeding requiring transfusion or intervention, hypotension (systolic arterial pressure ≤ 90 mmHg), and pneumonia. Secondary end points included the incidence of culprit vessels with acute occlusion.

Results

The study was terminated prematurely before enrolling the target number of patients. A total of 99 patients were enrolled from 2015 to 2018, including 75 with initially shockable rhythms. Forty-nine patients were randomized to early coronary angiography. The primary end point of efficacy and safety was not different between the 2 groups (55.1% versus 46.0%; P = 0.64). Early coronary angiography was not associated with any significant increase in survival (55.1% versus 48.0%; P = 0.55) or adverse events (26.5% versus 26.0%; P = 1.00). Early coronary angiography revealed a culprit vessel in 47%, with a total of 14% of patients undergoing early coronary angiography having an acutely occluded culprit coronary artery.

Conclusions

This underpowered study, when considered together with previous clinical trials, does not support early coronary angiography for comatose survivors of cardiac arrest without ST elevation. Whether early detection of occluded potential culprit arteries leads to interventions that improve outcomes requires additional study.

### Cost analysis from a randomized comparison of immediate versus delayed angiography after cardiac arrest [^91c17e51]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Exploratory subgroup analyses suggested that sex did not affect mean total costs. In a previous analysis, sex did not affect the clinical outcome as well.

Several other and ongoing trials should be mentioned. Their results will add further knowledge regarding the timing of coronary angiography in patients with an OHCA. The TOMAHAWK (Immediate Unselected Coronary Angiography Versus Delayed Triage in Survivors of Out‐of‐Hospital Cardiac Arrest Without ST‐Segment Elevation) trial results have recently been published and show no benefit of immediate versus delayed coronary angiography with regard 30‐day risk of death. In contrast to the COACT trial, this study included both patients with shockable and nonshockable initial cardiac rhythms. The ongoing DISCO (Direct or Subacute Coronary Angiography in Out‐of‐Hospital Cardiac Arrest) study is an international multicenter trial recruiting 1006 patients with OHCA randomly assigned to CAG as soon as possible versus delayed/selective CAG. The ARREST (Advanced Reperfusion Strategies for Patients With Out‐of‐Hospital Cardiac Arrest and Refractory Ventricular Fibrillation) trial investigates direct transport to a cardiac arrest center and immediate CAG versus transport to the nearest emergency department. We are eagerly awaiting the results of these trials and a cost analysis. Also, health economic implications might add further evidence.

Study Limitations

The COACT trial was not powered on the outcome "cost," and the present analysis is a post hoc analysis. Our cost analysis includes patient‐level resource consumption only from the initial hospital stay. Neurological status at discharge (cerebral performance score, Glasgow Coma Scale score) did not differ between the treatment arms; therefore, we presume a similar rehabilitation process and subsequent similar work disability.

No quality‐of‐life scores were obtained at 90 days. However, RAND‐36 quality‐of‐life scores were available at 12 months. As a result, we opted for a cost‐consequence analysis instead of a cost‐effectiveness analysis. In the latter case, it is essential that costs and effects are evaluated over the same time frame. Moreover, we chose to show only results based on empirical data from our research and therefore not to make assumptions about costs or effect behavior, which are not supported by empirical data (eg, extrapolation of cost to reach a 12‐month time frame, or shrink quality‐adjusted life year scores to a 90‐day time frame).

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) after cardiac arrest — adult recommendations specify the following with stated evidence grades: Coronary angiography should be performed emergently after cardiac arrest for all patients with suspected cardiac cause of arrest and persistent ST-segment elevation on ECG, regardless of the presence of coma (COR 1, LOE B-NR). Coronary angiography is recommended prior to hospital discharge in adult cardiac arrest survivors with suspected cardiac etiology, particularly with an initial shockable rhythm, unexplained left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or evidence of severe myocardial ischemia (COR 1, LOE B-NR). Emergency coronary angiography is reasonable for selected adult patients after cardiac arrest with suspected cardiac etiology without ST-segment elevation on ECG in the presence of CS, recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, or significant ongoing myocardial ischemia, regardless of coma (COR 2a, LOE B-NR). In adult comatose patients with ROSC after cardiac arrest, emergency coronary angiography is not recommended over a delayed or selective strategy when ST-segment elevation, shock, electrical instability, or significant ongoing myocardial ischemia are absent (COR 3: No Benefit, LOE B-R). In multivessel coronary artery disease in adult patients with shock after cardiac arrest, immediate revascularization of non–infarct-related coronary lesions is not recommended over initial revascularization of only the infarct-related artery (COR 3: No Benefit, LOE B-R).

### Utility and challenges of an early invasive strategy in patients resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^85745d02]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is frequently triggered by acute myocardial ischemia. Coronary angiography is an important component of post-resuscitation care for patients with OHCA without an evident noncardiac cause, to identify underlying coronary artery disease and allow revascularization. Most patients undergoing coronary angiography after OHCA have obstructive coronary artery disease, and nearly one-half of patients have acute coronary occlusion. Early coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention after OHCA have been associated with improved survival in observational studies, but these studies demonstrate selection bias, and randomized trials are lacking. Selection of patients for coronary angiography after OHCA can be challenging, particularly in comatose patients whose outcomes are driven primarily by anoxic brain injury. As for other patients with acute coronary syndromes, patients with ST-segment elevation after OHCA have a high probability of acute coronary occlusion warranting emergent coronary angiography. Patients with cardiogenic shock after OHCA are a high-risk population also requiring emergent coronary angiography. Among patients in stable condition after OHCA without ST-segment elevation, other clinical predictors can be used to identify those needing early coronary angiography to identify obstructive coronary artery disease. Despite the challenges with early neurological prognostication in comatose patients with OHCA, those with multiple objective markers of poor prognosis appear less likely to benefit from revascularization, and early coronary angiography may be reasonably deferred in appropriately selected patients meeting these criteria. The authors propose an algorithm to guide patient selection for coronary angiography after OHCA that combines clinical predictors of acute coronary occlusion and early clinical predictors of severe brain injury.

Cardiac Catheterization

There is reasonable consensus that early coronary angiography (performed within the first 6 hours) is safe and beneficial for post-CA care, although the majority of such data are from nonrandomized cohort studies. – Patients with ST-segment elevation on their ECG after resuscitation have an acutely occluded coronary at early coronary angiography nearly 80% of the time, which is similar to those with ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction not complicated by out-of-hospital CA. The current AHA guidelines recommend early coronary angiography for patients with ST-segment elevation on their ECG after CA, even if comatose with an unknown neurological prognosis. Nonrandomized registry reports suggest that both short-term and longer-term outcomes are improved in patients with CA and ST-segment elevation undergoing early coronary angiography and intervention. –

There is less agreement about the utility of early coronary angiography after out-of-hospital CA in patients without ST-segment elevation. This is an important issue because the majority (> 70%) of all resuscitated individuals with out-of-hospital CA do not have ST-segment elevation. A substantial amount of literature on nonrandomized cohort studies in post-CA patients without ST-segment elevation exists, as it does for those with ST-segment elevation. At least 10 000 patients have been included in such before-and-after cohort reports.– The overall results suggest that early coronary angiography is both safe and beneficial, including for improved survival and functional neurological status, among post-CA patients without ST-segment elevation. However, the proportion of post-CA patients without ST-segment elevation having an acutely occluded coronary culprit vessel is ≈20% to 30%.– This lower proportion has led to a less emphatic AHA recommendation.

### Association of electrocardiographic patterns after successfully resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with significant coronary lesions and mortality – A predefined substudy of the angiography after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation (TOMAHAWK) trial [^94e84131]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The use of electrocardiograms for predicting significant coronary lesions and mortality in patients with successfully resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) without ST-segment elevation has not been defined yet. The objective of this study was to investigate the association and predictive value of various standardized 12-lead electrocardiogram patterns in patients with successfully resuscitated OHCA and no ST-segment elevations on the presence of significant coronary lesions (diagnostic performance) and 30-day mortality (prognostic performance).

Design

Predefined subanalysis of the Angiography after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest without ST-Segment Elevation (TOMAHAWK) trial.

Setting

Multicenter, international randomized controlled trial across 31 centers.

Patients

Adult patients with successfully resuscitated OHCA and no ST-segment elevations.

Interventions

The first recorded electrocardiogram after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) at hospital admission was analyzed by experienced physicians.

Measurements and Main Results

Significant coronary lesions and 30-day mortality. In total, 412 patients with a coronary angiography were included, of which 163 (40%) had significant coronary lesions. No electrocardiogram pattern was identified as a predictor of significant coronary lesions. In the total cohort of patients with and without coronary angiography, right bundle branch blocks (BBBs), prolonged intrinsicoid deflection times, and intrinsicoid deflections in right BBB were strong, independent predictors of 30-day mortality. The "intrinsicoid deflection" is the sharp upward deflection in the QRS complex of an electrocardiogram. The "intrinsicoid deflection time" is the interval from the start of the QRS complex to the peak of the R wave. The predictive performance for significant coronary lesions was poor across all electrocardiogram patterns and better for 30-day mortality.

Conclusions

Standardized 12-lead electrocardiogram patterns after ROSC at hospital admission in patients with successfully resuscitated OHCA without ST-segment elevations have poor predictive performance for the presence of significant coronary lesions. Different QRS-related patterns might identify patients with higher risk of short-term mortality.

### Importance of coronary artery disease in sudden cardiac death [^dc261fdb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ventricular arrhythmias, pulseless electrical activity, and asystole can occur at the early stages of an acute coronary thrombotic occlusion, causing hemodynamic collapse, and resulting in "sudden cardiac death." Recognizing this common pathway for adult cardiac arrest, the 2012 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation with the American Heart Association ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) guidelines recommended immediate angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention in resuscitated out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients whose electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST‐elevation (class I recommendation). – However, clinical and electrocardiographic data alone are poor predictors for coronary artery occlusion in survivors of OHCAs. In a small, prospective study of 84 OHCA patients, Spaulding et al. showed that neither chest pain preceding arrest nor the presence of postresuscitation STEMI are independent predictors of an acute coronary occlusion.

Nonrandomized studies suggested that OHCA patients, both with and without evidence of STEMI, have improved survival associated with early cardiac catheterization. This was generally defined as cardiac catheterization performed either immediately upon hospital arrival or during hypothermia treatment when the patients were comatose. The benefit was most transparent in those resuscitated OHCA victims without readily obvious noncardiac cause for their arrest. A retrospective, observational study by Hollenbeck et al. demonstrated that comatose OHCA patients with initial documented rhythm of ventricular arrhythmias, but without electrocardiographic criteria for STEMI postresuscitation, have a significantly better rate of survival (65.6% vs. 48.6%) and favorable neurological outcome (60.7% vs. 44.5%) independently associated with early cardiac catheterization. There appeared to be a high incidence of acute coronary artery occlusion regardless of ECG pattern. It was also observed that early cardiac catheterization provided improved outcomes in patients without obstructive coronary lesions, perhaps through early hemodynamic optimization or mechanical support, but possibly simply as a marker of more aggressive postresuscitation management. It may also trigger a more immediate search for other causes of OHCA once obstructive coronary disease has been ruled out.

### SCAI expert consensus statement on out of hospital cardiac arrest [^ce107feb]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

SCAI expert consensus on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) frames the clinical scope by stating OHCA is a major public health problem with high mortality and morbidity and that improving survival with good neurological outcomes requires optimized response times and quality of care across the chain of survival. Given the high prevalence of coronary artery disease as a cause of arrest in patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, interventional cardiologists are often consulted to consider emergent coronary angiography and possible percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Emergent angiography and PCI are indicated in selected OHCA patients when a post resuscitation electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), though practice varies for those without STEMI on post resuscitation ECG. The cardiac catheterization laboratory role includes angiography and PCI as well as hemodynamic assessment and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) device use in patients with concomitant cardiogenic shock (CS). The document aims to provide an evidence-based and patient-oriented recommendation for management and was developed according to SCAI Publications Committee policies, including disclosure and management of relationships with industry, and internal and external review with organizational approval.

### Acute coronary occlusion in patients with non-ST-Segment elevation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^399a9495]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

According to current guidelines, hemodynamic status should guide the decision between immediate and delayed coronary angiography (CAG) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients without ST-segment elevation. A delayed strategy is advised in hemodynamically stable patients, and an immediate approach is recommended in unstable patients.

Objectives

This study sought to assess the frequency, predictors, and clinical impact of acute coronary occlusion in hemodynamically stable and unstable OHCA patients without ST-segment elevation.

Methods

Consecutive unconscious OHCA patients without ST-segment elevation who were undergoing CAG at Bern University Hospital (Bern, Switzerland) between 2011 and 2019 were included. Frequency and predictors of acute coronary artery occlusions and their impact on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality at 1 year were assessed.

Results

Among the 386 patients, 169 (43.8%) were hemodynamically stable. Acute coronary occlusions were found in 19.5% of stable and 24.0% of unstable OHCA patients (P = 0.407), and the presence of these occlusions was predicted by initial chest pain and shockable rhythm, but not by hemodynamic status. Acute coronary occlusion was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death (adjusted HR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.22–6.15) but not of all-cause death (adjusted HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.44–1.18). Hemodynamic instability was not predictive of fatal outcomes.

Conclusions

Acute coronary artery occlusions were found in 1 in 5 OHCA patients without ST-segment elevation. The frequency of these occlusions did not differ between stable and unstable patients, and the occlusions were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular death. In OHCA patients without ST-segment elevation, chest pain or shockable rhythm rather than hemodynamic status identifies patients with acute coronary occlusion.

Acute coronary syndromes — supportive triage and prognostic factors for cardiac arrest with STEMI note that transfer to a PCI-capable center was associated with improved survival in patients with cardiac arrest and STEMI on electrocardiogram (ECG), and EMS should preferentially transfer patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest, have achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and have STEMI on the ECG to a PPCI center; nearly one-third of patients with cardiac arrest and STEMI on ECG have normal neurologic status on presentation to the emergency department, and being alert or with partial/minimal neurologic response on presentation with STEMI after cardiac arrest is an independent predictor of survival; patients with STEMI who have achieved ROSC and are awake should undergo PPCI, whereas in patients who are comatose after cardiac arrest and have achieved ROSC but have STEMI on the ECG, an individualized patient assessment for survival and futility is essential before proceeding with PCI; poor prognostic features used in risk scores include unwitnessed arrest, no bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, nonshockable rhythm, cardiopulmonary resuscitation > 30 minutes, time to ROSC > 30 minutes, arterial pH < 7.2, lactate > 7 mmol/L, and age > 85 years.

2.2 Study definitions

CA was considered "early" when performed immediately (≤ 2 h) following arrival at the PCI‐capable centre."Late" CA was defined as CA performed at any other time during the index or subsequent hospital admission. This study was not randomized and the indication for performing early CA was based on the clinical judgment of the treating cardiologist. Both study sites have catheterization laboratories that were available at all times. The decision to delay CA or to not perform CA was usually made after initial assessment of neurological status and temperature management. We defined sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) as the resumption of spontaneous perfusing rhythm resulting in palpated pulse, arterial waveform or measurable blood pressure for > 20 min. Assisted circulation (e.g. extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) was not regarded as ROSC until "patient‐generated" circulation was detected. Cardiogenic shock (CS) was defined as a continuous event of > 30 min where either systolic blood pressure was < 90 mmHg or vasoactive/inotropic medications were utilized to support blood pressure > 90 mmHg, with clinical signs of elevated filling pressures (e.g. pulmonary congestion on chest radiograph or clinical examination) and signs of end‐organ hypoperfusion (e.g. cold and diaphoretic peripheries, altered conscious state, or urine output ≤ 30 ml/h).

### Emergency coronary angiography in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients without STEMI [^5cd859a4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Current guideline recommends that immediate coronary angiography (CAG) should be considered in all postcardiac arrest patients in whom acute coronary syndrome is suspected. In the setting of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), obtaining clinical data such as chest discomfort and medical diseases associated with acute coronary syndrome can be difficult. Therefore, emergency physicians depend on electrocardiographic findings after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) when they have to decide whether emergency CAG should be performed. In clinical practice, the usefulness of emergency CAG evaluation of OHCA patients without ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is debatable. We describe 2 OHCA patients who did not exhibit ST-segment elevation after ROSC and received underwent emergency CAG.

### Impact of urgent coronary angiography on mid-term clinical outcome of comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors presenting without ST-segment elevation [^268a0417]. Resuscitation (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Timing of coronary angiography (CAG) is still controversial in the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors who present without ST-segment elevation.

Methods and Results

We analysed a prospective registry of 158 comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. For further analysis, we included 99 patients without ST-segment elevation on the initial electrocardiogram. All patients underwent temperature management. Urgent CAG (< 2h from admission) was performed in 25% of the patients. A definite cause of the cardiac arrest could be identified during the index hospitalization in 82 patients: 36 had a non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and 46 had a non-ACS diagnosis. Eighty-seven patients (88%) survived the index hospitalization and 65 (66%) were alive at six months. A favourable neurological status (cerebral performance category ≤ 2) was observed in 56% of the patients at discharge and in 56% after six months of follow-up. Neither the survival nor the neurological outcome differed between the patients in whom the CAG was performed urgently upon the admission and the patients in whom the CAG was initially not performed, regardless of the aetiology of the cardiac arrest. On the other hand, performing an urgent CAG was safe and it did not prolong the average time to achieve an effective hypothermia.

Conclusions

Performing an urgent CAG in comatose cardiac arrest survivors without ST-segment elevation was not associated with better clinical and neurological outcome as compared to the initially conservative approach.

Explicit Activation Criteria and RRT/MET — evidence summary and certainty: Important heterogeneity existed across study designs and interventions, with many implementing activation criteria and RRT/MET simultaneously; thus, evaluating the impact of each in isolation was not possible. Among RCTs, pooled results demonstrated a reduction in mortality and non-ICU cardiac arrests, and both findings were supported by most observational studies. There was no effect on health-related quality of life or discharge to assisted living facilities (low certainty), and effects on transfers to a higher level of care and changes in goals of care were unclear (very low certainty). More recent interventional trials have confirmed that deployment of an early warning risk score leads to decreased mortality.

### Do out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients have increased chances of survival when transported to a cardiac resuscitation center? [^89de329b]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and it is a serious public health burden. 1 Despite an improvement in prehospital resuscitation practices, including an increased access to early cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation, mortality rates remain high, with only 10% of patients surviving to hospital discharge. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 To further decrease the mortality from OHCA, the establishment of a regionalized approach for the treatment of OHCA, including direct transport to specialized cardiac resuscitation centers, such as in the case of an ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction, has been proposed (class IIb, level of evidence C‐limited data). 5, 6, 7 For a hospital to be considered a cardiac resuscitation center, it must be able to provide diagnostic angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on site at all times as well as targeted temperature management (TTM). 5 Indeed, most nontraumatic OHCA results from an acute coronary syndrome, and PCI is the preferred therapeutic procedure for that pathology. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Patients remaining comatose following an OHCA also strongly benefit from some form of TTM. 10, 13, 14

Despite these recommendations made by the American Heart Association, few jurisdictions have implemented a regionalized approach for OHCA patients with designated receiving centers. As a result, there remains significant variation with regard to treatment standards for these patients. 15, 16 However, since these guidelines were published, multiple new studies have emerged, and their results could influence the decisions made for patients suffering from an OHCA.

To better evaluate the evidence on this subject, a systematic review and meta‐analysis of the currently available literature evaluating the association between the destination hospital capability (cardiac resuscitation center or not) and resuscitation outcomes (survival and survival with a good neurologic outcome) for patients suffering from an OHCA were performed.

### Prehospital activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory in ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction for primary percutaneous coronary intervention [^0558b0cb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Prehospital antithrombotic medication has been associated with improved thrombolysis in myocardial infarction coronary grade flow before PCI, lower rates of 30‐day stent thrombosis, and lower mortality, and may explain, in conjunction with lower time to reperfusion, the association with lower mortality with prehospital activation in our study compared with previously published Australian literature. Although these studies did demonstrate similar reductions in time to reperfusion, it is unclear whether the timing of initiation of medical therapy, including antithrombotic medication may also contribute to the mortality differences. Other differences in mortality in previously reported studies may be due to reporting all‐cause mortality rather than specifically cardiovascular mortality as well as the inclusion/exclusion of patients with cardiogenic shock, out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest, and preprocedural intubation with uncertain neurological status. Our study excluded patients who had out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest and preprocedural intubation with uncertain neurological status. These patients were deemed salvage due to the significantly high proportion of neurovascular mortality in this group despite appropriate cardiovascular reperfusion. However, the current study did not exclude patients with cardiogenic shock, which may develop with longer delays to treatment as noted in other studies. Cardiac arrest before PCI was identified on the causal pathway and was incorporated into the multivariate analysis. Unlike previous studies, cause of death was also analyzed in our study and both all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality showed lower rates associated with prehospital activation.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

PreAct Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

Of the Direct to CCL criteria specified, 4 are considered essential — (1) Paramedic confident in the STEMI diagnosis; (2) emergency physician and/or cardiologist confident in the STEMI diagnosis; (3) ability to provide informed consent; and (4) no "do not resuscitate" (DNR):
Paramedic confident in STEMI diagnosis — When EMS is uncertain about whether STEMI ECG criteria are met (in the absence of transmission) or whether the patient is having an STEMI based on the clinical presentation, initial evaluation in the ED is indicated.
Emergency physician and/or cardiologist confident in STEMI diagnosis — Based on the prehospital report and prehospital ECG, if the emergency physician and/or cardiologist is in doubt of the diagnosis or otherwise believes the patient needs initial ED evaluation, the patient should be evaluated in the ED initially.
Ability to provide consent — The patient's mental status should be considered for ability to give informed consent. If there is doubt, direct CCL transfer is not appropriate.
No do not resuscitate — Patients who have a known do not resuscitate still should be transported to an STEMI receiving center for further evaluation. Patient preference, shared‐decision making, and informed consent are important and legally mandated components of the STEMI process, 33, 34 in whom after an informed discussion emergent coronary angiography may still be performed.

ST Elevation ≥ 2 mm in ≥ 2 Contiguous Leads

Using ≥ 2 mm as a direct criterion decreases diagnostic uncertainty and improves specificity. 35 This criterion is more stringent than typical criteria for STEMI diagnosis to account for technical and interpretation challenges inherent to the prehospital environment that can lead to a higher rate of over activations. 35 Larger extent of ST elevation also identifies patients who have greater areas at risk 36 and therefore more likely to benefit from accelerated reperfusion.

Aged 30 to 90 Years

Younger patients (aged < 30 years) are less likely to have myocardial infarction and significantly more likely to have ECG abnormalities that mimic STEMI. Extremely elderly patients (aged > 90 years) are more likely to have significant medical comorbidities or goals of care that may preclude cardiac catheterization, such that discussions of goals of care with the patient and/or their family before angiography is appropriate.

### Invasive management of out of hospital cardiac arrest [^1c10be6a]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Clinical decision making is extremely difficult in this understudied patient population with high prevalence of neurological injury and inexorable shock states. As such, there are uncertain benefits from therapies available in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Fear of futility and public reporting often affects decision making and can result in risk aversion. This review focuses on invasive management in OHCA care, with particular focus on coronary angiography, coronary revascularization, and mechanical support. Guidelines recommend emergency coronary angiography in patients with ST-segment elevations on ECG after OHCA, while the role of coronary angiography in patients without ST-segment elevations is less clear. Similar uncertainty remains in the appropriate revascularization strategy in these patients. As in other areas of cardiology, there is a growing interest in the role of mechanical circulatory support after OHCA, though the available literature shows mixed results. The many uncertainties associated with treating the patient with OHCA highlight the importance of clinical decision support tools and treatment algorithms in the care of this population. This review focuses on invasive management in OHCA care, with particular focus on coronary angiography, coronary revascularization, and mechanical support.

### Catheterization laboratory activation during mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation: when should we say "No? " [^160806f6]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

Sudden cardiac arrest is a devastating manifestation of coronary artery disease and a leading cause of death in the western world. Early and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation is essential for return of spontaneous circulation. If manual compression is ongoing and return of spontaneous circulation has not been achieved, the prognosis is poor, and the logistics of performing cardiac catheterization are forbidding. With the advent of mechanical chest compression, however, this clinical scenario has become much more complex. Coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention, although still cumbersome, has been established as feasible with ongoing mechanical chest compression. This article discusses the strengths and pitfalls of mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation, our experience, and current evidence behind activation of the catheterization laboratory with ongoing mechanical chest compression.

### Should we perform an immediate coronary angiogram in all patients after Cardiac arrest? insights from a large French registry [^528b594c]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to assess the relationship between an immediate invasive strategy and survival after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) of presumed cardiac cause, according to prognosis evaluated on hospital arrival.

Background

An immediate coronary angiogram (CAG) may be associated with better outcome after OHCA in neurologically preserved patients but could be futile in other cases.

Methods

From May 2011 to May 2015, we collected data for all patients admitted in hospital after OHCA in Paris and its suburbs (France). Risk of in-hospital death was retrospectively calculated using the validated Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis score, which includes age, setting, initial rhythm, durations from collapse to basic life support and from basic life support to return of spontaneous circulation, pH, and epinephrine dose. Independent predictors of survival at discharge (including immediate CAG) were assessed in multivariate logistic regression in each of the 3 pre-defined subgroups of Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis score: low risk (< 150 points), medium risk (150 to 200 points), and high risk (> 200 points) for in-hospital death.

Results

A total of 1,410 patients were included and overall survival rate at hospital discharge was 32%. Distribution in the low-, medium-, and high-risk Cardiac Arrest Hospital Prognosis subgroups was 667 (47%), 469 (33%), and 274 patients (20%), respectively. The rate of early CAG was 86%, 66%, and 47% in the low-, medium-, and high-risk subgroups, respectively (p < 0.001). Early invasive strategy was independently associated with better survival in low-risk patients (odds ratio: 2.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.4 to 3.9; p = 0.001), but not in medium-risk (p = 0.55) and high-risk (p = 0.43) patients. Sensitivity analysis found consistent results.

Conclusions

In cardiac arrest patients, our results suggest that investigations regarding early CAG after OHCA should focus on patients with preserved neurological status.

### Improvement in care and outcomes for emergency medical service-transported patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with and without prehospital cardiac arrest: a mission: lifeline STEMI accelerator study [^25830e0e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with ST‐elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) constitute an important patient population, with significantly higher rates of system delay and mortality relative to patients with STEMI without OHCA. 1 Because STEMI is a common cause of cardiac arrest, obtainment of a 12‐lead ECG as soon as possible after return of spontaneous circulation to determine whether acute ST elevation is present is a class 1 recommendation in current OHCA guidelines. 2, 3 Because it is impossible to determine the likelihood of neurological recovery of patients with OHCA in the first hours after return of spontaneous circulation, immediate reperfusion of patients with STEMI with OHCA is recommended, regardless of coma or induced temperature management. 2

Nonetheless, OHCA is a frequently reported reason for failure to meet guideline‐recommended goals of timely reperfusion in patients with STEMI. 1, 4 Moreover, patients with STEMI with OHCA have previously been less likely to bypass the nearest non–percutaneous cardiac intervention (PCI) hospital to reach a cardiac center relative to patients with STEMI without OHCA. 5 Accordingly, a policy statement from the American Heart Association stresses the need for regional systems of care for patients with OHCA with substantial overlap to the regional systems of care that are recommended for patients with STEMI. 6 In addition to timely catheterization, patients with OHCA may also benefit from temperature management and other intensive care. These services are more likely to be available at a PCI center. 2, 3

Patients with cardiac arrest at the time of first medical contact (FMC) were registered in the Mission: Lifeline STEMI Accelerator project, which represents the largest national effort to coordinate regional STEMI care between hospitals and emergency medical service (EMS) agencies in 16 US regions from 2012 to 2014. 7, 8 Using data from the Mission: Lifeline STEMI Accelerator project, we evaluated whether changes in care and outcomes after these initiatives equally applied to patients with and without OHCA. We evaluated temporal changes in the following care and process measures: (1) proportions of patients with and without OHCA with a 12‐lead ECG obtained in the prehospital setting, (2) proportions taken directly to a PCI center, and (3) proportions meeting guideline‐recommended goals of timely reperfusion. Finally, we evaluated patient characteristics and outcomes according to STEMI and OHCA status.

### Early access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest due to a shockable rhythm: the Minnesota resuscitation consortium twin cities unified protocol [^f08bdb24]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

The MRC was established in 2012 as a statewide effort to improve survival from cardiac arrest in the state of Minnesota. Under MRC guidelines, emergency medical services providers, emergency medical services directors, paramedics‐receiving emergency departments, CCL directors, and cardiology groups work together to provide optimal resuscitation and postresuscitation care, including therapeutic hypothermia and early access to the CCL. 11 The Minneapolis‐St. Paul (Twin Cities area is the 14th largest metropolitan area in the United States according to figures from the 2013 census, with a population estimated to be 3 797 883. 12 The 11 hospitals included in MRC cover 70% of the population in the state of Minnesota.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

MRC hospitals in the Minneapolis‐St. Paul metropolitan area with 24/7 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) capabilities agreed to provide early access to the CCL (ie, within 6 hours of arrival to the emergency department, preferably within 2 hours) to all patients who were successfully resuscitated from ventricular fibrillation and/or ventricular tachycardia arrest regardless of the presence of ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction on the surface ECG (Figure 1).

Figure 1
The Minnesota Resuscitation Consortium (MRC) protocol for the treatment of out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) due to shockable rhythms. CCL indicates cardiac catheterization lab; DNR/DNI, do not resuscitate/do not intubate; ED, emergency department; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; ROSC, return of spontaneous circulation; STEMI, ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction; VF/VT, ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia.

Additional inclusion criteria for this prospective interventional registry were age > 18 and < 76, and arrest of presumed cardiac etiology. We included witnessed or unwitnessed arrests as well as comatose or conscious patients. All comatose patients received therapeutic hypothermia. 13 Patients whose initial presenting rhythm was pulseless electrical activity or asystole, had a known do not resuscitate/do not intubate status, an obvious noncardiac etiology for their cardiac arrest such as trauma, significant bleeding of any cause, and known terminal disease were excluded. We also excluded patients who did not gain return of ROSC or died prior to arrival to the emergency department. Patients who met inclusion criteria and did not meet any of the exclusion criteria were included in this analysis of the MRC protocol. A detailed review of the medical records was undertaken to understand the rationale for not going to the CCL within the stipulated time frame (Appendix S1).

2 PATIENT AND METHODS

2.1 Study design and patient population

We conducted a retrospective observational study involving two of the largest tertiary and quaternary health services — Alfred Health and Western Health — in Melbourne (Victoria, Australia). Ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board was obtained (Project no. 55974) with a waiver of consent due to the observational design of this study. Between the two centers, annual attendance for emergency medical services totals more than 200,000 episodes, with a combined catchment area of approximately 2 million people.

Consecutive patients identified by International Classification of Diseases Clinical Modification (ICD‐10‐CM) codes for cardiac arrest (I46, I46.2, I46.8, and I46.9) and shockable rhythms of ventricular fibrillation (VF) (I49.0 and I49.01) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) (I49.02) between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2018 were included. Patients were stratified into two groups according to whether they received CA (CA and no‐CA groups) (Figure 1). Those with ≥ 1 mm STE on initial ECG (assessed on arrival in emergency department) were omitted. Patients were subsequently separated into survivor and nonsurvivor groups for comparison to evaluate independent predictors of in‐hospital mortality. OHCA with shockable rhythm was defined as a sudden pulseless event with lack of effective cardiac output where VF or VT was recorded as the initial rhythm. Those with nonshockable rhythms (pulseless electrical activity or asystole) and in‐hospital cardiac arrest (occurring after arrival in emergency department) were excluded. Patients who died before arrival at hospital or before a decision to activate the catheterization laboratory could be made were also excluded.

Clinical data including demographic characteristics, past medical conditions, periarrest variables, clinical examination findings, investigation results (including initial biochemistry, admission ECG, and bedside echocardiography), angiographic results, PCI procedural data, and in‐hospital outcomes were collected from medical charts. Data were cross‐verified by study authors (W.Z. S.N. R.B. and L.H.) when deemed unclear or ambiguous.

### Implementation of a comprehensive ST-elevation myocardial infarction protocol improves mortality among patients with ST-Elevation myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock [^1c25d3bd]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Mortality in patients with STEMI-associated cardiogenic shock (CS) is increasing. Whether a comprehensive ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) protocol (CSP) can improve their care delivery and mortality is unknown. We evaluated the impact of a CSP on incidence and outcomes in patients with STEMI-associated CS. We implemented a 4-step CSP including: (1) Emergency Department catheterization lab activation; (2) STEMI Safe Handoff Checklist; (3) immediate catheterization lab transfer; (4) and radial-first percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We studied 1,272 consecutive STEMI patients who underwent PCI and assessed for CS incidence per National Cardiovascular Data Registry definitions within 24-hours of PCI, care delivery, and mortality before (January 1, 2011, to July 14, 2014; n = 723) and after (July 15, 2014, to December 31, 2016; n = 549) CSP implementation. Following CSP implementation, CS incidence was reduced (13.0% vs 7.8%, p = 0.003). Of 137 CS patients, 43 (31.4%) were in the CSP group. CSP patients had greater IABP-Shock II risk scores (1.9 ± 1.8 vs 2.8 ± 2.2, p = 0.014) with otherwise similar hemodynamic and baseline characteristics, cardiac arrest incidence, and mechanical circulatory support use. Administration of guideline-directed medical therapy was similar (89.4% vs 97.7%, p = 0.172) with significant improvements in trans-radial PCI (9.6% vs 44.2%, p < 0.001) and door-to-balloon time (129.0 [89:160] vs 95.0 [81:116] minutes, p = 0.001) in the CSP group, translating to improvements in infarct size (CK-MB 220.9 ± 156.0 vs 151.5 ± 98.5 ng/ml, p = 0.005), ejection fraction (40.8 ± 14.5% vs 46.7 ± 14.6%, p = 0.037), and in-hospital mortality (30.9% vs 14.0%, p = 0.037). In conclusion, CSP implementation was associated with improvements in CS incidence, infarct size, ejection fraction, and in-hospital mortality in patients with STEMI-associated CS. This strategy offers a potential solution to bridging the historically elusive gap in their care.

### Cost analysis from a randomized comparison of immediate versus delayed angiography after cardiac arrest [^f0d77b50]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The outcome of patients with out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) remains poor, with survival to hospital discharge ranging between 10% and 30%. Even after the return of spontaneous circulation has been achieved, mortality is still around 40%. The leading cause of in‐hospital mortality is poor neurologic outcome, which cannot be predicted in the early phase after cardiac arrest.

While international guidelines recommend emergency coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in selected patients after OHCA, the right timing of intervention is still under debate. However, emergency angiography in patients without a coronary or ischemic cause of the OHCA can further delay evidence‐based interventions on survival such as targeted temperature management and hemodynamic support. The COACT (Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest) trial (Netherlands Trial Register number NL4857) was designed to address this issue. In this investigator‐initiated, randomized, open‐label, multicenter trial, a strategy of immediate CAG was compared with a strategy of delayed angiography in patients who had been successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest and did not have ST‐segment elevation on ECG. With respect to 90‐day survival no significant difference was seen between the 2 groups. Also, no improvement in 1‐year clinical outcome was observed. A recent meta‐analysis of 3581 patients (11 studies) also found no significant difference in 30‐day mortality, neurological outcome, and PCI rate between early versus nonearly CAG in OHCA without ST‐segment elevation.

In case of equivalence with regard to health outcomes, it is important to assess the costs related to either strategy. Significant differences in costs between the 2 modalities can provide information for policymaking and help in final decision making about the implementation of either an immediate or delayed angiography strategy in patients after OHCA without ST‐segment elevation. Total costs related to managing patients with OHCA are mainly driven by in‐hospital costs and length of stay at the intensive care unit (ICU) during the initial hospitalization. We performed a prespecified cost‐consequence analysis based on the hospital stay and collected RAND‐36 quality‐of‐life scores at 12 months.

### PICS / AEPC / APPCS / CSANZ / SCAI / SOLACI: expert consensus statement on cardiac Catheterization for pediatric patients and adults with congenital heart Disease [^1d595d35]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). High credibility.

Preparedness, activation, and logistics for backup — a formal protocol should describe how surgical and/or ECMO backup is activated, and given the multiple tasks required in an emergency the entire activation process should ideally be initiated in a single step by a designated cath lab team member; if a patient can be sufficiently stabilized, in most circumstances a transfer to the specialized cardiothoracic OR is preferable to performing a procedure in a cath lab environment. In resource-limited environments, procedures sometimes may need to be performed without an option for surgical backup, circulatory support using cardiopulmonary bypass can serve as an alternative backup when an established ECMO program is not available, and without the availability of ECMO and/or surgical backup the presence of experienced operators and an understanding of rescue protocols is important.

### 2025 ACC / AHA / ACEP / NAEMSP / SCAI guideline for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^7c0a7345]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) care system pathway — patients with symptoms suggestive of ACS: "Patient calls 911: preferred"; emergency medical services (EMS) obtains a prehospital electrocardiogram within 10 min of first medical contact (FMC) and suspects ST‑segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (Class 1), and if transporting to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) center, perform "Prehospital cath lab activation (Class 1)" with "Direct transport to PCI center for PPCI (Class 1)", "Bypass ED (if feasible):", and a "Goal EMS FMC-to-device ≤ 90 min (Class 1)"; at both non‑PCI and PCI centers ensure "Door-to-ECG ≤ 10 min (Class 1)", diagnose STEMI, and at PCI centers "Activate cath lab"; at non‑PCI centers, use a "Fibrinolysis strategy" "If PPCI not feasible within 120 min of FMC (Class 1)" with "Goal door-to-lysis ≤ 30 min", then "Arrange for immediate transfer to PCI center" — "If lysis failed or patient unstable, arrange for urgent angiography for rescue PCI (Class 1)" or "If lysis successful and patient stable, arrange for early angiography (Class 1)"; alternatively adopt a "PPCI strategy" "If PPCI feasible within 120 min of FMC, or lysis contraindicated (Class 1)" with "Activate cath lab for PPCI" and "Urgent transfer to PCI center (bypass ED, direct to cath lab, if feasible)", proceeding to the cath lab with a "Goal FMC-to-device ≤ 90 min (direct presenters) or ≤ 120 min (transfers) (Class 1)".

### Ghrelin for neuroprotection in post-cardiac arrest coma: a randomized clinical trial… [^500a2e85]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question Is treatment with the endogenous hormone ghrelin safe and potentially efficacious in improving the neurological outcome of patients in a coma after cardiac arrest. Findings In this phase 2, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized clinical trial that included 160 patients in a coma within 12 hours of cardiac arrest, treatment with intravenous acyl-ghrelin for 1 week was safe. Neurological outcome by the cerebral performance categories was nonsignificantly better, and neuron-specific enolase levels were significantly lower in the intervention group. Interventions Patients were randomized to receive intravenous acyl-ghrelin, 600 μg, or placebo within 12 hours after cardiac arrest, continued for 7 days, twice daily, in addition to standard care. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was the score on the Cerebral Performance Categories scale at 6 months. Safety outcomes included any serious adverse events.

Secondary outcomes were mortality and neuron-specific enolase levels on days 1 and 3. Eligible patients were 18 years or older and in a coma after resuscitation for cardiac arrest. Patients had to be included within 12 hours after return of spontaneous circulation. Our primary analysis was a complete case analysis in the ITT population, including all patients with a CPC follow-up at 6 months. Sensitivity analyses were based on last observation carried forward for patients with a missing CPC at 6 months, where prospectively collected CPC scores at 3 months were used, provided less than 5% loss to follow-up at 6 months. Additional sensitivity analysis was done in patients without withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. Six months after cardiac arrest, the common OR for an improvement in the intervention group was 1.
78.

The observed improvment in the intervention group was consistent over all categories of the CPC. Results were essentially similar in modified ITT analyses, per-protocol analyses, as well as in the population based on last observation carried forward.

### Updates in cardiac arrest resuscitation [^99d89568]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

There are approximately 350,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests annually in the United States, with survival rates of approximately 5% to 10% and 24%, respectively. The critical factors that have an impact on cardiac arrest survival include prompt recognition and activation of prehospital care, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and rapid defibrillation. Advanced life support protocols are continually refined to optimize intracardiac arrest management and improve survival with favorable neurologic outcome. This article focuses on current treatment recommendations for adult nontraumatic cardiac arrest, with emphasis on the latest evidence and controversies regarding intracardiac arrest management.

### Emergency vs delayed coronary angiogram in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: results of the randomized, multicentric EMERGE trial [^b7a7f41d]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Although an emergency coronary angiogram (CAG) is recommended for patients who experience an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with ST-segment elevation on the postresuscitation electrocardiogram (ECG), this strategy is still debated in patients without ST-segment elevation.

Objective

To assess the 180-day survival rate with Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) 1 or 2 of patients who experience an OHCA without ST-segment elevation on ECG and undergo emergency CAG vs delayed CAG.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Emergency vs Delayed Coronary Angiogram in Survivors of Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (EMERGE) trial randomly assigned survivors of an OHCA without ST-segment elevation on ECG to either emergency or delayed (48 to 96 hours) CAG in 22 French centers. The trial took place from January 19, 2017, to November 23, 2020. Data were analyzed from November 24, 2020, to July 30, 2021.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the 180-day survival rate with CPC of 2 or less. The secondary end points were occurrence of shock, ventricular tachycardia, and/or fibrillation within 48 hours, change in left ventricular ejection fraction between baseline and 180 days, CPC scale at intensive care unit discharge and day 90, survival rate, and hospital length of stay.

Results

A total of 279 patients (mean [SD] age, 64.7 [14.6] years; 195 men [69.9%]) were enrolled, with 141 (50.5%) in the emergency CAG group and 138 (49.5%) in the delayed CAG group. The study was underpowered. The mean (SD) time delay between randomization and CAG was 0.6(3.7) hours in the emergency CAG group and 55.1(37.2) hours in the delayed CAG group. The 180-day survival rates among patients with a CPC of 2 or less were 34.1% (47 of 141) in the emergency CAG group and 30.7% (42 of 138) in the delayed CAG group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65–1.15; P = 0.32). There was no difference in the overall survival rate at 180 days (emergency CAG, 36.2% [51 of 141] vs delayed CAG, 33.3% [46 of 138]; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.64–1.15; P = 0.31) and in secondary outcomes between the 2 groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, for patients who experience an OHCA without ST-segment elevation on ECG, a strategy of emergency CAG was not better than a strategy of delayed CAG with respect to 180-day survival rate and minimal neurologic sequelae.

### Advanced life support. neuroprognostication after cardiac arrest and ROSC: prediction of good neurological outcome [^e5957e75]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support — Glasgow Coma Scale motor score within 4 days after cardiac arrest in comatose adults: A CoSTR by ILCOR summarized evidence for the use of the Glasgow Coma Scale motor score evaluated within 4 days in adults who are comatose after resuscitation from cardiac arrest, and regardless of target temperature, with the systematic review identifying two observational studies. In the first study with 342 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, a Glasgow Coma Scale motor score greater than 3 on day 4 after cardiac arrest predicted favorable outcome at 6 months (specificity, 84%; 95% CI, 79%–88%; sensitivity, 77%; 95% CI, 67%–85%), and a Glasgow Coma Scale motor score of 3 to 5 on day 4 predicted favorable outcome with a specificity of 72% (95% CI, 66%–77%) and sensitivity of 96% (95% CI, 93%–97%). In a second study with 302 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, a Glasgow Coma Scale motor score of 4 to 5 on intensive care unit admission predicted a favorable outcome at 3 months (specificity, 98%; 95% CI, 93%–99%; sensitivity, 12%; 95% CI, 7%–17%). Very low-certainty evidence from these two studies supports a weak treatment recommendation by ILCOR to assess the Glasgow Coma Scale motor score in the first 4 days after cardiac arrest to identify patients with a score higher than 3, which may indicate an increased likelihood of favorable outcome.

### SCAI position statement on optimal percutaneous coronary interventional therapy for complex coronary artery disease [^9d68db86]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). High credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) — percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) strategy and timing: PCI reduces morbidity and mortality in ACS, and minimizing the time to reperfusion in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requires coordinated transfer systems and early cath lab activation. An early invasive strategy is preferred for non-STEMI patients at higher risk, though PCI in ACS has higher adverse event rates than elective PCI. Adjunctive antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy can help reduce procedural risk. In STEMI with multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), complete revascularization is associated with improved long-term outcomes, and staging procedures for non-culprit stenoses appears to be safe if performed in a timely fashion.

Optimal timing, patient selection, location and method of implementation vary across the world. The objective here is to present an international consensus on the pillars of an ECPR program. The major aspect the group agrees on in that ECPR should be implemented within 60 minutes of collapse. With this in mind, the program should be built according to local resources knowing that the optimal team will require pre-established specific roles with personnel dedicated to resuscitation and others to ECPR.

### The evolving role of the cardiac catheterization laboratory in the management of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^4563fac2]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease is prevalent in different causes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), especially in individuals presenting with shockable rhythms of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pVT). The purpose of this report is to review the known prevalence and potential importance of coronary artery disease in patients with OHCA and to describe the emerging paradigm of treatment with advanced perfusion/reperfusion techniques and their potential benefits on the basis of available evidence. Although randomized clinical trials are planned or ongoing, current scientific evidence rests principally on observational case series with their potential confounding selection bias. Among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA with ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 70% to 85%. More than 90% of these patients have had successful percutaneous coronary intervention. Conversely, among patients resuscitated from VF/pVT OHCA without ST-segment elevation on their postresuscitation ECG, the prevalence of coronary artery disease has been shown to be 25% to 50%. For these patients, early access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory is associated with a 10% to 15% absolute higher functionally favorable survival rate compared with more conservative approaches of late or no access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory. In patients with VF/pVT OHCA refractory to standard treatment, a new treatment paradigm is also emerging that uses venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to facilitate return of normal perfusion and to support further resuscitation efforts, including coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. The burden of coronary artery disease is high in this patient population, presumably causative in most patients. The strategy of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, coronary angiography, and percutaneous coronary intervention has resulted in functionally favorable survival rates ranging from 9% to 45% in observational studies in this patient population. Patients with VF/pVT should be considered at the highest severity in the continuum of acute coronary syndromes. These patients have a significant burden of coronary artery disease and acute coronary thrombotic events. Evidence from randomized trials will further define optimal clinical practice.

### Early access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest due to a shockable rhythm: the Minnesota resuscitation consortium twin cities unified protocol [^85ade5d9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Each year over 300 000 out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) occur in the United States. 1 Despite efforts to increase awareness and training of the general population, outcomes remain poor with reported survival to hospital admission and hospital discharge of 26% and 9.6%, respectively. 2

There has been increased recognition of the importance of post–cardiac arrest care after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). 3 One of the objectives of post–‐cardiac arrest care is to identify and treat the reversible causes of the arrest and prevent recurrent arrest. 3 Early coronary angiography in survivors of OHCA reveals clinically significant coronary artery disease in 71% of patients and acute coronary artery occlusion in 48% of patients. 4 Coronary revascularization has been proven beneficial for patients with ST‐segment elevation myocardial infarction on their postarrest ECG. 5, 6, 7, 8 However, it is clinically difficult to decide if and when to perform coronary angiography in patients resuscitated from OHCA who remain comatose and do not have a current consistent with injury on their postarrest ECG. 4, 5, 9, 10

In October 2012, the Minnesota Resuscitation Consortium (MRC) developed an organized approach for the management of all patients resuscitated from shockable (ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia) rhythms in the metro area of Minneapolis‐St. Paul to gain early access to the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) irrespective of ECG findings. We hypothesized that a large proportion of patients presenting with VT/VF have ischemic heart disease as the underlying cause for their cardiac arrest regardless of the presence or absence of ST elevation on the postresuscitation ECG. Our aim was to determine feasibility of a strategy of rapid access to CCL and prompt revascularization of VT/VF patients. We also wanted to obtain preliminary estimates of clinical efficacy. In this article, we report our 2‐year experience with the MRC protocol.

### Coronary angiography in cardiac arrest: does timing matter? | NEJM resident 360… [^e6b641bc]. resident360.nejm.org (2019). Medium credibility.

Although spontaneous circulation was restored, Mr. Sampson remained unconscious. The ECG showed no ST-segment elevation. En route to the emergency department, the paramedics notified the interventional cardiologist and asked, "Should we come directly to the cath lab for emergent coronary angiography". Despite the best resuscitation efforts in patients who remain unconscious after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, survival rates are low, and a large proportion of survivors have significant long-term neurological complications. Although we know that many of these patients have underlying coronary artery disease, the question of whether urgent coronary angiography leads to improved survival or long-term neurologic and cardiac outcomes is uncertain, particularly when a patient has no evidence of ST-segment elevation to suggest acute coronary occlusion. Lemkes et al. addressed this question in a multicentre randomized trial recently published in NEJM.

Participants who were unconscious after resuscitation from cardiac arrest and had no evidence of ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction were randomized to undergo immediate coronary angiography after resuscitation or delayed coronary angiography during hospitalization. Percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in both groups if indicated. The results showed that 90-day survival did not differ between the immediate- and delayed-coronary angiography groups, suggesting that coronary angiography does not need to be performed immediately in this setting. The following NEJM Journal Watch summary further explains the study and findings: The COACT trial found no difference in survival with immediate versus delayed angiography. The benefit of immediate coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention after cardiac arrest in the absence of ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction is not known.

In the Coronary Angiography after Cardiac Arrest trial, investigators from the Netherlands randomized 552 such patients to either immediate or delayed coronary angiography — and, for both, PCI if indicated. The primary endpoint was 90-day survival. Comment: In the COACT trial, immediate coronary angiography and PCI, if indicated, for people with cardiac arrest in the absence of STEMI was not better than a delayed strategy. The finding may be explained by the low rate of occlusive thrombus and the fact that neurologic injury was the most common cause of death. There is more to come; editorialists note that two additional trials of this population are under way. Browse more From Pages to Practice ».

### Late outcomes of patients with prehospital ST-segment elevation and appropriate cardiac catheterization laboratory nonactivation [^d6d0fb53]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

All analyses were performed using R (v4.1.2, Vienna, Austria) and the survival and cmprsk packages. Categorical variables are presented as frequency (%) and continuous variables as medians with interquartile range. Pearson Chi‐squared or Fisher exact tests were used to compare categorical variables, and the Mann‐Whitney U test was used for continuous variables. Risk ratios (RR) for the primary and secondary outcomes with 95% CI are presented. Adjusted RR were obtained using a generalized linear model with a log link, Poisson error distribution, and were adjusted for the following clinically relevant covariates: age, sex, diabetes, previous MI, previous stroke, cardiac arrest, bundle branch block (categorized as left bundle‐branch block, right bundle‐branch block and no bundle‐branch block) and troponin T elevation (categorized as troponin T elevation versus no troponin T elevation). These covariates were concurrently forced into the crude models. We produced Kaplan–Meier survival curves stratified by CCL activation. Patients lost to follow up were considered censored.

We used multivariable Cox‐regression modeling adjusted for the same covariates to obtain hazard ratios (HR) for all‐cause death. To explore competing risks of the composite cardiovascular outcome of cardiovascular death/MI/stroke and noncardiovascular death, cause‐specific HRs were obtained and adjusted for the same covariates. Penalized splines were applied to age to accommodate departures from linearity. We checked for nonproportional hazards graphically and using scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Categorical covariates with time‐varying effects were stratified using the strata statement within the coxph function of the survival package. Final models satisfied Cox proportional hazards assumptions. To further explore competing risks, we used the cumulative incidence function to produce cumulative incidence curves. In a prespecified subgroup analysis of patients who had CCL nonactivation, we examined associations between covariates and future risk for all‐cause death, the composite cardiovascular outcome of cardiovascular death/MI/stroke, and noncardiovascular death. These models were adjusted for the same covariates as the generalized linear models in addition to the pattern of myocardial injury (instead of troponin T elevation; categorized as MI, myocardial injury and no myocardial injury), to estimate the excess hazard associated with different patterns of myocardial injury. Finally, we performed a post hoc sensitivity analyses to examine the potential confounding effect of inappropriate CCL activations and nonactivations. In this analysis, we compared appropriate CCL nonactivations to appropriate activations.

### Clinical prediction score for patients with initial nonshockable rhythm receiving extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: development and internal validation [^8ed191e0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Key Findings and Strengths

This study developed and internally validated a prediction scoring system (START‐ECPR Score) designed to support decision‐making for ECPR implementation in patients with OHCA with an initial nonshockable rhythm. The score provides a simple and practical tool for rapid assessment at hospital arrival. According to the START‐ECPR Score, patients with scores of 2 to 3 showed a higher survival rate to hospital discharge and more favorable neurological outcomes. In contrast, those with a score of 0 had an extremely low probability of survival and favorable neurological outcomes. Our study has several strengths. First, this scoring system exclusively focused on patients with OHCA with an initial nonshockable rhythm, a population that has not been prioritized as ECPR candidates due to their generally poorer outcomes and the limited evidence available for patient selection compared with those with initial shockable rhythms. Consequently, this study may offer novel and original insights for ECPR practices. Second, the 3 factors included in our scoring system — cardiac rhythm at hospital arrival, ROSC, and SOL — can be quickly assessed without the need for laboratory results. This feature makes our prediction score both practical for clinical decision‐making and easily interpretable when determining whether to initiate ECPR.

The "rate of survival to discharge with good neurologic function among OHCA patients is low with wide geographical variation estimated at 8.0–20%," and "Anoxic brain injury and postcardiac arrest shock share common risk factors that are related to the timing and quality of pre hospital care."

### Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a systematic review of current risk scores to predict survival [^0c4b771a]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Importance

The arrest and the post-arrest period are an incredibly emotionally traumatic time for family and friends of the affected individual. There is a need to assess prognosis early in the patient pathway to offer objective, realistic and non-emotive information to the next-of-kin regarding the likelihood of survival.

Objective

To present a systematic review of the clinical risk scores available to assess patients on admission following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) which can predict in-hospital mortality.

Evidence Review

A systematic search of online databases Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted up until 20th November 2020.

Findings

Out of 1,817 initial articles, we identified a total of 28 scoring systems, with 11 of the scores predicting mortality following OHCA included in this review. The majority of the scores included arrest characteristics (initial rhythm and time to return of spontaneous circulation) as prognostic indicators. Out of these, the 3 most clinically-useful scores, namely those which are easy-to-use, comprise of commonly available parameters and measurements, and which have high predictive value are the OHCA, NULL-PLEASE, and rCAST scores, which appear to perform similarly. Of these, the NULL-PLEASE score is the easiest to calculate and has also been externally validated.

Conclusions

Clinicians should be aware of these risk scores, which can be used to provide objective, nonemotive and reproducible information to the next-of-kin on the likely prognosis following OHCA. However, in isolation, these scores should not form the basis for clinical decision-making.

### Refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation at hospital arrival-survival and neurological outcome without extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^264e8b09]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Postresuscitation care

Patients were admitted to the nearest hospital, either one of two university heart centers or one of six nontertiary university hospitals. In case of signs of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the patient was admitted to a heart center for acute coronary angiography (CAG). In case of ROSC, all comatose patients were subsequently treated in an intensive care unit (ICU). Patients could be referred to a heart center for advanced treatment at any time during the hospital stay. A single investigator reviewed all individual patient charts with a focus on in-hospital postresuscitation care.

In-hospital treatment was terminated if prospect of recovery was not present on the basis of clinical assessment and parameters such as burden of comorbidities, echocardiogram, electroencephalography (EEG), inability to get off ventilator, and blood test results.

Data collection

By using the personal identification number provided to all Danish residents, we linked the OHCA cohort to the Danish Civil Registration Registry, which holds vital status on all Danish citizens, and primary outcome of the current study (30-day mortality) was obtained. All diagnoses and surgical procedures from all hospital admissions are continually registered in the National Patient Registry. On the basis of obtained data on comorbidity, coexisting conditions, and surgical procedures, we calculated the Charlson comorbidity Index (CCI). In addition, neurological outcome at hospital discharge was assessed from patient charts with the Cerebral Performance Categories scale (CPC). Favorable neurological outcome was defined as CPC 1 or 2, nonfavorable as 3–4, and dead as CPC 5. Data on termination of active therapy was also acquired from patient charts.

Prearrest prediction of survival following in-hospital cardiac arrest — guideline stance and context — states that prearrest prediction rules should not be used as the sole reason to not resuscitate an adult with in-hospital cardiac arrest. The section explains that the ability to use a clinical decision tool to predict survival to hospital discharge could help healthcare professionals understand which patients will benefit from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and which will not, that such a tool could guide discussions and decision-making for starting or abstaining from CPR (i.e., do-not-attempt-CPR), and that many different scoring systems have been designed to predict survival or nonsurvival in in-hospital cardiac arrest.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — pathophysiology, trial scope, and risk factors note that the presence of STEMI or STEMI-equivalent pattern on ECG after cardiac arrest implies transmural myocardial ischemia and a high probability of acute coronary occlusion, which can result in worsening cardiovascular instability if not promptly revascularized; randomized controlled trials examining the optimal timing of coronary angiography after OHCA systematically excluded patients with STEMI; evaluating for CAD prior to hospital discharge with invasive coronary angiography in cardiac arrest survivors with a presumed cardiac etiology is supported by other cardiology-focused guidelines and scientific statements and trials of timing performed invasive coronary angiography in all patients with neurological awakening; cardiogenic shock or recurrent ventricular arrhythmias after cardiac arrest can be caused by severe myocardial ischemia and patients with these unstable conditions are at high risk of re arrest if ischemia goes untreated; randomized clinical trials allowed crossover to the emergent arm for shock, recurrent VF, or evidence of severe myocardial ischemia, while elevated serum troponin levels and ischemic ECG abnormalities other than STEMI have inadequate sensitivity or specificity for unstable CAD and do not predict the benefit of invasive coronary angiography.

Table 5
Subgroup Results

Our findings suggest potential benefit for early coronary revascularization in patients presenting with PEA who have known or suspected coronary artery disease or LV dysfunction with a goal of rapid reversal of ischemia and salvage of remaining viable myocardium. Because all animals with PEA developed VF in the absence of prior preconditioning, humans that develop VF subsequent to PEA may have an even greater need for emergent revascularization because they may lack the spontaneous IPC (ie, absence of preinfarct angina) that could occur during acute myocardial infarction.

Although it is clear that immediate coronary angiography is indicated for OHCA with STEMI, the management of OHCA without STEMI remains uncertain despite a substantial incidence of coronary artery disease and ACO. The European Association of Percutaneous Cardiovascular Interventions guidelines recommend coronary angiography within 2 hours for all comatose patients with OHCA after initial assessment to exclude obvious noncardiac causes of arrest, whereas the American Heart Association 2015 guidelines reserve emergent angiography for patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction or predictors of ACO, and clinical instability. Clinical randomized controlled trials are currently evaluating whether a universal early coronary angiography strategy improves patient‐centered outcomes after OHCA in those with shockable and nonshockable rhythms and with and without STEMI on the postarrest ECG.

### Coronary angiography after cardiac arrest without ST segment elevation: one-year outcomes of the COACT… [^007b7a96]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective To determine whether immediate coronary angiography improves clinical outcomes at 1 year in patients after cardiac arrest without signs of STEMI, compared with a delayed coronary angiography strategy. Design, Setting, and Participants. Conclusions and Relevance In this trial of patients successfully resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and without signs of STEMI, a strategy of immediate angiography was not found to be superior to a strategy of delayed angiography with respect to clinical outcomes at 1 year. Coronary angiography in this patient group can therefore be delayed until after neurologic recovery without affecting outcomes.

The Coronary Angiography After Cardiac Arrest trial was designed to test the hypothesis that, in patients successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest in the absence of STEMI, a strategy of immediate coronary angiography and PCI, if necessary, results in better survival compared with a strategy of coronary angiography delayed until after neurologic recovery. The COACT trial was an investigator-initiated, randomized, open-label, multicenter trial comparing immediate vs delayed coronary angiography in patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation on the ECG tracing. The trial design has been published previously. 7 The protocol was developed by 3 of us and was approved by the steering committee and all relevant ethics committees.

The COACT multicenter, randomized clinical trial compared immediate coronary angiography with delayed coronary angiography in patients successfully resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without ST-segment elevation on the ECG and in the absence of an obvious noncoronary cause of the arrest. In the COACT trial, 90-day survival did not differ significantly between the 2 treatment strategies. 5 In the analyses reported herein, we found no significant difference in survival at 1 year between the immediate and delayed coronary angiography groups. In this randomized clinical trial of patients who were successfully resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and without signs of STEMI, an immediate angiography strategy did not improve 1-year clinical outcomes compared with a delayed angiography strategy.
