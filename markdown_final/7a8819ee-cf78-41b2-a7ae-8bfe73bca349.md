## Question

Medication for antimuscarinic induced diarrhea in a patient with myasthenia gravis. Glycopyrrolate vs other meds

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriateness of using glycopyrrolate to treat antimuscarinic-induced diarrhea in a patient with myasthenia gravis, and what safer alternative medications might be considered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis and how antimuscarinic drugs affect neuromuscular transmission. Then, I should verify glycopyrrolate's pharmacology and labeled contraindications in MG. Next, I will review the specific FDA labeling language across glycopyrrolate formulations to ensure consistency. After that, I need to consider the mechanism of antimuscarinic-induced diarrhea and whether adding another antimuscarinic would be counterproductive. Finally, I will identify safer, evidence-based alternatives and outline a practical management plan with monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder with impaired neuromuscular transmission due to acetylcholine receptor blockade or degradation, and symptomatic therapy often includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine, which increase synaptic acetylcholine but also cause muscarinic side effects like diarrhea, cramping, and hypersalivation [^115tWNob] [^117EJAar]. Wait, let me verify the muscarinic burden: yes, pyridostigmine's adverse effects are predominantly muscarinic, including diarrhea, which is exactly why antimuscarinics are sometimes considered to blunt cholinergic GI effects, but I need to ensure we do not worsen neuromuscular weakness in MG by further reducing cholinergic signaling [^117EJAar].

> Now, I will examine glycopyrrolate's pharmacology and labeled contraindications. Glycopyrrolate is a competitive muscarinic antagonist that blocks acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, thereby reducing secretions and GI motility; importantly, multiple FDA labels explicitly contraindicate glycopyrrolate in myasthenia gravis due to the risk of worsening muscle weakness and respiratory compromise, and this contraindication appears consistently across oral tablets, oral solution, and injectable formulations [^114FudQC] [^111QUr4L] [^117PqPwa]. Hold on, I should verify the rationale: by antagonizing muscarinic receptors, glycopyrrolate can further impair already compromised neuromuscular transmission in MG, potentially precipitating or worsening weakness, including bulbar and respiratory muscles, which is why it is listed as a contraindication rather than a mere precaution [^114FudQC] [^111QUr4L].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought glycopyrrolate might be reasonable to counter muscarinic diarrhea from pyridostigmine because it is used with neostigmine to mitigate bradycardia during neuromuscular blockade reversal. But hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — that perioperative use is a different context where short-term coadministration is intended to blunt cardiovascular muscarinic effects during reversal, and it does not imply safety or appropriateness for chronic GI symptom control in MG patients. In fact, the same labeling that allows coadministration for bradycardia still lists myasthenia gravis as a contraindication for glycopyrrolate itself, underscoring the mechanistic risk in MG [^117EJAar] [^1173ypha] [^114FudQC]. I should double-check: yes, the labels consistently advise caution or contraindication in MG, reinforcing that glycopyrrolate should not be used for routine antidiarrheal management in this population [^114FudQC] [^111QUr4L].

> Next, I should review the mechanism of the diarrhea we are trying to treat. The diarrhea here is muscarinic/cholinergic, driven by excess acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors due to acetylcholinesterase inhibition; adding another antimuscarinic like glycopyrrolate would reduce GI motility and secretions but at the cost of further decreasing cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction, which is precisely the wrong direction in MG and can worsen weakness or precipitate crisis, so the risk-benefit is unfavorable in this setting [^117EJAar] [^114FudQC]. Let me reconsider: is there any niche where glycopyrrolate helps diarrhea in MG? I should confirm — no, the contraindication remains, and the pathophysiologic rationale is consistently negative for MG [^114FudQC] [^111QUr4L].

> I will now identify safer, evidence-based alternatives. Loperamide is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor agonist that slows intestinal transit without antimuscarinic effects and is recommended as first-line antidiarrheal therapy in adults with noninfectious diarrhea; it does not antagonize acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors and therefore avoids the neuromuscular risks inherent to anticholinergics in MG [^112sCVTS]. But wait, what if opioid effects are a concern? In MG, the principal risk is respiratory depression in overdose or in those with severe bulbar weakness; used at standard doses with caution, loperamide is generally acceptable, and if symptoms persist or opioid-related adverse effects emerge, diphenoxylate with atropine can be considered as an alternative antidiarrheal adjunct, recognizing the small atropine component and monitoring for anticholinergic effects, though the atropine dose is low and often clinically negligible for neuromuscular effects in this context [^115feVAN] [^112sCVTS]. I should confirm dosing guidance: typical loperamide dosing starts with 4 mg then 2 mg after each loose stool to a maximum of 16 mg/day, with reassessment if no control in 24–48 hours, which aligns with infectious diarrhea guidance adapted to noninfectious drug-induced diarrhea when infection is excluded [^112sCVTS].

> Let me think about additional non-anticholinergic options if needed. Racecadotril, an enkephalinase inhibitor that reduces intestinal hypersecretion without affecting motility, has evidence of efficacy and a favorable constipation profile compared with loperamide in acute infectious diarrhea; while data are strongest in infectious settings, its mechanism is mechanistically attractive for cholinergic hypersecretion and may be considered off-label when standard therapy is insufficient or contraindicated, with the caveat that evidence in drug-induced diarrhea is limited and local access may vary [^115HU9bM]. I should double-check: yes, it is a reasonable second-line consideration when anticholinergics are to be avoided and loperamide is ineffective or not tolerated, acknowledging the evidence gap and the need for clinical judgment [^115HU9bM].

> Next, I should review the overarching management strategy for MG-related cholinergic diarrhea. The most targeted approach is to optimize pyridostigmine dosing to the lowest effective dose, split doses, and consider extended-release formulations to minimize peak muscarinic effects; if muscarinic side effects persist, short-term use of low-dose atropine can be used to blunt muscarinic symptoms in select cases, but chronic antimuscarinic therapy is not recommended due to the risk of worsening MG, and glycopyrrolate should be avoided entirely in MG outside of carefully monitored perioperative contexts for bradycardia mitigation [^115tWNob] [^113vZgVy] [^115S9Ddb]. Hold on, I should verify the atropine point: yes, brief, low-dose atropine can be used to counter muscarinic effects of anticholinesterases in MG, but sustained antimuscarinic therapy is discouraged because of potential disease worsening, reinforcing that glycopyrrolate has no role here [^113vZgVy] [^114FudQC].

> I need to ensure we address red flags and monitoring. Before treating diarrhea symptomatically, I should confirm there is no infectious etiology, C. difficile, or intestinal obstruction, especially if severe, persistent, or accompanied by systemic symptoms. In MG, any exacerbation of weakness, dysphagia, or respiratory symptoms warrants urgent evaluation for myasthenic or cholinergic crisis and potential escalation of care, and new or worsening diarrhea in the setting of immunosuppressive therapy should prompt infection screening and medication review [^111Qhugr] [^115tWNob]. Let me verify: yes, these precautions are consistent with MG guidance and infectious diarrhea best practices, and they help prevent masking a serious process with symptomatic antidiarrheals [^115tWNob] [^111Qhugr].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. Glycopyrrolate is contraindicated in myasthenia gravis and should not be used to treat antimuscarinic-induced diarrhea in this population because it can worsen neuromuscular weakness. Instead, use loperamide as first-line symptomatic therapy, consider diphenoxylate with atropine if loperamide is inadequate or not tolerated, and consider racecadotril as a non-anticholinergic alternative when available, all while optimizing pyridostigmine dosing and monitoring for disease exacerbation or alternative causes of diarrhea [^114FudQC] [^115feVAN] [^115HU9bM] [^115tWNob]. Hold on, I should verify one last time: the contraindication is consistent across glycopyrrolate formulations, and the recommended alternatives do not impose anticholinergic neuromuscular risks, aligning with both safety and mechanism in MG [^114FudQC] [^111QUr4L] [^111u1JRz].

---

Glycopyrrolate is **contraindicated in myasthenia gravis** because it can worsen muscle weakness and precipitate crisis [^114FudQC] [^111QUr4L]. For antimuscarinic-induced diarrhea in MG, **loperamide is preferred** for its efficacy and safety, and diphenoxylate/atropine is an alternative if needed [^112sCVTS] [^115feVAN]. Avoid other anticholinergics (e.g. dicyclomine, oxybutynin) due to risk of exacerbating MG [^112PjReR] [^111ajfUH]. If diarrhea persists, evaluate for other causes and adjust the offending antimuscarinic when possible.

---

## Pharmacological rationale and risks of glycopyrrolate in MG

Glycopyrrolate is a **competitive antagonist at muscarinic receptors**, reducing acetylcholine's effect at the neuromuscular junction and thereby worsening MG symptoms [^116BktVw]. Its use in MG is contraindicated because it can precipitate or exacerbate weakness, including respiratory compromise and crisis [^114FudQC] [^111QUr4L].

---

## Alternative pharmacological management of antimuscarinic-induced diarrhea

Given glycopyrrolate's contraindication, **alternative therapies** should be considered:

| **Medication** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical considerations in mg** |
|-|-|-|
| Loperamide | Peripheral μ-opioid agonist reducing intestinal motility | - Safe in MG <br/> - Preferred first-line <br/> - Minimal CNS penetration [^112sCVTS] |
| Diphenoxylate/atropine | - Peripheral opioid agonist <br/> - Anticholinergic | - Alternative to loperamide <br/> - Use cautiously due to anticholinergic component [^112sCVTS] [^112GBFde] |
| Racecadotril | Enkephalinase inhibitor reducing intestinal secretion | - Safe in MG <br/> - Alternative option [^115HU9bM] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize avoiding anticholinergics in MG due to the risk of exacerbating weakness; instead, **use non-anticholinergic antidiarrheals** such as loperamide or racecadotril [^111ajfUH] [^115cfqGa] [^115HU9bM].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profiles

Loperamide effectively controls diarrhea with minimal adverse effects in MG, whereas glycopyrrolate and other anticholinergics can worsen weakness and precipitate crisis; **loperamide is preferred** for its safety and efficacy [^115cfqGa] [^114FudQC].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Avoid glycopyrrolate**: Contraindicated in MG due to risk of exacerbating weakness [^114FudQC].
- **Preferred therapy**: Loperamide is first-line for antimuscarinic-induced diarrhea in MG [^notfound].
- **Alternative therapy**: Diphenoxylate/atropine or racecadotril if loperamide is inadequate [^115feVAN] [^115HU9bM].
- **Monitor closely**: Watch for MG exacerbation or cholinergic crisis during management [^113eiVEY].

---

Glycopyrrolate is contraindicated in MG; **use loperamide or racecadotril** for antimuscarinic-induced diarrhea, and avoid other anticholinergics.

5.4 Myasthenia Gravis

With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)].

5.5 Intestinal Obstruction

Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)].

Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudo-obstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms, and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction.

Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery.

5.7 Ulcerative Colitis

Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)].

5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy

Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

### Gastrointestinal side effects of prescription medications in the older adult [^113JsxhF]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms resulting from either prescription medications or over-the-counter drugs are frequently encountered in geriatric practice but often mistaken for symptoms of an organic disease leading to multiple diagnostic studies. The morbidity, mortality, and medical costs associated with drug toxicity, even when restricted to the GI tract, are probably underestimated. The consequences of drug toxicity are quite variable and range from a symptom of mild discomfort (eg, drug-induced diarrhea) at one end of the spectrum, to fatal GI hemorrhage or perforation. Better awareness of the possibility of drug-induced GI tract pathology by primary care physicians improves the recognition of these adverse effects, and ultimately, improves patient care. This review focuses on the most common and well-described drug-related side effects of the GI tract.

---

### Tolterodine tartrate (Detrol) [^112GBFde]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

Risk of Urinary Retention and Gastric Retention

DETROL Tablets should be administered with caution to patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention and to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, such as pyloric stenosis, because of the risk of gastric retention (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility

DETROL, like other antimuscarinic drugs, should be used with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility.

Controlled Narrow-Angle Glaucoma

DETROL should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma.

Central Nervous System (CNS) Effects

Detrol is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects including dizziness and somnolence (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the drug's effects have been determined. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered.

Reduced Hepatic and Renal Function

For patients with significantly reduced hepatic function or renal function, the recommended dose of DETROL is 1 mg twice daily (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations).

Myasthenia Gravis

DETROL should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction.

Patients with Congenital or Acquired QT Prolongation

In a study of the effect of tolterodine immediate release tablets on the QT interval (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Cardiac Electrophysiology), the effect on the QT interval appeared greater for 8 mg/day (two times the therapeutic dose) compared to 4 mg/day and was more pronounced in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PM) than extensive metabolizers (EMs). The effect of tolterodine 8 mg/day was not as large as that observed after four days of therapeutic dosing with the active control moxifloxacin. However, the confidence intervals overlapped. These observations should be considered in clinical decisions to prescribe DETROL for patients with a known history of QT prolongation or patients who are taking Class IA (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). There has been no association of Torsade de Pointes in the international post-marketing experience with DETROL or DETROL LA.

### Neostigmine methylsulfate [^115fy4RH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Muscarinic symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, increased bronchial and salivary secretions, and bradycardia) may appear with overdosage of Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection (cholinergic crisis), but may be managed by the use of additional atropine or glycopyrrolate. The possibility of iatrogenic overdose can be lessened by carefully monitoring the muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation. Should overdosage occur, ventilation should be supported by artificial means until the adequacy of spontaneous respiration is assured, and cardiac function should be monitored.

Overdosage of Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection can cause cholinergic crisis, which is characterized by increasing muscle weakness, and through involvement of the muscles of respiration, may result in death. Myasthenic crisis, due to an increase in the severity of the disease, is also accompanied by extreme muscle weakness and may be difficult to distinguish from cholinergic crisis on a symptomatic basis. However, such differentiation is extremely important because increases in the dose of Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection or other drugs in this class, in the presence of cholinergic crisis or of a refractory or "insensitive" state, could have grave consequences. The two types of crises may be differentiated by the use of edrophonium chloride as well as by clinical judgment.

Treatment of the two conditions differs radically. Whereas the presence of myasthenic crisis requires more intensive anticholinesterase therapy, cholinergic crisis calls for the prompt withdrawal of all drugs of this type. The immediate use of atropine in cholinergic crisis is also recommended. Atropine may also be used to lessen gastrointestinal side effects or other muscarinic reactions; but such use, by masking signs of overdosage, can lead to inadvertent induction of cholinergic crisis.

### Neostigmine methylsulfate and glycopyrrolate (Prevduo) [^115U8839]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1	Bradycardia

Neostigmine, a component of PREVDUO®, is associated with bradycardia. Consideration should be given to administration of glycopyrrolate prior to neostigmine (i.e., as separate products) in patients with bradycardia or in patients in whom bradycardia, a known risk of neostigmine methysulfate, may cause hemodynamic instability.

5.2 Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Certain Coexisting Conditions

PREVDUO®should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome, hypertension, myasthenia gravis and hyperthyroidism. Because of the known pharmacology of neostigmine methylsulfate as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia, hypotension or dysrhythmia would be anticipated. In patients with acute cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias or recent acute coronary syndrome, the risk of blood pressure and heart rate complications may be increased. Risk of these complications may also be increased in patients with myasthenia gravis.

5.3 Hypersensitivity

Because of the possibility of hypersensitivity, medications to treat anaphylaxis should be readily available.

5.4 Neuromuscular Dysfunction

Large doses of PREVDUO®administered when neuromuscular blockade is minimal can produce neuromuscular dysfunction. The dose of PREVDUO®should be reduced if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is nearly complete.

5.5 Cholinergic Crisis

It is important to differentiate between myasthenic crisis and cholinergic crisis caused by overdosage of neostigmine. Both conditions result in extreme muscle weakness but require radically different treatment [see Overdosage (10)].

5.6 Precipitation of Acute Glaucoma

Glycopyrrolate, a component of PREVDUO®, is contraindicated in patients with glaucoma because it may cause mydriasis and increase intraocular pressure. Advise patients with glaucoma to promptly seek medical care in the event that they experience symptoms of acute angle closure glaucoma (pain and reddening of the eyes, accompanied by dilated pupils).

5.7	Drowsiness and Blurred Vision

Glycopyrrolate, a component of PREVDUO®, may cause drowsiness or blurred vision. Warn patients not to participate in activities requiring mental alertness, such as operate a motor vehicle or other machinery or perform hazardous work until these issues resolve.

### Myasthenia gravis: myasthenia vs. cholinergic crisis [^113eiVEY]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

A serious complication of myasthenia gravis is respiratory failure. This may be secondary to an exacerbation of myasthenia (myasthenia crisis) or to treatment with excess doses of a cholinesterase inhibitor (cholinergic crisis). Managing respiratory failure and differentiating a myasthenia from a cholinergic crisis is reviewed. Due to the unpredictable development of respiratory failure, hospitalization is recommended for most patients with exacerbations or complications of myasthenia gravis.

### Identifying a patient-centered outcome measure for a comparative effectiveness treatment trial in myasthenia gravis [^116J7ZRN]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction/Aims

Data regarding the comparative effectiveness of myasthenia gravis (MG) treatments is not available. We used patient input to identify a patient-centered outcome measure (PCOM) for PROMISE-MG, a comparative effectiveness trial of MG treatments.

Methods

First, a questionnaire survey was administered to 58 people with MG at the patient meeting of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA), evaluating the impact of MG-related symptoms and MG treatments on patients' lives. Second, an online focus group of 13 patients with MG was conducted. Third, a potential outcome measure was selected. Fourth, the selected PCOM was evaluated by patients to assess how completely and accurately it captured their experiences with MG.

Results

The patient survey showed that limb weakness had the most impact on patients' lives. Weight gain, mood swings, insomnia, and diarrhea were the most bothersome treatment side effects. Avoiding hospitalization was very important. Focus group participants reported fatigue as one of the most bothersome symptoms and differentiated it from myasthenic weakness. They defined an ideal treatment as having minimal or no side effects and an 80% improvement in symptoms.

Discussion

Based on patient input, the 15-item Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life-Revised (MG-QOL15R) scale, a validated patient-reported outcome measure (PRO), was selected as the primary PCOM for PROMISE-MG. Avoiding hospitalization and having minimal to no treatment adverse effects were selected as additional outcome measures. The patient-centeredness of a PRO depends on the context of a study: PROs should be evaluated for appropriateness as a PCOM for every study.

### Racecadotril in the management of diarrhea: an underestimated therapeutic option? [^115HU9bM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In a multicenter single-blinded study in a wide population (945 outpatients) with AID, Prado documented that racecadotril reduced the duration of diarrhea (primary efficacy endpoint) and of abdominal pain duration, compared to loperamide. In the racecadotril group, constipation was less frequent than in loperamide-treated patients. Overall, 67 (14.2%) patients in the racecadotril group and 113 (23.9%) in the loperamide group (p = 0.001) experienced side effects.

Wang et al. performed a randomized single-blinded study aimed at comparing loperamide (2 mg b.i.d.) and racecadotril (100 mg t.i.d.) in 62 patients with AID. The authors documented that loperamide was faster in treating diarrhea versus racecadotril (13 h vs 19.5 h), but it induced the development of constipation.

### Myasthenia gravis: Association of British Neurologists' management guidelines [^114mCGy4]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction for which many therapies were developed before the era of evidence based medicine. The basic principles of treatment are well known, however, patients continue to receive suboptimal treatment as a result of which a myasthenia gravis guidelines group was established under the aegis of The Association of British Neurologists. These guidelines attempt to steer a path between evidence-based practice where available, and established best practice where evidence is unavailable. Where there is insufficient evidence or a choice of options, the guidelines invite the clinician to seek the opinion of a myasthenia expert. The guidelines support clinicians not just in using the right treatments in the right order, but in optimising the use of well-known therapeutic agents. Clinical practice can be audited against these guidelines.

### ACG clinical guidelines: management of benign anorectal disorders [^115cfqGa]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Guidelines — fecal incontinence — Gastroenterologists and other providers should prescribe antidiarrheal agents for FI in patients with diarrhea (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Several drugs to manage diarrhea (including loperamide, diphenoxylate with atropine, cholestyramine, colesevelam, anticholinergic agents, and clonidine) are available, and a systematic review found randomized evidence: conducted in 2007 it identified 13 randomized studies with 473 participants; 11 were crossover trials. In four trials, symptoms were better with active treatment than with placebo, while in two of these four trials more adverse effects occurred on active drug.

Management of myasthenia gravis

The therapeutic strategy in MG is guided by the clinical pattern (ocular versus generalised), autoantibody subtype, and disease severity. Current therapy of MG revolves around symptomatic treatment (cholinesterase inhibitors), long term steroids and steroid-sparing immunomodulation including thymectomy and rescue therapy in acute crisis. A summary of the various pharmacological therapies currently used in MG (including usual dosing) is shown in Table 2.

Table 2
Commonly used medications in MG.

BD twice daily, CD19 cluster of differentiation 19 cells (B lymphocytes), FBC full blood count, LFT liver function tests, OD once daily, QDS four times a day, TDS three times a day, U&E urea and electrolytes.

With the advent of newer therapies, myasthenia patients are often systematically assessed in clinic using standardised scoring systems which include patient-reported outcomes like the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) or Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life (MG-QoL-15) scores. In addition, MG Composite, a combined patient-reported outcome and physician examination score is also relatively easy to perform. All of these scores are usually done regularly in many specialist myasthenia clinics. More detailed assessment can be done using Quantitative of Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scale, which is more often done in a clinical trial setting along with the other scores. A detailed discussion of these scores is outside the remit of this article.

Cholinesterase inhibitors

Cholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine (usual dose 30–60 mg three to four times a day, titrating up if needed up to 360 mg/day in divided doses) can produce rapid relief of symptoms in mild MG and are usually prescribed as the initial therapy. Patients may develop cholinergic side effects like abdominal and limb muscle cramps, diarrhoea etc and these can be counteracted by drugs like Propantheline. Some patients with MuSK-MG may show a paradoxical worsening with cholinesterase inhibitors.

### Azithromycin dihydrate [^111qLv1F]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Cardiovascular Death

Some observational studies have shown an approximately two-fold increased short-term potential risk of acute cardiovascular death in adults exposed to azithromycin relative to other antibacterial drugs, including amoxicillin. The five-day cardiovascular mortality observed in these studies ranged from 20 to 400 per million azithromycin treatment courses. This potential risk was noted to be greater during the first five days of azithromycin use and does not appear to be limited to those patients with preexisting cardiovascular diseases. The data in these observational studies are insufficient to establish or exclude a causal relationship between acute cardiovascular death and azithromycin use. Consider balancing this potential risk with treatment benefits when prescribing azithromycin.

5.6 Clostridium difficile -Associated Diarrhea (CDAD)

CDAD has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including azithromycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin - producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.7 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Exacerbations of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of myasthenic syndrome have been reported in patients receiving azithromycin therapy.

5.8 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing azithromycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### GLYCATE-glycopyrrolate tablet… [^116BktVw]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility.

Glycopyrrolate, like other anticholinergic agents, inhibits the action of acetylcholine on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and on smooth muscles that respond to acetylcholine but lack cholinergic innervation. These peripheral cholinergic receptors are present in the autonomic effector cells of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, the sino-atrial node, the atrioventricular node, exocrine glands, and, to a limited degree, in the autonomic ganglia. Thus, it diminishes the volume and free acidity of gastric secretions and controls excessive pharyngeal, tracheal, and bronchial secretions. Glycopyrrolate antagonizes muscarinic symptoms induced by cholinergic drugs such as the anticholinesterases.

CONTRAINDICATIONS Glaucoma; obstructive uropathy; obstructive disease of the gastrointestinal tract; paralytic ileus; intestinal atony of the elderly or debilitated patient; unstable cardiovascular status in acute hemorrhage; severe ulcerative colitis; toxic megacolon complicating ulcerative colitis; myasthenia gravis. Glycopyrrolate tablets are contraindicated in those patients with a hypersensitivity to glycopyrrolate.
- Hyperthyroidism, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac tachyarrhythmias, tachycardia, hypertension and prostatic hypertrophy.
- Hiatal hernia associated with reflux esophagitis, since anticholinergic drugs may aggravate this condition. Anticholinergics produce certain effects, most of which are extensions of their fundamental pharmacological actions.

1.

To guard against further absorption of the drug
- use gastric lavage, cathartics, and/or enemas.
2. To combat peripheral anticholinergic effects
- utilize a quaternary ammonium anticholinesterase, such as neostigmine methylsulfate.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^1149ZDzY]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Why do we need MG guidance treatment statements?

Although there is widespread agreement on the use of many treatments for MG, there is no internationally accepted standard of care. Because MG is heterogeneous, no one treatment approach is best for all patients. Few physicians treat enough patients with MG to be comfortable with all available treatments. Given its heterogeneity, the few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in MG have limited generalizability, while uncontrolled trials are limited by potential bias. Hence, an effort to develop consensus among international experts was undertaken to guide clinicians worldwide on the multifaceted approach to managing MG. This summary condenses the extensive background information in the full guidance statements, available on the Neurology ® Web site at.

### Pyridostigmine bromide [^117EJAar]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling:

Risk of Improper Use of Pyridostigmine Bromide [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
Individuals at Increased Risk of Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
Use in Bromide-Sensitive Individuals [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]

Serious Adverse Reactions, Such as Difficulty Breathing, Severe Dizziness, Loss of Consciousness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]

6.1 Clinical Studies Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The adverse reactions to pyridostigmine bromide are typically of two varieties: muscarinic and nicotinic. Muscarinic adverse reactions include abdominal cramps, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, emesis, increased peristalsis, nausea, hypersalivation, urinary incontinence, increased bronchial secretion, diaphoresis, miosis, and lacrimation. Nicotinic adverse reactions are comprised chiefly of muscle cramps, fasciculations, and weakness.

In a controlled study of 90 healthy volunteers comparing immediate-release pyridostigmine bromide 30 mg every 8 hours, which provides exposures comparable to pyridostigmine bromide 105 mg extended-release tablets once daily, to placebo for 21 days, the adverse reactions that were reported in 2% or more of subjects is included in Table 1. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 3%) are diarrhea, abdominal pain, dysmenorrhea, and twitch.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^111Qhugr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Infectious diarrhea — loperamide and antidiarrheal safety — A meta-analysis has shown loperamide reduced diarrhea prevalence at both 24 and 48 hours after onset of treatment and reduced total duration; however, deaths have been reported in 0.54% of children given loperamide, and all events occurred in children < 3 years old. In healthy adults, loperamide has been shown to be effective in reducing diarrhea, largely in travelers and with antimicrobials, and in these studies it was not associated with increased occurrence of adverse events; loperamide significantly reduces stool volume in traveler's diarrhea and in most noncholera watery diarrhea syndromes. Patients should be advised about medications with the potential to increase the risk of complications from diarrhea, particularly antidiarrheal and antimicrobial agents, and limited reports suggest that routine use of medications with anticholinergic properties may lead to increased risk of severe outcomes, including death, from diarrhea caused by C. difficile and Clostridium perfringens.

### Glycopyrrolate: It's time to review [^112UNhQx]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Medication shortages have become an all-too-common inconvenience that has forced anesthesia providers to examine our administering practices. Because of these shortages, commonly used medications are at the greatest risk. Glycopyrrolate (Robinul), which has been in short supply in recent years, is one of the most widely used anticholinergic agents, especially in conjunction with the anticholinesterase neostigmine, for reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) drugs. Here we review multiple studies from 1972 through 1986 that used varying methods of patient selection and dosage and drug combination criteria, and which noted that glycopyrrolate had a superior efficacy and adverse effect profile when compared with atropine in NMB reversal. Meta-analysis from these studies indicated that the dosage of 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate for every 1 mg of neostigmine, given concomitantly (maximum 1 mg glycopyrrolate and 5 mg neostigmine), demonstrated the greatest efficacy with the lowest incidence of unwanted adverse effects. It has now become common practice to use a dosage ratio of 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate to 1.0 mg neostigmine for NMB reversal. Yet since 1986, there have been no studies on reversal with glycopyrrolate and neostigmine. Frequent medication shortages and good medical practice should be an impetus for clinicians to reevaluate dosing practices of critical medications and revisit these drugs, such as glycopyrrolate, with more current studies.

### An international, phase III, randomized trial of mycophenolate mofetil in myasthenia gravis [^113ZSPyJ]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as a steroid-sparing agent in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).

Methods

Patients with acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive class II-IVa MG (MG Foundation of America [MGFA] criteria) taking corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks were randomized to MMF (2 g/day) or placebo for 36 weeks. The primary endpoint was a composite measure defined as achievement of minimal manifestations or pharmacologic remission (MGFA post-intervention status), with reduction of corticosteroid dose on a set schedule. Secondary endpoints included disease severity, quality-of-life scores, and safety.

Results

A total of 44% of MMF-treated (n = 88) and 39% of placebo-receiving (n = 88) patients achieved the primary endpoint (p = 0.541). Improvements in mean quantitative MG, MG activities of daily living, and 36-item Short-Form health survey scores were similar in both groups. Numbers of adverse events were similar in both groups. The most commonly reported adverse events in the MMF-treated group were headache (12.5%) and worsening of MG (11.4%), and in the placebo group, worsening of MG (20.5%) and diarrhea (10.2%).

Conclusions

Initiation of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) treatment was not superior to placebo in maintaining myasthenia gravis (MG) control during a 36-week schedule of prednisone tapering. There were no significant differences in the primary or secondary endpoints between the study groups. MMF was well tolerated and adverse events were consistent with previous studies. Experience from this large, international, multicenter, phase III study employing full MG Foundation of America guidelines will aid the design of future MG studies.

### Neostigmine methylsulfate (bloxiverz) [^1175MRQu]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Muscarinic symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, increased bronchial and salivary secretions, and bradycardia) may appear with overdosage of BLOXIVERZ (cholinergic crisis), but may be managed by the use of additional atropine or glycopyrrolate. The possibility of iatrogenic overdose can be lessened by carefully monitoring the muscle twitch response to peripheral nerve stimulation. Should overdosage occur, ventilation should be supported by artificial means until the adequacy of spontaneous respiration is assured, and cardiac function should be monitored.

Overdosage of BLOXIVERZ can cause cholinergic crisis, which is characterized by increasing muscle weakness, and through involvement of the muscles of respiration, may result in death. Myasthenic crisis, due to an increase in the severity of the disease, is also accompanied by extreme muscle weakness and may be difficult to distinguish from cholinergic crisis on a symptomatic basis. However, such differentiation is extremely important because increases in the dose of BLOXIVERZ or other drugs in this class, in the presence of cholinergic crisis or of a refractory or "insensitive" state, could have grave consequences. The two types of crises may be differentiated by the use of edrophonium chloride as well as by clinical judgment.

Treatment of the two conditions differs radically. Whereas the presence of myasthenic crisis requires more intensive anticholinesterase therapy, cholinergic crisis calls for the prompt withdrawal of all drugs of this type. The immediate use of atropine in cholinergic crisis is also recommended. Atropine may also be used to lessen gastrointestinal side effects or other muscarinic reactions; but such use, by masking signs of overdosage, can lead to inadvertent induction of cholinergic crisis.

### Oxybutynin (Oxytrol) [^111ajfUH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Urinary Retention

Administer OXYTROL with caution in patients with clinically significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention [see Contraindications (4)].

5.2 Risks in Patients with Gastrointestinal Disorders

Administer OXYTROL with caution to patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders because of the risk of gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)].

OXYTROL, like other anticholinergic drugs, may decrease gastrointestinal motility and should be used with caution in patients with conditions such as ulcerative colitis or intestinal atony.

OXYTROL should be used with caution in patients who have hiatus hernia/gastroesophageal reflux and/or who are concurrently taking drugs (such as bisphosphonates) that can cause or exacerbate esophagitis.

5.3 Central Nervous System Effects

Products containing oxybutynin are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) effects. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, somnolence, confusion and hallucinations [see Adverse Events (6.2)]. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how OXYTROL affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, drug discontinuation should be considered.

5.4 Angioedema

Angioedema requiring hospitalization and emergency medical treatment has occurred with the first or subsequent doses of oral oxybutynin. In the event of angioedema, OXYTROL should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided.

5.5 Skin Hypersensitivity

Patients who develop skin hypersensitivity to OXYTROL should discontinue drug treatment.

5.6 Exacerbation of Symptoms of Myasthenia Gravis

Avoid use of OXYTROL in patients with myasthenia gravis, a disease characterized by decreased cholinergic activity at the neuromuscular junction. If experiencing exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis, oxybutynin-containing product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy promptly provided.

### Neostigmine [^115S9Ddb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

- **Bradycardia**: Atropine or glycopyrrolate should be administered prior to neostigmine methylsulfate injection to lessen risk of bradycardia. (5.1)

- **Serious Reactions with Coexisting Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome or myasthenia gravis. (5.2)

- **Neuromuscular Dysfunction**: Can occur if large doses of neostigmine methylsulfate injection are administered when neuromuscular blockade is minimal; reduce dose if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is nearly complete. (5.4)

5.1. Bradycardia

Neostigmine has been associated with bradycardia. Atropine sulfate or glycopyrrolate should be administered prior to neostigmine methylsulfate injection to lessen the risk of bradycardia [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2. Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Certain Coexisting Conditions

Neostigmine methylsulfate injection should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome or myasthenia gravis. Because of the known pharmacology of neostigmine methylsulfate as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia, hypotension or dysrhythmia would be anticipated. In patients with certain cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias or recent acute coronary syndrome, the risk of blood pressure and heart rate complications may be increased. Risk of these complications may also be increased in patients with myasthenia gravis. Standard antagonism with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) is generally successful to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular complications.

5.3. Hypersensitivity

Because of the possibility of hypersensitivity, atropine and medications to treat anaphylaxis should be readily available.

5.4. Neuromuscular Dysfunction

Large doses of neostigmine methylsulfate injection administered when neuromuscular blockade is minimal can produce neuromuscular dysfunction. The dose of neostigmine methylsulfate injection should be reduced if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is nearly complete.

5.5. Cholinergic Crisis

It is important to differentiate between myasthenic crisis and cholinergic crisis caused by overdosage of neostigmine methylsulfate injection. Both conditions result in extreme muscle weakness but require radically different treatment [see Overdosage (10)]

### When the patient fails to respond to treatment: myasthenia gravis [^115NyPvY]. Practical Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Myasthenia gravis is one of the most satisfying neurological disorders to treat. There are few other conditions in which therapeutic intervention can take a patient from being bed-bound and ventilated to normality. Most patients present with less severe symptoms, but even mild extraocular muscle weakness can be profoundly disabling. The standard therapeutic approach is successful for most patients, which can make the non-specialist neurologist somewhat blasé about its management. However, panic can set in when the standard approach fails. Failure is often the result of incorrect diagnosis, or inappropriate use of first-line treatments. This article outlines the main reasons for failure and gives advice on alternative therapeutic strategies.

Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon, leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antibacterial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

5.6 Exacerbation of Myasthenia Gravis

Exacerbation of symptoms of myasthenia gravis and new onset of myasthenic syndrome have been reported in patients receiving azithromycin therapy.

5.7 Use in Sexually Transmitted Disease

Azithromycin tablets, at the recommended dose, should not be relied upon to treat syphilis. Antibacterial agents used to treat non-gonococcal urethritis may mask or delay the symptoms of incubating syphilis. All patients with sexually transmitted urethritis or cervicitis should have a serologic test for syphilis and appropriate testing for gonorrhea performed at the time of diagnosis. Appropriate antibacterial therapy and follow-up tests for these diseases should be initiated if infection is confirmed.

5.8 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria

Prescribing azithromycin tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^111sn1Aw]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

RESULTS

All definitions below obtained simple consensus and all guidance statements below were agreed upon as being appropriate by the panel. Literature summaries and tables for medication dosing guidance and medication cautions are available as supplemental data at.

Preliminary definitions.

1. Goals for the treatment of MG.

MGFA Task Force Post-Intervention Status (PIS) classification Minimal Manifestation Status (MMS) or better, with no more than grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) medication side effects.

MMS: The patient has no symptoms or functional limitations from MG but has some weakness on examination of some muscles. This class recognizes that some patients who otherwise meet the definition of remission have mild weakness.

CTCAE grade 1 medication side effects: asymptomatic or only mild symptoms; intervention not indicated.

2. Definition of remission.

The patient has no symptoms or signs of MG. Weakness of eyelid closure is accepted, but there is no weakness of any other muscle on careful examination. Patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) every day with reasonable evidence to support symptomatic benefit are therefore excluded from this category.

3. Definition of ocular MG (based on dysfunction due to MG at a specified point in time, and not dependent upon the duration of disease).

MGFA Class I: Any ocular muscle weakness. May have weakness of eye closure. Strength in all other facial, bulbar, and limb muscles is normal. (It is recognized that some patients report fatigue when strength testing is normal. The physician should use clinical judgment in attributing fatigue to generalized MG in the absence of objective nonocular weakness).

4. Definition of impending myasthenic crisis.

Rapid clinical worsening of MG that, in the opinion of the treating physician, could lead to crisis in the short term (days to weeks).

5. Definition of manifest myasthenic crisis (the concept of crisis focuses on the clinical implications — it represents a serious, life-threatening, rapid worsening of MG and potential airway compromise from ventilatory or bulbar dysfunction).

MGFA Class V: Worsening of myasthenic weakness requiring intubation or noninvasive ventilation to avoid intubation, except when these measures are employed during routine postoperative management (the use of a feeding tube without intubation places the patient in MGFA Class IVB).

6. Definition of refractory MG.

PISis unchanged or worse after corticosteroids and at least 2 other IS agents, used in adequate doses for an adequate duration, with persistent symptoms or side effects that limit functioning, as defined by patient and physician.

### Xanomeline-trospium: a novel therapeutic for the treatment of schizophrenia [^116VQfMB]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Contraindications for xanomeline-trospium include urinary obstruction, gastric retention, hypersensitivity to any components of the medication due to risk of angioedema, and untreated narrow angle glaucoma. Additional recommendations include: avoid in patients with active biliary disease due to risk of transient biliary obstruction; use cautiously in patients with gastrointestinal obstructive disorders, ulcerative colitis, intestinal atony, or myasthenia gravis due to decreased gastrointestinal motility; monitor for anticholinergic adverse effects of the CNS, such as dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Laboratory and vital sign monitoring recommendations include liver enzymes, bilirubin, and heart rate at baseline and periodically during treatment.

Renal and hepatic impairment affect metabolism and elimination of xanomeline-trospium. Use of xanomeline-trospium is not recommended in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60mL/min, or patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class A hepatic impairment. Xanomeline-trospium is contraindicated in patients with CTP class B or C hepatic impairment. In addition, there are no data on use of xanomeline-trospium in patients who are pregnant or lactating.

First- and second-generation antipsychotics utilized in the management of schizophrenia, which primarily rely on dopaminergic and serotonergic antagonism, are associated with various adverse effects that contribute to nonadherence, including metabolic syndrome and drug-induced movement disorders. Xanomeline-trospium did not appear to be associated with metabolic syndrome or acute movement-related disorders in clinical trials; long-term data will help to validate these initial findings. - The primary adverse effects of xanomeline-trospium observed during clinical trials were cholinergic and/or anticholinergic in nature, such as nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, constipation, dry mouth, and diarrhea. - There were similar rates of discontinuation due to adverse effects in both the intervention and placebo cohorts of EMERGENT-1, EMERGENT-2, and EMERGENT-3. - The safety data of xanomeline-trospium are compelling as it may indicate a good option for patients at higher risk of metabolic syndrome or who experience other intolerable adverse effects, such as drug-induced movement disorders, with antipsychotics. Treatment of Parkinsonism can contribute to pill burden and cognitive impairment due to anticholinergic burden among people with schizophrenia.

### Neostigmine methylsulfate [^114u8iWy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

- **Bradycardia**: Atropine or glycopyrrolate should be administered prior to Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection to lessen risk of bradycardia. (5.1)

- **Serious Reactions with Coexisting Conditions**: Use with caution in patients with, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome or myasthenia gravis. (5.2)

- **Neuromuscular Dysfunction**: Can occur if large doses of Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection are administered when neuromuscular blockade is minimal; reduce dose if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is nearly complete. (5.4)

5.1. Bradycardia

Neostigmine has been associated with bradycardia. Atropine sulfate or glycopyrrolate should be administered prior to Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection to lessen the risk of bradycardia [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

5.2. Serious Adverse Reactions in Patients with Certain Coexisting Conditions

Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection should be used with caution in patients with coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, recent acute coronary syndrome or myasthenia gravis. Because of the known pharmacology of neostigmine methylsulfate as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, cardiovascular effects such asbradycardia, hypotension or dysrhythmia would be anticipated. In patients with certain cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias or recent acute coronary syndrome, the risk of blood pressure and heart rate complications may be increased. Risk of these complications may also be increased in patients with myasthenia gravis. Standard antagonism with anticholinergics (e.g., atropine) is generally successful to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular complications.

5.3. Hypersensitivity

Because of the possibility of hypersensitivity, atropine and medications to treat anaphylaxis should be readily available.

5.4. Neuromuscular Dysfunction

Large doses of Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection administered when neuromuscular blockade is minimal can produce neuromuscular dysfunction. The dose of Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection should be reduced if recovery from neuromuscular blockade is nearly complete.

5.5. Cholinergic Crisis

It is important to differentiate between myasthenic crisis and cholinergic crisis caused by overdosage of Neostigmine Methylsulfate Injection. Both conditions result in extreme muscle weakness but require radically different treatment [see Overdosage (10)]

Key messages

Myasthenia gravis is an antibody mediated autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction function that leads to muscle weakness and functional disability
Treatments targeting the underlying pathophysiological pathway are rapidly evolving and have improved management of myasthenia gravis
The most appropriate selection of treatments considers the mechanisms, indications, risks and benefits, and costs of each treatment along with patients' preference
Targeting different pathomechanisms of the disease simultaneously will likely lead to improved outcomes, particularly in the severe cases

New immunomodulatory therapeutics hold promise for the future treatment of myasthenia gravis, say DeHart-McCoyle and colleagues

### Dicyclomine hydrochloride [^117WY1Be]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Myasthenia Gravis

With overdosage, a curare-like action may occur (i.e., neuromuscular blockade leading to muscular weakness and possible paralysis). It should not be given to patients with myasthenia gravis except to reduce adverse muscarinic effects of an anticholinesterase [see Contraindications (4)].

5.5 Intestinal Obstruction

Diarrhea may be an early symptom of incomplete intestinal obstruction, especially in patients with ileostomy or colostomy. In this instance, treatment with this drug would be inappropriate and possibly harmful [see Contraindications (4)].

Rarely development of Ogilvie's syndrome (colonic pseudoobstruction) has been reported. Ogilvie's syndrome is a clinical disorder with signs, symptoms and radiographic appearance of an acute large bowel obstruction but with no evidence of distal colonic obstruction

5.6 Toxic Dilatation of Intestinemegacolon

Toxic dilatation of intestine and intestinal perforation is possible when anticholinergic agents are administered in patients with Salmonella dysentery.

5.7 Ulcerative Colitis

Caution should be taken in patients with ulcerative colitis. Large doses may suppress intestinal motility to the point of producing a paralytic ileus and the use of this drug may precipitate or aggravate the serious complication of toxic megacolon [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)]. Dicyclomine is contraindicated in patients with severe ulcerative colitis [see Contraindications (4)].

5.8 Prostatic Hypertrophy

Dicyclomine should be used with caution in patients with known or suspected prostatic enlargement, in whom prostatic enlargement may lead to urinary retention [see Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

5.9 Hepatic and Renal Disease

Dicyclomine should be used with caution in patients with known hepatic and renal impairment.

5.10 Geriatric Population

Dicyclomine hydrochloride should be used with caution in elderly who may be more susceptible to its adverse effects.

Table 2.
TCA dose range

Doses used in psychiatry (150–300 mg) for depression are higher than are needed to target pain and other GI symptoms. One recent 6-month placebo-controlled trial of amitriptyline 10–30 mg dose range in primary care showed benefit with GI but not psychological symptoms although adverse anticholinergic effects were common. Unfortunately, the study did not provide information on the differential benefit or frequency of side effects based on dose. One small study was published using a 10 mg dose of amitriptyline for IBS-D that showed modest benefit in treating pain and diarrhea, but it had methodological limitations. While very low doses may be insufficient for the control of digestive symptoms, it could be a starting point for future research.

Many providers choose to start with low doses, presumably to avoid side effects or ease patient anticipatory anxiety. However, if 10 mg is started, it needs to be increased to a higher dose target (Table 2). Suppose a patient reports side effects immediately and at low doses. In that case, it may be a nocebo effect rather than a medication effect, so rather than stop or switch the medication, we suggest the patient stay on the same dose for a week to adapt and then subsequently try to increase the dose further. Dose-related antimuscarinic side effects may be anticipated with higher doses up to 150 mg/d.

### Generalized myasthenia gravis with acetylcholine receptor antibodies: a guidance for treatment [^113vZgVy]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Symptomatic drug treatment

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are recommended as first‐line treatment in MG as they increase the amount of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thus improving neuromuscular transmission. Pyridostigmine bromide is the primary drug of choice. Ambenonium chloride is usually less effective and is regarded as a second‐line acetylcholine esterase inhibitor.

Pyridostigmine dosage is titrated individually, where 30–60 mg every 4–6 h is a typical adult dose. In pediatric patients, titration starts from 1 mg/kg/day, and a typical dose is 7 mg/kg/day. A daily dose of 450–600 mg or more may cause increased muscle weakness and cholinergic crisis.

Side effects are mainly due to muscarinic adverse events, including stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, muscle cramps, increased sweating, bronchial secretions, hypotension, and bradycardia. In a Dutch–Belgian cohort, 91% reported side effects from pyridostigmine, and one in four discontinued the treatment mainly due to side effects. Atropine in a low dose can be temporarily used to counteract such side effects, which are typically most pronounced at the start of the therapy. Pyridostigmine should not be given in the case of gastrointestinal or urinary obstruction and should be used cautiously in patients with bronchial asthma, bradyarrhythmias, or recent coronary occlusion. Pyridostigmine affects sensitivity to non‐depolarizing muscle relaxants such as vecuronium bromide.

Beta‐2 adrenergic agonists

Beta adrenergic agonists represent first‐line treatment for most congenital myasthenic syndromes but may also have a role in acquired MG. Beta‐2 adrenergic receptor agonists in low doses, mainly terbutaline, ameliorate the clinical symptoms in MG. A randomized, placebo‐controlled, pilot study of terbutaline improved the quantitative MG score and the fatigue response on repetitive nerve stimulation. Beta‐2 adrenergic agonists should be given with caution to patients with severe cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, or hypokalemia.

Recommendations

Pyridostigmine in optimal dose should be given as a first‐line symptomatic treatment in most patients with MG.
The optimal dose can vary according to activity needs and be adjusted by the patient accordingly.
Terbutaline and salbutamol can be used as adjuvant symptomatic treatments.

Immunosuppressive drug treatment

### Clinical features, pathogenesis, and treatment of myasthenia gravis: a supplement to the guidelines of the German Neurological Society [^1152Va32]. Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment strategies for MG

Largely independent from the autoantibody status, MG is treated according to the same principles. Treatment strategies can be distinguished into (a) symptomatic treatments facilitating neuromuscular transmission and (b) immunosuppressive treatments targeting the underlying pathological immune response in MG.

Symptomatic treatments

Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) such as pyridostigmin bromide represent the most common symptomatic treatments. Clinical efficacy of these drugs has been underlined using electrophysiological measurements. However, their broad application in the treatment of MG is based on uncontrolled observational studies, case series as well as on good clinical practice. For ethical reasons placebo-controlled studies on the clinical efficacy of these compounds are prohibited.

Patients with MuSK-antibody-associated MG usually respond worse than those with nAChR-antibody-associated MG to treatment with AChEI. In these cases, higher dosages are required for symptom control often leading to increased systemic side effects.

Pyridostigmin bromide is nowadays used for the oral long-term treatment of MG. Cholinergic side effects usually do not occur at dosages below 300 mg/day. However, during intravenous application cholinergic side effects such as bronchial spasm and hypersecretion, aggravated myasthenic muscle weakness, abdominal crampi, urinary urgency, hypersalivation and sweating, bradycardia and arterio-ventricular block, and miosis may occur and constitute cholinergic intoxication. Intravenous application of pyridostigmin bromide (up to 24 mg/day) always requires continuous monitoring in an intermediate or intensive care setting. The most frequent systemic side effects during all modes of application include gastrointestinal disturbance, diarrhea and crampi (in about 30%), hypersalivation (in about 6%), sweating (in about 4%), bradycardia and arterio-ventricular block (in about 1%).

Oral ambenonium chloride may be used instead of oral pyridostigmin bromide in case of bromide intolerance with gastrointestinal side effects.

### Persistent symptoms, exacerbations and drug side effects despite treatment in myasthenia gravis [^115dXhYB]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Drug refractory status was defined as lack of clinical changes following treatment with corticosteroids and two other IS agents. Drug refractoriness was evaluated biannually during the study follow‐up.
Immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agent‐related AEs were collected with groups defined by the most common event types: cephalalgia, digestive impairment (including abdominal pain and non‐infectious diarrhea), bone fracture, urinary infection, respiratory infection, digestive infection and other infections. Other AEs included very infrequent AEs. Severity of each AE was graded using the European Medicines Agency's classification, as mild (awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated), moderate (events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may interfere with daily activities), severe (events interrupt the participant's normal daily activities and generally require systemic drug therapy) or serious (events that result in hospital in‐patient stay, an extension of a hospital stay, permanent disability or death) (ema.eu protocol CPMP/ICH/377/95). The causative drug was decided based on drug administration timing, AE appearance and clinical judgement. For AEs from co‐administered drugs (e.g. infection in a patient receiving prednisone and an immunosuppressant drug), the AE was attributed to both treatments.
HCRU and costs: Direct costs from inpatient and outpatient services (length of MG‐related hospitalizations and ICU stays; number of ER visits, days of hospital/ambulatory day care and MG‐related neurologist or other specialist consultations) and pharmacy, including dose of hospital‐administered IVIG (hospitalization or day hospital administration) and number of PLEX sessions. Given the long duration of the study (1998–2020) and variability in costs over this period, 2022 prices for drugs and procedures were used. Hospital department price estimations from 2022 were: IVIG, 478.31 €/10 g; hospitalization, 634.23 € per day; ICU, 2019.87 € per day; day hospital, 286.67 € per session; first ambulatory consult: 181.39 €; follow‐up consult, 90.7 €; ER consult: 234.67 €; PLEX, 1209 € per session; thymectomy surgery, 8922€.

### Clinical perspective on management of key adverse events with sacituzumab govitecan [^112sCVTS]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

For SG-related any-grade diarrhea, we recommend initiating treatment with 4 mg of oral loperamide, followed by 2 mg thereafter with each episode, to a maximum dose of 16 mg/day until resolved. If diarrhea is not resolved after 24 hours or the patient is experiencing 3–4 stools per day when at a near maximum loperamide dose, oral 5 mg diphenoxylate-0.05 mg atropine sulfate should be considered 4 times daily, to a maximum dose of 20 mg diphenoxylate-0.2 mg atropine sulfate per day until control is achieved. Discontinue diphenoxylate-atropine use if clinical improvement is not seen within 10 days of administering the maximum dose. Because the severity of diarrhea associated with SG can vary widely by case, some patients may benefit from alternating loperamide with diphenoxylate-atropine administration. We have used loperamide prophylactically (not routine) and administered loperamide alternating with diphenoxylate-atropine. The PRIMED study included an investigation of the use of prophylactic loperamide with SG therapy, with loperamide given for 3 consecutive days after SG administration (ie, Days 2, 3, and 4 and Days 9, 10, and 11) for the first 2 cycles (with the option to extend to the next cycle based on the physician's discretion). Rates of diarrhea (34%)were lower compared with those reported in the ASCENT (65%)and TROPiCS-02 (62%)studies (Table 1). Constipation was observed in 46% of patients in PRIMED; whereas rates of 37% and 19% were observed in ASCENT and TROPiCS-02, respectively. Octreotide (100–150 μg, may increase to 500–2000 μg intravenous [IV] or SQ 3 times daily; discontinue within 24 hours of resolution to reduce risk of ileus) can also be effective with unusual cases of persisting diarrhea. However, the octreotide injection is painful, and ice on the injection site may be helpful. Additionally, patients should hydrate with oral or IV fluids as needed.

### Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment for myasthenia gravis [^115WchXL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In myasthenia gravis, antibody-mediated blockade of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction abolishes the naturally occurring 'safety factor' of synaptic transmission. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provide temporary symptomatic treatment of muscle weakness but there is controversy about their long-term efficacy, dosage and side effects. This is the second update of a review published in The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2011.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in all forms of myasthenia gravis.

Search Methods

On 8 July 2014 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials regarding usage of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in myasthenia gravis. Two authors scanned the articles for any study eligible for inclusion. We also contacted the authors and known experts in the field to identify additional published or unpublished data and searched clinical trials registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

The types of studies were randomised or quasi-randomised trials. Participants were myasthenia gravis patients diagnosed by an internationally accepted definition. The intervention was treatment with any form of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Types of outcome measures Primary outcome measureImprovement in the presenting symptoms within one to 14 days of the start of treatment. Secondary outcome measures(1) Improvement in the presenting symptoms more than 14 days after the start of treatment.(2) Change in impairment measured by a recognised and preferably validated scale, such as the quantitative myasthenia gravis score, within one to 14 days and more than 14 days after the start of treatment.(3) Myasthenia Gravis Association of America post-intervention status more than 14 days after start of treatment.(4) Adverse events including muscarinic side effects.

Data Collection and Analysis

One author (MMM) extracted the data, which were checked by a second author. We contacted study authors for extra information and collected data on adverse effects from the trials.

Main Results

We did not find any large randomised or quasi-randomised trials of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in generalised myasthenia gravis either for the first version of this review or this update. One cross-over randomised trial using intranasal neostigmine in a total of 10 participants was only available as an abstract. It included three participants with ocular myasthenia gravis and seven with generalised myasthenia gravis. Symptoms of myasthenia gravis (measured as improvement in at least one muscle function) improved in nine of the 10 participants after the two-week neostigmine treatment phase. No participant improved after the placebo phase. Lack of detail in the report meant that the risk of bias was unclear. Adverse events were minor.

Authors' Conclusions

Except for one small and inconclusive trial of intranasal neostigmine, no other randomised controlled trials have been conducted on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in myasthenia gravis. The response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in observational studies is so clear that a randomised controlled trial depriving participants in a placebo arm of treatment would be difficult to justify.

Objectives

This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (intervention). The objectives are as follows: To evaluate the benefits and harms of FcRn inhibitors for the maintenance treatment of myasthenia gravis in adult participants compared with control treatment (placebo, standard-of-care therapy, an alternative FcRn inhibitor, or an alternative immunomodulatory therapy). We will evaluate the efficacy of the treatment by the effect on disease severity and functional impairment, as assessed using a measurement tool validated for use in myasthenia gravis. Where possible, we will assess whether the effects of FcRn inhibitors differ according to different participant subgroups or different treatment regimens, or both. These data will be used to inform policymakers on the participant subgroups most likely to benefit from treatment and the most efficacious treatment regimen.

Methods

Primary Research Question

This phase 2a randomized controlled trial sought to determine the clinical efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of rozanolixizumab in patients with gMG. This study intended to provide Class I evidence that, for patients with gMG, rozanolixizumab is well-tolerated and improves Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score.
