## Question

Based on the MELD score what do you do?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what actions to take based on the MELD score in patients with advanced liver disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the MELD calculation and verifying the clinical context. Then, I should categorize the MELD score into pragmatic risk strata and map actions to each range. Next, I will integrate special scenarios such as acute liver failure, ACLF, HCC, and surgical risk. After that, I should review MELD exceptions and the role of MELD-Na and MELD 3.0. Finally, I will synthesize a concise action algorithm and highlight limitations and communication points to ensure safe, guideline-concordant care.

> Let me first confirm the MELD calculation and the clinical context before jumping to decisions. I need to check bilirubin, INR, and creatinine, and if the patient is on dialysis I should assign a creatinine of 4.0 mg/dL for the calculation; I should also verify whether sodium is available so I can use MELD-Na, which improves short-term mortality prediction on the waitlist, and I should confirm the patient's decompensation status, etiology, and whether there are complications like ascites, encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding that change urgency and candidacy for transplant referral [^114Fgaco] [^115mtjrF].

> Now, I will categorize the MELD into pragmatic strata, but wait, let me verify the thresholds that align with guideline triggers and observed risk gradients. Low MELD is generally less than 15, intermediate is 15 to 24, high is 25 to 34, and very high is 35 or greater; these brackets align with AASLD guidance that MELD 15 or higher should prompt transplant evaluation and with data showing sharply rising waitlist mortality above 30 and post-transplant morbidity above 35, while MELD less than 15 often reflects compensated disease but can still carry substantial mortality in decompensated phenotypes [^117UrHmw] [^113WrME8] [^112voG1h].

> For MELD less than 15, I should confirm whether the patient is compensated or decompensated because that changes action. If compensated, I will optimize outpatient care, screen for varices, manage etiology, and monitor MELD trends. If decompensated with ascites, encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding, I should not rely on MELD alone and should refer for transplant evaluation because decompensation itself predicts high mortality independent of MELD, and refractory ascites or hepatic hydrothorax warrant transplant evaluation regardless of MELD score [^111QZEQA] [^112voG1h] [^1111UDNY].

> For MELD 15 to 24, I need to ensure timely transplant referral and aggressive management of complications. Hold on, I should verify that this is the index-complication threshold; yes, AASLD recommends transplant evaluation once any decompensation occurs or MELD reaches 15, and at this range I should also screen for sarcopenia and frailty, optimize nutrition, and treat precipitating factors like infection or alcohol use, while considering living donor options to mitigate wait-time risk [^117UrHmw] [^112voG1h] [^116jfJYd].

> For MELD 25 to 34, I should double-check that this is the high-risk zone where waitlist mortality exceeds 50 percent at 3 months when MELD is above 30, so I need to expedite transplant workup, escalate bridge therapies, and coordinate regional sharing. Let me verify perioperative implications too; high MELD correlates with greater transfusion and vasopressor needs intraoperatively, so I should anticipate hemodynamic and coagulation support needs and consider ICU-level optimization while avoiding futile interventions in those with overwhelming multiorgan failure [^113WrME8] [^116AqFog] [^115vQgCR].

> For MELD 35 or higher, I should confirm candidacy and futility considerations carefully. Very high MELD is associated with increased post-transplant morbidity and ICU length of stay, and some centers consider MELD above 35 a gray zone where benefit may wane; however, survival benefit can still exist in selected patients, so I should involve transplant critical care, reassess reversibility of organ failures, and avoid overcalling futility while acknowledging that severe frailty, high lactate, and escalating vasopressor requirements are poor prognostic signs [^113WrME8] [^1122HHqF].

> Next, I should review special scenarios that override routine MELD-based actions. In acute liver failure, I need to check for Kings College Criteria or a MELD above 25, both indicating high risk and the need for urgent transplant referral and transfer to a transplant center, recognizing that MELD alone is imperfect in ALF and must be integrated with clinical trajectory and encephalopathy grade [^1151pG9X] [^112dEDt7]. In ACLF, I should prefer CLIF-C ACLF over MELD for short-term mortality prediction and consider that ACLF-3 patients may warrant prioritization on the waitlist despite limitations of MELD, with lactate and respiratory failure informing candidacy and timing [^113AVroJ] [^112AegiU] [^1122HHqF]. In HCC within Milan criteria, I should confirm tumor staging and pursue MELD exception points with bridge therapy to prevent dropout, balancing risks of progression against overtreatment of very small lesions [^115A8Yyx] [^113zziNN]. For surgical risk outside transplant, I should avoid elective procedures when MELD exceeds 20 and coordinate with transplant teams when MELD is 15 or higher, using validated surgical risk tools alongside MELD and CTP to guide decisions [^116gdpoc] [^1177yuxf] [^114WiezT].

> I will now examine MELD exceptions because some patients are sicker than their MELD suggests. I should confirm indications such as hepatopulmonary syndrome with hypoxemia, refractory ascites or hepatic hydrothorax, and portopulmonary hypertension, and I should apply for Regional Review Board-reviewed exception points when the biology does not reflect severity; I also need to remember that HRS-AKI can artificially elevate creatinine and MELD, yet patients may still lose priority when HRS is successfully treated, so I should advocate for policy-consistent exception pathways and not withhold disease-directed therapy [^117NiH6q] [^1146am2v] [^111scPkd].

> Let me consider refinements to MELD that improve prognostication. I should confirm whether sodium is available to compute MELD-Na, which better predicts 90-day waitlist mortality, and I should verify whether my center uses MELD 3.0, which incorporates albumin and sex to mitigate gender disparities and improve discrimination. I should also remember that MELD-LA, adding lactate, can improve in-hospital mortality prediction in hospitalized cirrhosis and ACLF, though it is not yet used for allocation in most systems [^115mtjrF] [^1136BnTs] [^116qAQLG].

> But wait, what if the MELD is low and the patient looks deceptively well. I should double-check for sarcopenia, frailty, and repeated decompensations, because these portend poor outcomes and may justify earlier transplant referral even with MELD below 15; I should also remember that MELD does not capture encephalopathy or quality-of-life impairment, so I must integrate clinical phenotype with laboratory scores and communicate prognosis transparently with patients and families [^112voG1h] [^116ozGdt].

> Next, I should review peri-transplant and immediate postoperative considerations that hinge on MELD. High MELD predicts greater intraoperative transfusion and vasopressor requirements, so I should coordinate blood bank and perfusion resources in advance, and I should monitor early post-transplant MELD because a POD5 MELD above about 14.5 predicts higher long-term mortality and may flag primary graft dysfunction or complications requiring escalation [^116AqFog] [^114TNAqd].

> I need to ensure my action algorithm is concise and actionable. If MELD is less than 15, I will optimize and monitor closely, but if decompensated I will refer for transplant. If MELD is 15 to 24, I will refer urgently and manage complications aggressively. If MELD is 25 to 34, I will expedite listing and anticipate high-acuity perioperative needs. If MELD is 35 or higher, I will verify candidacy, coordinate ICU-level optimization, and avoid futile care in non-survivable multiorgan failure while remaining open to selective transplantation in appropriate candidates [^117UrHmw] [^113WrME8].

> Finally, I should confirm documentation and communication steps. I will record the exact MELD-Na, date, and lab source. I will note decompensation features, exception indications, and frailty assessment. And I will use shared decision-making and serious illness conversations to align interventions with patient goals, acknowledging that MELD-based prognostication complements but does not replace clinical judgment in advanced liver disease [^116ozGdt].

Based on the MELD score, **refer for transplant evaluation when MELD ≥ 15** [^111QZEQA] or with any decompensation (ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleed) [^117UrHmw]. For MELD < 15, manage complications and monitor; for MELD 15–24, **urgent referral** is advised [^1177yuxf]; for MELD ≥ 25, **immediate referral** is critical [^1177yuxf]. MELD-Na improves prognostic accuracy [^115mtjrF], and MELD exceptions should be sought when the score underestimates severity [^1146am2v] (e.g. HCC, HPS) [^117NiH6q]. In acute liver failure, use MELD alongside KCC [^112dEDt7]; in ACLF, prefer CLIF-C ACLF [^113AVroJ]. Always interpret MELD in clinical context and reassess frequently.

## Clinical actions based on MELD score ranges

| **Meld score range** | **Recommended clinical actions** |
|-|-|
| < 15 | - Manage complications (ascites, encephalopathy, variceal bleeding) [^117UrHmw] <br/> - Monitor closely <br/> - Consider referral if decompensation occurs [^111QZEQA] |
| 15–24 | - Urgent transplant referral [^1177yuxf] <br/> - Aggressive management of complications [^117UrHmw] <br/> - Consider MELD-Na for prognostic accuracy [^115mtjrF] |
| ≥ 25 | - Immediate transplant referral [^1177yuxf] <br/> - Priority listing [^113WrME8] <br/> - Intensive monitoring and management [^111Lnner] |

---

## Special considerations

- **MELD-Na**: Incorporates sodium, improving prognostic accuracy [^1136BnTs] [^115mtjrF], especially in hyponatremia.
- **MELD exceptions**: Apply for conditions underestimated by MELD (e.g. HCC, HPS) [^113zziNN] [^117NiH6q].
- **Acute liver failure**: Use MELD with KCC [^112dEDt7]; MELD > 25 indicates high risk [^1151pG9X].
- **ACLF**: Prefer CLIF-C ACLF over MELD for short-term mortality prediction [^113AVroJ].

---

## Limitations of MELD score

- **Laboratory variability**: Inter-laboratory differences can affect accuracy [^1154dGHr].
- **Specific populations**: Less accurate in HCC, cholestatic diseases, and some acute settings [^116LrdzU] [^115xtcAP] [^115B1i1H].
- **Extrahepatic factors**: Does not capture frailty, sarcopenia, or extrahepatic organ failure [^116ozGdt] [^115TxJ5D] [^115B1i1H].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **MELD ≥ 15 or decompensation**: Refer for transplant evaluation [^111QZEQA] [^111XWLee].
- **MELD 15–24**: Urgent referral and aggressive management [^1177yuxf].
- **MELD ≥ 25**: Immediate referral and priority listing [^notfound].
- **Use MELD-Na**: For improved prognostic accuracy [^115mtjrF].
- **Seek exceptions**: When MELD underestimates severity [^1146am2v].
- **ACLF**: Use CLIF-C ACLF for short-term mortality prediction [^113AVroJ].

---

MELD guides urgency and timing of transplant referral, but **clinical judgment and reassessment** are essential to optimize outcomes [^116ozGdt].

AASLD acute-on-chronic liver failure — predictors and contraindications for LT candidate assessment emphasize that a singular score or cutoff may not be able to predict LT candidacy; rather, a composite of trajectory, end-organ severity, and ACLF scores may be helpful, and MELD-Na may not completely capture mortality risk at low MELD-Na scores but performs well at high MELD scores. Patients that meet criteria for both EASL and APASL definitions have worse survival than either definition alone. Pre-LT factors that likely serve as absolute contraindications to LT include high lactate levels (> 9 mmol/L), severe respiratory failure, and increasing vasopressor support. Rather than the absolute number of organ failures, the severity of organ failure plays a role, and among critically ill ICU patients, severe frailty (clinical frailty scale ≥ 7), infection features including < 72 h of antibiotics, FiO2 ratio ≤ 150 mm Hg, and high-dose norepinephrine are highlighted; ventilator support remains a consistent predictor of suboptimal outcomes especially with dialysis, active ongoing infection, and multiorgan failures.

### Management of patients with liver diseases on the waiting list for transplantation: a major impact to the success of liver transplantation [^115vQgCR]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Liver transplantation plays a major role in the therapeutic path of liver diseases. It concerns all patients with end-stage liver disease when other medical therapies have failed as well as a high number of patients with primary liver cancer, mainly hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The success of liver transplantation over the past years has been considerable, with more than 5000 being performed annually in Europe, surmounting to more than 140,000 liver transplantations in total. Such success comes as a consequence of the absence of alternative therapies and of the good post-transplant survival of approximately 90 and 80% at 1 and 5 years, respectively.

In Europe, liver donors are mainly of cadaver origin, either following brain death or cardiac arrest, under the Maastricht 3 procedure. In contrast to living donor transplantation, where the date of liver transplantation is known in advance, in cadaveric donor liver transplantation the date of liver transplantation is unknown. Therefore, the wait for transplantation can vary from a few days in the case of acute liver failure patients to more than 1 year for patients with cirrhosis of intermediate severity or those with HCC. The waiting lists for liver transplantation are composed of three types of patient. (1) Those with acute liver failure, included, in most countries, in a super-emergency waiting list giving them absolute priority over all other recipients, and receiving a transplant within hours or days. (2) Those with decompensated liver cirrhosis, included in the waiting list on the principle of the 'sickest first', based mainly on the calculation of the Model for End Stage Liver Diseases (MELD) score. Those with very high MELD score may likely access liver transplantation within days or a few weeks, whereas those with intermediate or low MELD scores will access liver transplantation within months or even years. (3) Those with HCC on compensated liver cirrhosis. Organ-sharing agencies assign these patients an artificial score according to the number and size of tumours, providing them access to liver transplantation within a maximum of 18 months. Since the number of candidates on the waiting list is greater than the offer of viable livers, there is some degree of competition between patients. Liver centres should manage their patients according to their clinical situation and the expected waiting time for liver transplantation. For a patient with an end-stage liver disease, the procedure of liver transplantation and the postoperative period remain a heavy procedure. Therefore, patients should be carefully prepared physically and mentally to undergo transplantation, much like an athlete preparing for the Olympic games. The management of patients on the waiting list is essential to avoid death or drop out due to deterioration of their condition as well as to ensure that patients are in the best physical condition possible prior to the procedure – this is essential for the success of the post-operative course.

Management of patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis

In the USA, the MELD score has been implemented since 2002 as a score to prioritise access to liver transplantation. Most countries in Europe have implemented the principle of the 'sickest first' to prioritise such access also based on the MELD score, despite some differences between countries. The principle of the 'sickest first' is one of justice and has achieved a reduction in mortality whilst on the waiting list in most countries. However, there are several inherent issues that must be addressed.

First, the MELD score, calculated from bilirubin, creatinine and international normalised ratio levels, is not the holy grail. Some patients with severe liver diseases are poorly represented by the MELD score, such as, for example, patients with cholestatic diseases, who have, until the very late stage, a low MELD score due to normal international normalised ratio and creatinine levels, patients with refractory ascites and otherwise preserved liver function, patients with chronic encephalopathy due to portacaval shunts, and patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome. Thus, these patients should be offered MELD exception points to provide them the possibility to access liver transplantation.

### The unwell patient with advanced chronic liver disease: when to use each score? [^115TxJ5D]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The intrinsic strengths of the MELD scores come from their objective construction as a product of multivariate analysis, representing the best method to minimise confounders and increase statistical power. Being continuous scores, they also possess higher statistical power. The MELD scores are also independent of disease aetiology and decompensated sequelae (ascites, HE, acute variceal bleeding). The increasing burden of metabolic associated fatty liver disease and the decreasing incidence of ACLD due to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection indicates that the dominant liver disease aetiologies have changed, and disease courses are likely to be different. As the MELD score is not affected by disease aetiology, it is more resistant to the changing etiological landscape of liver disease.

Whilst the components of the MELD scores are independent predictors of mortality, each may have varied significance due to the maladaptive neurohormonal and physiological responses in ACLD. Rosenstengle and colleagues conducted a large analysis of transplant-listed candidates, stratifying them by dominant biochemical parameter: bilirubin (MELD-Br, n = 13,658), INR (MELD-INR, n = 13,809), and creatinine (MELD-Cr, n = 12,412). Survival was lower for females across each group, emphasising the importance of prospectively validating the MELD 3.0 score, whilst the MELD-Cr had significantly lower 1-year intention-toto-treat rates (p < 0.001). Creatinine is a variable that may be affected by many patient-specific characteristics including sarcopenia and myosteatosis, which are themselves independent predictors of survival. Lattanzi and colleagues demonstrated in a prospective trial of 249 cirrhotics that radiologically identified sarcopenia and myosteatosis were independently associated with mortality, and that amalgamating them with the MELD score resulted in improved prediction of 3- and 6-month mortality. Meta-analyses have supported the prognostic importance of sarcopenia. The limitations of each variable in the MELD scores including hyponatremia are further discussed in the supplement.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^115B1i1H]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Prognosis in acute-on-chronic liver failure — once it develops, the probability of 28-day mortality ranges from 30% to 50%, and outcomes are often driven by the number and severity of organ failures; severity scores such as MELD and MELD-Na may underestimate mortality among patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure because they capture intrinsic liver disease but not the impact of extrahepatic organ failures.

### The unwell patient with advanced chronic liver disease: when to use each score? [^112xM92j]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prognostication in chronic liver disease and the implementation of appropriate scoring systems is difficult given the variety of clinical manifestations. It is important to understand the limitations of each scoring system as well as the context and patient group from which it was developed to allow appropriate application. This review seeks to explore the optimal clinical uses of different predictive scores developed for compensated and decompensated chronic liver disease, acute on chronic liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. We will also review future areas of research for each score and current gaps in the literature.

Main Body

The Child-Pugh score is the pre-eminent prediction score for liver disease that was developed through empiric selection of relevant variables. It is useful for selection of patients for surgical resection of hepatocellular carcinoma but is inferior to other scores for other clinically relevant endpoints such as survival in acute decompensations. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score and subsequent variants (MELD-Na, MELD 3.0) were developed to predict mortality following elective transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) insertion. An alternative is the Frieberg Index of Post-TIPS Survival (FIPS) score, which has been externally validated for TIPS populations. Organ allocation for liver transplantation is also currently prioritised using the MELD score, with the MELD 3.0 reducing waitlist gender discrepancies. The Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) acute decompensation (AD) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) scores are used for predicting mortality in cirrhotic patients with acute decompensation of liver disease and acute-on-chronic liver failure, respectively. Both scores were developed from retrospective analyses of an observational European cohort with external validation. Understanding of ACLF presentation of advanced liver disease remains in the preliminary stages. Improving collective understanding is important to optimise prognostication. The albumin-bilirubin score is a non-invasive predictor of survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Incorporating artificial intelligence to personalise predictive algorithms may provide the most effective prognostication for all clinical phenotypes.

Conclusion

We summarised key prognostic scores used in advanced liver disease and make recommendations for the optimal uses. Nuances in the development and implementation of each are discussed to help guide effective use.

### MELD scores of liver transplant recipients according to size of waiting list… [^113vEZyj]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 Author Affiliations: Division of Gastroenterology/Hepatology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver. Context The Model for Endstage Liver Disease score serves as the basis for the distribution of deceased-donor livers and was developed in response. A further recommendation was that the liver allocation system be based on an objective point system, including medical characteristics predictive of prognosis. During the subsequent 4 years, the Model for Endstage Liver Disease score was developed, studied, and finally implemented in February 2002 and serves as the basis for the liver allocation system used by the United. Network for Organ Sharing. 2–4 The MELD score reflects the recommendations of the IOM review and the final rule in that its basis is an objective scoring system of medical characteristics predictive of prognosis, with minimal emphasis on waiting time as a priority for transplantation.

However, the IOM recommendation to increase and standardize. 5, 6 and the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. 7 The SRTR reports the distribution of MELD scores between 6 and 10, 11 and 18, 19 and 24, and 25 and 40. MELD scores were based on laboratory values at reference. If all of the necessary laboratory values were not available, the patient was assigned a MELD score of 6. We designated the OPOs as "small" if fewer than 100 patients were listed for liver transplantation within the OPO and "large" if at least 100 patients. was the same in large and small OPOs; 92% had a MELD score of 18 or lower. The implementation of the MELD score as the basis for DD liver allocation has improved the distribution of organs. Deceased-donor livers are preferentially transplanted into sicker patients, which has reduced waiting list mortality without reducing posttransplantation survival.

9 However, considerable disparity in MELD scores for liver recipients still exists between. goal of the final rule, which is the ". creation of a 'level playing field' in organ allocation — that is, organs are allocated based on patients' medical need and less emphasis is placed on keeping organs in the local area where they are procured. "1 The disparity in MELD score that we have demonstrated would likely be.

### Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^112xCCCe]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Liver transplantation (LT) MELD exception process and condition-specific guidance states that for an LT candidate whose Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score does not adequately reflect the severity of their liver disease, an appeal for MELD exception points should be made to the RRB (1-B). Budd-Chiari syndrome in its fulminant and chronic form was thought to be adequately served by the current allocation policy provisions for status 1 designation and calculated MELD score prioritization, respectively. Conditions such as polycystic liver disease and pruritus were considered inappropriate for additional MELD points, and RRBs were instructed to refrain from granting any exceptional consideration. For the majority of conditions there was acknowledgment that the recommendation was for case-by-case consideration with specification of clinical data to be submitted to the RRB with prospective data collection. For these infrequent indications, potential recipients do not typically have hepatocellular failure and need to have extra MELD points assigned to allow LT.

### Hepatic encephalopathy and liver transplantation: the past, present, and future toward equitable access [^115C4W4h]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis is a debilitating chronic disease with high morbidity and mortality, with the only real cure being liver transplantation (LT). Currently, we allocate organs for transplantation based on the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium (MELD-Na) score that does not account for hepatic encephalopathy (HE). HE affects patients, families, and the health care system because of high rates of recurrence and major readmission burden. Moreover, HE casts a long shadow even after LT. Accounting for HE and incorporating it into the current allocation system has many proponents, but the framework to do this is currently lacking because of differences in consensus or in operationalization parameters. We review the latest evidence of the burden of HE, management of HE before and after LT, and evaluate pros and cons of several methods of diagnosing HE objectively to ensure early and equitable access to LT in this underserved population.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^1153xPfe]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease — treatment failure definitions, biochemical targets, and transplant evaluation are outlined as follows. Treatment failure may occur with any WD medication at initiation or during maintenance; once concurrent disease and nonadherence are excluded, pharmacological therapy should be re-evaluated and likely altered, and for advanced liver disease or liver failure, evaluation for liver transplantation should be considered; currently, no surrogate markers are established. Biochemical failure at initiation involves the inability to prevent worsening or exacerbation of liver injury and may be assessed using parameters of liver synthetic function and liver injury, with the aim to reduce these to less than twice (i.e., < 2 times) the upper limit of normal over time; synthetic function may respond more slowly than aminotransferases, typically 3–18 months. INR is a good measure of synthetic function, as is albumin. In cirrhosis, the MELD score may be calculated and followed with the expectation that it should improve over 3–18 months' time; in patients with MELD scores > 15 who are worsening or failing to improve after 3 months, evaluation for liver transplant may be necessary. Measuring 24-h urinary copper excretion on treatment can be highly informative and should be measured at least annually; for those on oral chelators, some prefer to measure 24-h urinary copper excretion after a 48-h washout period of drug.

### Update on the management of the liver transplant patient [^115mtjrF]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review and highlight recent literature regarding the medical management of adult patients undergoing liver transplantation.

Recent Findings

The addition of serum sodium concentration to the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score more accurately predicts 90-day waitlist mortality. Predictors of waitlist mortality and posttransplant survival include lower albumin and the presence of ascites, varices, and encephalopathy, as well as more nontraditional predictors such as older age, obesity, frailty, and sarcopenia. Indications for liver transplantation are evolving with the advent of effective therapy for hepatitis C and the increased prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Disparities persist in the current allocation system, including geographic variation and MELD inflation for hepatocellular carcinoma. Share 35 allows for broader regional sharing of organs for patients with the highest need, without detrimental effects on waitlist mortality or survival. Everolimus is a recently approved option for posttransplant immunosuppression that spares renal function.

Summary

The MELD score has enabled the liver transplant community to equitably allocate organs. Recent literature has focused on the limitations of the MELD score and the disparities inherent in the current system. The next steps for liver transplantation will be to develop strategies to further optimize waitlist prioritization and organ allocation.

### The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) [^116KfzDw]. Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) was initially created to predict survival in patients with complications of portal hypertension undergoing elective placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. The MELD which uses only objective variables was validated subsequently as an accurate predictor of survival among different populations of patients with advanced liver disease. The major use of the MELD score has been in allocation of organs for liver transplantation. However, the MELD score has also been shown to predict survival in patients with cirrhosis who have infections, variceal bleeding, as well as in patients with fulminant hepatic failure and alcoholic hepatitis. MELD may be used in selection of patients for surgery other than liver transplantation and in determining optimal treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who are not candidates for liver transplantation. Despite the many advantages of the MELD score, there are approximately 15%-20% of patients whose survival cannot be accurately predicted by the MELD score. It is possible that the addition of variables that are better determinants of liver and renal function may improve the predictive accuracy of the model. Efforts at further refinement and validation of the MELD score will continue.

### The MELD score in patients awaiting liver transplant: strengths and weaknesses [^116LrdzU]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Adoption of the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) to select and prioritize patients for liver transplantation represented a turning point in organ allocation. Prioritization of transplant recipients switched from time accrued on the waiting list to the principle of "sickest first". The MELD score incorporates three simple laboratory parameters (serum creatinine and bilirubin, and INR for prothrombin time) and stratifies patients according to their disease severity in an objective and continuous ranking scale. Concordance statistics have demonstrated its high accuracy in stratifying patients according to their risk of dying in the short-term (three months). Further validations of MELD as a predictor of survival at various temporal end-points have been obtained in independent patient cohorts with a broad spectrum of chronic liver disease. The MELD-based liver graft allocation policy has led to a reduction in waitlist new registrations and mortality, shorter waiting times, and an increase in transplants, without altering overall graft and patient survival rates after transplantation. MELD limitations are related either to the inter-laboratory variability of the parameters included in the score, or to the inability of the formula to predict mortality accurately in specific settings. For some conditions, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, widely accepted MELD corrections have been devised. For others, such as persistent ascites and hyponatremia, attempts to improve MELD's predicting power are currently underway, but await definite validation.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^1177yuxf]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Rescue liver transplantation — preoperative planning and timing in cirrhosis emphasize clarifying transplant candidacy, deferring elective operations when feasible, and prioritizing transplant evaluation when risk is high. Before a surgical procedure, it is important to determine whether or not the patient will be a candidate for liver transplantation in the future. In patients who are not potential candidates, this position should be made clear before proceeding with surgery, and if a patient is a candidate, a decision should be made as to whether the planned surgery can be postponed until after transplantation. Elective operations such as orthopedic procedures may be best deferred, and when a necessary procedure cannot be delayed because of quality-of-life impact, the liver transplant evaluation should be completed before the anticipated surgery, if possible. If the MELD score is > 15 (a score predictive of increased mortality), immediate evaluation for liver transplantation is recommended.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^115oz3js]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD Practice Guidance — Infection in ACLF and cirrhosis notes that infection is the most common precipitant of ACLF worldwide, with a prevalence of 48%. High-risk groups include younger male patients, alcohol-associated cirrhosis, and those with a high MELD score. In patients without ACLF who develop infection, risk factors for progression to ACLF include the presence of ascites, HE, higher MELD score, nosocomial infection, inadequate first antibiotic treatment, and type of infection (pneumonia > SBP). The most common infections are SBP, urinary tract infection skin/soft-tissue infections, and respiratory infections in descending order, and therefore a high level of suspicion for infection is needed in all patients with cirrhosis who present to the emergency room. Biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate, and bacterial DNA are often elevated in patients with cirrhosis both with and without infection, and a persistent elevation of these markers is a poor prognostic indicator. Patients with ACLF and infection have more severe systemic inflammation and a higher probability of death than patients with ACLF without infection. Even if patients survive ACLF, they have an increased risk of subsequent infections; 45% of patients with cirrhosis discharged after successful treatment of one infection acquire another infection within 6 months. Infection prevention measures are crucial in the hospitalized patient and are outlined in Table 5 and Supplemental Materials.

### Predicting prognosis in patients with end-stage liver disease… [^1179PLt9]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

A modification of the MELD that prioritized patients on transplant lists eliminated the cause of cirrhosis. The United Network for Organ Sharing modification is the most current version of the MELD and is the most widely used score for predicting prognosis in patients with end-stage liver disease. The CTP score includes bilirubin and serum albumin levels, INR, and presence or absence of ascites and encephalopathy. 4 The study used the version of the MELD that included creatinine, bilirubin, INR, and cause of cirrhosis. The mean age of patients was 57 years, about two thirds were men, and most had alcoholic cirrhosis. The accuracy of each score was measured using the concordance-statistic: 1 was a score that perfectly predicted the outcome in question, and 0 was a score that failed to predict any outcome correctly.

The study showed: the MELD, the CTP score, and the Emory score were similar in accuracy for predicting three-month mortality; the MELD was more accurate than the others for predicting 12-month mortality; and the MELD and the CTP score were more accurate than the Emory score for predicting 36-month mortality. 4 A study including 140 patients undergoing TIPS showed that the MELD was more accurate than the CTP score for predicting three-month mortality.
5. A systematic review identified nine studies comparing the MELD with the CTP score: five of these studies included patients with end-stage liver disease undergoing TIPS, and four included a broader population of patients with cirrhosis. 6 The MELD was similar to the CTP score in accuracy in all studies except one, which showed that the MELD was superior for predicting three-month mortality.
6. 7 This validation study used the older version of the MELD, which added 6.

MELD score and subsequent variants (MELD-Na, MELD 3.0)

With the development and increasing utilisation of novel rescue procedures to manage bleeding oesophageal varices, the MELD score was developed in 2000 to predict 3-month mortality following TIPS insertion. The initial score was developed in a retrospective cohort of 231 patients undergoing elective TIPS insertion between 1991 and 1995. The study excluded those with severe cardiopulmonary or intrinsic renal disease, whilst OLT was not considered a disease endpoint, which may lead to observation bias. The derivation study internally verified the MELD scores' capacity to predict mortality in patients following TIPS insertion, which was quickly expanded to patient selection for liver transplantation (Additional File 1: Table S2).

The combination of serum sodium level and MELD score soon became of interest given that hyponatremia is an independent predictor of risk of complications following liver transplantation. Kim and colleagues retrospectively analysed a cohort of liver transplant patients in order to determine the predictive ability of the MELD score and the MELD score plus sodium for 3-month mortality (Additional File 1: Table S3). From 2016, the MELD-Na score was adopted by UNOS for deceased donor liver allocation. Objectivity, however, was not pursuant to the implementation of the MELD or MELD-Na scores for donor allocation as there were higher rates of waitlist mortality in female patients. The MELD score predicts lower overall mortality in female patients, possibly due to reduced creatinine production. Kim and colleagues again used a large cohort of 29,410 waitlist candidates to amend the MELD score, re-weighing the importance of creatinine whilst introducing albumin and sex as covariates in the MELD 3.0. The derivation cohort demonstrated re-stratification of 8.8% of patients to a higher score, thereby increasing the effectiveness of organ allocation with improved discrimination in comparison to MELD-Na (concordance statistic 0.869 vs. 0.862, p < 0.01). It has been adopted as the current allocation standard by UNOS whilst European guidelines support its use. An external retrospective study engaging 6071 transplant candidates identified that female sex is not an independent predictor when incorporated into Cox regression analysis with the MELD 3.0. Whilst it was powered to detect significant differences, the design does not effectively test the impact of the MELD 3.0 and prospective studies are needed to assess whether it truly accounts for gender discrepancies.

### ACG clinical guideline: perioperative risk assessment and management in patients with cirrhosis [^114WiezT]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Key concepts: overall perioperative risk stratification in cirrhosis — Comprehensive evaluation of surgical risk in patients with cirrhosis requires consideration of liver-related factors, non–liver-related comorbidities, and surgery-specific factors, and individualized estimation is best accomplished by combining validated cirrhosis-specific surgical risk calculators with clinical judgement and individual patient circumstances. In conjunction with clinical judgment, cirrhosis-specific risk scores including the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), Childs-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP), Mayo, and VOCAL-Penn Score are useful to estimate operative risk, and nonhepatic comorbid conditions require independent assessment. In patients with known liver disease but unknown fibrosis stage, FIB-4 and/or elastography may be used to identify advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis, and patients with very low MELD (6–9) and CTP (5–6) scores and no evidence of clinically significant portal hypertension or hepatic decompensation have limited excess risk of adverse surgical events; preoperative assessment of frailty may help to inform surgical risk.

Regulatory requirements for LDLT are more stringent than for DDLT, and thus programs must be structured with necessary surgical, medical and staff complements.

Expert panel comment

Composite mathematical scores are used in clinical practice to assess the severity of underlying liver disease, and hence determine the outcome and prognosis after liver resection. Application of the Child–Pugh score and Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD), which were developed primarily for management of patients with cirrhosis, are of limited use in management of fibrotic, steatotic and non-cirrhotic livers, and do not specifically predict PHLF after elective liver resection. Still, diagnosing underlying liver diseases helps in selecting patients for further functional liver tests. Risk score calculators specific to PHLF, which include purely preoperative parameters based on the type of resection planned, patient demographics, and routine laboratory values, are useful in identifying high-risk patients who will benefit from further functional assessment, or adjustment of treatment strategies (such as consideration of minimally invasive surgical access, or parenchymal-sparing or 2-stage approaches).

Q3: What is the role of combining clinical information (clinical signs and laboratory results) with imaging for statistical models predicting PHLF?

Statistical models integrating FLR volume with imaging, clinical or laboratory parameter surrogates of liver function or portal hypertension allow preoperative prediction of PHLF, and should be considered in patients with a suspected or known underlying liver disease (for example alcohol-associated liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, CASH), especially when progressed to cirrhosis.

### Evaluation for liver transplantation in adults: 2013 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the American Society of Transplantation [^111WACaB]. Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Model for Endstage Liver Disease (MELD) score — The MELD score was initially devised to evaluate 3-month prognosis in patients with cirrhosis undergoing a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure and incorporates serum creatinine and bilirubin with the international normalized ratio (INR). The MELD score is now used to assess prognosis in cirrhosis in a variety of settings, including organ allocation for LT, and it is on a continuous scale from 6 to 40 that corresponded to a 3-month survival of 90% to 7%, respectively. Application of the MELD score has determined that the risk of deceased donor LT in patients with a MELD < 15 outweighs its benefits in most circumstances. Development of hyponatremia in cirrhosis is a marker of increased waiting list mortality and neurological dysfunction post-LT, and incorporation of serum sodium into the MELD score has been proposed to increase priority for organ allocation to candidates with hyponatremia to reduce waiting list deaths.

### AASLD practice guidance: palliative care and symptom-based management in decompensated cirrhosis [^111y1s41]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Hospice care in decompensated cirrhosis (DC) is characterized as end-of-life care (EoLC) focused on comfort, distinct from palliative care, and eligibility in the USA is tied to Medicare Part A with a prognosis certified as ≤ 6 months; given that DC is often incurable with life expectancy that may be well below 6 months, many patients with DC qualify. Hospice is EoLC focused on allowing people in the last phases of incurable disease to live as fully and comfortably as possible. Hospice is different than palliative care in that it focuses exclusively on comfort, rather than disease-directed curative treatment, and includes only persons with a life expectancy measured in months. In the USA, the hospice benefit is provided under Medicare Part A, and patients must have a defined, time-limited prognosis (certified by one or more physicians as ≤ 6 months). DC is in many cases incurable, and life expectancy, which can be predicted with models such as the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Child-Pugh-Turcotte scores, may be well below 6 months. Because of the poor prognosis of DC, many patients with DC qualify for hospice benefits, which can help support patients and their caregivers.

### Management of patients with liver diseases on the waiting list for transplantation: a major impact to the success of liver transplantation [^113WrME8]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Management of patients with high MELD score or in the intensive care unit (ICU)

There is a debate regarding the high mortality risk after liver transplantation in patients with a high MELD score. Some authors consider that transplantation in these patients can be futile. On the one hand, the survival benefit for these patients is extremely high as shown in patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis or with acute-on-chronic liver failure; on the other, the high mortality rates after liver transplantation can be considered a waste of organs. The MELD score is highly predictive of the risk of mortality on the waiting list. Patients on the waiting list with a MELD score of over 30 or 40 have an expected mortality rate of more than 50 and 70%, respectively, within 3 months. Therefore, there is justification to prioritise these patients. In patients with very high MELD scores (> 35), there is a risk of high post-transplant mortality and of over indication for liver transplantation. There is a consensus that for scores up to MELD 35, post-transplant survival remains unmodified. In patients with a MELD score above 35, there is currently no consensus on the potentially higher risk of post-transplant morbidity and mortality; however, the postoperative morbidity and ICU length of stay are significantly higher. Interestingly, the percentage of patients with chronic liver disease transplanted while in the ICU or soon after recovery remains low (< 10%). There are several reasons for this. First, patients in the ICU are frequently not evaluated for liver transplantation either because they are not in a liver ICU or because liver transplantation is considered too risky and futile. Several authors have tried to determine, through scores such as the Frailty scoring system or other scores, the limits at which transplantation is futile. Our personal opinion is that this line of futility is permanently evolving.

### Preoperative characteristics and intraoperative transfusion and vasopressor requirements in patients with low vs. high MELD scores [^116AqFog]. Liver Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Recent changes in organ allocation based on the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) prioritize the most ill patients on the waiting list for liver transplantation. While patients undergoing liver transplantation in the MELD era are more acutely ill, the impact of the policy changes on perioperative management has not been completely assessed. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 124 primary adult liver transplant patients. Patients were divided into low (≤ 30) and high MELD (> 30) score groups. Preoperative characteristics and intraoperative management were compared between the 2 groups. Patients with high MELD scores had lower baseline hematocrit and fibrinogen levels and were more likely to require ventilatory and vasopressor support before transplantation. Intraoperative transfusion requirements and use of vasopressors were also significantly increased in patients with high MELD scores compared to patients with low MELD scores. In conclusion, these data suggest that pretransplant MELD scores provide important information for perioperative management of patients undergoing liver transplantation.

### Management of patients with liver diseases on the waiting list for transplantation: a major impact to the success of liver transplantation [^115A8Yyx]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Management of patients with HCC

Patients with HCC on decompensated liver cirrhosis may have access to transplantation through the MELD score. However, most of the patients with HCC on the waiting list have a compensated liver cirrhosis and a low MELD score. Thus, these patients cannot get access to liver transplantation through the MELD score. Therefore, patients with HCC on the waiting list will gain points according to the size of the tumour and the number of nodules as well as waiting time duration. There are some differences between countries, yet the principle is highly similar. In general, no additional points are given for TNM1 tumours (a single nodule below 2 cm) where strategies other than liver transplantation should be favoured (i.e. percutaneous radiofrequency, surgical resection). In contrast, patients with TNM2 tumours will gain points with waiting time. The time between listing and transplantation depends on the number of points given to these patients and may vary according to the policy of the organ-sharing agencies. During this period, the centres should have a strategy to limit or reduce tumour growth in order to avoid drop out from the waiting list. It has been shown that a bridge therapy for HCC is necessary for projected waiting times of over 6 months. The treatment of HCC during this period may have a double objective; first, to reduce the size and number of active tumours in order to place patients within the criteria for transplantation (downstaging of the tumour) and, second, to reduce and avoid tumour progression. The treatment strategies for HCC may include percutaneous radiofrequency, surgical resection of some tumour nodules, transarterial chemoembolisation and, in some cases, sorafenib. The treatments can be combined according to the type and the progression of HCC. Despite these strategies, some patients will drop out from the list due to the progression of HCC outside the criteria for transplantation. The three main poor prognosis factors in patients with HCC are the regular increase of AFP, an AFP level of over 1000 ng/mL and the invasion of the portal vein by the tumour. These factors can become a contraindication for liver transplantation due to the high risk of recurrence after liver transplantation.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for the management of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults [^111FnjUD]. Gut (2024). Medium credibility.

No randomised controlled trials have compared the outcome of treatments in patients eligible for both transplant and resection. Traditionally, liver transplant has been the preferred approach, certainly for patients with multifocal disease, as it is considered to provide the optimal oncological resection, treat the underlying cirrhosis and has excellent long-term outcomes, including overall and recurrence-free survival. Applicability of transplant may be limited by organ shortage. In the past decade, a number of studies have focused on the best approach for these patients. Two meta-analyses have evaluated this question. Postoperative morbidity and mortality, and short-term (1 year) OS were worse for those treated with a transplant. A comparison of pooled 5-year OS shows that transplant was associated with better outcomes (63% LT vs 58% LR and 61% LT vs 49% LR, respectively, for each study). It should be noted that recurrent disease after resection is high, with 5-year recurrence rates ranging from 18% to 72%.

The following points need consideration when considering optimal therapy for a patient. For multifocal disease within criteria, transplant probably offers superior survival to resection. Resection may be considered in patients not suitable for transplant. For a solitary nodule > 2 cm in diameter, transplant probably offers the best outcome long term, but resection is definitively a competitive treatment in carefully selected patients, with good short-term outcomes. The role for an individualised approach was emphasised in a study in which both treatment strategies were compared using a Markov model simulation and included sensitivity analysis-based factors such as patient age, liver function and waiting time for a transplant. Improved outcomes were reported for those receiving a transplant who had advanced liver disease (ie, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 10) and/or portal hypertension. However, equivalent survival outcomes for patients with well-compensated cirrhosis (MELD score < 10) and improved survival following liver resection for those with T1 lesions (solitary lesion without vascular invasion) were reported. These conclusions have been replicated in other studies.

### The current management of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury in the United States and the potential of terlipressin [^111scPkd]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, the MELD scoring system often provides a disservice to patients with HRS‐AKI on transplantation waiting lists. Patients with HRS‐AKI have demonstrated worse survival expectancy than other populations with cirrhosis with equivalent MELD scores. This is because patients with elevated sCr from HRS‐AKI have worse prognoses than patients with AKI because of parenchymal nephropathy. In Italy, the Italian Liver Allocation Policy was recently revised to reflect relevant critical issues and conceptual advances, one being "the inequity of a purely MELD‐based system governing organ allocation". The revised policy now considers HRS an exception, but to date, no such policy revision has been implemented in the United States. Finally, data demonstrate that effective pharmacological treatment of HRS‐AKI improves specific components of the MELD system (ie, sCr, sodium), reducing the score and adversely affecting the priority of patients on the waiting list for liver allocation who remain quite ill and still require life‐saving LT. Nevertheless, this should not be a reason to withhold treatment in patients with HRS‐AKI who are LT candidates, as the benefits of effective management far exceed the risk of decreased priority for LT. An update to amend the allocation policy to allow patients with HRS‐AKI to maintain priority for liver allocation in the setting of effective therapy would be ideal, but more advances in this field are needed. For example, the availability of validated biomarkers to differentiate HRS‐AKI from the pool of other kidney disorders (eg, parenchymal AKIs) is essential to avoid the mislabeling of patients and downstream implications on kidney allocation.

### Prioritization for liver transplantation [^112m1dAs]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

There are three possible policies for prioritization for liver transplantation: medical urgency, utility and transplant benefit. The first is based on the severity of cirrhosis, using Child-Turcotte-Pugh score and, more recently, the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, or variants of MELD, for allocation. Although prospectively developed and validated, the MELD score has several limitations, including interlaboratory variations for measurement of serum creatinine and international normalized ratio of prothrombin time, and a systematic adverse female gender bias. Adjustments to the original MELD equation and new scoring systems have been proposed to overcome these limitations; incorporation of serum sodium improves its predictive accuracy. The MELD score poorly predicts outcomes after liver transplantation due to the absence of donor factors incorporated into the scoring system. Several utility models are based on donor and recipient characteristics. Combined poor recipient and donor characteristics lead to very poor outcomes, which in a utility system would be considered unacceptable. Finally, transplant benefit models rank patients according to the net survival benefit that they would derive from transplantation. However, complex statistical models are required, and unmeasured characteristics may unduly affect the models. Well-designed prospective studies and simulation models are necessary to establish the optimal allocation system in liver transplantation.

### Evidence-based incorporation of key parameters into MELD score for acute-on-chronic liver failure [^113MHiet]. Egastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a critical syndrome defined by the acute exacerbation of the existing chronic liver disease, leading to multiple organ failure and high short-term mortality. Although there are therapies for ACLF, the 90-day mortality rate remains high and increases as the ACLF grade increases. Liver transplantation (LT) improves survival in patients with ACLF. However, it is constrained by the organ allocation policy, shortage of organ donors and high mortality among those awaiting liver transplants. Therefore, it is of critical clinical relevance to accurately and early predict ACLF outcomes to tailor current therapeutic options and provide a rational basis for testing novel therapies.

The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score and the model for end-stage liver disease with sodium (MELD-Na) score are widely used for prognostication in ACLF and for organ prioritisation in LT. However, MELD score and MELD-Na score have not been developed specifically for ACLF assessment and have limited performance. Additional parameters should be identified and incorporated to improve MELD score. However, some prior attempts were limited by the sample size, lack of external validation or weakness of the statistical approach. Besides, a selection bias may exist when screening the parameters in any specific cohort.

To overcome these weaknesses, we used a meta-analysis approach to identify the predictive factors for adverse outcomes in patients with ACLF. The selected factors were validated in two large-scale, multicentre, prospective and observational cohorts. Based on these factors, we developed and validated a prognostic score in an external cohort.

### Disparities in liver transplantation before and after introduction of the MELD score… [^114cfDNn]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

MELD indicates Model for End-Stage Liver Disease; UNOS, United Network for Organ Sharing; AHN, acute hepatic necrosis; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma. Status 1 is defined as fulminant liver failure with a life expectancy without liver transplantation of less than 7 days. Patients listed as temporarily inactive could not be properly assessed for receipt of liver transplantation. The MELD score is based on objective laboratory variables and predicts the risk of mortality within 3 months. In the current system, patients with higher MELD scores receive greater priority for organ allocation regardless of the amount of time spent on the waiting list. The current system also prioritizes patients with hepatocellular carcinoma to increase their likelihood of undergoing liver transplantation before disease progression renders them ineligible.

Studies of the first year under the MELD system reported improved transplantation rates and decreased mortality on the waiting list. 4, 5. To determine which variables to include in the multivariable models, we first performed univariate comparisons by the outcome of interest by each covariate including age, sex, blood type, listing diagnoses, education level, insurance payer, region, calculated MELD score at listing and removal, reason for removal from the waiting list, and comorbid illnesses, retaining those variables with P <.
05. Calculated MELD score was associated with all of the outcomes assessed, including the risk of death, death or becoming too sick for liver transplantation within 3 years of listing, and likelihood of liver transplantation within 3 years of listing in the post-MELD cohort.

For example, patients with more severe liver disease had significantly increased risk of death for each 1-point increase in calculated MELD score if listed without HCC. Black patients continue to be listed with more severe liver disease than white patients. Once MELD is added to the adjusted post-MELD model, it accounts for this difference in severity of liver disease and puts black patients at equal position at listing. Race likely accounted for this difference in the pre-MELD cohort.

### Organ allocation for chronic liver disease: model for end-stage liver disease and beyond [^116ptVWG]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Implementation of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score has led to a reduction in waiting list registration and waitlist mortality. Prognostic models have been proposed to either refine or improve the current MELD-based liver allocation.

Recent Findings

The model for end-stage liver disease - sodium (MELDNa) incorporates serum sodium and has been shown to improve the predictive accuracy of the MELD score. However, laboratory variation and manipulation of serum sodium is a concern. Organ allocation in the United Kingdom is now based on a model that includes serum sodium. An updated MELD score is associated with a lower relative weight for serum creatinine coefficient and a higher relative weight for bilirubin coefficient, although the contribution of reweighting coefficients as compared with addition of variables is unclear. The D-MELD, the arithmetic product of donor age and preoperative MELD, proposes donor-recipient matching; however, inappropriate transplantation of high-risk donors is a concern. Finally, the net benefit model ranks patients according to the net survival benefit that they would derive from the transplant. However, complex statistical models are required and unmeasured characteristics may unduly affect the model.

Summary

Despite their limitations, efforts to improve the current MELD-based organ allocation are encouraging.

### Indications for liver transplantation [^114dvWdu]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Patients should be considered for liver transplantation if they have evidence of fulminant hepatic failure, a life-threatening systemic complication of liver disease, or a liver-based metabolic defect or, more commonly, cirrhosis with complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatorenal syndrome, or bleeding caused by portal hypertension. While the complications of cirrhosis can often be managed relatively effectively, they indicate a change in the natural history of the disease that should lead to consideration of liver transplantation. Referral to a liver transplant center is followed by a detailed medical evaluation to ensure that transplantation is technically feasible, medically appropriate, and in the best interest of both the patient and society. Patients approved for transplantation are placed on a national transplant list, although donor organs are allocated locally and regionally. Since 2002, priority for transplantation has been determined by the Model of End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which provides donor organs to listed patients with the highest estimated short-term mortality.

### Preoperative evaluation of patients with liver disease [^114auviA]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2007). Medium credibility.

Patients with end-stage liver disease often undergo surgery for indications other than liver transplantation. These patients have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality that is related to their underlying liver disease. Assessments of surgical risk provide a basis for discussion of risks and benefits, treatment decision making, and for optimal management of patients for whom surgery is planned. The most useful indicators of surgical risk are indices that predict advanced disease, such as the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score, or those that predict prognosis, such as the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score. Careful preoperative risk assessment, patient selection, and management of various manifestations of advanced disease might decrease morbidity and mortality from nontransplant surgery in patients with liver disease.

MELD exceptions — allocation framework and objectives: Although the biological MELD score serves most candidates, it fails a subset with complications of cirrhosis or relatively rare etiologies of liver disease; Regional Review Boards (RRBs) were established to provide peer review of individual patients poorly served by the standard allocation algorithm. To comprehensively review data and codify expert opinion, the MELD Exception Study Group (MESSGE) Committee was convened by UNOS to identify conditions for which a specific, objective endpoint defines the need for LT such that assignment of additional priority can be automatic (without RRB peer review) and to recommend the amount of additional priority.

When to refer for transplant

LT is the definitive treatment for selected patients with DC and should be considered when the severity of liver disease incurs a likelihood of poor survival or impaired quality of life. A UK clinical guideline outlining the process of LT assessment, including who and how to refer, has recently been published. To summarise, the over-riding principles of LT in the UK are that anticipated life expectancy after LT must exceed that without. A UK Model for End-stage liver disease (UKELD) score of 49 is the equipoise at which the predicted 1 year mortality without LT matches that after LT and is therefore the current minimum listing threshold for elective LT in those with irreversible decompensation.

In the absence of variant conditions, we recommend that referral for LT is considered when a patient with chronic liver disease develops the typical features of DC (ie, jaundice, ascites, variceal bleeding or HE) and UKELD ≥ 49. Early referral is preferable because a patient can become too unwell for LT, if the referral is made too late. The referring clinician should consider first whether the decompensation is potentially reversible (for example with abstinence, in the case of alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), or with antivirals in untreated chronic viral hepatitis). If not, is the patient suitable for LT? Contraindications to LT include coexisting significant extrahepatic comorbidity (with predicted mortality of > 50% at 5 years), presence of extrahepatic sepsis, active malignancy and some previous extrahepatic malignancies. Some contra-indications can be temporary or relative, so if a patient is not currently suitable for LT, consider whether they may be suitable following treatment or an intervention (eg, nasogastric feeding in a patient with severe sarcopenia). If there is any doubt, advice should be sought from the LT unit.

ARLD is the leading indication for LT in the UK. Detailed recommendations for LT referral in ARLD in the UK are beyond the scope of this practice guidance. These have recently been revised. To summarise, it is recommended that patients with decompensated ARLD should be referred to consider their suitability for LT if they still have evidence of decompensation after optimal management and 3 months validated abstinence from alcohol and are otherwise suitable candidates for LT, in line with The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance. Contraindications to LT in ARLD include active ongoing alcohol use, drinking alcohol while on the waitlist and during the period of transplant evaluation, and a history of repeated non-adherence to advice to abstain from alcohol.

### Modelling kidney outcomes based on MELD eras-impact of MELD score in renal endpoints after liver transplantation [^114PHoWr]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver transplantation (LT) is preferred therapy for individuals with advanced chronic liver disease and those with acute liver failure. Disparities among grafts distribution and patient selection force transplant polices to draw a specific liver allocation criterion that include MELD score. From the past 10 years, this score has been used by the UNOS, Euro transplant for prioritizing allocation of liver transplants and Brazilian liver allocation policy instead of the previous CPT score.

MELD score-based liver allocation policy continues under discussion, especially because some authors criticize that patient with remarkably high scores are too sicky to undergoing liver transplantation. Other studies call attention to the increasing prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma that could lead patients without this condition to receive a liver transplant late – because hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis supplements MELD scores irrespective to laboratorial data. Instead, this allocation policy can reduce the time on the waiting list for LT and mortality from all causes of the patient with end-stage liver disease.

Patients undergoing LT frequently experience some degree of AKI through the perioperative period of LT. This AKI could be explained by liver transplantation by itself plus additional insults to the kidney, such as hemorrhage, administration of nephrotoxic drugs, post reperfusion syndrome, hypotension and often substantial blood transfusion. Although kidney injury is usually reversible, it implies some complications, such as increased length of hospitalization, longer mechanical ventilation time, sepsis, and progression to chronic renal failure, directly contributing to lower liver graft and patient survival.

Serum creatinine is a cornerstone of AKI diagnosis in general population. Despite interferences in end-stage liver disease and post LT, this test is still consistent for AKI diagnosis in these setting. Also, MELD score employs serum creatinine as a variable, and it is known that end stage liver disease patient with AKI is more likely to receive a higher priority in transplantation list based on MELD score.

### The utility of early post-liver transplantation model for end-stage liver disease score in prediction of long-term mortality [^114TNAqd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

The study has several limitations. First, its retrospective nature means that unobserved potential confounders may exist that were not controlled for in the analyses. For example we were not able to assess the role of post-LT intensive care unit stay, pre- and post-LT patient care, and rehabilitation in mortality outcomes. Moreover, although we used a relatively large database, the causal relationship between variables may not be generalizable to larger populations because of the single-center design of the current study. Therefore, findings presented in this study should interpreted in the context of its limitations.

In conclusion, immediate postoperative MELD scores after LT may hold value in predicting mortality and could be used as a tool for the postoperative risk assessment of patients. Consequently, in the management of patients with high postoperative MELD scores, warning signs of infection, intra-abdominal bleeding or primary graft dysfunction should trigger the initiation of appropriate therapeutic interventions and careful monitoring. Moreover, the utility of early postoperative MELD scores as a prognostic model may enable physicians to predict the need for re-transplantation during patients' clinical course. Future multicenter cohort studies are warranted to confirm these findings.

Summary Box

What is already known:

The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score is considered as a reliable prognostic model for mortality prediction among patients on the liver transplantation (LT) waiting list
The occurrence of postoperative complications depends on several donor and recipient-related risk factors that contribute to a substantial impact on outcomes and costs
Postoperative patient survival is affected by preoperative factors related to both donor and recipient, including recipient age and quality of the donor liver graft, as well as surgical procedure complexity

What the new findings are:

The immediate postoperative MELD scores after LT could predict mortality
MELD score on postoperative day (POD) 5 was independently associated with mortality
The optimal cutoff value of 14.5 was obtained for MELD score on POD5, which significantly differentiated between surviving and non-surviving patients with a sensitivity of 69.8% and a specificity of 57.2%

### Management of patients with liver diseases on the waiting list for transplantation: a major impact to the success of liver transplantation [^116R1Z8L]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The results of liver transplantation are excellent, with survival rates of over 90 and 80% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. The success of liver transplantation has led to an increase in the indications for liver transplantation. Generally, priorities are given to cirrhotic patients with a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score on the principle of the sickest first and to patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on the principle of priority points according to the size and number of nodules of HCC. These criteria can lead to a 'competition' on the waiting list between the above patients and those who are cirrhotic and have an intermediate MELD score or with life-threatening liver diseases not well described by the MELD score. For this latter group of patients, 'MELD exception' points can be arbitrarily given.

Discussion

The management of patients on the waiting list is of prime importance to avoid death and drop out from the waiting list as well as to improve post-transplant survival rates. For the more severe cases who may swiftly access liver transplantation, it is essential to rapidly determine whether liver transplantation is indeed indicated, and to organise a fast workup ahead of this. It is also essential to identify the ideal timing for liver transplantation in order to minimise mortality rates. For patients with HCC, a bridge therapy is frequently required to avoid progression of HCC and to maintain patients within the criteria of liver transplantation as well as to reduce the risk of post-transplant recurrence of HCC. For patients with cirrhosis and intermediate MELD score, waiting time can exceed 1 year; therefore, regular follow-up and management are essential to maintain the patient alive on the waiting list and to achieve a good survival after liver transplantation.

Conclusion

There is a diversity of patients on the waiting list for transplantation and equity should be preserved between those with cirrhosis of high and intermediate severity and those with HCC. The management of patients on the waiting list is an essential component of the success of liver transplantation.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^116BAALw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Liver transplantation (LT) for HRS-AKI — role, MELD considerations, outcomes, and simultaneous liver-kidney (SLK) criteria: LT is the optimal treatment for HRS-AKI and the etiology of AKI is not accounted for in liver allocation prioritization in the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) sodium–based system; medical treatment should not be withheld despite concerns about lowering MELD sodium. Post-LT renal insufficiency and ongoing need for RRT are correlated with decreased post-transplantation survival. Terlipressin with albumin has been shown to decrease requirement of LT, improve 30-day pretransplantation survival, and lower risk of chronic renal disease after LT, although another study could not confirm these effects. Improvement in kidney function after LT is not universal; approximately 12% of patients remain dialysis dependent after LT. After MELD implementation, there was a > 3000% increase in SLK procedures, and current SLK candidacy requires dialysis or measured/calculated GFR ≤ 25 mL/min for ≥ 6 consecutive weeks; after LT, patients can be listed for kidney alone with high priority if they have persistent renal dysfunction defined by end-stage renal disease or GFR < 20 mL/min.

Solid arrows indicate statistically significant effects; dashed lines, effects that are not statistically significant; and AHF, acute hepatic failure. B, Simplified model depicting statistically significant effects on health-related quality of life. The MELD score has a direct, positive effect on the PCS scale score. Values for each arrow are standardized regression coefficients. AGFI indicates adjusted goodness-of-fit index. a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure. 3 The model was later validated as a way to predict mortality rates in patients with varying severity of hepatic disease. 4 It comprised 3 factors that were significantly associated with mortality and were modeled as a continuous score reflecting disease severity.

The MELD system was implemented in 2002; for purposes of organ allocation, the scores range from 6 to 40.
2. These data led us to our primary aim, to determine whether the pretransplant MELD score correlates with posttransplant HRQOL. Our hypothesis was that an increasing MELD score would have an inverse relationship with physical and mental HRQOL. A single-institution prospective cohort study was performed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center after approval by the institutional review board. The primary variable of interest in all of the models was the MELD score as a single composite measure of disease severity. The tested influence of the MELD score on the HRQOL measures in the context of other variables that have been previously shown to influence HRQOL. The exogenous variables were the MELD score, diabetes, cause of liver disease, length of stay, and time after transplant.

Endogenous variables were rejection episodes, Karnofsky functional performance, and the 4 posttransplant HRQOL outcome measures. The preoperative MELD score, without exception points, had a direct positive effect on the postoperative physical HRQOL. This means that after controlling for other effects in the model, persons with higher pretransplant MELD scores had better posttransplant physical HRQOL. The effect was small but statistically significant in both models of physical HRQOL and was opposite of what we had expected based on the findings by Rodrigue et al8 in which an increasing MELD score was associated with a worse SF-36 PCS scale score.

### The evolution in the prioritization for liver transplantation [^111L9aHj]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Policies for organ allocation can be based on medical urgency, utility or transplant benefit. With an urgency policy, patients with worse outcomes on the waiting list are given higher priority for transplantation [based on the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score or the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, or United Kingdom model for End-stage Liver Disease (UKELD) score]. The MELD and UKELD scores have statistical validation and use objective and widely available laboratory tests. However, both scores have important limitations. Adjustments to the original MELD equation and new scoring systems have been proposed to overcome these limitations; incorporation of serum sodium improves its predictive accuracy and is part of the UKELD score. The utility-based systems are based on post-transplant outcome taking into account donor and recipient characteristics. MELD and UKELD scores poorly predict outcomes after liver transplantation due to the absence of donor factors. The transplant benefit models rank patients according to the net survival benefit that they would derive from transplantation. These models would be based on the maximization of the lifetime gained through liver transplantation. Well-designed prospective studies and simulation models are necessary to establish the optimal allocation system in liver transplantation, as no current model has all the best characteristics.

### AGA clinical practice update on surgical risk assessment and perioperative management in cirrhosis: expert review [^1116YG3D]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Predicting surgical risk in a patient with cirrhosis emphasizes outcomes by preoperative risk and the primacy of liver disease severity. In cirrhotic patients undergoing surgery categorized preoperatively as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class V, Teh et al showed a median survival of 2 days, a 90% mortality rate at 14 days, and a 100% mortality rate at 90 days. The risk of postoperative mortality and complications is related to the degree of hepatic dysfunction, comorbidities, type of surgical procedure, and expertise of the management team, and Of these factors, the severity of the liver disease appears to be the most important factor in determining mortality risk. The severity of liver disease has traditionally been assessed in the literature by the Child–Turcotte–Pugh (CTP) score (Child–Pugh class) and the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, and If the surgical risk is much higher than the chance of a good outcome from the perspective of the patient, then the procedure should be considered futile and avoided regardless of the patient's degree of liver disease.

### The unwell patient with advanced chronic liver disease: when to use each score? [^115Ta494]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

In the management of chronic liver disease, survival and prognosis are used to guide treatment decisions and discussions with patients and their caregivers. For a clinician, it is important to have appropriate tools to provide an accurate and realistic assessment of the natural course of a patient's disease. Multiple scores have been developed to model survival outcomes in advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD). The first widely utilised score, the Child–Pugh score (CPS), remains one of the preeminent models for cirrhosis despite having been developed through empirical selection of relevant variables. More recently, contemporary scores have been derived from statistical analysis for variables independently predictive of mortality: the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score has historically represented the most used alternative to the CPS. However, the landscape of ACLD has evolved since the development of these scores and will continue to change. Aetiological causes of ACLD have transitioned from predominantly viral hepatitis to alcoholic-associated liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Whilst the optimal diagnostic criteria for steatotic liver disease remain unclear, extended definitions now include patients that may not have been considered to have liver disease when index scores were derived. ACLD may also manifest in a variety of phenotypes including acute decompensations (AD) of ACLD, acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF), stable ACLD in patients awaiting orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) and those with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There are varied outcomes for each of these conditions. Moreover, the collective understanding of ACLF is incomplete, with a unifying definition not yet established. The advancement of contemporary understanding of ACLD requires re-assessment of prognostic tools. The aim of this review is to summarise, appraise, and compare current scores assessing disease in ACLD and highlight when each may be most useful.

The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score is widely used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation. One of the pitfalls of the MELD score is the interlaboratory variability in all three components of the score (INR, bilirubin, creatinine). The interlaboratory variability in the INR has the largest impact on the MELD score, with a mean difference of around 5 MELD points in most studies. During the 3rd conference on Coagulopathy and Liver disease, a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians discussed possible solutions for the INR problem in the MELD score with the intention to provide a constructive contribution to the international debate on this issue. Here we will discuss possible solutions and highlight advantages and disadvantages.

Severe alcoholic hepatitis — pharmacotherapy and referral: Patients with MDF > 32 or MELD score > 20 without a contraindication to glucocorticoid may be treated with methylprednisone 32 mg daily, but the appropriate duration of treatment remains a subject of controversy. Methylprednisone does not improve survival beyond 28 days, and the benefits for < 28 days are modest. Patients with a contraindication to glucocorticoids may be treated with pentoxifylline 400 mg three times daily with meals, though data regarding the efficacy are conflicting. Patients with severe AH, particularly those with a MELD score > 26 with good insight into their alcohol use disorder and good social support should be referred for evaluation for liver transplantation, as the 90-day mortality rate is very high, while patients with mild to moderate AH defined by a MELD score < 20 and MDF < 32 should be referred for abstinence counseling and prescribed a high protein diet supplemented with B vitamins and folic acid.

### Hepatocellular carcinoma [^114Jrd3p]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) hepatic reserve scoring is outlined: MELD is a numerical scale ranging from 6 (less ill) to 40 (gravely ill) for individuals ≥ 12 years, derived using three laboratory values (serum bilirubin, creatinine, and INR), and has been adopted by the United Network for Organ Sharing to stratify patients on the liver transplantation waiting list according to their risk of death within 3 months. Advantages include incorporation of renal function and an objective laboratory-based system, but clinical assessments of ascites and encephalopathy are not included; it is currently unclear whether MELD is superior to the Child-Pugh (C-P) score as a predictor of survival, and MELD has not been validated as a predictor of survival in patients with cirrhosis who are not on a liver transplantation waiting list. Serum creatinine, an important component of MELD, can be an unreliable marker of renal dysfunction, especially in patients with cirrhosis.

This association has also been described in trauma patients. 7 As there are 3 laboratory components to the MELD score, the association between a change in MELD score and 90-day mortality may reflect changes in liver or renal function in the first 48 hours of critical care. These data demonstrate that in critically ill patients with CLD, increased MELD score is associated with increased mortality and hospital readmission following EGS. Concurrently, MELD score reduction exerts a protective effect in this patient population.

The identification of exposures that are predictive of outcomes in EGS patients may be useful for preoperative planning and may be useful inclusions for future risk stratification models. Furthermore, EGS patients with CLD might benefit from enhanced longitudinal care following hospital discharge to reduce unplanned readmissions. Further investigation into the relationship between MELD score and outcomes in patients without CLD is warranted.

Introduction

Liver transplantation is still a complex and cost-intensive procedure and the results are influenced by many interrelated factors. As liver transplantation has become a universally accepted treatment for end-stage liver disease, the number of patients accumulating on the waiting list has gradually outweighed the scarce resources of available organs. Fair allocation of donor livers to patients with end-stage liver disease is a difficult task. The USA and Europe used prioritization systems based on waiting time and on the parameters of the Child-Turcotte-Pugh score. Since February 2002, the United Network for Organ Sharing introduced a new allocation policy for cadaveric liver transplants, based on the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. This new policy stratifies the patients based on their risk of death while on the waiting list. The impact of MELD score on postoperative mortality remains elusive. There are reports of reduced survival in groups with high MELD scores, but also reports of no influence of MELD score on survival.

Furthermore, the unique pathophysiology of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) has important implications on critical care treatment after transplantation. Although liver transplantation has been the sole treatment of patients with ESLD for over 20 years, only limited data are available addressing the intensive care management and complications of this patient population.

The current challenge is to optimize outcome with limited resources, because liver transplantation remains financially expensive with incremental costs when postoperative complications occur. Therefore, it is essential to identify and modify risk factors to improve postoperative ICU management.

In this study we addressed the question of whether MELD score affects postoperative morbidity, represented by an increased length of stay in the ICU and mortality in patients after liver transplantation. Furthermore, the study was undertaken to determine the major ICU problems in such patients and to outline and predict major clinical risk factors regarding length of stay in the ICU and mortality.

Therefore, data from all consecutive liver transplants performed in our institution over six years, from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2008, were analyzed.

### The new liver allocation system: moving toward evidence-based transplantation policy [^115CZkoh]. Liver Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

In 1999, the Institute of Medicine suggested that instituting a continuous disease severity score that de-emphasizes waiting time could improve the allocation of cadaveric livers for transplantation. This report describes the development and initial implementation of this new plan. The goal was to develop a continuous disease severity scale that uses objective, readily available variables to predict mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease and reduce the emphasis on waiting time. Mechanisms were also developed for inclusion of good transplant candidates who do not have high risk of death but for whom transplantation may be urgent. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) and Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease (PELD) scores were selected as the basis for the new allocation policy because of their high degree of accuracy for predicting death in patients having a variety of liver disease etiologies and across a broad spectrum of liver disease severity. Except for the most urgent patients, all patients will be ranked continuously under the new policy by their MELD/PELD score. Waiting time is used only to prioritize patients with identical MELD/PELD scores. Patients who are not well served by the MELD/PELD scores can be prioritized through a regionalized peer review system. This new liver allocation plan is based on more objective, verifiable measures of disease severity with minimal emphasis on waiting time. Application of such risk models provides an evidenced-based approach on which to base further refinements and improve the model.

### Model for end-stage liver disease exceptions in the context of the French model for end-stage liver disease score-based liver allocation system [^115NHYEA]. Liver Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score-based allocation systems have been adopted by most countries in Europe and North America. Indeed, the MELD score is a robust marker of early mortality for patients with cirrhosis. Except for extreme values, high pretransplant MELD scores do not significantly affect posttransplant survival. The MELD score can be used to optimize the allocation of allografts according to a sickest first policy. Most often, patients with small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and low MELD scores receive extra points, which allow them appropriate access to transplantation comparable to the access of patients with advanced cirrhosis and high MELD scores. In addition to patients with advanced cirrhosis and HCC, patients with a number of relatively uncommon conditions have low MELD scores and a poor prognosis in the short term without transplantation but derive excellent benefits from transplantation. These conditions, which correspond to the so-called MELD score exceptions, justify the allocation of a specific score for appropriate access to transplantation. Here we report the conclusions of the French consensus meeting. The goals of this meeting were (1) to identify which conditions merit MELD score exceptions, (2) to list the criteria needed for defining each of these conditions, and (3) to define a reasonable time interval for organ allocation for each MELD exception in the general context of organ shortages. MELD exceptions were discussed in an attempt to reconcile the concepts of transparency, equity, justice, and utility.

Prognosis and Transplantation

To date, it often remains difficult to predict which ALF patients will ultimately require transplantation. Newer models, including the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, have not improved our accuracy. In fact, the discriminative power of the MELD was not found to be superior to that of the INR or the King's College Hospital criteria. In addition, equating transplantation with death, in many models, inflates the positive predictive value of a particular system. The King's College Criteria remain the most clinically useful, with a sensitivity of 68%-69% and a specificity of 82%-92%. However, reliance entirely upon any set of guidelines cannot be recommended.

Despite great early interest in liver support systems, the field has had little forward movement since our last publication. Both artificial (i.e. sorbent-based) and bioartificial (i.e. cell-based) systems have been tested. There has been no good evidence that any artificial support system reliably reduces mortality in the setting of ALF. Thus, the currently available liver support systems cannot be recommended outside of clinical trials.

Liver transplantation remains the only definitive treatment for patients who fail to demonstrate recovery. The 1-year survival after cadaveric liver transplant for ALF is less than that observed in patients transplanted for chronic liver failure. However, after the first year, this trend had reversed and ALF patients have a better long-term survival. The use of live donor liver transplantation and auxiliary liver transplant remain controversial. Urgent cadaveric liver transplantation remains the standard of care in the setting of ALF.

Developing effective methods of liver support or other alternatives to transplantation and better prognostic scoring systems remain key goals to further improve overall survival rates and avoid unnecessary transplants.

### The utility of early post-liver transplantation model for end-stage liver disease score in prediction of long-term mortality [^11197LFo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver transplantation (LT) has been considered as a curative treatment modality for patients with end-stage liver disease. Despite recent advances in both surgical techniques and the medical management of patients, short- and long-term adverse outcomes following LT still represent the major source of morbidity and mortality. The occurrence of postoperative complications depends on several donor- and recipient-related risk factors and may have a substantial impact on outcomes and costs. Thus, postoperative patient survival is affected by preoperative factors related to both donor and recipient, including recipient age (older than 60 years), comorbid conditions (e.g. diabetes, renal failure, cardiac or pulmonary disease, malnutrition) and the quality of the donor liver graft, as well as the complexity of the surgical procedure.

The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score was originally designed and validated to predict mortality in patients with portal hypertension who developed complications due to transjugular portosystemic shunt. Subsequently, this scoring system was modified and used as the standard tool in prioritizing candidates for LT. In addition, previous studies have indicated that the MELD score is a reliable prognostic model for 3-month mortality among patients awaiting LT. Although the utility of the MELD score in predicting pre-transplant mortality has been extensively investigated, there are only limited data concerning its relation with post-transplantation outcomes. Recently, the MELD score on postoperative day (POD) 5 was found to be significantly associated with the risk of death after hepatectomy. This finding may lead to a better assessment of the severity of clinical risk scores and could be used to guide clinical decision-making concerning the medical management of patients. Therefore, in the current study we aimed to evaluate the prognostic ability of the post-transplantation MELD score in the prediction of long-term outcomes following LT.

Table 1
Predictive models used in patients with cirrhosis undergoing surgery

In patients with cirrhosis, non-urgent surgery should be deferred until an adequate assessment has been undertaken and their liver disease optimised. The clinical team should consider referral to a unit with experience in managing patients with cirrhosis, where appropriate. Consideration should also be given to non-surgical options if available/appropriate. Care should be taken to optimise nutrition. For patients with compensated cirrhosis, after appropriate perioperative risk stratification and counselling, surgery may then be indicated.

Emergency surgery in patients with cirrhosis carries an increased mortality risk, and cirrhosis is an independent predictor of death. In the emergency setting, where deferring surgery may not be feasible, the patient and surgical, anaesthetic and medical teams must weigh the potential benefits and risks collaboratively. Table 2 summarises the anaesthetic considerations when planning surgery in patients with cirrhosis.

Table 2
Anaesthetic considerations in the cirrhotic patient

Surgery in decompensated cirrhosis

Surgery in patients with decompensated cirrhosis carries a significantly higher mortality risk than compensated cirrhosis. Eligibility for liver transplantation, if the patient was to decompensate following surgery, should be determined prior to surgery. In patients with Child-Pugh C or MELD > 20, surgery should be avoided or delayed until after liver transplantation, if possible, for all but the most urgent and lifesaving procedures. Good palliation of symptoms is crucial in patients unsuitable for transplant where surgery is considered too high risk, as well as in all patients waiting for surgery post-transplant.

Abdominal wall hernias are common in patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and mortality is high in those undergoing surgery. The clinical team should consider discussion with an experienced centre to guide management of recurrent ascites with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) and other sequelae of decompensation in the perioperative/postoperative period. The decision to offer hernia repair and its timing will be influenced by the patient's eligibility for liver transplantation and the nature of their presentation. Where patients have undergone assessment and are awaiting liver transplantation, hernia repair may be deferred until the time of transplantation (when it can be undertaken during or following liver transplantation). In patients who are not candidates for liver transplantation elective repair of symptomatic umbilical hernia (if feasible) can be undertaken and may avoid the added risk of emergency surgery. In patients who develop life-threatening complications of an abdominal wall hernia (skin breakdown with leaking ascites, incarceration, obstruction or strangulation) emergency repair may still be undertaken but the morbidity and mortality increases significantly.

### Decompensated cirrhosis but low MELD-should we wait or refer for liver transplantation? [^112voG1h]. Liver Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Cirrhosis constitutes a significant global health burden with decompensation characterized by ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, as well as variceal hemorrhage. These decompensation features are independent predictors of mortality. Liver transplantation remains the definitive treatment for patients with cirrhosis. However, given that this is a limited resource, thus its allocation, using the MELD score, has to be judicious despite decompensation features affecting the patient's quality of life. Patients with grade 3 ascites or overt hepatic encephalopathy have significant mortality; therefore, in some instances, these decompensation features should be considered indications for liver transplantation despite low MELD. The majority of patients listed for liver transplantation have low MELD scores (≤ 15 points); and approximately half will die due to liver-related complications. Current evidence demonstrates a mortality reduction of ~40% with LT in those patients with a low MELD. Furthermore, new scores have been developed, such as the MELD 3.0, which incorporates female sex, albumin, and all the MELD-Na components (bilirubin, creatinine, international normalized ratio, and sodium), and the Gender-Equity Model for Liver Allocation, that includes bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and the Royal Free Hospital glomerular filtration rate, which have demonstrated improved discrimination. Lastly, to address the limited resource, living donor liver transplant has demonstrated a significant survival benefit in patients even at MELD-Na scores as low as 11, suggesting that life-years gained are similar to deceased-donor transplant. In this review, our goal is to present the frequency of patients listed for transplant with low MELD, and the limitation of using MELD in patients for liver transplantation. We will provide practical guidance on the management of common complications of cirrhosis and early consideration for liver transplant referral in patients with clinical decompensation and low MELD.

Even without hepatic failure, hepatic dysfunction before DMCS implantation is associated with increased bleeding and transfusion needs, as well as risks of allo-sensitization, lung injury with exacerbation of right ventricular dysfunction, and infection; to minimize bleeding risk, coagulation abnormalities should be corrected and unnecessary antiplatelet agents should be discontinued before DMCS, ideally 3 to 7 days before surgery. Patients with confirmed cirrhosis or end stage liver disease are noted as poor candidates for DMCS except in very rare circumstances.

A MELD score greater than 20 also should prompt consideration of steroid treatment. Abstinence from alcohol should be promoted to improve long-term prognosis in AH.

### Close observation versus upfront treatment in hepatocellular carcinoma: are the exception points worth the risk? [^113zziNN]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver transplantation is the most durable long-term treatment strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the setting of cirrhosis. Unfortunately, both HCC incidence and mortality continue to rise in the USA while availability of liver allografts for liver transplantation remains stable. Although 30 000 patients are diagnosed with HCC annually, less than a quarter are listed for liver transplantation. Of 6000 transplants annually, only 1300 per year are performed for HCC, with 15% of patients dying while waiting for an organ. Without treatment, 5-year survival rates are dismal at 20%.

Most patients with HCC have a low biological model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, and consequently MELD does not predict mortality for these patients in the same way it does for decompensated cirrhotics. For these patients, the risk of HCC progression and transplant wait list removal are generally independent of MELD score. To equalise wait list mortality between patients with HCC and decompensated cirrhotics, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN)established criteria to award exceptions for transplant candidates with HCC. Based on these criteria, patients with tumours that are > 2 cm in diameter and < 3 in number (T2 tumours) are granted 'MELD exception points' to increase priority for liver transplantation and compensate for their risk of progression and dropout. These criteria are an adaptation of the Milan criteria, which help determine transplant eligibility based on tumour burden, and are defined as one lesion less than 5 cm or three lesions less than 3 cm. As such, the current allocation system prioritises liver transplantation for patients with T2 lesions. Given a perceived lower risk of progression, exception points are not given for tumours < 2 cm in diameter (T1 tumours), prompting many centres to observe T1 lesions for progression to T2, rather than treat with immediate liver-directed therapy (LDT).

Due to a paucity of data, the ideal management strategy of T1 HCCs remains poorly defined. The two principal strategies for managing T1 HCC are immediate LDT versus observation of T1 tumours until progression to stage T2 (OPTN 5B)where patients can be listed for transplant with a MELD exception score. Currently, only limited data have compared observation versus LDT strategies with respect to T1 tumours. The aim of this study was to compare the rate of T1 tumour progression beyond Milan criteria in patients treated with immediate LDT to patients who were observed for progression to T2 criteria in anticipation of transplant listing.

Concluding remarks

LT programs around the world have been deeply affected by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most LT centers reduced their transplant activity because of inadequate resources and the increased risk of nosocomial spread, factors that were considered to outweigh the benefit of performing an LT. Additionally, professional associations of hepatology and transplant providers recommended that LT should be limited to emergency cases and that each center should evaluate any operation on a case-by-case basis, giving priority to patients with acute liver failure or ACLF with high MELD scores, as well as HCC patients at the upper limits of the Milan criteria. Another important issue that was raised during the COVID-19 pandemic is the increased alcohol consumption, and the relapse in abstinent patients, that were both noticed in several countries around the world. LT programs were heavily impacted by this phenomenon, as it resulted in higher MELD scores, increased mortality and a greater frequency of ALC cases in the LT waiting lists. As novel treatment and vaccination strategies against SARS-CoV-2 started to appear, clinicians and researchers tried to incorporate all the new information into their practice. In particular, regarding high-risk groups such as immunocompromised LT patients, it is mandatory that their management should be guided by the latest guidelines, which we summarize in this review. Based on the knowledge that was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, medical societies should be properly prepared in the future in order to manage similar outbreaks in a more efficient way and with a lower impact on everyday hospital care, including SOT programs.
