## Question

Symptoms warranting emergency cholecystectomy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when emergency cholecystectomy is indicated, including timing, special populations, and when to avoid or defer surgery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core indication and the default standard of care. Then, I should verify the timing windows and how they vary by guideline. Next, I will examine absolute and relative contraindications and how to triage high-risk patients. After that, I need to consider special populations such as the elderly, those with cirrhosis, and pregnancy. I will then review alternative strategies like percutaneous cholecystostomy and when they are appropriate. Finally, I should synthesize a practical decision framework and close with key takeaways and caveats anchored to guidelines and outcomes data.

> Let me first confirm the core indication. Acute calculous cholecystitis is the principal scenario warranting emergency cholecystectomy, and early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the first-line treatment whenever feasible, with benefits including shorter length of stay, fewer complications, and lower costs compared with delayed strategies, so the default should be to operate rather than observe unless there is a compelling reason not to [^1169Tm3N] [^112Ku9zv] [^111wc8A3].

> Wait, let me verify the timing because this is where confusion often arises. Multiple high-quality sources converge on an early window: WSES recommends surgery within about 7 days of admission and within 10 days of symptom onset, while Tokyo-aligned guidance favors within 72 hours of onset when possible; large observational data also show fewer biliary complications and shorter stays when surgery occurs within 3 days of admission, and consensus statements define "immediate" as within 72 hours and "delayed" as beyond that, acknowledging an unfavorable intermediate period between roughly 10 days and 4 weeks when inflammation complicates dissection [^111wc8A3] [^112veDkw] [^114HP1rz] [^115Kyo8g] [^111VQvDj] [^112yGBq5].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about delaying in everyone who presents late. I should double-check whether the 72-hour mark is a hard cutoff; it is not. Evidence supports that laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains appropriate and advantageous up to 7–10 days from symptom onset, albeit with potentially higher technical difficulty and conversion risk, so the team should individualize based on local expertise and patient factors rather than reflexively deferring beyond 72 hours [^111wc8A3] [^111VQvDj].

> Next, I should review absolute contraindications to emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy. I need to ensure I state this clearly: septic shock and absolute anesthesia contraindications are the main settings in which laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be avoided; in these cases, source control with resuscitation and, if needed, percutaneous cholecystostomy is preferred until the patient is stabilized and fit for surgery [^117EMiyr] [^1155Ff6t] [^1128wR23].

> Let me consider high-risk but potentially operable patients carefully. Advanced age alone is not a contraindication; in fact, elderly patients benefit from early laparoscopic cholecystectomy compared with drainage or delayed surgery, with lower morbidity and mortality, and guidelines endorse attempting a laparoscopic approach first unless there are absolute contraindications or profound instability; similarly, patients with Child-Pugh A–B cirrhosis and even some pregnant patients can undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy safely when managed appropriately, ideally in the second trimester for pregnancy [^112RGZUY] [^1173RQdM] [^112KVF3P] [^114NW7ER] [^1146EiQ8] [^1152d9gs].

> I will now examine when to escalate to open surgery or a bailout technique. Severe local inflammation, inability to achieve the critical view of safety, bleeding in Calot's triangle, suspected bile duct injury, or dense adhesions are situations where conversion to open or subtotal cholecystectomy should not be viewed as failure but as a safety maneuver; subtotal cholecystectomy is a validated option in difficult gallbladders and can reduce bile duct injuries when anatomy is obscured [^112gKPmb] [^1146EiQ8] [^111tuCQ6].

> But wait, what if the patient is too unstable for any immediate operation? I should confirm the role of percutaneous cholecystostomy. PC should be reserved for patients unfit for surgery, particularly those with sepsis or failure of medical therapy, and framed as a bridge to interval cholecystectomy rather than definitive therapy; recent high-quality evidence suggests PC offers no clear advantage over antibiotics alone except in the presence of sepsis, and interval cholecystectomy is best scheduled 8–13 weeks after drainage with a clamping trial before tube removal to reduce complications [^1128wR23] [^1116GvkB] [^114MiQW9].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied that delayed surgery after PC is uniformly safer; I should correct that. Delayed cholecystectomy after initial nonoperative management carries a meaningful risk of interim biliary events and emergency presentations, with meta-analytic data showing about 18.5% re-presentation and 9.7% requiring earlier-than-planned emergency surgery, reinforcing the principle to proceed to definitive cholecystectomy as soon as the patient is optimized [^116nwiyt].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against guidelines. If the patient has acute calculous cholecystitis and is hemodynamically stable without absolute anesthesia contraindications, offer early laparoscopic cholecystectomy ideally within 72 hours but acceptable up to 7–10 days from symptom onset; if septic shock or an absolute anesthesia contraindication exists, prioritize resuscitation and consider PC as a bridge; in the elderly, cirrhotics, or pregnant patients, favor early laparoscopic cholecystectomy with appropriate perioperative precautions rather than defaulting to drainage or delay; throughout, apply safe cholecystectomy principles and be ready to convert or perform subtotal cholecystectomy when anatomy is unsafe [^1169Tm3N] [^111wc8A3] [^117EMiyr] [^112KVF3P] [^112gKPmb] [^1128wR23].

> I should double-check that my key takeaways align with outcomes data. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy reduces hospital stay, wound infections, and resource utilization, and is associated with fewer serious adverse events and lower costs compared with delayed strategies; even in high-risk cohorts, well-selected patients often fare better with surgery than with drainage, which supports a surgical-first mindset when feasible [^111wc8A3] [^116ZBA5k] [^1152d9gs].

> Finally, a quick self-check on scope and caveats. This synthesis focuses on acute calculous cholecystitis; acalculous cholecystitis in the critically ill is a different entity where PC is more commonly indicated, and timing of cholecystectomy should be individualized once the acute illness improves; also, local expertise, theater access, and patient preferences matter, so shared decision-making and regional pathways are essential to translate these principles into practice [^112Ku9zv] [^1125hEBg].

Emergency cholecystectomy is indicated for **acute cholecystitis with sepsis or organ dysfunction** [^117EMiyr], **gangrenous or perforated gallbladder** [^112Ku9zv], **failure of medical therapy** [^1128wR23], or **acute biliary pancreatitis with persistent biliary obstruction** [^notfound]. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferred in stable patients within 72 hours of symptom onset [^112veDkw] [^111VQvDj]; however, surgery should be avoided in septic shock or with absolute anesthesia contraindications [^117EMiyr]. Percutaneous cholecystostomy is reserved for high-risk or unstable patients as a bridge to surgery [^1128wR23] [^1116GvkB].

---

## Clinical indications for emergency cholecystectomy

### Acute cholecystitis with systemic infection or organ dysfunction

- **Sepsis or septic shock**: Patients with acute cholecystitis presenting with sepsis or septic shock require immediate source control via emergency cholecystectomy or percutaneous cholecystostomy if unstable [^1155Ff6t] [^1128wR23].

- **Organ dysfunction**: Acute cholecystitis complicated by organ dysfunction (renal, respiratory, hepatic) necessitates urgent surgical intervention [^notfound].

---

### Gangrenous or perforated gallbladder

Gangrenous cholecystitis, marked by gallbladder wall necrosis, carries a **high risk of perforation, abscess, and mortality** and requires emergency cholecystectomy [^114XJjpD]. Perforated gallbladder with **localized or generalized peritonitis** also mandates immediate surgical intervention to prevent sepsis and death [^1146EiQ8].

---

### Failure of conservative management

Failure of medical therapy — persistent pain, fever, or leukocytosis despite antibiotics and supportive care — indicates the need for **emergency cholecystectomy** [^1128wR23] [^113zVkYf].

---

### Acute biliary pancreatitis with persistent biliary obstruction

Persistent biliary obstruction due to gallstones in the common bile duct causing pancreatitis requires **urgent ERCP followed by early cholecystectomy** during the same admission [^113iKkiK] [^112utMyF].

---

## Timing of emergency cholecystectomy

Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within **72 hours of symptom onset** is recommended for stable patients with acute cholecystitis, as it reduces complications, length of stay, and recurrence [^112veDkw] [^114fo6CM] [^111VQvDj]. Delayed cholecystectomy is considered for patients stabilized after initial conservative management or percutaneous cholecystostomy, typically scheduled within **6–8 weeks** [^1128wR23] [^1116GvkB].

---

## Contraindications to emergency cholecystectomy

Absolute contraindications include **septic shock** or **absolute anesthesia contraindications** [^117EMiyr]; relative contraindications include **severe comorbidities**, **high surgical risk** (ASA IV), or **unstable hemodynamics**, in whom percutaneous cholecystostomy is preferred [^1116GvkB] [^114MiQW9].

---

## Alternative interventions

Percutaneous cholecystostomy is indicated for **high-risk, unstable, or elderly patients** unfit for surgery, serving as a bridge to definitive cholecystectomy or as definitive management in select cases [^1128wR23] [^1116GvkB]. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (**ERCP**) is indicated for **concomitant choledocholithiasis** with endoscopic stone extraction before or during cholecystectomy [^115AUCwC] [^112utMyF].

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^115MsxNQ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) has a high incidence in the general population. The presence of several areas of uncertainty, along with the availability of new evidence, prompted the current update of the 2016 WSES (World Society of Emergency Surgery) Guidelines on ACC.

Materials and Methods

The WSES president appointed four members as a scientific secretariat, four members as an organization committee and four members as a scientific committee, choosing them from the expert affiliates of WSES. Relevant key questions were constructed, and the task force produced drafts of each section based on the best scientific evidence from PubMed and EMBASE Library; recommendations were developed in order to answer these key questions. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria (see https://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/). All the statements were presented, discussed and voted upon during the Consensus Conference at the 6th World Congress of the World Society of Emergency Surgery held in Nijmegen (NL) in May 2019. A revised version of the statements was voted upon via an online questionnaire until consensus was reached.

Results

The pivotal role of surgery is confirmed, including in high-risk patients. When compared with the WSES 2016 guidelines, the role of gallbladder drainage is reduced, despite the considerable technical improvements available. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) should be the standard of care whenever possible, even in subgroups of patients who are considered fragile, such as the elderly; those with cardiac disease, renal disease and cirrhosis; or those who are generally at high risk for surgery. Subtotal cholecystectomy is safe and represents a valuable option in cases of difficult gallbladder removal.

Conclusions, Knowledge Gaps and Research Recommendations

ELC has a central role in the management of patients with ACC. The value of surgical treatment for high-risk patients should lead to a distinction between high-risk patients and patients who are not suitable for surgery. Further evidence on the role of clinical judgement and the use of clinical scores as adjunctive tools to guide treatment of high-risk patients and patients who are not suitable for surgery is required. The development of local policies for safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^111tuCQ6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The present update of the WSES Guidelines on ACC clarifies that, in 2016, the reasons for conversion were used as a proxy in the absence of high-quality studies; we maintained the same approach for the current version of the guidelines.

When expertise in difficult instances of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is ensured, the conversion is not a failure and it represents a valid option to be considered. The quality of the evidence is moderate. However, the absence of opportunities to achieve a higher quality of evidence, along with the broadly used conversion to open surgery and the clinical impact on patients' safety, suggests a strong recommendation for conversion to open surgery after laparoscopy has been attempted at the best institutional level available. Nevertheless, according to Gupta et al. surgeons should adopt a philosophy of safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Understanding the mechanisms related to specific complications may help elaborating strategies to avoid or reduce those complications; in this context, the surgeon should define, in their own personal armamentarium, the indications for a bailout techniques among the available options.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^113GfcMy]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The estimated overall prevalence of gallstones is 10–15% in the general population, with some differences across countries. Between 20 and 40% of patients with gallstones will develop gallstone-related complications, with an incidence of 1–3% annually; acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) is the first clinical presentation in 10–15% of the cases. Cholecystectomy is the most common therapeutic approach for ACC and is considered the standard of care for gallstone disease for the majority of patients. However, considering the heterogeneity of clinical scenarios, the variability in hospital facilities and in the availability of expertise, the management of patients with right upper quadrant abdominal pain may vary.

In 2016, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) published the first edition of their guidelines for ACC, which presented different diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms, compared with the Tokyo Guidelines (TG), known at that time as Tokyo Guidelines 2013 (TG13). In particular, the direct link between diagnostic criteria for ACC, severity classification and therapeutic indications described in the TG13 are limited by lack of quality evidence. The approach of the WSES guidelines was to simplify the initial management of patients presenting with suspected ACC. The literature review, the discussion of the relevant evidence and the statements made during the consensus conference (CC) held in Jerusalem in 2015 (Third WSES International Congress) supported surgery as the gold standard treatment for all patients with ACC, with two exceptions: patients who refuse surgery, and patients for whom surgery would be considered as 'very high risk', although no clear consensus was reached on this second issue. Moreover, the 2016 WSES Guidelines on ACC included discussions on unclear areas, such as diagnosis, evaluation of the surgical risk and appropriate management of associated common bile duct stones (CBDS).

### 2020 WSES guidelines for the detection and management of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy [^116PvTaW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Bile duct injury (BDI) is a dangerous complication of cholecystectomy, with significant postoperative sequelae for the patient in terms of morbidity, mortality, and long-term quality of life. BDIs have an estimated incidence of 0.4–1.5%, but considering the number of cholecystectomies performed worldwide, mostly by laparoscopy, surgeons must be prepared to manage this surgical challenge. Most BDIs are recognized either during the procedure or in the immediate postoperative period. However, some BDIs may be discovered later during the postoperative period, and this may translate to delayed or inappropriate treatments. Providing a specific diagnosis and a precise description of the BDI will expedite the decision-making process and increase the chance of treatment success. Subsequently, the choice and timing of the appropriate reconstructive strategy have a critical role in long-term prognosis. Currently, a wide spectrum of multidisciplinary interventions with different degrees of invasiveness is indicated for BDI management. These World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines have been produced following an exhaustive review of the current literature and an international expert panel discussion with the aim of providing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate and standardize the detection and management of BDIs during cholecystectomy. In particular, the 2020 WSES guidelines cover the following key aspects: (1) strategies to minimize the risk of BDI during cholecystectomy; (2) BDI rates in general surgery units and review of surgical practice; (3) how to classify, stage, and report BDI once detected; (4) how to manage an intraoperatively detected BDI; (5) indications for antibiotic treatment; (6) indications for clinical, biochemical, and imaging investigations for suspected BDI; and (7) how to manage a postoperatively detected BDI.

Emergency laparoscopic surgery allows both the evaluation of acute abdominal pain and the treatment of many common acute abdominal disorders. This review critically evaluates the current evidence base for the use of laparoscopy, both diagnostic and interventional, in the emergency abdomen, and provides guidance for surgeons as to current best practise. Laparoscopic surgery is firmly established as the best intervention in acute appendicitis, acute cholecystitis and most gynaecological emergencies but requires further randomised controlled trials to definitively establish its role in other conditions.

### Indications of cholecystectomy in gallstone disease [^1161nQJr]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent studies showed new insights in the indication and timing of cholecystectomy in gallstone disease. This review will provide an overview.

Recent Findings

Considerable variations in indication for gallbladder surgery have been noticed leading to a significant number of unnecessary cholecystectomies. As a consequence, up to 33% of patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease have persistent abdominal pain after cholecystectomy. On the other hand, studies showed that certain patients with acute cholecystitis, common bile duct stones and biliary pancreatitis benefit from same admission instead of delayed cholecystectomy.

Summary

A critical view on indications for cholecystectomy in patients with uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease prevents unnecessary cholecystectomies. In patients with mild-to-moderate complicated symptomatic gallstone disease, same-admission cholecystectomy reduces the risk of recurrent complications.

### Is there a difference in textbook outcomes of emergency cholecystectomy in older patients compared with younger patients? [^115wFgU3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

After the SPRIMACC Study, which was focused on post-operative major morbidities after cholecystectomy in acute calculous cholecystitis, the data of the same patient group of the study was used to implement the TO concept in emergency cholecystectomies; the results were published a short time ago. In this prospective multicenter observational study, the aims were defined to identify factors related to achieving TO and to propose an international definition for TO parameters, in patients with urgent early cholecystectomy for ACC.

As a surgical team believing this concept to be of some value, we determined it would be beneficial to increase the data produced on it as developed in cases of acute cholecystitis, which remain one of the most common emergency surgery indications worldwide. While working on this subject, we hoped to compare our results to examples in the literature, although there exists only a limited number of studies on the use of the concept. As it was hoped to reference the approach used in the most comprehensive and prospective multicenter study with the largest number of patients, we favoured the criteria used by the SPRIMACC Collaborative (SC) and proposed as an international definition. In this particular study, younger age was a protective factor for achieving textbook outcome in initial univariate analysis, however after completion of the multivariate analysis, age was not found to have a significant relation to achieve textbook outcome. On the other hand, in the study by Iseda et al. being elder was found to be a cause of TO failure in the multivariate analysis results. It may be considered that this issue will remain controversial for some time, as it is noted that as life expectancy increases, the association between health status and chronological age becomes increasingly variable. At this point, the results of the study by Loozen et al. should be recalled, which support early LC for elderly, high-risk patients over percutaneous gallbladder drainage. Ultimately, current revisions and possible variations in algorithms resulting from this study and other possible similar outcomes, signify that we are likely to question the effects of ageing population more frequently in LC for acute calculous cholecystitis.

### Improved management of acute gallstone disease after regional surgical subspecialization [^111TsP1o]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Acute gallstone disease is a common indication for emergency hospital admission, and evidence now strongly supports early laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the treatment of choice. Recent data from the UK suggest that this is achieved in a minority of cases with a high proportion of patients managed by deferred elective surgery or emergency open cholecystectomy. We present results of a policy of definitive treatment during index admission after subspecialist reorganization of a regional emergency surgical service.

Methods

Data for all emergency gallstone admissions were retrieved from a prospectively collected regional surgical audit database and results were compared from 31 month periods before and after subspecialist service reorganization in August 2002.

Results

A total of 2442 patients were analyzed. Before subspecialization, 458 of 733 patients (62.4%) underwent cholecystectomy during index admission; after subspecialization, cholecystectomy during index admission for biliary colic/acute cholecystitis was achieved in 666 of 817 (81.5%) patients (90.2% laparoscopic, 6.5% conversion rate, and 3.3% primary open cholecystectomy) with a reduction in hospital stay from median 5 to 4 days. The rate of deferred surgery decreased from 37.5% to 18.4%. Early surgery reduced total hospital admission by more than 1 day per patient compared with deferred surgery.

Conclusions

Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy during emergency admission is cost-effective and should be regarded as the standard of care. However, it requires appropriately trained surgeons and availability of a dedicated emergency room, which at present are not consistently provided in all regions of the UK.

### Indications for and optimal management of percutaneous cholecystectomy drainage: a systematic review [^1128wR23]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Use of percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) has increased over the past 20 years without consensus regarding indications and management.

Objective

To identify indicators for PC, clarify the management of a PC tube (PCT), and suggest the timing of further interventions.

Evidence Review

A systematic review was conducted to identify studies examining PC. Five databases were selected and searched from inception to December 31, 2024: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Inclusion criteria were prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses published within the last 5 years, randomized clinical trials, prospective cohort studies, retrospective cohorts, cross-sectional studies, and case-control studies with multivariate analyses.

Findings

Of 3774 publications identified, 69 studies met the inclusion criteria. There were 5 randomized clinical trials, 2 prospective cohort analyses, 40 retrospective cohort analyses, 1 case-control study, 12 cross-sectional studies, 3 systematic reviews, and 6 meta-analyses. PC was outperformed by cholecystectomy and offered no apparent benefit compared to antibiotic-only management (AOM) except among patients with concomitant sepsis. Interval cholecystectomy (IC) following PC was associated with better outcomes compared to a definitive PC. Factors associated with failure to undergo IC include congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic liver disease (CLD). IC within 8 weeks and beyond 13 weeks after PC was associated with increased complications. Removal of PC before IC was associated with reduced complications but an increase in the likelihood of undergoing emergency IC. A PCT clamp trial was a better test than tube cholangiogram for PCT removal.

Conclusion and Relevance

PC should only be considered among poor surgical candidates unable to undergo immediate cholecystectomy. Indications for PC include cholecystitis sepsis or AOM failure. PC should be approached as a bridging therapy to IC with careful consideration among patients with CHF and CLD. PC removal before IC should be guided by a successful clamping trial to reduce complications and interim recurrence. IC should be performed 8 to 13 weeks after PC.

### Acute cholecystitis: WSES position statement [^114HXLyF]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The literature about the treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis has been recently examined in more than one Consensus Conference. The disease could present with a picture ranging from mild, self-limiting, to a potentially life-threatening illness, and the severity of inflammation and its life-threatening potential is also strongly determined by the general condition of the patient. The degree of inflammation of the gallbladder and the conditions of patients with their co-morbidities contribute to indicate the best therapeutic option for every single patient. However, such heterogeneity makes very difficult to standardize a therapeutic protocol for this condition.

The optimal surgical treatment for acute cholecystitis should be examined according to its severity; however, no uniform grading system is yet available, and the need for practical patient-related operative guidelines has been stressed elsewhere.

Even the evidences about the outcome of the therapeutic procedures adopted are difficult to evaluate in this heterogeneous context; studies available have not generally examined the optimal treatment for acute cholecystitis according to its severity. A systematic review of the literature must take into consideration this aspect.

The literature review has been presented to the 2nd World Society for Emergency Surgery held in Bergamo in July 2013. This position paper follows the indication emerged in that meeting.

### 2017 WSES and SICG guidelines on acute calcolous cholecystitis in elderly population [^113GLTod]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute cholecystitis, more specifically with respect to cholecystectomy, indications, SICG/WSES 2019 guidelines recommend to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis in elderly patients, because it is safe, feasible, with a low complication rate, and associated with shortened hospital stay.

### Acute cholecystitis during COVID-19 pandemic: a multisocietary position statement [^113PFv6N]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

What therapeutic strategy for acute cholecystitis during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) remains the treatment of choice for AC, even in the COVID-19 era.

All current guidelines recommend LC as the gold standard of therapy for AC, because of the better results in terms of mortality, morbidity, and postoperative hospital stay compared to open cholecystectomy (OC).

The Italian guidelines, promoted by SICE in 2012 in collaboration with all the leading Italian scientific societies and our evidence-based guidelines on laparoscopic cholecystectomy published in 2015, reiterated that "patients with acute cholecystitis should be treated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy" with a grade of recommendation A in the former and "strong" in the latter. This indication also applies in the case of elderly patients and those with severe AC. The guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) agree with this setting.

Several studies have emphasized that many toxic components of the surgical smoke may endanger the operating team's health.

Blood-borne viruses (HPV, HBV, HIV) are known to be present in the plume produced by electrocautery and other energy devices. However, although the SARS-Cov-2 RNA has recently been detected in the peritoneal cavity, there is no evidence to indicate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in surgical smoke.

No evidence emerged suggesting that the risk of COVID-19 infection related to LC may be higher than that of OC, neither for the patient nor for the health professionals. Therefore, this working group does not consider that patients should be denied the benefits that high-quality studies have shown to be associated with LC. We recommend surgeons to take the necessary safety measures to reduce the risk of viral diffusion in the operating theater and ensure that patients continue to benefit from advantages of laparoscopic surgery.

### Is there a difference in textbook outcomes of emergency cholecystectomy in older patients compared with younger patients? [^114UPotY]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute cholecystitis (AC) is the first presentation in approximately 15% of patients with gallstone disease and it accounts for 7% of the emergency abdominal pain consultations. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) represents the gold standard option in management of the acute cholecystitis if there is no cause to contraindicate it. Despite some remaining as a high-risk population, a significant proportion of elderly patients diagnosed with AC are being managed with LC.

Textbook outcome (TO) is a composite measure of quality of surgical care. Its definition as a concept is achieving an uneventful course for a patient undergoing surgery. Initially defined as a 'textbook outcome' in colorectal surgery, the concept was subsequently carried over to and popularised in the field of esophagogastric surgery. Currently, it increasingly used in various fields of surgery literature, although it should be stated that in general, the use of this concept in benign diseases and emergency surgery remains limited. The highly variable presentations of emergency patients, comorbidities and diverse types of interventions render establishing textbook outcomes challenging in this patient group. Physiologically instability in these patients make them particularly unwell and more likely to have poorer outcomes, which are expressed as additional adverse factors for emergency cohorts. Despite these challenging situations, emergency patient group-specific scenarios, such as "emergency laparotomy" and "trauma laparotomy", have been suggested as a basis to overcome these challenges, given the large spectrum of patients and pathologies.

### Pre-operative antibiotics in patients with acute mild cholecystitis undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy: is it really useful? A systematic review [^113ZLimw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with acute cholecystitis. Current guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the Tokyo Guidelines 2018 (TG18) recommend performing early cholecystectomy for patients with mild (grade I) and moderate (grade II) acute cholecystitis who do not respond to the initial conservative treatment. The WSES guidelines suggest performing surgery within 7 days of hospital admission and within 10 days of symptoms onset, while the TG18 recommends surgery within 24–72 h of symptom onset. Both guidelines advocate for early surgery, regardless of the precise duration since symptom onset, as it reduces wound infections, hospital stay, and operation time, while also improving quality of life. However, the timing of surgery from symptom onset or hospital admission may vary depending on resource availability and the final diagnosis.

During hospital stay while awaiting laparoscopic cholecystectomy, empirical antibiotic therapy is often initiated. This practice is generally justified in patients with moderate (Tokyo II) and severe (Tokyo III) acute cholecystitis, in which organ dysfunction results from inflammatory or infectious processes. However, there is no clear consensus regarding the use of antibiotics in patients with mild (Tokyo I) cholecystitis.

Antibiotics may be administered during three main phases in patients with acute cholecystitis: preoperatively, perioperatively (as prophylaxis, typically within 120 min before incision, in accordance with hospital policies), and postoperatively (see Fig. 1).

Timing of antibiotic administration in the natural course of acute cholecystitis after hospital admission

For perioperative and postoperative antibiotics, established recommendations and supporting evidence guide the use; however, the role of preoperative antibiotics remains uncertain (Table 1).

### The need for new "patient-related" guidelines for the treatment of acute cholecystitis [^115dTwAW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Acute cholecystitis could present with a picture ranging from mild, self limiting, to a potentially life threatening illness. However the severity of inflammation and its life threatening potential is also strongly determined by the general condition of the patient, and the surgical treatment is often dictated more by the general conditions of the patient than by the grade of inflammation/infection of the gallbladder.

Actually no randomized controlled trials have examined the optimal surgical treatment for acute cholecystitis according to its severity grade and the panel at the Tokyo consensus meeting included patients with organ/systemic dysfunctions in the "grade III" of the guidelines, with the suggestion that these patients should receive delayed cholecystectomy after urgent drainage. Early gallbladder drainage is suggested also in grade II patients, with local severe inflammation, however a later systematic review of 53 papers about cholecystostomy as an option in acute cholecystitis found no evidence to support the recommendation of percutaneous drainage rather than straight early emergency cholecystectomy even in critically ill patients, and stated that it is not possible to make decisive recommendations about it. From their data, actually, cholecystectomy seems to be a better option than early drainage, for treating acute cholecystitis in the elderly and/or critically ill population.

Borzellino et al. in a recent review of prospective and retrospective series did not show an increase in local postoperative complications in laparoscopically treated severe (gangrenous and empyematous) acute cholecystitis but did not address the issue of timing of intervention in this subset of patients. Once established the need for surgery, an accurate evaluation of the general condition of the patients should allow to exclude the surgical option in patients at high risk to not overcome the operation. For this subgroup of patients different options should be evaluated (e.g. percutaneous cholecystostomy). Patients whom general conditions allow to safely face surgery, acute cholecystitis should be operated by laparoscopy early after the beginning of symptoms. In our opinion further investigations and studies should be undertaken in order to identify a more practical patient-related operative guidelines to treat acute cholecystitis and the issue of a scoring system that can be related to the clinical and therapeutic decision making is largely unresolved.

### International Delphi consensus on the management of percutaneous choleystostomy in acute cholecystitis (E-AHPBA, ANS, WSES societies) [^114oMbBE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute cholecystitis (AC) accounts for 30% of emergency admissions to general surgery departments and is the second most frequent cause of complicated intra-abdominal infection. Currently, laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the gold standard in the treatment of AC. However, in patients with high surgical risk, comorbidities, or advanced age, LC is associated with high rates of morbidity (31%), and postoperative mortality (4%); much higher than those obtained in patients with low surgical risk.

In patients with a level of surgical risk that outweighs the possible benefits of surgery, non-surgical treatments have become widespread. These treatments, including the most frequently used alternative to surgery, percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC), play a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. PC consists of the percutaneous puncture of the gallbladder and the placement of a drainage catheter, usually performed in very ill patients as a bridge to a delayed surgical procedure. In some countries, an increase in the use of PC over the last decades has been observed due to two main factors: Population aging, which increases the number of patients with high surgical risk, and the publication of the Tokyo Guidelines (TG) and the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Guidelines. These guidelines devised to standardize the diagnosis, management, and treatment of AC, and recommended the use of PC in selected groups of patients. Recently, however, the utility of PC versus LC in patients with high surgical risk has been questioned, and it has been suggested that PC may be over-used.

The theoretical advantages offered by PC are the rapid resolution of sepsis and the optimal preparation of the patient for elective LC. Its main drawback is the possibility of recurrence of AC or other biliary events while awaiting LC. Many questions, indications, and management of PCs are unanswered.

The Delphi method is a well-established approach for answering a research question by identifying a consensus view among subject experts. It allows for reflection among participants, who can reconsider their opinions based on the anonymized views of their peers. First, available evidence should be reviewed to develop the Delphi consensus questionnaire. Finally, a Delphi process is delivered to formulate these guidance and recommendations. This study defines an international consensus on indications and PC management using Delphi methodology with contributions from experts from three surgical societies. This method lets us know the opinion of a group of experts, but only randomized control trials could assure us that Delphi's statements are adequate.

Discussion

The above reported literature review clarifies the advantages of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in an unselected population. It has to be stressed, however, that acute cholecystitis is a very heterogeneous disease as far as general and local factors are concerned. The severity of inflammation and its life-threatening potential is strongly determined by the general status of the patient, and the choice of surgical treatment cannot disregard this aspect. Also, the general principles expressed in the literature have to be applied taking into account the environment, the socio-economic context in which such an emergency develops and the related logistics.

The Tokyo guidelines attempted to address such heterogeneity with the above described classification, that takes into account both local and general factors, and a therapeutic protocol based on such scheme.

Such a tailored approach, however, has not been validated by studies showing an improved outcome after its introduction, and a retrospective series did not find any significant benefit. It ends up in a large use of delayed cholecystectomy, despite several meta-analysis of RCTs establish that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to be considered the gold standard. It also disregards the examined literature about the safety of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the severe forms of the disease. Furthermore, the role of percutaneous cholecystostomy is far from being established as discussed above: its therapeutic potential needs to be confirmed by the literature evidence and integrated in an evidence-based algorithm.

The risk of early surgery for acute cholecystitis should be evaluated against a well-established risk score in order to identifying the patients with reduced functional reserve who should undergo a treatment alternative to surgery. However, none of the available clinical scores for the evaluation of surgical risk for acute conditions has been validated for this disease. Further investigations could help in validating a clinical score useful for clinical and therapeutic decision making for acute cholecystitis.

In addition, it has to be stressed that the general principles expressed in the evidence based recommendations have to be adapted to the technical, environmental and social conditions of the different areas of the world. The indications suggested by the Tokyo Guidelines, too limited for most of the Western countries, still have been shown to increase the adoption of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy in a Japanese context, as reported by Asai.

Section 3. Surgical treatment of ACC

The literature updated from the 2016 WSES Guidelines on ACC showed no remarkable publications to change the meaning of previous statements edited by the WSES in 2016; however, they have been reviewed to ensure the best available evidence.

Which is the preferred first line of treatment for patients with ACC?

When should laparoscopic cholecystectomy be avoided in patients with ACC?

3.1 We recommend laparoscopic cholecystectomy as the first-line treatment for patients with ACC. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

Comment: A low complication rate and shortened hospital stay are the major advantages.

3.2 We recommend avoiding laparoscopic cholecystectomy in case of septic shock or absolute anaesthesiology contraindications. #QoE: high; SoR: strong#

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is generally considered the standard technique for the removal of gallstones. Local inflammation, especially in gangrenous and emphysematous ACC, has been considered to increase the risk of bile duct injuries, blood loss, operative time, general morbidity and mortality rates in comparison with open surgery. As technical difficulties usually decrease with experience and improvements in surgical technique and instrumentation, the hesitation to safely perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy in ACC has decreased over the years.

Despite several studies, ranging from case series to randomized prospective clinical trials, confirming the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the treatment of patients with ACC, a recent survey on intra-abdominal infection, the CIAOW study, showed unexpected results. It was a worldwide survey of 68 medical institutions during a 6-month study period demonstrating that 48.7% of patients with ACC still underwent open surgery.

### International Delphi consensus on the management of percutaneous choleystostomy in acute cholecystitis (E-AHPBA, ANS, WSES societies) [^113rAM2r]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

There has been a progressive increase in the use of percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC) in acute cholecystitis (AC) over the last decades due to population aging, and the support of guidelines (Tokyo Guidelines (TG), World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) Guidelines) as a valid therapeutical option. However, there are many unanswered questions about the management of PCs. An international consensus on indications and PC management using Delphi methodology with contributions from experts from three surgical societies (EAHPBA, ANS, WSES) have been performed.

Methods

A two-round Delphi consensus, which included 27 questions, was sent to key opinion leaders in AC. Participants were asked to indicate their 'agreement/disagreement' using a 5-point Likert scale. Survey items with less than 70% consensus were excluded from the second round. For inclusion in the final recommendations, each survey item had to have reached a group consensus (≥ 70% agreement) by the end of the two survey rounds.

Results

54 completed both rounds (82% of invitees). Six questions got > 70% and are included in consensus recommendations: In patients with acute cholecystitis, when there is a clear indication of PC, it is not necessary to wait 48 h to be carried out; Surgery is the first therapeutic option for the TG grade II acute cholecystitis in a patient suitable for surgery; Before PC removal a cholangiography should be done; There is no indication for PC in Tokyo Guidelines (TG) grade I patients; Transhepatic approach is the route of choice for PC; and after PC, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred approach (93.1%).

Conclusions

Only six statements about PC management after AC got an international consensus. An international guideline about the management of PCs are necessary.

### Acute cholecystitis during COVID-19 pandemic: a multisocietary position statement [^115AXhZN]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Following the spread of the infection from the new SARS-CoV2 coronavirus in March 2020, several surgical societies have released their recommendations to manage the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for the daily clinical practice. The recommendations on emergency surgery have fueled a debate among surgeons on an international level. We maintain that laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis, even in the COVID-19 era. Moreover, since laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not more likely to spread the COVID-19 infection than open cholecystectomy, it must be organized in such a way as to be carried out safely even in the present situation, to guarantee the patient with the best outcomes that minimally invasive surgery has shown to have.

### Cesena guidelines: WSES consensus statement on laparoscopic-first approach to general surgery emergencies and abdominal trauma [^112nVJsn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present review summarizes the current evidence on laparoscopy and associated minimally-invasive procedures in general surgical emergencies and abdominal trauma. This paper also presents a shared consensus regarding the recommendations and indications for laparoscopy application in patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery.

Over the last two decades, the role of laparoscopy in the emergency setting has increased considerably, as a result of improved surgical expertise and continued technological advances. Laparoscopy is well established as the standard of care for the surgical treatment of acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis in stable patients, and guidelines have long recommended its first-line role in the absence of septic shock or absolute anesthetic contraindications. Even in the presence of diffuse peritonitis or peritoneal contamination in perforated appendicitis, the benefits of the laparoscopic approach have been documented. Previous upper abdominal surgery is no longer a contraindication to safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Difficult gallbladders can be managed effectively through various laparoscopic bailout-techniques, to decrease conversion rates and associated morbidity, as reported in various recent systematic reviews. A useful adjunct would be the use of ICG, which has been increasingly integrated into laparoscopic equipment.

In 2018, another Japanese nationwide retrospective cohort study reported similar results.

With the limitations of the quality of the studies, laparoscopy should be suggested for the treatment of symptomatic gallstones including ACC. The vast majority of studies suggests the second trimester until the initial part of the third trimester as the best time to perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy, as there is a higher risk of miscarriage and toxic effect of anaesthesia in the first trimester, while concerns are related to the size of the uterus in the third trimester.

A systematic review and set of guidelines from the British Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy, endorsed by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, have been published in 2019 and they summarize the discussion, confirming the benefits of ELC over non-operative treatment, especially in the second trimester.

Which surgical strategies should be adopted in case of difficult anatomic identification of structures during cholecystectomy for ACC?

3.4 We recommend laparoscopic or open subtotal cholecystectomy in situations in which anatomic identification is difficult and in which the risk of iatrogenic injuries is high. #QoE: moderate; SoR: strong#

Reasons for a 'difficult gallbladder' vary, and can be related to obesity, adhesions, acute or chronic inflammation, distended gallbladder and liver cirrhosis. Due to the diversity of reasons and the variability of approaches among surgeons, a review conducted in 2011 showed no consensus on the ideal way to deal with a difficult gallbladder. The options include subtotal cholecystectomy, fundus first cholecystectomy, perioperative cholangiogram, open conversion or a combination of these options.

In this section, we focus on subtotal cholecystectomy, which is an option when the critical view of safety cannot be obtained. In 2015, a systematic review and meta-analysis by Elshaer et al. reported that subtotal cholecystectomy was performed using laparoscopic (72.9%) open (19.0%) and laparoscopic converted to open (8.0%) techniques. In this study including over 1200 patients, the most common indications were severe cholecystitis (72.1%), followed by gallstones in liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension (18.2%) and empyema or a perforated gallbladder (6.1%). They concluded that subtotal cholecystectomy might be helpful during the surgical management of difficult cholecystectomy; also considering that it achieves morbidity rates comparable to those reported for total cholecystectomy in straightforward cases. The quality of evidence is limited, due to the absence of prospective randomized studies, which are not expected to be easily performed in the future.

### Open cholecystectomy in the laparoscopic era [^113xEUkd]. The British Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

As techniques in laparoscopic cholecystectomy have improved, surgeon experience of open cholecystectomy may be limited. This study examined the current indications for and techniques used in primary open cholecystectomy.

Methods

Some 3100 consecutive patients undergoing elective or emergency cholecystectomy over a 5-year interval were identified from a prospective surgical audit database. Demographic, diagnostic and procedural data were examined.

Results

There were 123 (4.0 per cent) primary and 219 (7.4 per cent) converted open cholecystectomies. Some 48.0 and 45.6 per cent of patients in the primary open cholecystectomy and converted groups respectively were men, compared with 24.0 per cent of 2758 who had a successful laparoscopic procedure. Primary open cholecystectomy was employed principally for previous upper abdominal open surgery (22.7 per cent) and emergency operation for general peritonitis (19.5 per cent). The fundus-first approach was employed in 53.7 per cent of primary open procedures and 53.0 per cent of conversions, with subtotal excision in 4.9 and 13.2 per cent respectively.

Conclusion

Primary open cholecystectomy remains a common procedure in the treatment of gallbladder disease despite the success of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Successful outcome in difficult cases requires familiarity with specific techniques, exposure to which may be limited in current training programmes.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^115MUCQT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions, knowledge gaps and research recommendations

The WSES 2020 on ACC, based on the updated evidence, reinforces the pivotal role of ELC in the management of ACC, even in high-risk patients. The new developed algorithm, in our opinion, emphasizes the importance of two categories of patients: the high-risk patients and those who are not suitable for surgery.

The CHOCOLATE Study defined high-risk patients as those with an APACHE score 7–14; this high-quality study improved our understanding of the management of this complex cohort of patients. Its results are in favour of surgery, when compared with biliary drainage in high-risk patients with ACC. However, there is not a single and universally accepted definition of this high-risk patients group; therefore, accepting the suggestion coming from Loozen et al. it appears reasonable to recommend the development of local clinical pathways after deciding which of the available scores fits local needs and expertise.

In addition to the defined high-risk patients, the WSES proposes the category of patients who are not suitable for surgery. We suggest to include in this group all patients with ACC who are not fit for surgery, according to the specific surgeon's judgement, and patients who are not amenable for surgical treatment, due to the presence of clinical conditions which are not classifiable with clinical or physiologic scores (Appendix 2). For this cohort of patients, surgery may be unsafe or impossible and gallbladder drainage may be the best suitable option in case of uncontrolled sepsis and/or failure of NOM.

Moreover, areas for important future research were identified. These include (1) high-quality studies on prognostic factors of ACC patients so as to improve shared decision making, (2) defining the best management option when ELC is not possible due to lack of surgical expertise or due to the duration of symptoms. This should include focus groups involving patients and clinicians, and using observational studies, and (3) defining the best option in the management of difficult operative scenarios. This needs a common language among researchers in order to obtain higher quality studies (in terms of classification of difficulties: e.g. adhesions with hollow viscus, difficulties in grasping the gallbladder, difficulties in view of safety, gangrene of the cystic duct, etc.).

Finally, the WSES strongly advocates the adoption of a policy for safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy and encourages the development of local pathways, based on the available evidence.

### Comparative operative outcomes of early and delayed cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis: a population-based propensity score analysis [^114fo6CM]. Annals of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the operative outcomes of early and delayed cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis.

Background

Randomized trials comparing early to delayed cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis have limited contemporary external validity. Furthermore, no study to date has been large enough to assess the impact of timing of cholecystectomy on the frequency of serious rare complications including bile duct injury and death.

Methods

This is a population-based retrospective cohort study of patients emergently admitted to hospital with acute cholecystitis and managed with cholecystectomy over the period of April 1, 2004, to March 31, 2011. We used administrative records for the province of Ontario, Canada. Patients were divided into 2 exposure groups: those who underwent cholecystectomy within 7 days of emergency department presentation on index admission (early cholecystectomy) and those whose cholecystectomy was delayed. The primary outcome was major bile duct injury requiring operative repair within 6 months of cholecystectomy. Secondary outcomes included major bile duct injury or death, 30-day postcholecystectomy mortality, completion of cholecystectomy with an open approach, conversion among laparoscopic cases, and total hospital length of stay. Propensity score methods were used to address confounding by indication.

Results

From 22,202 patients, a well-balanced matched cohort of 14,220 patients was defined. Early cholecystectomy was associated with a lower risk of major bile duct injury [0.28% vs 0.53%, relative risk (RR) = 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31–0.90], of major bile duct injury or death (1.36% vs 1.88%, RR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56–0.94), and, albeit non-significant, of 30-day mortality (0.46% vs 0.64%, RR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.47–1.15). Total hospital length of stay was shorter with early cholecystectomy (mean difference 1.9 days, 95% CI: 1.7–2.1). No significant differences were observed in terms, open cholecystectomy (15% vs 14%, RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.99–1.16) or in conversion among laparoscopic cases (11% vs 10%, RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.93–1.13).

Conclusions

These results support the benefit of early overdelayed cholecystectomy for patients with acute cholecystitis.

### Timing of cholecystectomy in acute cholecystitis [^1161QhNQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder that most commonly occurs as a result of obstruction of the cystic duct by gallstones. The current standard of treatment for acute cholecystitis is cholecystectomy.

Objective

Our goal was to discuss the benefits of and compare early laparoscopic cholecystectomy and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the treatment of acute cholecystitis.

Materials and Methods

A Medline literature search was performed dating from January 1982 to July 2015. We limited the search to human studies written in English and using the keywords "Acute Cholecystitis", early vs. delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy, surgical management, and surgical complications.

Results

There were 225 articles reviewed, of which 25 met criteria for selection. Our recommendations are based on these 25 articles.

Conclusion

Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferred over delayed, due to overall better quality of life, lower morbidity rates, and lower hospital cost. Ultimately, management of acute cholecystitis by emergency physicians should be made based on patient's clinical status and available resources in their particular hospital.

Patients over 80 years old

The true clinical relevance of age is difficult to assess and the impact of old age on the clinical outcomes in cases of surgical abdominal pathology is largely unknown.

In 2017, the WSES and the Italian Society for Geriatric Surgery developed a CC and a consequent set of guidelines on this topic. Only retrospective studies have focused their interest on elderly patients with ACC. In general, no RCTs are available, population sizes of the studies were small and distributed over a long period of time. It should be noted that the prevalence of elderly people with ACC could increase in the future, due to the improvement in life expectancy and the consideration that the risk of biliary stones increases with age. Some of the recommendations were derived from evidence describing the general population, which includes the elderly. The level of evidence for surgery, timing and risk assessment ranged from 2 to 3, and the grade of recommendation ranged from B to C according the 2011 Oxford classification "(https://www.cebm.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CEBM-Levels-of-Evidence-2.1.pdf.)". With these limitations, the conclusion supported laparoscopic cholecystectomy for ACC in elderly patients, after considering the intrinsic surgical risk, life expectancy and the rate of relapse in cases of conservative management; and frailty scores, in the absence of a single universally accepted score, were evaluated as adjunctive tools to better characterize elderly patients in the clinical situation.

### Acute cholecystitis [^11656bvQ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Of people admitted to hospital for biliary tract disease, 20% have acute cholecystitis. Up to the age of 50 years, acute calculous cholecystitis is three times more common in women than in men, and about 1.5 times more common in women than in men thereafter. About 95% of people with acute cholecystitis have gallstones. Optimal therapy for acute cholecystitis, based on timing and severity of presentation, remains controversial.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for acute cholecystitis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 12 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: early cholecystectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy, observation alone, and open cholecystectomy.

### Early surgery for acute cholecystitis in the elderly: getting it right the first time [^112PoPG5]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute cholecystitis is one of the most common surgical emergency presentations globally. In the United States alone, over 300.000 patients per year present to the emergency department with acute cholecystitis. The condition is more likely to occur with increasing age. In the past, a 'three-day window' was referred to as the safety zone in which one could perform an emergency cholecystectomy. Recent guidelines suggest that this time window can be extended up to 7 days and even within 10 days from the onset of symptoms. Of note, the most recent World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guideline states that: " Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) should be the standard of care whenever possible, even in subgroups of patients who are considered fragile, such as the elderly; those with cardiac disease, renal disease, and cirrhosis; or those who are generally at high risk for surgery ".

However, compliance in clinical practice may not follow the guideline suggestions. Variation management of acute cholecystitis is considerable. In one study from the United Kingdom (UK), the predicted probability of getting an emergency cholecystectomy during admission ranged from almost everyone (98%) to almost none (2%). In another study in the UK National Health Service (NHS), 50% did not undergo cholecystectomy during the same admission. This documented variation in management likely reflects a variation in the provision of care, but also in variation in access to emergency theaters and in variation in dedicated teams (not only surgeons) for emergency general surgery in hospitals. Hence, it is most likely that we underserve, undertreat, and underdeliver sufficient care for a large proportion of patients admitted with acute cholecystitis. We can only reflect on the provision of care in our own country in Norway, where even the universal health care system does not provide timely and efficient care for all patients in large, populated areas due to lack of access to emergency theaters and due to competing emergencies. Another argument often used is that elderly and frail patients do not tolerate surgery as well, and hence, surgery is deferred or not done altogether. Indeed, frailty is associated with higher morbidity and mortality after laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis. However, the elderly may also benefit from timely surgical care.

### Optimum timing of emergency cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis in england: population-based cohort study [^111VQvDj]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute cholecystitis is a common complication of gallbladder stones. Cholecystectomy represents the only definitive management strategy for symptomatic gallstone disease. Undertaking cholecystectomy during index admission for acute cholecystitis is associated with reduced long-term biliary complications, shorter total admission length of stay and lower overall treatment costs.

Guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) recommend that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed as soon as safely possible but can be performed up to 10 days from symptom onset. In the United Kingdom the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend that patients with acute cholecystitis should receive cholecystectomy within 7 days of diagnosis. The utilization of emergency cholecystectomy has not been universally adopted in the United Kingdom with only 15.7% of patients with acute cholecystitis undergoing cholecystectomy on index admission (compared to 52.7% in the United States), and there is a wide variation in the utilization of emergency cholecystectomy across hospitals in the United Kingdom.

Most current studies, although limited by sample size, advocate an early approach to emergency cholecystectomy with previous evidence suggesting that undertaking surgery within 72 h of symptom onset or hospital admission reduces operative time, decreases length of hospital stay, is associated with fewer adverse post-operative outcomes and reduced mortality compared to patients undergoing surgery later in their clinical course. However, other studies have demonstrated that emergency cholecystectomy can be undertaken up to 7 days from symptom onset with equivalent outcomes.

This national population-based cohort study aimed to evaluate how timing of emergency cholecystectomy affects outcomes for patients in England. The effect of hospital volume of emergency cholecystectomy upon timing of surgery and outcomes has also been examined. The primary end point was post-operative biliary complications while secondary end points were conversion to open and length of hospital stay.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^111Xs3Vq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

An update of the literature searches was performed for the purpose of this guideline. Sixteen trials were identified in the update (including the trials originally included in the systematic review). The number of participants with acute cholecystitis was not reported in one of the trials. In the remaining 15 trials, 1240 participants were included in 14 trials comparing ELC versus DLC and 618 participants were included in one trial comparing ELC versus intermediate laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ILC). The country; recruitment period; number of participants; the duration of symptoms; the timing of ELC, DLC and ILC; and the surgical experience are reported in Table 3. Overall, it appears that ELC was performed within 10 days of onset of symptoms in most trials.

Main reasons for unclear or high risk of bias

High risk of bias: at least one of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, missing outcome bias or selective outcome reporting bias was classified as high risk of bias

Unclear risk of bias: at least one of random sequence generation, allocation concealment, missing outcome bias or selective outcome reporting bias was classified as unclear risk of bias without any of the domains being classified as high risk of bias

a All studies were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. The risk of bias classification stated here is for the remaining domains

b This was the only study in which intermediate laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed; delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in the remaining studies

There were no significant differences in mortality or conversion to open cholecystectomy between the three groups. The proportion of patients with serious adverse events was significantly higher in ILC compared to ELC in the only trial included in the comparison between ILC and DLC. The number of serious adverse events was significantly less with ELC compared to DLC in the only trial comparing ELC with DLC that reported this information. The total length of hospital stay (including all the admissions for treatment) was about 4 days shorter with ELC compared to DLC, and about 5 days shorter with ELC compared to ILC. The return to work was about 9 days sooner following ELC compared to DLC.

RESULTS

Cohort Characteristics

This study collected data on 21,706 patients who underwent cholecystectomy for benign gallbladder disease between January 1, 2022, and June 30, 2022, from 57 countries (Supplementary Material, Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Tables 1 and 2 and Supplementary Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content 1, summarize the characteristics of the patients who underwent cholecystectomy. The patients were categorized into 3 groups based on the setting of their surgery: elective (n = 10,821, 49.9%), emergency (n = 4263, 30.5%), and delayed (n = 6622, 19.6%). Patients admitted electively were younger, with a median age of 47 years compared with emergency and delayed admissions, with median ages of 52 and 50 years, respectively. Females represented the majority of cases in all categories. Males were more commonly admitted for emergency surgery, accounting for 41.1% (n = 1753) of all emergency admissions. The majority of patients across all categories had American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 1 and ASA II physical statuses. The emergency category had the highest proportion of patients with ASA III and above (15.6% of all emergency admissions) and a greater prevalence of comorbidities, including a body mass index > 30, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and stroke.

TABLE 1
Baseline Cohort Characteristics of Patients Undergoing Cholecystectomy for Benign Gallbladder Disease

TABLE 2
Prior Admissions, Indications for Cholecystectomy, and Interventions Before Cholecystectomy

The main indications for surgery differed among the groups (Table 2). Biliary colic was the most common indication in the elective group (64.5%), whereas cholecystitis was the most common in the emergency (64.3%) and delayed (37.0%) groups. Eight cases of Mirizzi syndrome were recorded: type I: 1, type II: 2, type III: 2, type V = 1, unclassified. Of the 1195 cholecystectomy patients admitted for pancreatitis, 436 (36.5%) underwent emergency surgery, 664 (55.6%) underwent delayed procedures, and 95 (7.9%) underwent elective surgery. Cholecystectomy during the index admission was performed in 2739 of 7989 (34.2%) patients with acute cholecystitis. Preoperative interventions included endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and percutaneous cholecystostomy, which were performed in 9.1% and 1.4% of patients, respectively.

Finally, in patients with predicted or actual severe gallstone pancreatitis, or when there is cholangitis, jaundice, or a dilated common bile duct, surgery is contraindicated. In this situation an urgent ERCP with endoscopic sphincterotomy should be performed, followed by interval laparoscopic cholecystectomy when the patient is fitter.

In general, in the absence of contraindications, surgery is suggested as first-line therapy in order to avoid complications and potential drug toxicity for the foetus. Retrospective studies stated that recurrent ACC or pancreatitis can occur in 10% of patients, while miscarriage can occur in 10–20% of patients. NOM is an alternative option, but it must be highlighted that there is a risk of higher incidence of spontaneous abortion, threatened abortion, and premature birth when compared to patients who underwent cholecystectomy.

One systematic review and meta-analysis focused on the comparison of open cholecystectomy with laparoscopic cholecystectomy during pregnancy. The authors selected 11 studies, all of which were retrospective: two from national databases, one from a state database and the others were retrospective from single- or multiple- institutions. The analysis included 10,632 patients (1219 open; 9413 laparoscopic). The outcomes were as follows:
Outcomes for the mother: death occurred in 1 open versus 0 laparoscopic cases; complications (including caesarean section, dilatation and curettage, hysterectomy, maternal dehydration and pre-eclampsia) were 3.5% in laparoscopic cases vs. 8.2% in open cases, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.42 (95% CI 0.33–0.53, p < 0.001).
Outcomes for the foetus: 1 death out of 161 patients (0.6%) in laparoscopic cases versus 4 deaths from 93 patients (4.3%) in open cases, with an OR of 0.39 (95% CI 0.07–2.19, p = 0.29); the complications (including foetal loss, foetal distress, threatened preterm delivery and preterm birth) were 346 out of 8807 laparoscopic cases (3.9%) vs. 139 out of 1161 open cases (12.0%), with an OR of 0.42 (95%; 0.28–0.63, p < 0.001).
Surgical complications (including bile duct injury, bile duct leaking, solid organ or hollow viscus injury, pulmonary and wound infections, and hernias): 901 out of 9413 laparoscopic cases (9.6%) versus 211 out of 1219 open cases (17.3%), with an OR of 0.45 (95% CI 0.25–0.82, p = 0.01).
Preterm delivery (< 37-week gestation): 11 out of 127 laparoscopic cases (8.7%) versus 5 out of 78 open cases (6.4%), with an OR of 1.35 (95% CI 0.41–5.14; p = 0.59).
The Apgar score at 5 minutes was the same.

### 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery updated guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute calculus cholecystitis [^117Xzhks]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

In 2018, the Scientific Board of the 6thWorld Congress of the WSES endorsed its president to organize a CC on ACC in order to update the previous WSES Guidelines. The WSES president appointed four members as a scientific secretariat, four members as an organization committee and four members as a scientific committee, choosing them from the expert affiliates of the WSES. Relevant key questions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of ACC were developed and divided into seven sections, in order to analyse the topic and update the guidelines with the currently available evidence. Under the supervision of the scientific secretariat, a bibliographic search related to these questions was performed, using electronic search of PubMed and EMBASE databases in May 2019, with no date or language restrictions. An additional manual search of the literature was performed by members of the working groups involved in the analysis of the papers and the development of the guidelines. The topics and sections, the key questions and the related key words used to develop the update on ACC are available in Table 1.

Table 1
Sections/topics, key questions and key words

Before the CC, the statements and recommendations were reviewed by the representatives responsible for each of the sections, creating a draft version of the guidelines. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were reviewed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria (see). Specifically, the quality of evidence was graded as 'High', 'Moderate', 'Low' or 'Very low' and the strength of a recommendation was indicated as either 'Strong' or 'Weak'. Consensus had previously been defined as 70% or more of the votes being in agreement. During the 6th World Congress of the WSES held in Nijmegen, the Netherlands in May 2019, each question was discussed and voted upon by the audience (votes were either 'agree' or 'disagree'). The percentage of agreement was recorded immediately; in case of disagreement, the statement was modified following discussion. After the CC, the president and representatives reviewed the guidelines in response to the comments and the revised version of the statements was voted upon via an online questionnaire until consensus was reached. Throughout the period of the elaboration of the current guidelines, repeated literature searches were carried out in order to maximize the inclusion of relevant evidence (last literature search: May 2020).

### Routine pathology and postoperative follow-up are not cost-effective in cholecystectomy for benign gallbladder disease [^115e9MdF]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

All consecutive patients who underwent elective or emergency cholecystectomy between January 2011 and June 2017 in a single major teaching hospital in the Netherlands were included. Cholecystectomies combined with other procedures were excluded since the cholecystectomy was not the primary indication for surgery with the exception of cholecystectomies combined with umbilical hernia repair. All consecutive cholecystectomy procedures were identified from the operating room digital planning system. All clinical data were obtained from the electronic medical records. Potential visits to general practitioners or other hospitals were not available for data analyses.

The indications for cholecystectomy were uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease and complicated gallstone disease, as acute cholecystitis, (acute) biliary pancreatitis, previous endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and gallbladder polyps of at least 1 cm, multiple or growing polyps. Uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease was defined in most cases by a typical patient history supported by ultrasound confirmation of the presence of gallstones. Patients with acute cholecystitis were considered for cholecystectomy according to national guidelines within 1 week of the onset of symptoms or for delayed surgery after 6 weeks. If required, percutaneous gallbladder drainage was performed as a bridge to surgery, or in patients considered unfit for surgery at that time. In patients with acute biliary pancreatitis, cholecystectomy was usually performed after 6 weeks, and in selected patients with mild pancreatitis directly after discharge from the hospital.

Patients with an uncomplicated procedure and postoperative course were usually discharged at postoperative day one. Selected patients were discharged the same day. Patients with a perforated or gangrenous cholecystitis were treated postoperatively with one or more days of intravenous antibiotics. A single follow-up visit at the outpatient clinical was scheduled to evaluate the clinical course and discuss the pathology results. The visit was planned 2–3 weeks after surgery, which was altered to around 6 weeks postoperatively since 2014.

### Is there a difference in textbook outcomes of emergency cholecystectomy in older patients compared with younger patients? [^117SijEP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

In the study conducted by Fugazzola et al. and the SPRIMACC Collaborative, TO criteria was similar with the study by Iseda et al. albeit with slight differences. Differently, LOS criterion was seven days this time and similarly, readmissions until 30 days were again accepted as TO failure. Full laparoscopic surgery was preferred as a criterion name instead of no conversion to open expression. In both of these latter studies, subtotal cholecystectomy (SC) was not a TO failure and this seemed to us to be the correct approach. However, subtotal cholecystectomy caused TO failure in the study by Lucocq et al. This may be interpreted differently because only elective patients were included in the study, but SC should nevertheless not be a failure for TO. Those who require re-intervention due to biliary leakage or other circumstances will already cause TO failure resulting from the postoperative complication criterion (Clavien-Dindo score > 2). Therefore, subtotal cholecystectomy patients with an uneventful postoperative course should be accepted for TO.

Table 5
Textbook outcome criteria for cholecystectomy in current trials

A VAS pain score at six months was defined as a criterion for TO in a recent noteworthy Dutch study which also evaluated patient surveys, although such factors are not directly related to the surgical procedure. The study itself already looks for TO in uncomplicated gallstone disease not in the LC procedures, but the distinction here should be noted. This is because, as mentioned in the same study, accurate patient selection has already been a problem for cholecystectomy, therefore factors directly related to surgery should be evaluated with priority. There remains an absence of an internationally recognised definition of TO in emergency cholecystectomies. Each criteria should be evaluated and discussed in the surgical literature to reach a universal standard.

Another positive aspect of researching TO data is that it allows patients to be provided with more accurate and in-depth information when obtaining informed consent. The readmission rate within 30 days or 90 days, which has previously been utilized as a component of TO criteria, can serve as an indicator of the patient's postoperative experience, indicating the absence of significant complications during this period. However, the establishment of a longer-term version of the textbook outcome can be planned, as was done in a Delphi consensus on trauma cohorts, in another study. Additional criteria such as the absence of need for endoscopic or percutaneous interventions or, as a part of patient-centered outcome approach, the absence of persistent right upper quadrant pain, etc. in one year or later after emergency cholecystectomy, can be defined in that context.

### Incremental net benefit of cholecystectomy compared with alternative treatments in people with gallstones or cholecystitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cost-utility studies [^116ZBA5k]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Gallstones constitute one of the most common and expensive gastrointestinal disorders and cause significant epidemiological and economic burdens worldwide. Approximately 20% of people with gallstones experience symptoms requiring medical attention or surgery, while the remaining 80% remain asymptomatic for many years. Treatment options for cholecystitis include surgical (cholecystectomy-open and laparoscopic) or conservative management. The treatment of gallstone disease is expensive and often engenders substantial economic and social burdens if symptoms or complications occur. The healthcare system in the United States alone reported treatment costs as US$6.5 billion per year.

The optimal timing and the treatment choice for cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis have always been contentious. In earlier days, several weeks of hospital stay and an initial intense medical management were the norm before an open cholecystectomy (OC). Introducing early cholecystectomy (open or laparoscopic) reduced the overall treatment duration considerably. Performing early surgery for cholecystitis has the advantage of reducing hospital stay and circumvents the risk of emergency surgery in the wake of a non-resolved or recurrent issue.

### Cesena guidelines: WSES consensus statement on laparoscopic-first approach to general surgery emergencies and abdominal trauma [^1152d9gs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The laparoscopic approach to ACC in emergency settings, improves not only the patients' outcomes, but also improves the utilization of health care resources. Early LC was associated with a significant reduction in wound infection rate, hospitalization length, duration of surgery and quality of life, compared to delayed LC as demonstrated by Song et al. in a meta-review of seven discordant meta-analyses and systematic reviews published from 2004 to 2015. No differences were found in mortality, bile duct injury, bile leakage, overall complications and conversion to open surgery. Early LC demonstrated its superiority also in terms of cost-effectiveness, as demonstrated in a meta-analysis on six studies containing cost analyses that compared early versus delayed LC for ACC.

The Tokyo Guidelines 18 (TG18) widened the indications for LC when compared with Tokyo Guidelines 13 (TG13), as they supported same-admission LC for patients with all three severity grades of ACC. A recent meta‑analysis and systematic review confirmed the superiority of emergency cholecystectomy over percutaneous cholecystostomy for the treatment of ACC also in high‑risk surgical patients, in terms of mortality/morbidity, readmission rate, and LOS.

The risk of a laparoscopic approach failure and the need for conversion increases in the case of a difficult gallbladder. The incidence of difficult cholecystitis reported in the literature is 10–15% of the total cases of ACC. Major factors that contribute towards a difficult cholecystectomy include the severity of the disease, the presence of adhesions, the surgeon's laparoscopic experience including caseload of operations for ACC, and the devices availability for surgical treatment. Conversion rates were increased in the presence of previous upper midline abdominal surgery, as shown in a recent prospective study and in advanced ACC with high CRP, gangrene or an abscess.

A review conducted in 2011 showed no consensus on the ideal way to deal with a difficult gallbladder. The options include subtotal cholecystectomy, fundus first cholecystectomy, intra-operative cholangiogram, open conversion or a combination of these options. Due to the diversity of reasons and the variability of approaches among surgeons, no consensus has been reached regarding the choice of the most appropriate "bailout technique". The 2020 WSES guidelines recommended conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy in case of severe local inflammation, adhesions, bleeding within Calot's triangle or suspected bile duct injury. However, both bile duct injury and conversions significantly increase morbidity and mortality, adversely affecting the quality of life while being associated with substantial costs.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated biliary colic [^115ZN5BN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated biliary colic is one of the commonest indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves several months of waiting if performed electively. However, people can develop life-threatening complications during this waiting period.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for people with uncomplicated biliary colic due to gallstones.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until March 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials, irrespective of language and publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data. We sought to include data on short-term mortality (30-day mortality or in-hospital mortality), bile duct injury, other serious adverse events, quality of life, conversion to open cholecystectomy, length of hospital stay, operating time, and return to work. We planned to calculate the risk ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes using RevMan and based on intention-to-treat analysis when data were available. Since only one trial contributed data to this review, Fisher's exact test was used for binary outcomes. A P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Main Results

Only one trial including 75 participants (average age: 43 years; females: 65% of participants), randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis) (n = 35) or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean waiting period of 4.2 months) (n = 40), contributed information to this review. The trial had a high risk of bias. Information on the outcome mortality was available for the 75 participants. Information on serious adverse events was available for 68 participants (28 people in the early group and 40 people in the delayed group). The other outcomes were available for 28 participants in the early laparoscopic cholecystectomy group and 35 participants in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. There were no deaths in the early group (0/35) (0%) versus 1/40 (2.5%) in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group (P > 0.9999). There was no bile duct injury in either group. There were no serious adverse events related to the surgery in either group. During the waiting period, complications developed in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group. The complications that the participants suffered included pancreatitis (n = 1), empyema of the gallbladder (n = 1), gallbladder perforation (n = 1), acute cholecystitis (n = 2), cholangitis (n = 2), obstructive jaundice (n = 2), and recurrent biliary colic (requiring hospital visits) (n = 5). In total, 14 participants required hospital admissions for the above symptoms. All of these admissions occurred in the delayed group as all the participants were operated on within 24 hours in the early group. The proportion of people who developed serious adverse events was 0/28 (0%) in the early group, which was significantly lower than in the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy group 9/40 (22.5%) (P = 0.0082). This trial did not report quality of life or return to work. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who required conversion to open cholecystectomy in the early group 0/28 (0%) compared with the delayed group (6/35 or 17.1%) (P = 0.0743). There was a statistically significant shorter hospital stay in the early group than in the delayed group (MD -1.25 days, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.45). There was a statistically significant shorter operating time in the early group than the delayed group (MD -14.80 minutes, 95% CI -18.02 to -11.58).

Authors' Conclusions

Based on evidence from only one high-bias risk trial, it appears that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours after diagnosis of biliary colic) decreases the morbidity during the waiting period for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean waiting time 4.2 months), the hospital stay, and operating time. Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to confirm or refute these findings, and to determine if early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is better than the delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy if the waiting time is shortened further.

### Optimum timing of emergency cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis in england: population-based cohort study [^115Kyo8g]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This national population-based cohort study including data from 43,870 patients has demonstrated that early intervention by undertaking emergency cholecystectomy within 3 days of admission is associated with fewer post-operative biliary complications, reduced need for intra-operative conversion and shorter post-operative length of stay. Patient's undergoing emergency cholecystectomy more than 8 days following presentation were associated with the highest rates of post-operative ERCP and bile duct injury, as well as increased post-operative length of stay. These findings are in keeping with previous studies, which have identified that early intervention for emergency cholecystectomy is generally associated with improved patient outcomes. A French national healthcare database study identified that patient's undergoing cholecystectomy on days 1–3 of admission had improved post-operative outcomes (reduced intensive care admissions, re-operation or post-operative sepsis) when compared to those undergoing surgery from day 5 onwards. Additional studies have advocated that patients with cholecystitis should undergo surgery as soon as safely feasible, and that immediate surgery on the day of admission is associated with improved outcomes. Undertaking cholecystectomy within the first 24–48 h of hospital admission is also associated with reduced hospital costs.

### Early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic [^117SwVS9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Biliary colic is one of the commonest indications for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves several months of waiting if performed electively. However, patients can develop life-threatening complications during this waiting period.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for patients with biliary colic due to gallstones.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded until March 2008.

Selection Criteria

We included only randomised clinical trials irrespective of language and publication status.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted the data. We intended to calculate the risk ratio, risk difference with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes using RevMan 4.2 based on intention-to-treat analysis.

Main Results

Only one trial including 75 patients, randomised to early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (less than 24 hours of diagnosis) (n = 35) and delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (mean waiting period of 4.2 months) (n = 40), qualified for this review. This trial was of high risk of bias. During the waiting period in the delayed group (mean 4.2 months), the complications that the patients suffered included severe acute pancreatitis resulting in mortality (1), empyema of gallbladder (1), gallbladder perforation (1), acute cholecystitis (2), cholangitis (2), obstructive jaundice (2), and recurrent biliary colic requiring hospital visits (5). The rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy was lower in the early group (0%) than the delayed group (8/40 or 20%) (p = 0.0172). There was a statistically significant shorter operating time and hospital stay in the early group than the delayed group (WMD -14.80 minutes, 95% CI -18.02 to -11.58 and -1.25 days, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.45 respectively). Fourteen patients (35%) required 18 hospital admissions for symptoms related to gallstones during the mean waiting period of 4.2 months in the delayed group. This is equivalent to 11 admissions per 100 persons per month.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on evidence from only one high-bias risk trial, it appears that early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (< 24 hours of diagnosis of biliary colic) decreases the morbidity during the waiting period for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, decreases the rate of conversion to open cholecystectomy, decreases operating time, and decreases hospital stay. Further randomised clinical trials are necessary to confirm or refute this finding.

Section 6. Alternative treatment for patients with ACC who are not suitable for surgery: observation and techniques for gallbladder drainage

When should Non-Operative Management be considered for patients with ACC?

6.1 We suggest considering NOM, i.e. best medical therapy with antibiotics and observation, for patients refusing surgery or those who are not suitable for surgery. #QoE: low; SoR: weak#

6.2 We suggest considering alternative treatment options for patients who fail NOM and who still refuse surgery or patients who are not suitable for surgery. #QoE: low; SoR: weak#

Schimdt et al. published an RCT comparing observation and surgery in cases of ACC, with a long median follow-up time of 14 years. In their analysis, about 30% of patients with mildly symptomatic acute cholecystitis who did not undergo cholecystectomy developed recurrent gallstone-related complications, as compared with 3% of patients who underwent cholecystectomy, but these differences were not significant for recurrent disease or complications. Overall, 60% of patients had undergone surgery, while 40% avoided surgery. There are significant limitations in the study, as recognized by the authors: firstly, a relevant percentage of eligible patients (41%) were excluded from randomization; secondly, the reasons for the exclusion were not stated in the paper; thirdly, the definitions of dropout and failure within the observation group were not clear. Brazzelli et al. published a systematic review of two RCTs comparing observation with surgery in patients with symptomatic gallstone disease (in the first study) and patients with ACC (in the second study). From a total of 201 patients, the results confirmed the high rate of gallstone-related complications within the observation group (RR 6.63, 95% CI 1.57–28.51, p = 0.01). The authors, although noting the substantial lack of good quality evidence, reported that a policy of surgery for all patients with ACC, when compared to a policy of observation followed by surgery for symptomatic patients, represents a costly but more effective choice. In conclusion, relevant uncertainty exists regarding the best management between surgery or observation in cases of ACC, especially in uncomplicated disease; observation and best medical therapy are likely to be safe, but this latter approach is characterised by a high incidence of recurrent disease.

Regarding specific circumstances for gallstone disease, more specifically with respect to elderly patients, EASL 2016 guidelines recommend to perform cholecystectomy in the elderly and in patients with high anesthetic risk with gallstone complications (such as acute cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, or obstructive jaundice) as soon as the general status allows surgery.

### 2017 WSES and SICG guidelines on acute calcolous cholecystitis in elderly population [^113Zkcka]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Gallstone disease is very common afflicting 20 million people in the United States. In Europe, the overall incidence of gallstone disease is 18.8% in women and 9.5% in men. The frequency of gallstones related disease increases by age. The elderly population is increasing worldwide.

Aim

The present guidelines aims to report the results of the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and Italian Surgical Society for Elderly (SICG) consensus conference on acute calcolous cholecystitis (ACC) focused on elderly population.

Material and Methods

The 2016 WSES guidelines on ACC were used as baseline; six questions have been used to investigate the particularities in elderly population; the answers have been developed in terms of differences compared to the general population and to statements of the 2016 WSES Guidelines. The Consensus Conference discusses, voted, and modified the statements. International experts contributed in the elaboration of final statements and evaluation of the level of scientific evidences.

Results

The quality of the studies available decreases when we approach ACC in elderly. Same admission laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be suggested for elderly people with ACC; frailty scores as well as clinical and surgical risk scores could be adopted but no general consensus exist. The role of cholecystostomy is uncertain.

Discussion and Conclusions

The evaluation of pro and cons for surgery or for alternative treatments in elderly suffering of ACC is more complex than in young people; also, the oldest old age is not a contraindication for surgery; however, a larger use of frailty and surgical risk scores could contribute to reach the best clinical judgment by the surgeon. The present guidelines offer the opportunity to share with the scientific community a baseline for future researches and discussion.

### Evaluation of the CT scan as the first examination for the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy for acute cholecystitis [^114bYB6B]. World Journal of Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The CT scan has supplanted the abdominal ultrasound for emergency examinations. A comparison of CT scan and ultrasound performance for the diagnosis and management of acute cholecystitis in acute care was proposed. The hypothesis is that the CT scan may be sufficient for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, which would allow faster progress to surgery.

Methods

The retrospective study of consecutive patients operated for acute cholecystitis or gallbladder distension with pre-operative imaging within 48 h in one centre.

Results

Between 2015 and 2017, a total of 341 cholecystectomies were performed in our centre. The analysis involved 120 patients. Ultrasound had better sensitivity than the CT scan, respectively, 79.4% [70.5–86.6] and 52.3% [42.5–62.1], but less specificity, with 61.5% [31.6–86.1] and 92.3% [64.0–99.8], respectively. However, there was a significant difference in favour of the CT scan for the diagnosis of complicated cholecystitis (p 0.004). The positive likelihood ratio of complicated cholecystitis is better at CT scan (7.8) [2.7–23.1] than in ultrasound (1.0) [0.1–9.7]. CT scan and ultrasound are equivalent for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, but CT scan is more efficient for the diagnosis of complicated cases (Youden index J 0.3 vs 0.001).

Conclusion

It is possible to place the surgical indication of cholecystectomy on the only data of the CT scan. We propose a decision-making algorithm that uses the CT scan to make the diagnosis and decide on emergency treatment for complicated cases or that allows us to propose a delayed surgery for simple cholecystitis.

### The LIFE TRIAD of emergency general surgery [^114Ntth9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Indications and guidelines production is a substantial part to diffuse good clinical and surgical practice. Guideline development is only possible through the availability of high-quality data and experts who develop consensus to define the best strategies for specific scenarios where no definitive data may be obtained. Many diseases in fact have been deeply investigated and plenty of literature works exist. A few others, however, due to the paucity of cases and their scattered diffusion, have not been so effectively studied. This is why registries and experts are vital for EGS. The leading societies have the duty and the responsibility to promote expert discussion and production of guidelines. They must offer open and wide options to allow worldwide coming experts to share data, experiences, and opinions in order to obtain the most shared and diffusible guidelines and indications possible.

### Surgery for acute cholecystitis in severely comorbid patients: a population-based study on acute cholecystitis [^1114YVJ4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute cholecystitis is a common complication of cholecystolithiasis. Cholecystitis may also occur in critically ill patients due to the disruption of the biliary peristalsis, and in a minority for other reasons. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the recommended treatment if possible. Severe systemic disease as measured by the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification (ASA ≥ 3) or Charleston Comorbidities index (CCI ≥ 7) is considered a contraindication for surgery in the most recent Tokyo guidelines. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines give no firm recommendations but state that patients with ASA3 or aged above 80 are at high risk of morbidity and mortality. Despite this, emergency cholecystectomy is the most common emergency general surgery procedure in the elderly. The experience from our centres is that patients with ASA 3 are routinely operated upon without a large increase in morbidity and mortality, but this has not been systematically evaluated.

Non-operatively managed (NOM) patients may be considered for surgery later to avoid new complications from cholecystolithiasis, e.g. another cholecystitis, pancreatitis, cholangitis, and gallstone ileus. Late cholecystectomy is considered worse than early cholecystectomy because of higher costs, risk of additional gallstone complications and worse quality of life. How common it is for patients to have complications while waiting for surgery, or for patients not considered candidates for surgery to have another complication is debated and estimates range from 2.5 to 22% while waiting for surgery and the lifetime risk of new gallstone complications is estimated to be between 10 and 50%.

There is a registry in Sweden covering almost all the emergency and elective cholecystectomies performed since 2005, The Swedish Registry of Gallstone Surgery and Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography, Gallriks, from which regular reports about the quality of surgical treatment and research are published. No corresponding registry with detailed data exists for NOM patients in Sweden.

Aim and hypotheses

The study aimed to investigate if it is safe to perform emergency cholecystectomies compared to NOM in patients deemed too sick to have surgery according to the Tokyo guidelines (ASA ≥ 3 and CCI ≥ 7). Additionally, we wanted to investigate the length of stay and outcomes after surgery compared to patients who are healthy or have mild systemic disease (ASA1–2 or CCI < 7).

The hypothesis was that ASA3 patients are potential candidates for surgery and have a similar rate of complications compared to patients with fewer comorbidities and that patients treated conservatively are at excessive risk for second events which motivates cholecystectomy even in comorbid patients.

Safe cholecystectomy guideline — risk stratification recommendations for mitigating bile duct injury (BDI) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: For patients with acute cholecystitis, we suggest that surgeons may use the Tokyo Guidelines 18 (TG18), American Association of Surgery for Trauma (AAST) classification, or another effective risk stratification model for grading of severity of cholecystitis and for patient management (expert opinion). During operative planning of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and intraoperative decision-making, we suggest that surgeons consider factors that potentially increase the difficulty of laparoscopic cholecystectomy such as male sex, increased age, chronic cholecystitis, obesity, liver cirrhosis, adhesions from previous abdominal surgery, emergency cholecystectomy, cystic duct stones, enlarged liver, cancer of gallbladder and/or biliary tract, anatomic variation, bilio-digestive fistula, and limited surgical experience (expert opinion).

For patients with moderate and severe cholecystitis there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation, particularly as it relates to the outcome of bile duct injury.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for acute cholecystitis, more specifically with respect to gallbladder drainage, indications, SICG/WSES 2019 guidelines recommend to consider performing percutaneous cholecystostomy for the treatment of elderly patients (> 65 years old) with acute calculous cholecystitis and ASA III/IV, performance status 3 to 4, or septic shock, deemed unfit for surgery.

### Comparing percutaneous treatment and cholecystectomy outcomes in acute cholecystitis patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113kMcD2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

AC typically presents with pain in the right upper quadrant, fever, nausea, and vomiting. To establish a diagnosis, healthcare providers rely on a thorough clinical assessment, along with ultrasound imaging and laboratory tests. The severity of the condition can vary widely, ranging from mild to severe, with serious complications such as gallbladder gangrene or perforation that can lead to significant morbidity and even mortality. To ensure consistent and effective management, the Tokyo Guidelines were created to offer a clear framework for diagnosing and treating AC, also providing a classification system for the severity of the disease and evidence-based protocols to improve patient outcomes. According to the Tokyo Guidelines, cholecystectomy (CC), particularly the laparoscopic method, is the preferred surgical treatment for AC, especially when performed within 72 h of symptom onset, as it is associated with fewer complications and shorter hospital stays. However, in patients at high surgical risk or those presenting later in the disease course, percutaneous cholecystostomy (PC), commonly referred to as drainage, represents a valuable alternative in clinical context. While percutaneous drainage is associated with higher mortality and longer hospital stays compared to CC, it remains a critical option for patients who are not candidates for surgery. In certain cases, percutaneous drainage may be employed as a temporary solution, while in others, it can serve as a definitive therapeutic approach.

Recent meta-analyses have consistently shown that early CC, preferably laparoscopic, is associated with better outcomes compared to PC, even in high-risk surgical patients with AC. The 2020 World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines strongly recommend early laparoscopic CC as the first-line treatment, reserving PC for patients unfit for surgery. However, the role of PC, either as a definitive treatment or as a bridge to delayed surgery, remains debated in specific clinical scenarios.

These systematic review and meta-analysis aim to provide a comprehensive and updated evaluation in light of these guidelines and recent evidence, providing a comparison not only between PC and CC but also evaluates the outcomes of a staged approach (PC followed by CC) versus immediate CC. This dual perspective offers novel insights into the optimal management strategies for high-risk patients with acute cholecystitis.

Support for subtotal cholecystectomy has also been reported from other studies. In a retrospective study on severely difficult gallbladders, 105 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy were matched with 46 patients who underwent subtotal laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The authors observed no bile duct injury in the subtotal cholecystectomy group, but four instances in the complete cholecystectomy group. Bile leakage was greater in the subtotal group due to difficulty in the cicatrisation on the remaining gallbladder stump; however, bile leakage was managed easily by abdominal drainage or in combination with endoscopic biliary prosthesis placement.

A recent nation-based database study evaluating 290,855 cases between 2003 and 2014 showed an increased use of subtotal cholecystectomy from 0.1 to 0.52% for open subtotal cholecystectomy and from 0.12 to 0.28% for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The conversion rate from laparoscopic to open total cholecystectomy decreased from 10.5 to 7.6%. Interestingly, the teaching hospitals significantly increased the rate of subtotal cholecystectomy. Furthermore, it should be highlighted that there are different techniques to achieve subtotal cholecystectomy: this aspect could add some difficulty in analysing data from different studies.

The quality of the available evidence ranges from low to moderate. However, the concordance of all the evidence, the large application of the technique globally, with the important clinical impact on patient safety, and the current absence of opportunities to achieve a better level of evidence strongly supports the recommendation for subtotal cholecystectomy in cases of difficult gallbladder.

When should conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy be considered in patients with ACC?

3.5 We recommend conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy in case of severe local inflammation, adhesions, bleeding from the Calot's triangle or suspected bile duct injury. #QoE: moderate; SoR: strong#

This recommendation should be supported by studies in which the patients with difficult gallbladder have been randomized to conversion or to different laparoscopic procedures. However, this type of study is unlikely to be performed.

### Acute cholecystitis: WSES position statement [^114XJjpD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Based on that scheme, the Tokyo guidelines suggest early laparoscopic cholecystectomy only in the mild forms of the disease (grade I), in which a laparoscopic cholecystectomy is likely to be easy. In the moderate cases, medical therapy with or without early gallbladder drainage (surgical or percutaneous) followed by delayed cholecystectomy is indicated, except in "experienced" centers. The "severe" grade (with organ dysfunction) is trusted to cholecystostomy.

However, several reports show that early cholecystectomy is safe even in the severe forms of the disease or in the elderly population. In particular, a recent review of prospective and retrospective series (EL3) did not show an increase in local postoperative complications in severe cholecystitis and confirmed that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is to be considered an acceptable indication for it, despite a demonstrated threefold conversion rate.

Laparoscopic vs open cholecystectomy

There are two randomized trials (EL2), a population-based outcome research (EL3) and numerous comparative studies demonstrating that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with faster recovery and shorter hospital stay than open cholecystectomy; the population-based outcome research showed also lower morbidity and mortality. This evidence supported the EAES Consensus Conference recommendation that laparoscopic cholecystectomy be the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis.

The preference for laparoscopic cholecystectomy is also expressed in the Tokyo guidelines; however, the "severity" tailored approach suggested in those guidelines limits the indication for surgery only to the mildest forms of acute cholecystitis and takes in consideration the above evidence only in part (EL5). One of the trials mentioned above, specifically included gangrenous cholecystitis (to be classified in the "moderate" form according to the Tokyo guidelines) and a recent meta-analysis shows that straight laparoscopic cholecystectomy is indicated in severe (gangrenous, empyematous) cholecystitis (EL3).

Advanced age also does not preclude the indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy (EL3).

### Laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the acute care surgery model: risk factors for complications [^116fnRkF]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The Acute Care Surgery (ACS) model developed during the last decade fuses critical care, trauma, and emergency general surgery. ACS teams commonly perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for acute biliary disease. This study reviewed LCs performed by an ACS service focusing on risk factors for complications in the emergent setting.

Methods

All patients who underwent LC on an ACS service during a 26-month period were identified. Demographic, perioperative, and complication data were collected and analyzed with Fisher's exact test, χ 2 test, and Mann-Whitney U Test.

Results

During the study period, 547 patients (70.2% female, mean age 46.1 ± 18.1, mean body mass index 32.4 ± 7.8kg/m 2) had LC performed for various acute indications. Mean surgery time was 77.9 ± 50.2minutes, and 5.7% of cases were performed "after hours". Rate of conversion to open procedure was 6%. Complications seen included minor bile leaks (3.8%), infection (3.8%), retained gallstones (1.1%), organ injury (1.1%), major duct injury (0.9%), and postoperative bleeding (0.9%). Statistical analysis demonstrated significant relationships between conversion, length of surgery, age, gender, and intraoperative cholangiogram with various complications. No significant relationships were detected between complications and BMI, pregnancy, attending experience, and time of operation.

Discussion

Although several statistically significant relationships were identified between several risk factors and complications, these findings have limited clinical significance. Factors including attending years in practice and time of the operation were not associated with increased complications. ACS services are capable of performing a high volume of LCs for emergent indications with low complication and conversion rates.-Level of evidence:IV.

Overall, it appears that ELC performed within 7 days of hospital admission and within 10 days of onset of symptoms is superior to either ILC performed between 7 days of hospital admission and 6 weeks or DLC performed between 6 weeks and 3 months of the initial hospital admission for acute cholecystitis. Since blinding cannot be achieved in these comparisons and the outcomes were subjective, all the trials were deemed to be at high risk of bias. However, trials with low risk of bias are difficult to conduct in this comparison. Since the evidence was consistent across trials and outcomes, it appears highly likely that ELC is superior to either ILC or DLC. Therefore, despite the moderate quality evidence (which is mainly because of the lack of blinding in the trials), the recommendation for ELC is strong. However, it should be noted that the study authors described that ELC was more complex; therefore, it should be attempted only by experienced surgeons. Referral to centres with high surgical expertise should be considered if adequate surgical expertise is not available. If ELC cannot be performed, DLC appears to be better than ILC. Although, there is no evidence of difference between DLC and ILC, the ACDC trial comparing ELC versus ILC showed that a significant proportion of patients undergoing ILC developed serious adverse events. Therefore, DLC may be preferable when ELC is not possible, although a proportion of patients with planned DLC approach may need unplanned earlier surgery (see Fig. 1). There are no trials comparing ILC and DLC and it is unlikely that they will performed, given the results of the ACDC trial. Therefore, there is significant uncertainty whether DLC is better than ILC when ELC is not possible and the recommendation to perform DLC when ELC is not possible is weak.

Retrospective cohort — Canada (2004–2011) found 890 patients with cholecystostomy for acute cholecystitis; in-hospital mortality was 5%. At three months, 25% had a cholecystectomy and 10% had died; at one year, 40% had cholecystectomy and 18% had died. Thirty-day and 1-year postoperative mortality in the cholecystectomy group was 2% and 6%. Among 866 discharged without cholecystectomy, gallstone-related emergency department visit or hospitalization was 23% at 3 months and 49% at 1 year, and in-hospital mortality of gallstone-related admissions was 1%.

Timing definitions for delayed surgery — In the debate over early versus delayed cholecystectomy, there is agreement that there is an unfavorable intermediate period during which cholecystectomy is more difficult due to the predictable severity of inflammation, and the span of this unfavorable intermediate period is at a minimum between 10 days and 4 weeks; studies that classify surgeries during this period as delayed are not adequately "delayed", which biases results in favor of early cholecystectomy.

### SAGES guidelines for the clinical application of laparoscopic biliary tract surgery [^111KAmy6]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Medium credibility.

Indications for laparoscopic biliary tract surgery — The indications for laparoscopic operations on the gallbladder and biliary tree have not changed since the 1992 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference Statement and remain similar to open surgery, with relative and absolute contraindications noted. As stated in the NIH report, "most patients with symptomatic gallstones are candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, if they are able to tolerate general anesthesia and have no serious cardiopulmonary diseases or other co-morbid conditions that preclude operation". Indications include but are not limited to symptomatic cholelithiasis, biliary dyskinesia, acute cholecystitis, and complications related to common bile duct stones including pancreatitis, and asymptomatic gallstones are generally not an indication for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The guideline assigns these indications an evidence rating of "Level II, Grade A".

Acute biliary pancreatitis — timing of cholecystectomy: In patients with acute biliary pancreatitis, the AGA recommends cholecystectomy during the initial admission rather than after discharge (Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence). Moderate quality evidence from a single randomized controlled clinical trial found reductions in a composite outcome of mortality and gallstone-related complications with initial-admission cholecystectomy (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09–0.61).

Gallstone-associated cystic duct obstruction is responsible for 90% to 95% of the cases of acute cholecystitis. Approximately 5% to 10% of patients with acute cholecystitis have acalculous cholecystitis, defined as acute inflammation of the gallbladder without gallstones, typically in the setting of severe critical illness. The typical presentation of acute cholecystitis consists of acute right upper quadrant pain, fever, and nausea that may be associated with eating and physical examination findings of right upper quadrant tenderness. Ultrasonography of the right upper quadrant has a sensitivity of approximately 81% and a specificity of approximately 83% for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. When an ultrasound result does not provide a definitive diagnosis, hepatobiliary scintigraphy is the gold standard diagnostic test.

Following diagnosis, early vs late laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with improved patient outcomes, including fewer composite postoperative complications, a shorter length of hospital stay, and lower hospital costs. During pregnancy, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, compared with delayed operative management, is associated with a lower risk of maternal-fetal complications and is recommended during all trimesters. In people older than 65 years of age, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is associated with lower mortality at 2-year follow-up compared with nonoperative management. For patients with acalculous acute cholecystitis, percutaneous cholecystostomy tube should be reserved for patients who are severely ill at the time of diagnosis; all others should undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Conclusions and Relevance Acute cholecystitis, typically due to gallstone obstruction of the cystic duct, affects approximately 200 000 people in the US annually. In most patient populations, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, performed within 3 days of diagnosis, is the first-line therapy for acute cholecystitis.

### Patient information: acute cholecystitis… [^112Y58BH]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

The gallbladder is an organ located below the liver that stores bile, a fluid that helps digest fats in the small intestine. Typical symptoms of acute cholecystitis include pain in the right upper area of the abdomen, fever, and nausea. Most commonly, acute cholecystitis occurs when the duct from the gallbladder to the small intestine is blocked by gallstones, resulting in swelling of the gallbladder due to accumulation of bile. Approximately 5% to 10% of people develop acute cholecystitis without gallstones. Acute complicated cholecystitis occurs when patients develop serious consequences from cholecystitis, such as rupture of the gallbladder. Acute cholecystitis affects more than 200 000 individuals per year in the US. Although about 20 million people in the US have gallstones, most do not experience symptoms related to them. However, about 10% to 15% of individuals with gallstones develop acute cholecystitis over their lifetime.

Right upper abdominal ultrasound is the first recommended imaging study to diagnose acute cholecystitis. Gallbladder ultrasound is accurate, low cost, and easily accessible; can be performed rapidly; and does not expose patients to ionizing radiation. Computed tomography, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance imaging are other imaging studies that are less commonly used to diagnose acute cholecystitis. The recommended treatment of acute cholecystitis is surgical removal of the gallbladder. In the US, standard care is laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is minimally invasive surgery performed via 3 small incisions in the abdomen to remove the gallbladder. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed 1 to 3 days after diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is associated with fewer postoperative complications, shorter hospitalization, and lower costs compared with surgery done more than 3 days after diagnosis.

For patients at high risk of surgical complications, an alternative to cholecystectomy is image-guided placement of a catheter through the skin of the abdomen into the gallbladder to allow drainage of the gallbladder.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. The gallbladder is a small organ underneath the liver that concentrates and stores bile. Bile is fluid made by the liver and released into the small intestine to help digestion. Changes in bile concentration and composition caused by changes in diet, hormones, medications, or rapid weight loss or weight gain can result in formation of solid pieces of bile called gallstones. In the United States, more than 6 million men and 14 million women have had gallstone disease, with higher rates in Native and Hispanic Americans. A small portion of people with gallstones may experience occasional abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, often after meals. Gallstones can sometimes migrate out of the gallbladder, block the normal flow of bile, and lead to inflammation and infection of the gallbladder. This is called cholecystitis and can cause sharp, constant abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting.

These symptoms warrant a visit to a physician, who can arrange for an ultrasound and make a referral to a surgeon if appropriate. Gallstones do not need to be treated if they are not causing problems. Patients who have cholecystitis or are bothered by symptoms of gallstones are treated with surgical removal of the gallbladder, known as cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, also known as minimally invasive cholecystectomy, is performed through 4 small incisions with use of a camera to visualize the inside of the abdomen and long tools to remove the gallbladder. Surgery is done under anesthesia, and patients are asleep throughout the entire procedure. Complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy are rare but can be serious when structures near the gallbladder are damaged. One of these structures is the common bile duct, which is the main tube that drains bile from the liver and gallbladder to the small intestine.

Damage to the common bile duct or other biliary ducts can cause leakage or obstruction of bile flow and has symptoms of abdominal pain, fever, and yellowing of skin, known as jaundice. These symptoms can also be caused by a gallstone that is left behind in the bile duct. Bleeding from a blood vessel near the gallbladder can sometimes occur. Most bleeding stops on its own, but rarely, persistent bleeding requires intervention. After cholecystectomy, patients who experience worsening pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or jaundice should see a doctor.
