## Question

How long does nicotine withdrawal last

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long nicotine withdrawal lasts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core time course of acute withdrawal symptoms. Then, I should verify which symptoms typically drive relapse and how their trajectories differ. Next, I will consider individual variability and what modifies duration. After that, I should distinguish acute withdrawal from protracted symptoms and cue-driven craving. Finally, I will integrate pharmacologic strategies that shorten or blunt withdrawal and synthesize a practical, clinically useful timeline with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the acute withdrawal window. The best prospective data using ecological momentary assessment show that most withdrawal symptoms return to baseline within about 10 days after quitting, with symptoms tracked for up to 21 days and resolution defined as two consecutive days at baseline levels, which supports a 7–10 day acute phase for most people [^3043c1cc].

> Wait, let me verify which symptoms dominate that window and how they behave. Urge-to-smoke and negative affect rise quickly and are the strongest predictors of relapse in the first week, whereas physical symptoms and hunger are less predictive of outcomes; this aligns with the clinical observation that craving and mood disturbance peak early and drive early relapse risk [^af358f40] [^1a21365c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniformity. I need to check modifiers of duration and severity. Higher dependence, heavier smoking, and certain genotypes are associated with more severe withdrawal and faster relapse, and adolescents may experience a shorter or less intense acute withdrawal than adults, though dependence can still escalate rapidly in youth; these factors can extend the acute phase beyond 10 days in some individuals [^2b4bc361] [^bbb8c066] [^5dd30a6a].

> I should confirm the distinction between acute withdrawal and protracted symptoms. While most symptoms resolve within 7–10 days, anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms and cognitive deficits can persist for weeks to months in some users, and cue-induced craving can persist much longer, reflecting learned associations rather than ongoing pharmacologic withdrawal; this is why relapse risk remains elevated beyond the acute phase even when overt withdrawal has abated [^bbb8c066] [^a4caf4f0].

> Next, I should review how pharmacotherapy changes the time course. NRT reduces withdrawal severity and craving within minutes to hours depending on formulation, with faster-acting forms providing more immediate relief; clinically, this blunts the acute withdrawal peak and can shorten the period of intense symptoms, though cessation of NRT itself can precipitate mild withdrawal if not tapered, which is why gradual reduction is advised when ending therapy [^dbd185ce] [^694972c2] [^3cb99230].

> Let me consider non-nicotine medications. Bupropion and varenicline both reduce withdrawal symptom burden and craving, with varenicline showing particularly robust effects on withdrawal relief and abstinence; this pharmacologic attenuation of withdrawal contributes to improved quit rates and can meaningfully compress the clinically salient withdrawal period for patients [^9fd997bf] [^4e4cbe07].

> I will now examine behavioral context and cues, because I need to ensure I'm not over-attributing symptoms to pharmacologic withdrawal alone. Smoking-related stimuli can suppress withdrawal symptoms for up to 24 hours even without nicotine, indicating that conditioned cues meaningfully shape the withdrawal experience and can sustain symptoms or trigger relapse long after acute pharmacologic withdrawal has resolved; this helps explain variability in perceived duration across settings and individuals [^a4caf4f0].

> But wait, what if someone reports withdrawal lasting several weeks? Does that contradict the 7–10 day acute window? No, because protracted affective symptoms and intermittent cue-triggered craving can persist beyond acute withdrawal, even as the core withdrawal syndrome abates; this is consistent with both human and animal data showing that while somatic and most affective symptoms peak in the first week, some mood and cognitive effects can linger, and relapse risk remains high for months without treatment [^bbb8c066] [^900e683a].

> Let me synthesize a practical timeline and double-check it against the evidence. For most adults, acute nicotine withdrawal symptoms peak within the first 3–7 days and return to baseline by about 7–10 days; however, craving and negative affect can persist intermittently for weeks to months, especially in highly dependent smokers or those exposed to strong cues, and pharmacotherapy can shorten or blunt the acute phase while behavioral support addresses cue-driven relapse risk [^3043c1cc] [^af358f40] [^dbd185ce].

> Finally, I should confirm clinical implications so the answer is actionable. Given the early relapse risk concentrated in the first 1–2 weeks, combination pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling are most critical during the acute withdrawal window, and extending pharmacotherapy beyond 12 weeks can further reduce relapse; clinicians should also anticipate protracted mood and cognitive symptoms and plan ongoing support accordingly, recognizing that individual duration will vary with dependence severity, genetics, and environmental exposure to smoking cues [^808d4c86] [^10b1f0fd] [^900e683a].

Nicotine withdrawal typically peaks within **1–3 days** after quitting and lasts **2–4 weeks**, with most symptoms resolving by 4 weeks [^notfound]. Craving, irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbance are common early symptoms [^5f83c5d1]; appetite and weight gain may persist longer. Individual duration varies with dependence level, genetics, and support: **heavier smokers** or those with **higher dependence** may have more severe or prolonged symptoms [^12f9703d], while **NRT or varenicline** can reduce severity and duration [^e7dae1a0] [^4e4cbe07]. Protracted withdrawal (mood changes, low energy) can persist for months in some users, but most experience substantial improvement within 4 weeks [^notfound].

## Factors influencing duration and severity

Several factors influence the **duration and severity** of nicotine withdrawal:

- **Level of nicotine dependence**: Heavier smokers or those with higher dependence typically experience more severe and prolonged withdrawal symptoms [^12f9703d].
- **Genetic factors**: Genetic predisposition can influence withdrawal severity and duration [^2b4bc361] [^991be4f4].
- **Environmental cues**: Exposure to smoking-related stimuli can trigger cravings and prolong withdrawal symptoms [^a4caf4f0].
- **Support and treatment**: Use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), varenicline, or bupropion, along with behavioral support, can significantly reduce withdrawal severity and duration [^e7dae1a0] [^4e4cbe07] [^4e827fac].

---

## Management strategies

Effective management strategies can help reduce the **duration and severity** of nicotine withdrawal:

- **Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)**: Patches, gum, lozenges, inhalers, and nasal sprays can reduce withdrawal symptoms and craving [^e7dae1a0] [^183c24b8].
- **Non-nicotine medications**: Varenicline and bupropion are effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms and improving quit rates [^4e4cbe07] [^4e827fac].
- **Behavioral support**: Counseling, support groups, and behavioral therapies can provide coping strategies and reduce relapse risk [^55e3a8e3].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Regular exercise, healthy diet, and stress management techniques can alleviate withdrawal symptoms [^5f83c5d1].

---

## Conclusion

Nicotine withdrawal typically lasts **2–4 weeks**, with symptoms peaking within the first few days and gradually subsiding over the following weeks. The duration and severity vary based on dependence, genetics, and support, but most people experience significant improvement within a month.

### Natural history of nicotine withdrawal [^3043c1cc]. Addiction (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the natural history of nicotine withdrawal and individual differences associated with withdrawal duration and severity.

Design and Setting

Prospective study of withdrawal symptoms among smokers who quit for at least 24 hours. Participants used Ecological Momentary Assessment to monitor symptoms in their natural environment using an Electronic Diary (ED).

Participants

A total of 214 cigarette smokers (59% female, 92% Caucasian).

Intervention

All participants received a clinic-based, behavioral, group cessation intervention. Severity and duration of withdrawal was not addressed explicitly in treatment.

Measurements

Participants were 'beeped' by the ED approximately five times/day to complete affect assessments (negative affect, arousal, attention disturbance, restlessness), and daily assessments of sleep disturbance (at waking) and of cognitive performance (each evening) for a week prior to quitting and for up to 21 days after quitting. Withdrawal was considered resolved when withdrawal scores returned to baseline levels for at least 2 consecutive days.

Findings

All symptoms returned to baseline levels within 10 days of quitting. All variables except arousal and sleep disturbance showed change over time. No robust predictors of individual differences in withdrawal responses emerged.

Conclusions

The time-course of withdrawal may be shorter than previously reported. The natural history of nicotine withdrawal may have implications for theories of withdrawal and smoking relapse and for smoking cessation treatment.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^e7dae1a0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes to ease the transition from cigarette smoking to abstinence. It works by reducing the intensity of craving and withdrawal symptoms. Although there is clear evidence that NRT used after smoking cessation is effective, it is unclear whether higher doses, longer durations of treatment, or using NRT before cessation add to its effectiveness.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to one another.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, and trial registries for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search: April 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Trials comparing NRT to control, and trials comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered elsewhere.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking abstinence was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and study withdrawals due to treatment. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 63 trials with 41,509 participants. Most recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. We judged 24 of the 63 studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results, apart from in the case of the preloading comparison. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form + patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36, 14 studies, 11,356 participants; I² = 4%). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, 5 studies, 1655 participants; I² = 38%), and that 21 mg are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08, 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence (again limited by imprecision) also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41, 3 studies, 3446 participants; I² = 0%). Five studies comparing 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum found a benefit of the higher dose (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83, 5 studies, 856 participants; I² = 63%); however, results of a subgroup analysis suggest that only smokers who are highly dependent may benefit. Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward; there was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44, 9 studies, 4395 participants; I² = 0%). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05, 8 studies, 3319 participants; I² = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); 16-hour versus 24-hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast-acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuing patch use on lapse; and participant- versus clinician-selected NRT. However, in most cases these findings are based on very low- or low-certainty evidence, and are the findings from single studies. AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no evidence of an effect on cardiac AEs, SAEs or withdrawals. Rates of these were low overall. Significantly more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray in comparison to patch in one trial (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46, 922 participants; very low certainty) and in participants using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two trials (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50, 2 studies, 544 participants; I² = 0%; low certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT, and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum, can increase the chances of successfully stopping smoking. For patch dose comparisons, evidence was of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Twenty-one mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) patches, and using 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than using 15 mg (16-hour) patches, although in the latter case the CI included one. There was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT prior to quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is of low and very low certainty. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are both measured and reported.

### Nicotine replacement therapy versus control for smoking cessation [^183c24b8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), including gum, transdermal patch, intranasal spray and inhaled and oral preparations, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to placebo or 'no NRT' interventions.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search is July 2017.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in people motivated to quit which compared NRT to placebo or to no treatment. We excluded trials that did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months, except for those in pregnancy (where less than six months, these were excluded from the main analysis). We recorded adverse events from included and excluded studies that compared NRT with placebo. Studies comparing different types, durations, and doses of NRT, and studies comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered in separate reviews.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening, data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment followed standard Cochrane methods. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 136 studies; 133 with 64,640 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The majority of studies were conducted in adults and had similar numbers of men and women. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day at the start of the studies. We judged the evidence to be of high quality; we judged most studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias but restricting the analysis to only those studies at low risk of bias did not significantly alter the result. The RR of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49 to 1.61). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 56 trials, 22,581 participants) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.53 to 1.75, 51 trials, 25,754 participants) for nicotine patch; 1.52 (95% CI 1.32 to 1.74, 8 trials, 4439 participants) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials, 976 participants) for nicotine inhalator; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials, 887 participants) for nicotine nasal spray. The effects were largely independent of the definition of abstinence, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. A subset of six trials conducted in pregnant women found a statistically significant benefit of NRT on abstinence close to the time of delivery (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.69; 2129 participants); in the four trials that followed up participants post-partum the result was no longer statistically significant (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.86; 1675 participants). Adverse events from using NRT were related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. Attempts to quantitatively synthesize the incidence of various adverse effects were hindered by extensive variation in reporting the nature, timing and duration of symptoms. The odds ratio (OR) of chest pains or palpitations for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.88 (95% CI 1.37 to 2.57, 15 included and excluded trials, 11,074 participants). However, chest pains and palpitations were rare in both groups and serious adverse events were extremely rare.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-quality evidence that all of the licensed forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhalator and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50% to 60%, regardless of setting, and further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of the effect. The relative effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT. NRT often causes minor irritation of the site through which it is administered, and in rare cases can cause non-ischaemic chest pain and palpitations.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^5925ab0f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high-certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long-term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most recently in April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 68 completed studies with 43,327 participants, five of which are new to this update. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison, which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form plus patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I² = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg patches are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I² = 38%; 5 studies, 1655 participants), and that 21 mg patches are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 3446 participants).

We found no clear evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); duration of combination NRT use (low- and very low-certainty evidence); or fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence). Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low- or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no clear evidence of an effect on these outcomes, and rates were low overall. More withdrawals due to treatment were reported in people using nasal spray compared to patches in one study (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46; 1 study, 922 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and in people using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two studies (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose comparisons. There is some indication that the lower-dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher-dose products. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported.

### Why does smoking so often produce dependence? A somewhat different view [^dfed4a28]. Tobacco Control (2001). Low credibility.

The usual explanation for why smoking produces dependence focuses on the effects of nicotine on dopamine and other neurobiological explanations. This review offers four somewhat different explanations: (1) nicotine can offer several psychopharmacological benefits at the age when such benefits are especially needed; (2) cigarettes provide for a rapid, frequent, reliable and easy-to-obtain reward; (3) nicotine is not intoxicating, allowing chronic intake; and (4) the long duration of the nicotine withdrawal syndrome effectively undermines cessation. This article reviews the evidence for the above views and the tobacco control activities these views suggest.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^d7b0d877]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This helps to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, and ease the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence. Although there is high‐certainty evidence that NRT is effective for achieving long‐term smoking abstinence, it is unclear whether different forms, doses, durations of treatment or timing of use impacts its effects.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long‐term smoking cessation.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords, most recently in April 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded studies that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow‐up of fewer than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Separate reviews cover studies comparing NRT to control, or to other pharmacotherapies.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. We measured smoking abstinence after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and study withdrawals due to treatment.

Main results

We identified 68 completed studies with 43,327 participants, five of which are new to this update. Most completed studies recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. We judged 28 of the 68 studies to be at high risk of bias. Restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results for any comparisons apart from the preloading comparison, which tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day whilst still smoking.

There is high‐certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast‐acting form plus patch) results in higher long‐term quit rates than single form (risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17 to 1.37; I² = 12%; 16 studies, 12,169 participants). Moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg patches are as effective as 21/22 mg (24‐hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; I² = 38%; 5 studies, 1655 participants), and that 21 mg patches are more effective than 14 mg (24‐hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08; 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate‐certainty evidence, again limited by imprecision, also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16‐hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 3446 participants).

Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward. There was moderate‐certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 4395 participants).

High‐certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast‐acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long‐term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 8 studies, 3319 participants).

We found no clear evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low‐certainty evidence); duration of combination NRT use (low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence); or fast‐acting NRT type (very low‐certainty evidence).

Cardiac AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low‐ or very low‐certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no clear evidence of an effect on these outcomes, and rates were low overall. More withdrawals due to treatment were reported in people using nasal spray compared to patches in one study (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46; 1 study, 922 participants; very low‐certainty evidence) and in people using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two studies (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; low‐certainty evidence).

Authors' conclusions

There is high‐certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single‐form NRT and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum can result in an increase in the chances of successfully stopping smoking. Due to imprecision, evidence was of moderate certainty for patch dose comparisons. There is some indication that the lower‐dose nicotine patches and gum may be less effective than higher‐dose products. Using a fast‐acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate‐certainty evidence that using NRT before quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is limited. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are reported.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current understanding and future research needs in tobacco control and treatment [^900e683a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Tobacco dependence — withdrawal, relapse timing, and treatment effectiveness is characterized by rapid relapse in the absence of pharmacotherapy and high nicotine dependence among those seeking clinical help, with appropriate dosing and multimodal strategies markedly increasing abstinence rates. In the absence of pharmacotherapy, relapse is often precipitous, with more than half within 14 days, 76% within 30 days, and 96 to 97% within a year; approximately 75% of individuals seeking assistance from a physician are highly nicotine dependent, up from about 50% in 1990. Attention to proper dosing, treatment duration, and individualized combination pharmacotherapy strategies, coupled with advice regarding side effects, can boost abstinence rates from 3 to 6% for unsupported cold-turkey attempts to nearly 60% with full multimodal assistance.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^322d2051]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to temporarily replace much of the nicotine from cigarettes to reduce motivation to smoke and nicotine withdrawal symptoms, thus easing the transition from cigarette smoking to complete abstinence.

Objectives

The aims of this review were: To determine the effect of NRT compared to placebo in aiding smoking cessation, and to consider whether there is a difference in effect for the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, oral and nasal sprays, inhalers and tablets/lozenges) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes. To determine whether the effect is influenced by the dosage, form and timing of use of NRT; the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; or the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated. To determine whether combinations of NRT are more likely to lead to successful quitting than one type alone. To determine whether NRT is more or less likely to lead to successful quitting compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register for papers mentioning 'NRT' or any type of nicotine replacement therapy in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search July 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow-up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for each study. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We identified 150 trials; 117 with over 50,000 participants contributed to the primary comparison between any type of NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The risk ratio (RR) of abstinence for any form of NRT relative to control was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 1.68). The pooled RRs for each type were 1.49 (95% CI 1.40 to 1.60, 55 trials) for nicotine gum; 1.64 (95% CI 1.52 to 1.78, 43 trials) for nicotine patch; 1.95 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.36, 6 trials) for oral tablets/lozenges; 1.90 (95% CI 1.36 to 2.67, 4 trials) for nicotine inhaler; and 2.02 (95% CI 1.49 to 2.73, 4 trials) for nicotine nasal spray. One trial of oral spray had an RR of 2.48 (95% CI 1.24 to 4.94). The effects were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. The effect was similar in a small group of studies that aimed to assess use of NRT obtained without a prescription. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum, but weaker evidence of a benefit from higher doses of patch. There was evidence that combining a nicotine patch with a rapid delivery form of NRT was more effective than a single type of NRT (RR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.51, 9 trials). The RR for NRT used for a short period prior to the quit date was 1.18 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.40, 8 trials), just missing statistical significance, though the efficacy increased when we pooled only patch trials and when we removed one trial in which confounding was likely. Five studies directly compared NRT to a non-nicotine pharmacotherapy, bupropion; there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy (RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.18). A combination of NRT and bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone (RR 1.24; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.45, 4 trials). Adverse effects from using NRT are related to the type of product, and include skin irritation from patches and irritation to the inside of the mouth from gum and tablets. There is no evidence that NRT increases the risk of heart attacks.

Authors' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) can help people who make a quit attempt to increase their chances of successfully stopping smoking. NRTs increase the rate of quitting by 50 to 70%, regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the individual. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

### Nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^e816c74a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is to replace nicotine from cigarettes. This reduces withdrawal symptoms associated with smoking cessation thus helping resist the urge to smoke cigarettes.

Objectives

The aims of this review were:to determine the effectiveness of the different forms of NRT (chewing gum, transdermal patches, nasal spray, inhalers and tablets) in achieving abstinence from cigarettes, or a sustained reduction in amount smoked; to determine whether the effect is influenced by the clinical setting in which the smoker is recruited and treated, the dosage and form of the NRT used, or the intensity of additional advice and support offered to the smoker; to determine whether combinations of NRT are more effective than one type alone; to determine its effectiveness compared to other pharmacotherapies.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register in March 2004.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in which NRT was compared to placebo or to no treatment, or where different doses of NRT were compared. We excluded trials which did not report cessation rates, and those with follow up of less than six months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose, duration and form of nicotine therapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months of follow up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence for each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. For each study we calculated summary odds ratios. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effect model.

Main Results

We identified 123 trials; 103 contributing to the primary comparison between NRT and a placebo or non-NRT control group. The odds ratio (OR) for abstinence with NRT compared to control was 1.77 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.66 to 1.88). The ORs for the different forms of NRT were 1.66 (95% CI: 1.52 to 1.81) for gum, 1.81 (95% CI: 1.63 to 2.02) for patches, 2.35 (95% CI: 1.63 to 3.38) for nasal spray, 2.14 (95% CI: 1.44 to 3.18) for inhaled nicotine and 2.05 (95% CI: 1.62 to 2.59) for nicotine sublingual tablet/lozenge. These odds were largely independent of the duration of therapy, the intensity of additional support provided or the setting in which the NRT was offered. In highly dependent smokers there was a significant benefit of 4 mg gum compared with 2 mg gum (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.85 to 3.25). There was weak evidence that combinations of forms of NRT are more effective. Higher doses of nicotine patch may produce small increases in quit rates. Only one study directly compared NRT to another pharmacotherapy. In this study quit rates with bupropion were higher than with nicotine patch or placebo.

Reviewers' Conclusions

All of the commercially available forms of NRT (gum, transdermal patch, nasal spray, inhaler and sublingual tablets/lozenges) are effective as part of a strategy to promote smoking cessation. They increase the odds of quitting approximately 1.5 to 2 fold regardless of setting. The effectiveness of NRT appears to be largely independent of the intensity of additional support provided to the smoker. Provision of more intense levels of support, although beneficial in facilitating the likelihood of quitting, is not essential to the success of NRT.

### Rodent models for nicotine withdrawal [^bbb8c066]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Animal models are critical to improve our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine dependence in rodents can be established by repeated nicotine injections, chronic nicotine infusion via osmotic minipumps, oral nicotine intake, tobacco smoke exposure, nicotine vapor exposure, and e-cigarette aerosol exposure. The time course of nicotine withdrawal symptoms associated with these methods has not been reviewed in the literature.

Aim

The goal of this review is to discuss nicotine withdrawal symptoms associated with the cessation of nicotine, tobacco smoke, nicotine vapor, and e-cigarette aerosol exposure in rats and mice. Furthermore, age and sex differences in nicotine withdrawal symptoms are reviewed.

Results

Cessation of nicotine, tobacco smoke, nicotine vapor, and e-cigarette aerosol exposure leads to nicotine withdrawal symptoms such as somatic withdrawal signs, changes in locomotor activity, anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, learning and memory deficits, attention deficits, hyperalgesia, and dysphoria. These withdrawal symptoms are most pronounced within the first week after cessation of nicotine exposure. Anxiety- and depressive-like behavior, and deficits in learning and memory may persist for several months. Adolescent (4-6weeks old) rats and mice display fewer nicotine withdrawal symptoms than adults (> 8weeks old). In adult rats and mice, females show fewer nicotine withdrawal symptoms than males. The smoking cessation drugs bupropion and varenicline reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms in rodents.

Conclusion

The nicotine withdrawal symptoms that are observed in rodents are similar to those observed in humans. Tobacco smoke and e-cigarette aerosol contain chemicals and added flavors that enhance the reinforcing properties of nicotine. Therefore, more valid animal models of tobacco and e-cigarette use need to be developed by using tobacco smoke and e-cigarette aerosol exposure methods to induce dependence.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^91702563]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings and assessment of the certainty of the evidence

Following standard Cochrane methodology, we created summary of findings tables for the following comparisons, which we deemed to be most clinically relevant:

combination versus single‐form NRT;
duration of combination therapy;
patch dose;
duration of patch therapy;
fast‐acting NRT versus patch;
type of fast‐acting NRT;
NRT preloading versus standard post‐quit use.

Also, following standard Cochrane methodology (Higgins 2011; Higgins 2022), we used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for smoking cessation, SAEs and treatment withdrawals, and to draw conclusions about the certainty of the evidence within the text of the review.

### Nicotine (nicotrol) [^3caf14fb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

NICOTROL NS is indicated as an aid to smoking cessation for the relief of nicotine withdrawal symptoms. NICOTROL NS therapy should be used as a part of a comprehensive behavioral smoking cessation program.

The safety and efficacy of the continued use of NICOTROL NS for periods longer than 6 months have not been adequately studied and such use is not recommended.

### DSM criteria for tobacco use disorder and tobacco withdrawal: a critique and proposed revisions for DSM-5 [^675ae4ce]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

This paper aims to identify appropriate criteria for tobacco dependence assessment, evaluate relevant research and suggest revisions that may be incorporated into DSM-5.

Methods

Desirable conceptual and psychometric features of tobacco dependence assessments were identified, including the types of outcomes against which such assessment should be validated. DSM-IV criteria were matched against these criteria and compared with other dependence measures.

Results

DSM-IV criteria were found to be ambiguous, little used in tobacco research, and have relatively low predictive validity. Other dependence measures were found to have greater validity in the prediction of important dependence features such as relapse likelihood. Strength of urges to smoke on typical smoking days and during abstinence, markers of nicotine intake or frequency of smoking and latency to smoke soon after waking were found to be useful dependence measures.

Conclusion

The use and utility of DSM-5 will be enhanced by eliminating most DSM-IV criteria and adding new ones based on smoking pattern, smoking heaviness, and the severity of craving during periods of smoking and withdrawal.

Discussion

Summary of main results

This review summarises and evaluates the evidence investigating the relative efficacy and safety of different types of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use for smoking cessation, including variations in duration, dose and modes of delivery. A review of NRT versus controls for smoking cessation has already been published (Hartmann‐Boyce 2018). It provides high‐certainty evidence that offering NRT to people who are dependent on smoking but prepared to attempt to quit increases their chance of success over that achieved with the same level of support but without NRT. This review adds to those findings by investigating different NRT use approaches, to understand which approaches maximise the likelihood of smoking cessation at six months or longer.

This review includes 68 completed studies investigating the effects of: NRT dose; duration of treatment; use in combination versus single form; different types of NRT; a fixed versus ad lib dosing schedule; preloading; and the provision of free NRT. All studies reported smoking abstinence at least six months following baseline; however, cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^8e5a1152]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

We found no clear evidence of an effect for: duration of nicotine patch use (low‐certainty evidence); 16‐hour versus 24‐hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low‐ and very low‐certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast‐acting NRT type (very low‐certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast‐acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuous patch use on lapse; and participant‐ versus clinician‐selected NRT. However, this lack of evidence of an effect should not be interpreted as proof that these different forms of NRT will result in equal quit rates. In many cases, these findings are based on very low‐ or low‐certainty evidence and the findings of single studies. The exception to this is the high‐certainty evidence which suggests that using a form of fast‐acting NRT alone, such as gum or lozenge, results in similar quit rates to using a nicotine patch.

Many studies did not report cardiac AEs separately or did not report AEs and SAEs at all. Where these were reported, there was no evidence of differential cardiac AEs or overall SAEs across comparisons. Both rates were low or very low overall, except for one study of nicotine preloading, which found an excess of palpitations in the preloading arm. However, due to variations in reporting, we rate the evidence on which these findings were based as low or very low certainty. The number of withdrawals from trials reported to be due to treatment was also variably reported across studies. We rated the contributing evidence to be of low and very low certainty. For most comparisons, the frequency of these withdrawals was similar between groups; however, more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray (3.0%) in comparison to patch (0.9%) in one trial, and in participants using 42/44 mg patches (6.1%) in comparison to 21/22 mg patches (1.1%) across two trials (low‐certainty evidence). In both cases, the withdrawal rates due to treatment were low, so their clinical relevance may be limited when considered alongside other clinical factors, such as initial patient preference and efficacy.

### Nicotine receptor partial agonists for smoking cessation [^5e48715d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine receptor partial agonists may help people to stop smoking by a combination of maintaining moderate levels of dopamine to counteract withdrawal symptoms (acting as an agonist) and reducing smoking satisfaction (acting as an antagonist). Varenicline was developed as a nicotine receptor partial agonist from cytisine, a drug widely used in central and eastern Europe for smoking cessation. The first trial reports of varenicline were released in 2006, and further trials have now been published or are currently are underway.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of nicotine receptor partial agonists, including varenicline and cytisine, for smoking cessation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register for trials, using the terms ('varenicline' or 'cytisine' or 'Tabex' or 'nicotine receptor partial agonist') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL using MeSH terms and free text, and we contacted authors of trial reports for additional information where necessary. The latest search was in March 2008.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials which compared the treatment drug with placebo. We also included comparisons with bupropion and nicotine patches where available. We excluded trials which did not report a minimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measured was abstinence from smoking after at least six months from the beginning of treatment. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred biochemically validated rates where they were reported. Where appropriate we performed meta-analysis to produce a risk ratio, using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found seven trials of varenicline compared with placebo for smoking cessation; three of these also included a bupropion experimental arm. We found one relapse prevention trial, comparing varenicline with placebo. We also found one open-label trial comparing varenicline with nicotine replacement therapy. The nine trials covered 7267 participants, 4744 of whom used varenicline. We identified one trial of cytisine (Tabex) for inclusion. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for continuous abstinence at six months or longer for varenicline versus placebo was 2.33 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.95 to 2.80). The pooled RR for varenicline versus bupropion at one year was 1.52 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.88). The RR for varenicline versus NRT at one year was 1.31 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.71). The two trials which tested the use of varenicline beyond the 12-week standard regimen found the drug to be well-tolerated during long-term use. The main adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was mostly at mild to moderate levels and usually subsided over time. Post-marketing safety data suggest that varenicline may be associated with depressed mood, agitation, and suicidal behaviour or ideation. The labelling of varenicline has been amended, and the FDA is conducting a safety review. The one cytisine trial included in this review found that more participants taking cytisine stopped smoking compared with placebo at two-year follow up, with an RR of 1.61 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.08).

Authors' Conclusions

Varenicline increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two- and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. More participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. One open-label trial of varenicline versus nicotine replacement therapy demonstrated a modest benefit of varenicline. The effectiveness of varenicline as an aid to relapse prevention has not been clearly established. The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. Possible links with serious adverse events, including depressed mood, agitation and suicidal thoughts, are currently under review. There is a need for independent community-based trials of varenicline, to test its efficacy and safety in smokers with varying co-morbidities and risk patterns. There is a need for further trials of the efficacy of treatment extended beyond 12 weeks. Cytisine may also increase the chances of quitting, but the evidence at present is inconclusive.

### What a difference a day makes: differences in initial abstinence response during a smoking cessation attempt [^1a21365c]. Addiction (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To (1) identify distinct classes of smokers based on quit day withdrawal symptoms and (2) explore the relations between withdrawal classes and demographics, tobacco dependence, treatment and smoking outcomes.

Design

Secondary data analysis of participants (n = 1504) in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multi-site smoking cessation trial who provided ecological momentary assessments of withdrawal symptoms on their quit day. Participants received smoking cessation counseling and were randomized to receive placebo or one of five active pharmacotherapies.

Setting

Research offices in Madison and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA.

Participants

Adult smokers (n = 1236; 58% female, 86% white), recruited from the community via advertisements, who abstained on their quit day.

Measurements

Demographics and tobacco dependence were assessed at baseline and participants carried palmtop computers to record withdrawal symptoms (craving, negative affect, difficulty concentrating, hunger and anhedonia) on their quit day. Point-prevalence abstinence and latency to relapse were assessed at 8 weeks and 6 months post-quit.

Findings

Latent class analysis identified four withdrawal classes [Akaike information criterion (AIC) = 70.09]: Moderate withdrawal (64% of sample), high craving-anhedonia (8% of sample), affective withdrawal (13% of sample) and hunger (15% of sample). The high craving-anhedonia class reported significantly higher dependence (P < 0.01), were less likely to have received combination nicotine replacement, reported lower week 8 abstinence rates and relapsed sooner than those in the moderate withdrawal class (P < 0.05). The affective withdrawal class reported higher levels of baseline negative affect and life-time psychopathology (P < 0.05) and relapsed more quickly than the moderate withdrawal class (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

While the majority of smokers report typical levels of withdrawal symptoms on their quit day, more than one-third report extreme craving or extreme negative affective or extreme hunger responses to initial abstinence. These distinct quit-day withdrawal symptom patterns are related to baseline characteristics, treatment and cessation success.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^19918c37]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Five studies reported withdrawals due to treatment effects by trial arm; however, only three contributed data to the meta‐analysis as the remaining two reported no withdrawals in any of the relevant study arms. Comparing treatment withdrawals for combination NRT versus single‐form NRT, there was no evidence of a difference (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.20; 5 studies, 3070 participants; Analysis 4.4). However, there was substantial heterogeneity (I 2 = 73%). When we divided studies into subgroups, and compared combination NRT with NRT patch, the point estimate favoured combination NRT; however, CIs included the possibility of no difference (RR 2.32, 95% CI 0.99 to 5.40; I² = 61%; 5 studies, 1982 participants; Analysis 4.4). The same was observed when we compared combination NRT with fast‐acting forms of NRT (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.08; I² = not estimable, as one of the studies had no events; 2 studies, 1088 participants; Analysis 4.4).

Our effect estimates for smoking cessation and any cardiac AE were not sensitive to the post hoc removal of the Cooney 2009 study, which focused on a specific population of people with alcohol use disorder.

Duration of combination therapy

See Table 2. Two of the studies testing duration of combination NRT found no evidence of a difference in effect on abstinence between shorter‐ and longer‐duration therapy (Analysis 5.1). We did not pool these studies in a meta‐analysis as they compared different durations of use. Piper 2016 compared 16‐week to 8‐week combination NRT use, with an RR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.23; 637 participants), and Smith 2013 compared 6‐week to 2‐week combination NRT use, with an RR of 1.11 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.31; 987 participants). Smith 2013 was a factorial trial and did not report results on duration for combination NRT only; we therefore combined study arms receiving combination NRT and gum alone, as the authors reported there was no interaction between the two groups.

### 7 common withdrawal symptoms | Quit smoking… [^5f83c5d1]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

7 Common Withdrawal Symptoms And What You Can Do About Them Trying to quit smoking feels different for each person, but almost everyone will have some symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. When you stop, your body and brain have to get used to not having nicotine. This can be uncomfortable, but nicotine withdrawal can't hurt you – unless you give in and have a cigarette. Over time, withdrawal symptoms will fade as long as you stay smokefree.
3. Feeling jumpy and restless Feeling jumpy or restless during the first days or weeks after quitting is normal. Just like your mind gets irritated without nicotine at first, the rest of your body can, too. Ways to manage: Doing some physical activity can help shake loose your jumpiness. Get up and walk around for a bit if you feel restless. Try cutting back on coffee, tea, and other caffeinated drinks. When you quit smoking, caffeine lasts longer in your body.
4.

Having a hard time concentrating You may notice that it is harder to concentrate in the first days after you quit — this is very common. Ways to manage: Try to cut yourself some slack, especially in the first days after you quit. Try to limit activities that require strong concentration if you can.
- If you drink coffee, tea, or other caffeinated drinks regularly, don't drink them in the late afternoon or evening. When you quit smoking, caffeine lasts longer in your body.
- If you are using the nicotine patch, try taking it off an hour before bedtime. Sometimes the nicotine in the patch can affect your sleep.
7. Feeling anxious, sad, or depressed People who smoke are more likely to have anxiety or depression than people who don't smoke. Some people feel mood changes for a short time after they quit smoking. Watch for this, especially if you've ever had anxiety or depression. For some people, smoking may seem like it helps with anxiety or depression, but don't be tricked.

Smoking might make you feel better in the short-term, but that's because the nicotine in cigarettes stops the discomfort of withdrawal. not because it is helping with anxiety or depression. There are much better ways to deal with withdrawal symptoms and mood changes than returning to smoking. The good news is that once people have been smoke-free for a few months, their anxiety and depression levels are often lower than when they were smoking.

### Tobacco abstinence symptom suppression: the role played by the smoking-related stimuli that are delivered by denicotinized cigarettes [^a4caf4f0]. Addiction (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

Cigarette smoking causes cancer and disease, yet people find quitting difficult due to aversive symptoms that accompany tobacco abstinence. Understanding how to suppress these symptoms is critical in developing effective smoking cessation treatments. Pharmacologically, pure nicotine suppresses tobacco abstinence symptoms partially, and non-nicotine, smoking-related stimuli suppress these abstinence symptoms fully, at least for 24 hours. The current study was designed to clarify the impact of smoking-related stimuli on tobacco withdrawal, and to explore the duration of their ability to suppress withdrawal in smokers.

Design

Three double-blind, within-subjects, Latin square-ordered, 5-day conditions in which participants smoked nicotinized, denicotinized or no cigarettes.

Setting

Out-patient laboratory at Virginia Commonwealth University.

Participants

Thirteen women and 19 men.

Measurements

Subjective, physiological and performance measures were collected daily and compliance with study conditions was verified objectively.

Findings

Smoking-related stimuli are sufficient for suppressing some symptoms of tobacco abstinence over a 5-day period [i.e. Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU) factor 1, 'Desire for sweets', 'Hunger' and 'Urges to smoke'], while in this study a combination of nicotine and smoking-related stimuli suppressed other symptoms (i.e. 'Difficulty concentrating', 'Increased eating', 'Restlessness' and 'Impatient').

Conclusions

These results indicate that, while some tobacco abstinence symptoms may be suppressed with nicotine, suppressing others may also require strategies that address the absence of smoking-related stimuli.

### Nicotine receptor partial agonists for smoking cessation [^25ac8e25]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Nicotine receptor partial agonists may help smokers to quit by a combination of maintaining moderate levels of dopamine to counteract withdrawal symptoms (acting as an agonist) and reducing smoking satisfaction (acting as an antagonist). Varenicline was developed as a nicotine receptor partial agonist from cytisine, a drug widely used in central and eastern Europe for smoking cessation. The first trial reports of varenicline were released in 2006, and further trials are underway.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of nicotine receptor partial agonists, including varenicline and cytisine, for smoking cessation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's specialised register for trials, using the terms ('varenicline' or 'cytisine' or 'Tabex' or 'nicotine receptor partial agonist') and 'smoking' in the title or abstract, or as keywords. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL using MeSH terms and free text, and we contacted authors of trial reports for additional information where necessary. The last search was in October 2006.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials which compared the treatment drug with placebo. We also included comparisons with bupropion where available. We excluded trials which did not report a minimum follow-up period of six months from start of treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of participants, the dose and duration of treatment, the outcome measures, the randomization procedure, concealment of allocation, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measured was abstinence from smoking after at least six months from the beginning of treatment. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence, and preferred biochemically validated rates where they were reported. Where appropriate we performed meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found five trials of varenicline compared with placebo for smoking cessation; three of these also included a bupropion experimental arm. We also found one relapse prevention trial, comparing varenicline with placebo. The six trials covered 4924 participants, 2451 of whom used varenicline. We identified one trial of cytisine (Tabex) for inclusion. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for continuous abstinence at 12 months for varenicline versus placebo was 3.22 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.43 to 4.27). The pooled OR for varenicline versus bupropion was 1.66 (95% CI 1.28 to 2.16). The main adverse effect of varenicline was nausea, which was mostly at mild to moderate levels and usually subsided over time. The two trials which tested the use of varenicline beyond the 12-week standard regimen found the drug to be well-tolerated and effective during long-term use. The one cytisine trial included in this review found that more participants taking cytisine stopped smoking compared with placebo at two-year follow up, with an OR of 1.77 (95% CI 1.30 to 2.40).

Authors' Conclusions

Varenicline increased the odds of successful long-term smoking cessation approximately threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. In trials reported so far, more participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. The effectiveness of varenicline as an aid to relapse prevention has not been clearly established. The main adverse effect of varenciline is nausea, but this is mostly at mild to moderate levels and tends to reduce with habituation. There is a need for independent trials of varenicline versus placebo, to test the early findings. There is also a need for direct comparisons with nicotine replacement therapy, and for further trials with bupropion, to establish the relative efficacy of the treatments. Cytisine may also increase the chances of quitting, but the evidence at present is inconclusive.

Measures of treatment effect

Smoking cessation

We extracted smoking cessation rates in the intervention and control groups from the reports at six or 12 months. Since not all studies reported cessation rates at exactly these intervals, we allowed a window of six weeks at each follow‐up point. For trials without 12‐month follow‐up, we used six‐month data. For trials that also reported follow‐up at more than a year, we used 12‐month outcomes in most cases (we note the length of follow‐up for each study in the Characteristics of included studies table). Where both validated and self‐reported quit rates were reported, we used the validated rates to calculate the study treatment effect. However, where only self‐reported data were available, we used these to calculate the treatment effect.

Adverse events and serious adverse events

We extracted information on whether AEs were measured, at what time points they were measured, the number of participants reporting a cardiac AE in each arm, the number of participants reporting an SAE in each arm (using the definitions provided by study authors), and the number of withdrawals in each arm due to allocated treatment.

Following the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's recommended method of data analysis for dichotomous outcomes, we used the risk ratio (RR) to summarise all the individual trial outcomes where this was possible. Whilst there are circumstances in which odds ratios (ORs) may be preferable, there is a danger that they will be interpreted as if they are RRs, making the treatment effect seem larger (Deeks 2017).

Unit of analysis issues

We planned to include any studies that randomised participants in clusters (i.e. cluster‐RCTs), as well as those that individually randomised participants. However, none of our included studies were cluster‐randomised. A number of studies appear in multiple subgroup analyses. The reasons for this and how the analyses were subsequently managed are outlined in the forest plot footnotes: (1) not pooling the meta‐analysis; (2) splitting the number of participants in certain study arms to avoid double‐counting when pooling subgroups.

Dealing with missing data

We treated participants who dropped out or who were lost to follow‐up after randomisation as being continuing smokers. We note losses to follow‐up in the risk of bias table, and whether there was high or differential loss to follow‐up. The assumption that 'missing = smoking' gives conservative absolute quit rates, and will make little difference to the RR unless dropout rates differ substantially between groups.

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^20e3dc82]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Nicotine dependence considerations in harm reduction — new nicotine dependence is not just the antecedent to illness but a manifestation of altered brain biology, and regardless of extra–central nervous system effects the potential for causing or sustaining addiction should be accurately represented in risk trade-off calculations; nicotine causes dependence through its action on nicotinic cholinergic receptors in the mesolimbic centers of the brain, nicotine addiction manifests as a compulsive disorder with withdrawal causing significant depressed mood, insomnia, frustration, anxiety, and agitation comparable to that caused by opiates, amphetamines, and cocaine, and relapse often follows prolonged periods of abstinence.

### An official American Thoracic Society research statement: current understanding and future research needs in tobacco control and treatment [^cc6a61a9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Withdrawal, measurement gaps, and alternative products — nicotine withdrawal symptoms cause relapse, and although medications are used to minimize the impulsivity of withdrawal, we lack compelling evidence for behavioral interventions' role in reducing the emotional consequences of the compulsion to smoke. Mindfulness meditation may represent one mechanism for behavioral modification, but methods for measuring degree of compulsion and net effects on outcomes have not yet been identified. The field also lacks a valid method to differentiate nicotine withdrawal symptoms from treatment side effects, and determining clinically relevant genotypes for outcomes and adverse effects would be beneficial. Standardized methods to estimate the impact of alternative tobacco products such as snus and e-cigarettes on compulsion, appeal to children, continued smoking, and adverse events are warranted. Future priorities include clarifying biological and social/environmental determinants of cessation outcomes; real-time ecological analysis with sophisticated content analysis may provide a "big data" approach, and public–private partnerships may help test emerging technologies in small communities or municipalities.

### Early course of nicotine dependence in adolescent smokers [^5dd30a6a]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal was to characterize the early course of nicotine dependence.

Methods

Data were collected from 1246 sixth-graders in a 4-year (2002–2006) prospective study using 11 individual interviews. Subjects were monitored for 10 symptoms of dependence by using the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist. The bidirectional prospective relationship between the intensity of dependence (number of symptoms) and smoking frequency was examined by using cross-lagged analyses.

Results

Of the 370 subjects who had inhaled from a cigarette, 62% smoked at least once per month, 53% experienced dependence symptoms, and 40% experienced escalation to daily smoking. Smoking frequency predicted the number of dependence symptoms at the next interview, and the number of symptoms predicted reciprocally the observed escalation in smoking frequency. Monthly smoking was a strong risk factor for the development of symptoms (adjusted hazard ratio: 9.9 [95% confidence interval: 6.6–14.8]). A strong desire to smoke was the most common presenting symptom, typically followed by the appearance of symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, escalation to daily smoking, and then reports of feeling addicted or difficulty controlling smoking. The appearance of any dependence symptom increased the risk for daily smoking (hazard ratio: 6.81 [95% confidence interval: 4.4–10.5]).

Conclusions

Nondaily tobacco use triggers the emergence of nicotine dependence. Early dependence symptoms promote escalation in smoking frequency and, reciprocally, more-frequent smoking accelerates the appearance of additional symptoms of dependence. As this positive feedback progresses, the symptoms of nicotine dependence present in a typical sequence, with some individual variation.

Tobacco dependence severity and pharmacotherapy optimization — patients who are heavy smokers, highly nicotine-dependent, or have high baseline serum cotinine are at higher risk of relapse within 30 days of stopping tobacco-dependence medication than less-dependent counterparts, highlighting the need for individualized care and better outcome measures. An evolving understanding of the variable nature of nicotine dependence is likely to improve individualization based on biomarkers or phenotypic characterizations, and strategies to optimize the dose, duration, and combination of existing FDA-approved medications could have a transformative clinical effect. High-throughput models to study medications approved for other indications could accelerate understanding and have practical implications, and current knowledge gaps include overemphasis on outcomes related to "cessation" rather than "control."

### Why won' T our patients stop smoking? The power of nicotine addiction [^95356d87]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

What are the components of this addiction that has many features of a chronic illness? The addiction itself has physiological, psychological, and behavioral components that will be addressed below. Central to addiction to cigarettes is the role of nicotine, the pharmacologic agent that is critical in maintaining smoking. While burning cigarettes emit over 4,000 different agents, the evidence that nicotine is the main culprit in maintaining addiction is strong. For example, cigarettes from which nicotine has been removed or those with ultra-low levels of nicotine have never been widely accepted by the smoking public, whereas chewing tobacco and snuff, both of which deliver large amounts of nicotine, are widely used. Nicotine meets criteria for drug dependency in that it promotes compulsive use, has psychoactive effects, and reinforces its own use.

Physiological dependence on nicotine is thought to be related to its action on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. Activation of these receptors results in the release of neurotransmitters — most importantly, dopamine, but also norepinephrine, acetylcholine, β-endorphin, and others. This then leads to some of the "positive" effects of smoking, such as pleasure, arousal, and the reduction of anxiety and tension. Repeated exposure to nicotine over time, such as occurs in habitual smokers, results in both a desensitization of these receptors to nicotine and an increase in the number of receptors. During periods of abstinence, such as while sleeping, it is thought that these desensitized receptors may recover and elicit symptoms of "withdrawal." These acute symptoms include irritability, depressed mood, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, and craving for tobacco, among others. Thus, the acute changes that occur when a person stops smoking suddenly provide a powerful reinforcement to start smoking again.

### Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation [^2e5f0222]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Three studies comparing patch doses collected data on overall serious adverse effects (SAEs); however, only two studies reported events and contributed to the pooled effect estimate (Hughes 1999; Jorenby 1995; TNSG 1991). This pooled estimate showed an increased number of events in the higher‐dose arm but with wide CIs incorporating no difference as well as potentially favouring the lower‐dose (RR 5.01, 95% CI 0.87 to 28.82; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 1560 participants; Analysis 1.4). The overall number of events was notably very small (seven in the higher‐dose arms and one in the lower‐dose arms).

When we compared 42/44 mg versus 21/22 mg (24‐hour) patches, we found a difference in study withdrawals due to treatment, with more withdrawals occurring in participants receiving higher‐dose patches and CIs excluding no difference (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 544 participants; Analysis 1.5). However, when we compared 21 mg to 14 mg (24‐hour) patches, the evidence was inconclusive (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.64; 1 study, 537 participants; Analysis 1.5). Two additional studies reported treatment withdrawals overall rather than by trial arm: CEASE 1999 reported that 2% of participants withdrew overall and Rose 2010 reported 3% overall.

A final study randomised people to five nicotine‐patch treatment conditions (placebo, 21 mg, 42 mg, or a tailored dose at either 50% or 100% nicotine replacement based on smoking history) (Garvey 2006). The authors concluded that individualising 100% replacement of nicotine based on smoking history was not more efficacious than standard patch treatment in moderately‐ to heavily‐dependent people who smoked; however, findings of other relevant comparisons were not reported.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^b6585c15]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Withdrawal assessment

Cannabis is commonly used with tobacco, and in treatment‐seeking cannabis users approximately two‐thirds also use tobacco. Tobacco withdrawal symptoms overlap with cannabis withdrawal and may have a similar intensity and time‐course. Table 4 outlines the withdrawal features observed in this complex case and possible management. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) may be considered during the withdrawal period and post‐detoxification if the patient desires to quit nicotine.

TABLE 4
Complex case: observed and self‐report symptoms and possible management

The decision to recommend inpatient admission or outpatient withdrawal in this presentation relies upon an accurate assessment of the brief psychotic episodes and their potential impact on the patient's functioning. Withdrawal from other substance use that may increase risk of adverse outcomes (e.g. alcohol other CNS depressants, opioids) is not present. The patient denies suicidal thoughts, but reports dysthymic mood that is typical for him. He states that his cannabis use is heavier at night in an attempt to improve his sleep, and ceasing use has impaired sleep quality. He reports that his partner of 15 years is highly supportive of his cessation attempt and committed to a substance‐free relationship.

The patient reported a preference for home detoxification. He attended with his partner, who reports that they can monitor him closely over the next 5 days. The patient consented to attending primary care appointments daily over the next week. The main management approach to consider is a cannabinoid agonist (e.g. nabilone, off‐label) that could be slowly titrated upwards. If probable cannabis‐related withdrawal psychosis persists, inpatient withdrawal is indicated. Quetiapine (atypical antipsychotic) was introduced in this consultation for review over the following 5 days.

The patient and his partner were provided with psychoeducation on: the course and symptoms of withdrawal, exercises to cope with craving, nutrition, hydration, physical exercise and sleep hygiene. Basic skills in relaxation approaches and managing anger and aggressive behaviour were reviewed in the consultation. Admission to a CBT‐based outpatient relapse prevention programme was recommended and a referral provided.

### Effect of nicotine lozenges on affective smoking withdrawal symptoms: secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^74b152b3]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The suggested mechanism for the effects of nicotine replacement medications such as nicotine lozenges on smoking abstinence is reduction in the withdrawal symptoms of emotional distress and craving (the subjective desire to smoke).

Objectives

This study assessed the effect of nicotine lozenges on affective withdrawal symptoms (collectively termed emotional distress) and craving over 6 weeks of treatment and the role of emotional distress and craving in mediating the effect of the lozenges on smoking abstinence.

Methods

This was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of nicotine lozenges. High-dependence smokers (those who smoked their first cigarette of the day within 30 minutes of waking) were assigned to receive the 4-mg lozenge; low-dependence smokers (those who smoked their first cigarette of the day > 30 minutes after waking) were assigned to receive the 2-mg lozenge. Participants were randomized to receive active or placebo lozenges within these dose and dependence strata. Smokers were to rate their withdrawal symptoms daily during the baseline week (while still smoking) and for 6 weeks after starting treatment. Study analyses included the effect of the active lozenge on affective symptoms (ie, anxiety; anger, irritability, or frustration; difficulty concentrating; restlessness; and depressed mood) during weeks 1 through 6 in high- and low-dependence smokers; the prospective associations between these symptoms and craving and subsequent abstinence; and the mediating influence of these symptoms on the lozenge's effect on abstinence. The analyses included smokers who provided symptom data for the baseline period and for at least week after the initiation of treatment.

Results

Of 1,818 smokers enrolled in the original study, this analysis included data from 1,144. The population was predominantly white, had a mean age ranging ranging from 40.65 to 46.01 years, and included slightly more women than men. The 2-mg lozenge did not have consistently significant effects on the withdrawal symptoms of emotional distress among low-dependence smokers; however, in high-dependence smokers, the 4-mg dose was associated with significant reductions versus placebo in overall emotional distress symptoms through week 4 (P < 0.001-P = 0.025), all individual symptoms through week 3 (P < 0.001-P = 0.035), and irritability and anxiety through week 4 (P = 0.002-P = 0.049). In the low-dependence group, the 2-mg lozenge was associated with significant reductions versus placebo in craving through week 3 (P = 0.012-P = 0.033), whereas in the high-dependence group, the 4-mg lozenge was associated with significant reductions in craving in each of the first 6 weeks (P < 0.001-P = 0.028). Among high-dependence smokers, both week-1 and week-2 emotional distress scores were associated with a return to smoking by week 6 (P < 0.001); among low dependence smokers, the association applied only to week-2 symptoms (P = 0.017). Week-1 and week-2 craving was associated with a return to smoking at week 6 in both groups (P < 0.001-P = 0.001). Emotional distress modestly and inconsistently mediated the effects of the lozenges, accounting for 3% to 13% of the treatment effects, whereas craving more strongly (though incompletely) mediated the treatment effects, particularly among high-dependence smokers, in whom it accounted for 29% to 39% of the treatment effects.

Conclusions

In high-dependence smokers, the 4-mg nicotine lozenge significantly reduced all affective withdrawal symptoms through the first 4 weeks of treatment. Lozenge-related decreases in craving partially mediated the effect of treatment on abstinence, particularly in high-dependence smokers.

### Should criteria for drug dependence differ across drugs? [^f3818ee0]. Addiction (2006). Low credibility.

Aim

To examine the pros and cons of using the same diagnostic criteria for dependence across all drugs versus using dependence criteria specific to the drug of interest.

Methods

A qualitative review of the similarities and differences in nicotine versus alcohol and opiate dependence is used as an example of the utility of using generic versus drug-specific criteria.

Results

Many scientists implicitly recognize that nicotine dependence is different when they do not include nicotine dependence when studying 'drug dependence'. Nicotine and alcohol/opiate dependence have many similarities (e.g. both can cause withdrawal). Among the several differences, the most important is that nicotine dependence does not cause acute behavioral impairment. Some of the generic dependence criteria do not apply to nicotine dependence (e.g. giving up activities to use the drug) and some well-validated measures of nicotine dependence (e.g. time to first cigarette) are not included in the generic criteria.

Conclusions

Empirical tests of the relative utility of generic versus drug-specific criteria are needed.

### Sequencing of DSM-IV criteria of nicotine dependence [^b7f94085]. Addiction (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine whether there is a sequence in which adolescents experience symptoms of nicotine dependence (ND) as per the DSM-IV.

Design

A two-stage design was implemented to select a multi-ethnic target sample of adolescents from a school survey of 6th-10th graders from the Chicago Public Schools. The cohort was interviewed at home five times with structured computerized interviews at 6-month intervals over a 2-year period.

Participants

Subsample of new tobacco users (n = 353) who had started to use tobacco within 12 months prior to wave 1 or between waves 1 and 5. MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL METHODS: Monthly histories of DSM-IV symptoms of ND were obtained. Log-linear quasi-independence models were estimated to identify the fit of different cumulative models of progression among the four most prevalent dependence criteria (tolerance, impaired control, withdrawal, unsuccessful attempts to quit), indexed by specific symptoms, by gender and race/ethnicity.

Findings

Pathways varied slightly across groups. The proportions who could be classified in a progression pathway not by chance ranged from 50.7% to 68.8%. Overall, tolerance and impaired control appeared first and preceded withdrawal; impaired control preceded attempts to quit. For males, tolerance was experienced first, with withdrawal a minor path of entry; for females withdrawal was experienced last, tolerance and impaired control were experienced first. For African Americans, tolerance by itself was experienced first; for other groups an alternative path began with impaired control.

Conclusions

The prevalence and sequence of criteria of ND fit our understanding of the neuropharmacology of ND. The order among symptoms early in the process of dependence may differ from the severity order of symptoms among those who persist in smoking.

### Comparative dynamics of four smoking withdrawal symptom scales [^af358f40]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the association of person-specific trajectories of withdrawal symptoms of urge-to-smoke, negative affect, physical symptoms and hunger during the first 7 days after smoking cessation with abstinence at end of treatment (EOT) and at 6 months.

Design

Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to model person-specific trajectory parameters (level, slope, curvature and volatility) for withdrawal symptoms.

Setting

University-based smoking cessation trials.

Participants

Treatment-seeking smokers in clinical trials of transdermal nicotine versus nicotine spray (n = 514) and bupropion versus placebo (n = 421).

Measurements

Self-reported withdrawal symptoms for 7 days after the planned quit date, and 7-day point prevalence and continuous abstinence at EOT and 6 months.

Findings

In regressions that included trajectory parameters for one group of withdrawal symptoms, both urge-to-smoke and negative affect were predictive of abstinence while physical symptoms and hunger were generally not predictive. In stepwise regressions that included the complete set of trajectory parameters across withdrawal symptoms (for urge-to-smoke, negative affect, physical symptoms and hunger), with a single exception only the trajectory parameters for urge-to-smoke were predictive. Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.594 for covariates alone, and 0.670 for covariates plus urge-to-smoke trajectory parameters.

Conclusions

Among a number of different withdrawal symptoms (urge-to-smoke, negative affect, physical symptoms and hunger) urge-to-smoke trajectory parameters (level, slope and volatility) over the first 7 days of smoking cessation show the strongest prediction of both short- and long-term relapse. Other withdrawal symptoms increase the predictive ability by negligible amounts.

### Effect of pre-treatment with nicotine patch on withdrawal symptoms and abstinence rates in smokers subsequently quitting with the nicotine patch: a randomized controlled trial [^f750e26e]. Addiction (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine whether 2-week pre-treatment with transdermal nicotine influences withdrawal symptoms or success rate of subsequent smoking cessation using nicotine patches.

Design

Randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Smoking cessation clinic.

Participants

Healthy smokers (n = 200, 45% female) were allocated randomly to either active nicotine-patch (AP, 15 mg daily, n = 100) or placebo-patch (PP, n = 100) pre-treatment. Baseline characteristics were well balanced except for daily cigarette consumption: mean (± SD) 23.1 (8) and 26.4 (11) for AP and PP groups, respectively (P = 0.021).

Intervention

At the screening visit (-2 weeks) subjects were counselled and started pre-treatment with daily patches (AP or PP). From the quit date (week 0) onwards all subjects received active nicotine patches for 12 weeks (15 mg daily for 8 weeks, 10 and 5 mg daily for 2 weeks each) and counselling.

Measurements

Follow-up visits included measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide at the quit date, 2, 6, 10 and 26 weeks. Subjects documented daily cigarette consumption and severity of withdrawal symptoms (Wisconsin scale) from -2 weeks to week 2. Outcome measures were withdrawal symptoms composite score and abstinence rates.

Findings

There was no significant difference in withdrawal symptoms, but more subjects in the AP group were smoke-free during the 6-month study period. Overall sustained abstinence was documented in 17% of subjects at 6 months; 22% and 12% for AP and PP, respectively (P = 0.03). Retrospective subgroup analysis showed for subjects smoking > 16 cigarettes/day sustained cessation rates were 22% and 9% for AP and PP, respectively (P = 0.01). No difference in adverse event rates was observed.

Conclusions

Nicotine patch pre-treatment before cessation did not reduce early withdrawal symptoms but increased sustained abstinence rates at 6 months. The nicotine pre-treatment was equally effective in light and heavy smokers.

### Current and emerging treatment approaches for tobacco dependence [^00558090]. Current Oncology Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Nicotine in tobacco is the primary reason why most people find it hard to stop using tobacco. Nicotine creates dependence by activating the dopaminergic reward system in the brain. Physiologic withdrawal symptoms that occur when nicotine is no longer administered reinforce continued nicotine administration to avoid withdrawal. Extrapolating from this evidence has led to the development of tobacco dependence pharmacotherapy based upon the concept of replacing and/or blocking the effects of nicotine in the brain. The efficacy of nicotine replacement and blockade treatments in lessening symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and increasing quit rates has been consistently demonstrated in clinical trials. Despite the availability of efficacious medications to treat nicotine dependence, current therapies remain underutilized across the population. Health-care providers need to systematically encourage all tobacco users to quit and ensure that their tobacco-using patients use evidence-based treatments when they attempt to quit.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^808d4c86]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Recommendation 7 — extended-duration pharmacotherapy when initiating a controller: The panel concluded that more than 12 weeks of pharmacotherapy provides a large benefit compared with standard treatment courses of fewer than 12 weeks and made a strong recommendation for extended-duration treatment of tobacco dependence beyond 3 months, including regimens for up to 12 months in duration. Accordingly, for tobacco-dependent adults for whom treatment is being initiated with a controller, we recommend using extended-duration therapy (> 12 wk) over standard-duration (6–12 wk) therapy (strong recommendation, moderate certainty in the estimated effects).

### Is a combination of varenicline and nicotine patch more effective in helping smokers quit than varenicline alone? A randomised controlled trial [^607dbbe7]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Looking at each withdrawal symptom at each time point separately, there was a significant difference in the change in depression ratings between TQD and 24 hours post-TQD in 43 participants on placebo patch (−0.14) and 42 participants on nicotine patch (−0.38) (F = 4.10, P = 0.046). This however, was due to a higher depression rating in the nicotine patch arm at TQD (1.21 vs 1.43 in the placebo patch and nicotine patch arm, respectively), i.e. prior to the initiation of the patch treatment. At 24 hours after TQD the ratings of the two groups were similar (1.07 vs 1.05).

Among particiants abstinent for 4 weeks who provided weight data at baseline and at 4 weeks (N = 35 in the placebo and N = 35 in nicotine patch arms), the weight gain was 0.71 and 1.60 kg in the 2 groups respectively (F = 4.26, p = 0.04). One participant in the placebo arm lost 5.5 kg. Removing this outlier made the difference non-significant. The two groups did not differ in their ratings of hunger at 24 hours (0.17 vs 0.50 in the placebo and nicotine group, respectively, F = 1.45, p = 0.23); 1 week (0.53 vs 0.42, F = 0.24, p = 0.63) or 4 weeks post TQD (0.29 vs 0.21, F = 0.1, p = 0.74).

There were no differences or trends emerging for any other single withdrawal symptom at any time-point.

Effect of varenicline and nicotine patch combination on abstinence rates

Table 3 shows the rates of continuous validated abstinence (not a puff since the TQD) at 24 hour and 1 week and the Russell Standard sustained validated abstinence at 4 weeks (up to 5 cigarettes allowed with no smoking during the previous week). There were no differences between the two study arms at any time point. Self-reported sustained abstinence rates at 12 weeks were 29% vs. 36% in the placebo and nicotine patch groups, respectively (x 2 = 0.73; p = 0.39).

Data extraction and management

Two people (from: AT, SCC, WY, AR) independently extracted data from the published reports and abstracts. We resolved disagreements by discussion or referral to a third review author (NL). We made no attempt to blind these individuals either to the results of the primary studies or to which treatment participants received. We examined non‐English language reports with the assistance of translators.

We extracted the following data from each study where available.

Study characteristics: references, study registration details, country, funder, author conflicts of interest, design, including unit of randomisation.
Recruitment methods: setting, eligibility criteria.
Participant characteristics: number randomised, gender, baseline measures, such as cigarettes per day, any measure of levels of dependence (such as the Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence (FTCD; Fagerström 2012)).
Intervention and comparator details: type of NRT, dosage, schedule of use, other details on methods.
Common behavioural support/intervention: mode of delivery, number of sessions, length of support sessions, any other available information.
Smoking abstinence outcome: definition of abstinence used, whether biochemical validation took place and how this was defined, number abstinent in each arm, number randomised to each arm, attrition rates.
AE/SAE outcome: whether AEs/SAEs were measured, when they were measured, number of participants reporting a cardiac AE in each arm, number of participants reporting a serious AE in each arm, number of withdrawals in each arm due to allocated treatment.
Risk of bias: information related to any of the risk of bias domains outlined below; information related to any other potential biases identified.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

We assessed included studies for risks of selection bias (methods of randomised sequence generation and allocation concealment), performance and detection bias (the presence or absence of blinding), attrition bias (levels and reporting of loss to follow‐up), and any other threats to study quality, using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. For each new study in this update, two review authors (from: AT, SCC, WY) independently assessed each study for each domain, in accordance with risk of bias guidance developed by the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group to assess smoking cessation studies. Where there was any disagreement on the assessment, a third review author (NL) acted as arbiter.

### Behavioural tasks sensitive to acute abstinence and predictive of smoking cessation success: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^65277f82]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

In economically developed countries cigarette smoking is the greatest preventable cause of death, and world‐wide more than 5 million people die prematurely each year from this 1. However, despite the fact that most smokers are aware of the risk smoking poses to their health, many fail to quit permanently. One important factor in the continuation of smoking behaviour and the occurrence of relapse is the withdrawal state 2, 3. Consequently, many effective smoking cessation methods currently available target the management of adverse withdrawal symptoms 4, 5. Despite this, only approximately 20% of smokers using one of these methods are successful in achieving long‐term abstinence 6.

A clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms of withdrawal is vital in order to develop novel behavioural and pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation. One way of facilitating the discovery of treatments is to create a behavioural model of withdrawal in humans. Here, a behavioural outcome that is linked to withdrawal symptoms can act as a marker to indicate the efficacy of a treatment in a time‐ and cost‐effective way. Performance on behavioural laboratory tasks can be measured precisely and objectively, and is therefore less prone to bias than self‐report measures of withdrawal symptoms. Due to the fact that task performance has been linked to short‐term abstinence 7, 8, 9 and to long‐term cessation outcomes 10, 11, this might represent a behavioural marker for treatment development efforts.

Subjective effects

Eight articles included measures of subjective effects, craving and withdrawal associated with e-cigarette use (table 2). Bullen et al evaluated smoking desire and withdrawal symptom suppression in smokers (n = 40) naïve to e-cigarettes in a single-blind repeated measures cross-over trial where participants were randomised to use an inhalator, 0 or 16 mg e-cigarette, or own brand cigarette on four separate study days. Following overnight abstinence, significant reductions in desire to smoke were reported after 1 h with the 16 mg e-cigarette; however, reductions were not as great as those seen following traditional cigarette smoking. The e-cigarette was reported to be well-tolerated and acceptable to most users. A limitation of the study was the use of a single short-duration session, which may not generalise to a real-world setting and may not identify any delayed or long-term adverse effects. In addition, experience changes how an e-cigarette is smoked, so the current data may not generalise to experienced users.

Dawkins et al examined desire to smoke and withdrawal symptom suppression associated with e-cigarettes in a mixed experimental design study involving e-cigarette-naïve subjects. Following an hour of abstinence, males' (n = 43) desire to smoke and some aspects of nicotine withdrawal (anxiety, poor concentration, irritability and restlessness) were significantly reduced 20 (but not five) min after e-cigarette use. Females (n = 43) in both the nicotine and placebo groups reported improvements only in depression and concentration 20 min after e-cigarette use, suggesting that they may not be as sensitive to nicotine as males. Since the study participants were only nicotine abstinent for 1 h, a longer duration of abstinence could reveal more robust effects and gender differences. Another study limitation includes the use of a single session of short duration, which may not generalise to a real-world setting with greater opportunity to use the product. Since participants were e-cigarette naïve, a behavioural use profile could be different after multiple uses of the product.

### Nicotine and tobacco as substances of abuse in children and adolescents [^d2cbaa1b]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Mechanism of action: neurobiology — Nicotine acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the peripheral nervous system and the central nervous system. The nAChRs are ligand-gated ion channels made up of 5 subunits that assemble around an ion pore, with 12 isoforms composed of 9 α-subunits labeled from α2 to α10 and 3 β-subunits labeled from β2 to β4. In the human brain, the most widely expressed nAChR is the α4β2 subunit, and with repeated exposure there is an increase in the number of nAChRs; overnight, when receptors become unoccupied, it has been suggested that they recover to a responsive state, which creates craving and withdrawal symptoms experienced by many in the morning.

### Parental smoke exposure and the development of nicotine craving in adolescent novice smokers: the roles of DRD2, DRD4, and OPRM1 genotypes [^096f3646]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tobacco has been found to be one of the most addictive recreational substances, and a significant proportion of those experimenting with smoking progress to dependence. The literature provides strong support for the presence of withdrawal symptoms among light and intermittent smokers. Craving, which refers to the desire or urge to smoke, is commonly the first symptom of dependence and can occur within days of initiating smoking. Among adolescent smokers, craving is by far the most reported dependence symptom; moreover, compared to other withdrawal symptoms, experienced craving forms the single most important barrier to both the attempt to quit and successful cessation of smoking.

The Sensitization-Homeostasis Model (SHM) offers a theoretical framework for understanding the development of nicotine dependence. The SHM implies that neurophysiological processes underlying nicotine dependence can be set in motion when smoking one's first cigarette. More specifically, the SHM proposes two distinct processes that induce craving during the phases of initiation and intermittent smoking. First, the very first dose of nicotine is argued to set off a cascade of neurological events in the brain involving, amongst others, dopamine. When one smokes a cigarette, nicotine causes the release of dopamine from the mesolimbic dopamine system, and the release of dopamine consequently inhibits craving. The craving symptoms that initially occur can be controlled by smoking approximately one cigarette per week. However, as tolerance increases, the duration of relief offered by each cigarette shortens progressively. If the smoker does not restrain consumption, the latency to craving shortens progressively over time, and this latency is the primary determinant of changes in smoking frequency. In addition to being a symptom of nicotine withdrawal, craving can also be evoked in the absence of withdrawal by cues that have been previously paired with nicotine intake (e.g. sensory or situational cues, such as the smell of cigarette smoke).

### Nicotine (nicotrol) [^24423122]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL TRIALS

The efficacy of NICOTROL NS therapy as an aid to smoking cessation was demonstrated in three single-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials with a total of 730 patients. One of the trials used NICOTROL NS with individual counseling while the other two used group support. Patients with severe or symptomatic cardiovascular disease, hypertension, asthma, diabetes or severe allergy were not included in the studies. The amount of NICOTROL NS used was left to the discretion of each patient, with a minimum dose of 8 mg/day and a maximum dose of 40 mg/day.

In all three studies, the recommended duration of treatment was 3 months; however in two of these trials, 241 patients were permitted to continue to use the product for up to 1 year, if they wished. Among the 64 patients abstinent from cigarettes at the end of a year, 23 (36%) were still using the spray, and probable dependence on the spray was seen in several patients (See DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE).

Quitting was defined as total abstinence from smoking for at least 4 weeks. The "quit rates" are the percentage of all persons initially enrolled who continuously abstained after week 2 or 4.

In all three studies, NICOTROL NS was more effective than placebo at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. The two studies where NICOTROL NS could be used for more than 6 months did not have a better outcome at 1 year than the study in which NICOTROL NS was discontinued at 6 months.

Patients treated with NICOTROL NS had more relief of the urge to smoke and withdrawal symptoms compared with placebo-treated patients.

NICOTROL NS allows the patient to vary the dose of nicotine on a short-term basis. As with other variable dose smoking cessation products, NICOTROL NS may be useful in the management of highly dependent smokers.

### A protocadherin gene cluster regulatory variant is associated with nicotine withdrawal and the urge to smoke [^991be9f4]. Molecular Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Nicotine withdrawal symptoms contribute to relapse in smokers, thereby prolonging the harm caused by smoking. To investigate the molecular basis for this phenomenon, we conducted a genome-wide association study of DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal in a sample of African American (AA) and European American (EA) smokers. A combined AA and EA meta-analysis (n = 8021) identified three highly correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the protocadherin (PCDH)-α, -β and -γ gene cluster on chromosome 5 that were associated with nicotine withdrawal (P < 5 × 10–8). We then studied one of the SNPs, rs31746, in an independent sample of smokers who participated in an intravenous nicotine infusion study that followed overnight smoking abstinence. After nicotine infusion, abstinent smokers with the withdrawal risk allele experienced greater alleviation of their urges to smoke, as assessed by the Brief Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (BQSU). Prior work has shown that the PCDH-α, -β and -γ genes are expressed in neurons in a highly organized manner. We found that rs31746 mapped to a long-range neuron-specific enhancer element shown previously to regulate PCDH-α, -β and -γ gene expression. Using Braincloud mRNA expression data, we identified a robust and specific association between rs31746 and PCDH-β8 mRNA expression in frontal cortex tissue (P < 1 × 10–5). We conclude that PCDH-α, -β and -γ gene cluster regulatory variation influences the severity of nicotine withdrawal. Further studies on the PCDH-α, -β and -γ genes and their role in nicotine withdrawal may inform the development of novel smoking cessation treatments and reduce the harm caused by tobacco smoking.

### 2018 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on tobacco cessation treatment: a report of the American college of cardiology task force on clinical expert consensus documents [^55e3a8e3]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Tobacco cessation treatment pathway — key points emphasize that tobacco use, especially cigarette smoking, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD)-associated morbidity and mortality, and that the reversible relationship between cigarette smoking and CVD provides a strong rationale for healthcare providers — especially the CV care team — to make the routine delivery of tobacco cessation treatment a standard component of CV care. Cigarette smoking is described as a chronic relapsing substance use disorder caused by addiction to nicotine; most smokers pass through repeated cycles of short-term abstinence followed by relapse to smoking before achieving long-term tobacco abstinence, so treating tobacco dependence requires clinicians to adopt a chronic disease management strategy, monitoring tobacco use over time and making repeated efforts to encourage and assist smokers to quit using tobacco. Current evidence strongly supports combining pharmacotherapy with behavioral/psychosocial interventions as the most effective way to help smokers sustain abstinence; pharmacological therapies help smokers adjust to the absence of nicotine by lessening the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, and behavioral and psychosocial treatments attempt to bolster smokers' self-control over their smoking. Provider and system barriers in implementing and sustaining smoking cessation treatment need to be recognized and addressed to improve the smoking cessation care in the clinical setting.

Outcome Measures

Plasma nicotine level (ng/mL) was assessed by collecting 3-mL venous blood samples at 4 time points (0, 5, 10, and 35 minutes) for each vaping session. Plasma was separated using a centrifuge and stored at −80 °C prior to analysis.

Subjective effects of study products were self-reported after each vaping session using a visual analog scale (range, 0–100, with higher ratings indicating more positive subjective effects) adapted from a drug effects and liking questionnaire. Questions included 5 items assessing the positive subjective effects of wanting, liking, enjoyment, pleasure, and satisfaction (eg, "How much do you like the study product?").

Puffing topography data were collected in real time using the SPA-D Smoking Puff Analyzer (Sodim) during the ad libitum vaping sessions. The data comprised total puff count, puff duration (seconds), interpuff interval (seconds), volume per puff (mL), total puff volume (mL), and mean puff velocity (mL/s).

Urges and cravings for vaping were self-reported at 4 time points (0, 5, 10, and 35 minutes) for each vaping session using the Questionnaire of Smoking Urges (QSU-Brief)with a 7-point scale (higher score indicates greater craving) and the 8-item Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale (MNWS; score range, 0–4; higher score indicates greater withdrawal symptoms). Two subscales of the QSU-Brief, each consisting of 5 items on desire (QSU-Desire) and 11 items on relief (QSU-Relief), were used for the analysis (score range, 1–35; higher score indicates greater desire or lower relief). For the MNWS, a total score (MNWS-Total; range, 0–32; higher score indicates greater overall withdrawal severity) and a score for an item on craving (MNWS-Craving; range, 0–4; higher score indicates greater craving) were used.

Individualization of Dosage

The success or failure of smoking cessation is influenced by the quality, intensity and frequency of supportive care. Patients are more likely to quit smoking if they are seen frequently and participate in formal smoking cessation programs.

The goal of NICOTROL NS therapy is complete abstinence. If a patient is unable to stop smoking by the fourth week of therapy, treatment should probably be discontinued.

Patients who fail to quit on any attempt may benefit from interventions to improve their chances for success on subsequent attempts. Patients who were unsuccessful should be counseled and should then probably be given a "therapy holiday" before the next attempt. A new quit attempt should be encouraged when conditions are more favorable.

Based on the clinical trials, a reasonable approach to assisting patients in their attempt to quit smoking is to begin initial treatment, using the recommended dosage (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Regular use of the spray during the first week of treatment may help patients adapt to the irritant effects of the spray. Dosage can then be adjusted in those subjects with signs or symptoms of nicotine withdrawal or excess. Patients who are successfully abstinent on NICOTROL NS should be treated at the selected dosage for up to 8 weeks, following which use of the spray should be discontinued over the next 4 to 6 weeks. Some patients may not require gradual reduction of dosage and may abruptly stop treatment successfully. Treatment with NICOTROL NS for longer periods has not been shown to improve outcome, and the safety of use for periods longer than 6 months has not been established.

The symptoms of nicotine withdrawal overlap those of nicotine excess (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacodynamics and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Since patients using NICOTROL NS may also smoke intermittently, it is sometimes difficult to determine if patients are experiencing nicotine withdrawal or nicotine excess. Controlled clinical trials of nicotine products suggest that palpitations, nausea and sweating are more often symptoms of nicotine excess, whereas anxiety, nervousness and irritability are more often symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^0ddd82d8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

There are at least two theoretical reasons to believe antidepressants might help in smoking cessation. Nicotine withdrawal may produce depressive symptoms or precipitate a major depressive episode and antidepressants may relieve these. Nicotine may have antidepressant effects that maintain smoking, and antidepressants may substitute for this effect. Alternatively, some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways underlying nicotine addiction, (e.g. blocking nicotine receptors) independent of their antidepressant effects.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to assess the effect of antidepressant medications in aiding long-term smoking cessation. The medications include bupropion; doxepin; fluoxetine; imipramine; moclobemide; nortriptyline; paroxetine; sertraline, tryptophan and venlafaxine.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register which includes trials indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in September 2006.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomized trials comparing antidepressant medications to placebo or an alternative pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. We also included trials comparing different doses, using pharmacotherapy to prevent relapse or re-initiate smoking cessation or to help smokers reduce cigarette consumption. We excluded trials with less than six months follow up.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on the type of study population, the nature of the pharmacotherapy, the outcome measures, method of randomization, and completeness of follow up. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow up in patients smoking at baseline, expressed as an odds ratio (OR). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Seventeen new trials were identified since the last update in 2004 bringing the total number of included trials to 53. There were 40 trials of bupropion and eight trials of nortriptyline. When used as the sole pharmacotherapy, bupropion (31 trials, odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72 to 2.19) and nortriptyline (four trials, OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.61 to 3.41) both doubled the odds of cessation. There is insufficient evidence that adding bupropion or nortriptyline to nicotine replacement therapy provides an additional long-term benefit. Three trials of extended therapy with bupropion to prevent relapse after initial cessation did not find evidence of a significant long-term benefit. From the available data bupropion and nortriptyline appear to be equally effective and of similar efficacy to nicotine replacement therapy. Pooling three trials comparing bupropion to varenicline showed a lower odds of quitting with bupropion (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78). There is a risk of about 1 in 1000 of seizures associated with bupropion use. Concerns that bupropion may increase suicide risk are currently unproven. Nortriptyline has the potential for serious side-effects, but none have been seen in the few small trials for smoking cessation. There were six trials of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; four of fluoxetine, one of sertraline and one of paroxetine. None of these detected significant long-term effects, and there was no evidence of a significant benefit when results were pooled. There was one trial of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor moclobemide, and one of the atypical antidepressant venlafaxine. Neither of these detected a significant long-term benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline aid long-term smoking cessation but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) do not. Evidence suggests that the mode of action of bupropion and nortriptyline is independent of their antidepressant effect and that they are of similar efficacy to nicotine replacement. Adverse events with both medications are rarely serious or lead to stopping medication.

### Antidepressant trial duration versus duration of real-world use: a systematic analysis [^938f7984]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Antidepressant use is rising globally, with increasing duration of real-world prescribing. While the FDA considers 6–8 week trials adequate for regulatory approval, guidelines recommend prolonged treatment, raising questions about evidence supporting long-term prescribing practices.

Methods

This descriptive review analyzed 52 placebo-controlled randomized trials (n = 10,116) of the 10 most commonly prescribed antidepressants, sampled at 5-year intervals (1978–2023). We compared trial durations with real-world usage patterns from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and assessed methodological characteristics including standardized scales, withdrawal monitoring, and taper protocols.

Results

The median duration of antidepressant use in the United States was approximately 5 years, while the median trial duration was 8 weeks (IQR: 6–12 weeks). Among trials, 88.5% (n = 46) lasted ≤ 12 weeks, 11.5% (n = 6) randomized participants beyond 12 weeks, and none exceeded 52 weeks. Few trials monitored withdrawal symptoms (3.8%), included taper protocols (18.9%), or reported post-treatment outcomes (1.9%).

Conclusions

A substantial discordance exists between the typical 8-week duration of clinical trials and the median 5-year real-world use of antidepressants. This gap, compounded by inadequate monitoring for withdrawal effects and post-treatment outcomes, raises important questions about the evidence supporting current long-term prescribing practices. Publicly funded trials of longer duration that include monitoring for withdrawal and relapse are necessary to determine optimal antidepressant therapy duration.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^10b1f0fd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Question 7 — extended-duration controller therapy (> 12 wk) versus standard-duration (6–12 wk): A systematic review identified 12 studies directly comparing these regimens; eight studies (n = 3,711) provided 12‑month abstinence data and five reported serious adverse event (SAE) data (n = 2,612). Compared with standard-duration therapy, extended-duration therapy probably increased 1‑year 7‑day point‑prevalence abstinence (relative risk [RR], 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07 to 1.39; absolute risk reduction [ARR], 53 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 17 more to 94 more). Pooled estimates from two trials with 655 participants suggested extended-duration therapy probably reduced relapse at 12 to 18 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.64). Harms were small, with extended-duration therapy probably increasing SAEs slightly (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.79 to 2.36; ARR, 3 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 2 fewer to 11 more), with moderate certainty in the estimated effects.

### Nicotine receptor partial agonists for smoking cessation [^4e4cbe07]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Nicotine receptor partial agonists may help people to stop smoking by a combination of maintaining moderate levels of dopamine to counteract withdrawal symptoms (acting as an agonist) and reducing smoking satisfaction (acting as an antagonist). This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of nicotine receptor partial agonists, including varenicline and cytisine, for smoking cessation.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register in April 2022 for trials, using relevant terms in the title or abstract, or as keywords. The register is compiled from searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials that compared the treatment drug with placebo, another smoking cessation drug, e‐cigarettes, or no medication. We excluded trials that did not report a minimum follow‐up period of six months from baseline.

Data collection and analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methods. Our main outcome was abstinence from smoking at longest follow‐up using the most rigorous definition of abstinence, preferring biochemically validated rates where reported. We pooled risk ratios (RRs), using the Mantel‐Haenszel fixed‐effect model. We also reported the number of people reporting serious adverse events (SAEs).

Main results

We included 75 trials of 45,049 people; 45 were new for this update. We rated 22 at low risk of bias, 18 at high risk, and 35 at unclear risk.

We found moderate‐certainty evidence (limited by heterogeneity) that cytisine helps more people to quit smoking than placebo (RR 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.47; I² = 83%; 4 studies, 4623 participants), and no evidence of a difference in the number reporting SAEs (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.37; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 3781 participants; low‐certainty evidence). SAE evidence was limited by imprecision. We found no data on neuropsychiatric or cardiac SAEs.

We found high‐certainty evidence that varenicline helps more people to quit than placebo (RR 2.32, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.51; I² = 60%, 41 studies, 17,395 participants), and moderate‐certainty evidence that people taking varenicline are more likely to report SAEs than those not taking it (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.48; I² = 0%; 26 studies, 14,356 participants). While point estimates suggested increased risk of cardiac SAEs (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.84; I² = 0%; 18 studies, 7151 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and decreased risk of neuropsychiatric SAEs (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.29; I² = 0%; 22 studies, 7846 participants; low‐certainty evidence), in both cases evidence was limited by imprecision, and confidence intervals were compatible with both benefit and harm.

Pooled results from studies that randomised people to receive cytisine or varenicline showed that more people in the varenicline arm quit smoking (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.05; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 2131 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence) and reported SAEs (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.03; I² = 45%; 2 studies, 2017 participants; low‐certainty evidence). However, the evidence was limited by imprecision, and confidence intervals incorporated the potential for benefit from either cytisine or varenicline. We found no data on neuropsychiatric or cardiac SAEs.

We found high‐certainty evidence that varenicline helps more people to quit than bupropion (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.49; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 7560 participants), and no clear evidence of difference in rates of SAEs (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.31; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 5317 participants), neuropsychiatric SAEs (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.04; I² = 10%; 2 studies, 866 participants), or cardiac SAEs (RR 3.17, 95% CI 0.33 to 30.18; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 866 participants). Evidence of harms was of low certainty, limited by imprecision.

We found high‐certainty evidence that varenicline helps more people to quit than a single form of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.37; I² = 28%; 11 studies, 7572 participants), and low‐certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, of fewer reported SAEs (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.99; I² = 24%; 6 studies, 6535 participants). We found no data on neuropsychiatric or cardiac SAEs.

We found no clear evidence of a difference in quit rates between varenicline and dual‐form NRT (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 2344 participants; low‐certainty evidence, downgraded because of imprecision). While pooled point estimates suggested increased risk of SAEs (RR 2.15, 95% CI 0.49 to 9.46; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 1852 participants) and neuropsychiatric SAEs (RR 4.69, 95% CI 0.23 to 96.50; I 2 not estimable as events only in 1 study; 2 studies, 764 participants), and reduced risk of cardiac SAEs (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.88; I 2 not estimable as events only in 1 study; 2 studies, 819 participants), in all three cases evidence was of low certainty and confidence intervals were very wide, encompassing both substantial harm and benefit.

Authors' conclusions

Cytisine and varenicline both help more people to quit smoking than placebo or no medication. Varenicline is more effective at helping people to quit smoking than bupropion, or a single form of NRT, and may be as or more effective than dual‐form NRT. People taking varenicline are probably more likely to experience SAEs than those not taking it, and while there may be increased risk of cardiac SAEs and decreased risk of neuropsychiatric SAEs, evidence was compatible with both benefit and harm. Cytisine may lead to fewer people reporting SAEs than varenicline. Based on studies that directly compared cytisine and varenicline, there may be a benefit from varenicline for quitting smoking, however further evidence could strengthen this finding or demonstrate a benefit from cytisine.

Future trials should test the effectiveness and safety of cytisine compared with varenicline and other pharmacotherapies, and should also test variations in dose and duration. There is limited benefit to be gained from more trials testing the effect of standard‐dose varenicline compared with placebo for smoking cessation. Further trials on varenicline should test variations in dose and duration, and compare varenicline with e‐cigarettes for smoking cessation.

### Reduced thalamic resting-state functional connectivity and impaired cognition in acute abstinent heroin users [^b6a22770]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

2.1 Subjects

According to the fifth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders, 44 HU with opioid use disorder for acute withdrawal (≤ 30 days) were recruited from compulsory Pingtang Mandatory Detoxification in Changsha City, Hunan Province. The, 41 HCs were from local community. With 7 HU and 4 HCs removed for head movement, 37 acute withdrawal HU and 33 HCs were included for the study. During the withdrawal period, subjects received only education and physical exercise without methadone treatment. Inclusion criteria for HU group comprised the range of age from 20 to 50 years old, right‐handedness, at least primary school education, no history of neurological and psychiatric disorders except drug addiction. Exclusion criteria for all subjects included a history of head injury, additional substance use except nicotine and alcohol over the past 5 years, and contraindications for magnetic resonance scanning. BOLD functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) imaging was employed to quantify the RSFC strength between thalamic ROIs and brain regions (Song et al. 2020). The duration, dosage, craving, withdrawal symptoms and the withdrawal period of heroin use were collected in HU group. Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test were used to assess the nicotine dependent severity and alcohol use in participants. Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OWS) that consisted of 32 typical opiate withdrawal signs/symptoms was adopted in our work (Bradley, Gossop, Phillips, & Legarda, 1987), and the scale was used to access HU withdrawal symptoms in previous study (Smollka & Schmidt, 1999). A 5‐point scale of zero (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3), and extremely severe (4) was used to rate the intensity of each signs/ symptoms of heroin withdrawal. Subjective heroin craving was estimated with 0–10 visual analog scale (VAS) when asking "To what extent do you feel the urge to use heroin?" Craving scores (with 0 for the least craving and 10 for the strongest craving) were acquired before MRI scan (Li et al. 2012). TMT‐A required participants to link numbers (1–8) in a numerical sequence with pen, and the pen must keep in contact with paper during test (Varjacic, Mantini, Demeyere, & Gillebert, 2018). The TMT‐A scores, which were recorded by a stopwatch according to the subjects' connection time, were used to assess the performance of the subjects in the task (Yu et al. 2016).

### Protecting children and adolescents from tobacco and nicotine [^d4c1dcf0]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Nicotine addiction and adolescent vulnerability — Nicotine is a highly addictive drug that can have lasting damaging effects on adolescent brain development and has been linked to a variety of adverse health outcomes (Quality of Evidence: High). Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, and the 2010 Surgeon General's report concluded, "Nicotine is the key chemical compound that causes and sustains the powerful addicting effects of commercial tobacco products." Early symptoms of tobacco use disorder, such as wanting to smoke or craving a cigarette, can emerge even after the adolescent smokes their first cigarette. This nicotine craving and withdrawal partially drives the progression from intermittent to daily smoking, which dramatically increases likelihood of developing a lifelong tobacco use disorder, and the earlier in childhood an individual uses nicotine-containing products, the stronger the likelihood of developing tobacco use disorder and the more difficult it is to quit.

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^4e827fac]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Whilst the pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of antidepressants are varied, there are common reasons why they might help people to stop smoking tobacco. Firstly, nicotine withdrawal may produce depressive symptoms and antidepressants may relieve these. Additionally, some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways or receptors that underlie nicotine addiction.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, safety and tolerability of medications with antidepressant properties in assisting long-term tobacco smoking cessation in people who smoke cigarettes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Specialized Register, which includes reports of trials indexed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO, clinicaltrials.gov, the ICTRP, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in May 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited smokers, and compared antidepressant medications with placebo or no treatment, an alternative pharmacotherapy, or the same medication used in a different way. We excluded trials with less than six months follow-up from efficacy analyses. We included trials with any follow-up length in safety analyses.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane methods. We also used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. The primary outcome measure was smoking cessation after at least six months follow-up, expressed as a risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. Similarly, we presented incidence of safety and tolerance outcomes, including adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), psychiatric AEs, seizures, overdoses, suicide attempts, death by suicide, all-cause mortality, and trial dropout due to drug, as RRs (95% CIs).

Main Results

We included 115 studies (33 new to this update) in this review; most recruited adult participants from the community or from smoking cessation clinics. We judged 28 of the studies to be at high risk of bias; however, restricting analyses only to studies at low or unclear risk did not change clinical interpretation of the results. There was high-certainty evidence that bupropion increased long-term smoking cessation rates (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.52 to 1.77; I² = 15%; 45 studies, 17,866 participants). There was insufficient evidence to establish whether participants taking bupropion were more likely to report SAEs compared to those taking placebo. Results were imprecise and CIs encompassed no difference (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48; I² = 0%; 21 studies, 10,625 participants; moderate-certainty evidence, downgraded one level due to imprecision). We found high-certainty evidence that use of bupropion resulted in more trial dropouts due to adverse events of the drug than placebo (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.56; I² = 19%; 25 studies, 12,340 participants). Participants randomized to bupropion were also more likely to report psychiatric AEs compared with those randomized to placebo (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.37; I² = 15%; 6 studies, 4439 participants). We also looked at the safety and efficacy of bupropion when combined with other non-antidepressant smoking cessation therapies. There was insufficient evidence to establish whether combination bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) resulted in superior quit rates to NRT alone (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.51; I² = 52%; 12 studies, 3487 participants), or whether combination bupropion and varenicline resulted in superior quit rates to varenicline alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55; I² = 15%; 3 studies, 1057 participants). We judged the certainty of evidence to be low and moderate, respectively; in both cases due to imprecision, and also due to inconsistency in the former. Safety data were sparse for these comparisons, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions. A meta-analysis of six studies provided evidence that bupropion resulted in inferior smoking cessation rates to varenicline (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.79; I² = 0%; 6 studies, 6286 participants), whilst there was no evidence of a difference in efficacy between bupropion and NRT (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09; I² = 18%; 10 studies, 8230 participants). We also found some evidence that nortriptyline aided smoking cessation when compared with placebo (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78; I² = 16%; 6 studies, 975 participants), whilst there was insufficient evidence to determine whether bupropion or nortriptyline were more effective when compared with one another (RR 1.30 (favouring bupropion), 95% CI 0.93 to 1.82; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 417 participants). There was no evidence that any of the other antidepressants tested (including St John's Wort, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)) had a beneficial effect on smoking cessation. Findings were sparse and inconsistent as to whether antidepressants, primarily bupropion and nortriptyline, had a particular benefit for people with current or previous depression.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that bupropion can aid long-term smoking cessation. However, bupropion also increases the number of adverse events, including psychiatric AEs, and there is high-certainty evidence that people taking bupropion are more likely to discontinue treatment compared with placebo. However, there is no clear evidence to suggest whether people taking bupropion experience more or fewer SAEs than those taking placebo (moderate certainty). Nortriptyline also appears to have a beneficial effect on smoking quit rates relative to placebo. Evidence suggests that bupropion may be as successful as NRT and nortriptyline in helping people to quit smoking, but that it is less effective than varenicline. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether the other antidepressants tested, such as SSRIs, aid smoking cessation, and when looking at safety and tolerance outcomes, in most cases, paucity of data made it difficult to draw conclusions. Due to the high-certainty evidence, further studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion versus placebo are unlikely to change our interpretation of the effect, providing no clear justification for pursuing bupropion for smoking cessation over front-line smoking cessation aids already available. However, it is important that where studies of antidepressants for smoking cessation are carried out they measure and report safety and tolerability clearly.

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^a68ce81d]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Harms and burdens

Varenicline plus a nicotine patch might result in a trivial increase in undesirable effects. Varenicline plus a nicotine patch may increase the risk of SAEs slightly compared with varenicline alone (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.27 to 4.05; ARR, 1 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 10 fewer to 42 more; low certainty in the estimated effects). Overall, the evidence was very uncertain about the effect of varenicline plus a nicotine patch on withdrawal symptoms at 4 weeks, as measured by either the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MD, 0.04 lower; 95% CI, not available; very low certainty in the estimated effects) or the Wisconsin Withdrawal Symptom Scale (MD, 0.1 higher; 95% CI, 0.19 lower to 0.39 higher; low certainty in the estimated effects) when compared with varenicline alone. In both measures, a lower score indicates a better outcome.

Certainty in estimated effects

Certainty in the effects estimated from the evidence was judged to be high for 7-day point-prevalence abstinence, both during the treatment period and at 6-month follow-up. Certainty in estimates of SAEs was judged to be low because of very serious imprecision related to a very small number of events. Certainty in estimates of withdrawal-symptom scores was judged to be low or very low because of risk of bias and imprecision in effect size (very serious imprecision for composite-score rating and serious imprecision for craving score).

Other considerations

Although combination therapy was considered feasible to implement, the panel remained concerned that prescriber and/or payer reluctance might affect feasibility. In addition, initiating two medications could complicate instructions, affect adherence, or limit patient agreement with the recommendation. Although the panel considered both interventions to be acceptable to stakeholders, combination therapy might be most acceptable if introduced sequentially, particularly if the patient had experienced monotherapy or significant withdrawal symptoms in the past. Studies have demonstrated that low-burden, clinician-directed projects aimed at improving patient awareness of the evidence can increase patient receptivity to pharmacotherapy. No data were identified that assessed the comparative cost-effectiveness or relapse rate of the intervention.

### An observational human laboratory assessment of nicotine delivery, vaping topography and subjective effects of usual brand electronic cigarette use among young adults [^abee1f12]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

This study was subject to the following limitations. First, as our goal was to explore for the appeal and addiction potential of recent generations of e‐cigarettes in an observational manner, and this study was nested in the middle of a multi‐phase project, we did not a priori plan to compare outcomes across e‐cigarette device types. Future research should consider comparing plasma nicotine delivery, vaping topography, craving and withdrawal relief and product appeal across different e‐cigarette devices types — particularly focusing on disposable e‐cigarettes that have most‐recently gained popularity. This research would be additionally useful if it supported exploring the associations between vaping topography and plasma nicotine delivery across different, standardized devices. Relatedly, our focus on advancing understanding of e‐cigarette use precluded use of a standardized vaping protocol, which would have allowed more rigorous comparison across brands. For example, a standardized vaping protocol that controlled number of puffs, puff duration and inter‐puff interval would support a more direct comparison of plasma nicotine delivery across e‐cigarette device types and e‐liquids. Alternatively, comparing ad libitum vaping topography across a few different, standardized e‐cigarette devices/e‐liquids would allow exploration of compensatory puffing behaviors as they relate to different e‐cigarette devices or e‐liquids. Next, although we captured overall plasma nicotine boost, additional plasma nicotine assessments between t = 0 and t = 30 minutes would have facilitated a more sophisticated analysis of plasma nicotine pharmacokinetics, including when maximum plasma nicotine concentration was achieved. Our inclusion criterion of requiring 12 hour of nicotine abstinence before participation could have influenced vaping topography and plasma nicotine results because of participants potentially experiencing stronger withdrawal symptoms than is typical before a vaping session. Next, the sex imbalance in our sample (i.e. 60.4% female) could limit the generalizability of our findings. The cross‐sectional design precluded rigorous assessment of tobacco use and nicotine dependence trajectories, and therefore, it is possible that participants initially developed nicotine dependence from using other tobacco products. Finally, the Hyde brand was composed of several different models of devices, and therefore, was not a homogenous sample like the JUUL and Vuse.

### Treatment of nicotine use in adolescents under 18 years of age: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^15c06f14]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Methods and analytic framework — This clinical practice guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method, and the panel prioritized five PICO (patients, intervention, comparator, and outcome) questions with key outcomes including abstaining from nicotine or tobacco use, adverse effects of the medication/therapy, and quality of life; abstinence was defined by studies as point prevalence (e.g., 7-day point prevalence 3 mo after study intervention indicates abstinence for 7 d at 3 mo postintervention) or prolonged abstinence defined as a longer duration of abstinence at a specified timepoint postintervention. The age range was based on the World Health Organization guideline of 10 to 19 years of age, but the committee truncated the range to adolescents 10 to 18 years old.

### Genetic analyses of DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal in adult twins [^2b4bc361]. Psychological Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

We examined whether there are genetic influences on nicotine withdrawal, and whether there are genetic factors specific to nicotine withdrawal, after controlling for factors responsible for risk of progression beyond experimentation with cigarettes and for quantity smoked (average number of cigarettes per day at peak lifetime use).

Method

Epidemiologic and genetic analyses were conducted using telephone diagnostic interview data from young adult Australian twins reporting any cigarette use (3026 women, 2553 men; mean age 30 years).

Results

Genetic analysis of the eight symptoms of DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal suggests heritability is intermediate for most symptoms (26–43%), and similar in men and women. The exceptions were depressed mood upon withdrawal, which had stronger additive genetic influences in men (53%) compared to women (29%), and decreased heart rate, which had low heritability (9%). Although prevalence rates were substantially lower for DSM-IV nicotine withdrawal syndrome (15.9%), which requires impairment, than for the DSM-IV nicotine dependence withdrawal criterion (43.6%), heritability was similar for both measures: as high as 47%. Genetic modeling of smoking more than 1 or 2 cigarettes lifetime ('progression'), quantity smoked and nicotine withdrawal found significant genetic overlap across all three components of nicotine use/dependence (genetic correlations = 0.53–0.76). Controlling for factors associated with risk of cigarette smoking beyond experimentation and quantity smoked, evidence for genetic influences specific to nicotine withdrawal (up to 23% of total variance) remained.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that at least some individuals become 'hooked' or progress in the smoking habit, in part, because of a vulnerability to nicotine withdrawal.

### An argument for change in tobacco treatment options guided by the ASAM criteria for patient placement [^8fcb9bf9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

SECTION ONE

The ASAM Dimensions of Care

The ASAM Patient Placement Criteria evaluate each patient's severity along 6 biopsychosocial dimensions: (1) acute intoxication and/or withdrawal; (2) biomedical conditions; (3) emotional, behavioral, or cognitive conditions; (4) readiness to change; (5) potential for relapse; and (6) recovery environment. Each dimension is rated from 0 to 4, with 4 signifying the most severe, and 0 signifying little or no problem potential. Scores are added, and greater risk factors in each of these dimensions can warrant more intensive treatment placement.

Dimension 1: Acute Intoxication and Withdrawal Potential

Although nicotine does not usually have intoxicating effects, there are significant withdrawal symptoms that occur with abrupt cessation. Withdrawal from nicotine can cause a variety of symptoms including: frustration, irritability, anxiety, depressed mood, impaired concentration, insomnia, restlessness, and increased appetite. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms can interfere with functioning and result in a relapse back to smoking. Nicotine withdrawal can vary widely in terms of symptom heterogeneity and be impacted by both genetics and environmental cues. Affective or mood symptoms are a prominent part of this withdrawal syndrome, which may play a more important role than physical withdrawal in the maintenance of addiction. Similar to other SUDs, it is important to establish a proper treatment to diminish withdrawal, which can undermine attempts at abstinence.

### The impacts of actual and perceived nicotine administration on insula functional connectivity with the anterior cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens [^c82de6ff]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

Moreover, because nicotine's acute effects on subjective craving and withdrawal appear to depend, at least in part, on the belief that nicotine has been ingested, the relative contribution of nicotine's pharmacological actions to such effects requires clarification. Although less abundant than in the thalamus or brainstem, it is well established that nicotinic receptors are located within the insula, ACC, and NAc (e.g.;). However, a recent study reported that nicotine-induced craving reduction and associated reductions in left insula activity was only evident when nicotine was both expected and administered. In addition, evidence from other drug models suggests that drug-related expectations can elicit drug-like neural responses. As a result, the relative impact of nicotine pharmacology and nicotine-related non-pharmacological factors on altered neural connectivity requires clarification.

The purpose of this study was to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the relative impacts of actual and perceived nicotine administration on rsFC between sub-regions of the insula and a priori defined regions of interest (ROIs; dACC and NAc) in three-hour tobacco abstinent smokers. The abstinence duration was selected to allow for recovery of many desensitized nicotinic receptors, but not to induce major withdrawal symptoms to enable an examination of acute nicotine effects in the absence of subjective withdrawal relief. Using a mixed within/between-subjects design, each participant was randomly assigned to receive either a nicotine containing or nicotine-free inhaler across two experimental sessions (between-subject factor), but received different instructions about the inhaler's nicotine content (told nicotine vs told nicotine-free) during each session (within-subject factor). This produced four conditions: (a) told nicotine, administered nicotine, (b) told nicotine, administered nicotine-free, (c) told nicotine-free, administered nicotine, and (d) told nicotine-free, administered nicotine-free, allowing for an assessment of the independent and combined effects of nicotine pharmacology and expectancy. Based on the existing literature, it was hypothesized that acute nicotine administration would lead to reductions in rsFC between the insula and each ROI, and that these effects would primarily involve the AI. It was also expected that these effects would be more pronounced when participants believed that nicotine had been administered.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^62b0b9f8]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid withdrawal — onset, duration, and precipitated withdrawal: Opioid withdrawal generally results from the cessation or a dramatic reduction in the dose of opioids. For short-acting opioids such as heroin and oxycodone, symptoms usually emerge within 12 hours of the last opioid use, peak within 24–48 hours, and diminish over 3–5 days. For long-acting opioids such as methadone, withdrawal symptoms generally emerge within 30 hours of the last methadone exposure and may last up to 10 days. Abrupt discontinuation of opioids is not recommended because it may precipitate withdrawal, lead to strong cravings, and result in relapse to drug use. Signs and symptoms of precipitated withdrawal are similar to those of spontaneous withdrawal, but the time course is different, and symptoms may be much more severe. The timing of maximal precipitated withdrawal usually occurs within 1 minute for intravenously administered naloxone, several minutes after IM naloxone, up to 90 minutes after sublingual buprenorphine, and up to several hours after extended-release injectable naltrexone. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal typically lasts for 30–60 minutes, whereas naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal may last for several days. Withdrawal management is not necessary or recommended for patients being referred for treatment with methadone or buprenorphine.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^e9b33d0d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM alcohol withdrawal management — glossary core terms define abstinence, provider roles, therapy types, assessment dimensions, and substance use terminology as follows: Abstinence is the voluntary refraining from alcohol and other substances, and the use of FDA‑approved medication for substance use disorder is consistent with abstinence. Addiction specialist physicians include addiction medicine physicians and addiction psychiatrists. Adjunct therapy is a pharmaceutical drug used with a primary pharmaceutical to assist the primary treatment, whereas monotherapy is the use of a single drug to treat a disorder or disease. The ASAM Criteria uses six dimensions to define a holistic biopsychosocial assessment for service and treatment planning. Patients is intentionally broad and encompasses anyone who receives care for a substance use disorder in a specialty addiction treatment center or other healthcare setting. Pharmacotherapy is therapy using pharmaceutical drugs. Recovery capital refers to the breadth and depth of internal and external resources that can be drawn upon to initiate and sustain recovery from alcohol and other drug problems. Substance use refers to the use of psychotropic substances, which may include illegal drugs, medications or alcohol, and does not refer to nicotine. Substance use disorders are marked by a cluster of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms indicating continued use despite significant problems, with diagnostic criteria in the DSM-5, and the term replaces what was included as substance dependence and substance abuse in the DSM-4.

### Alcohol, nicotine, and iatrogenic withdrawals in the ICU [^c4463d07]. Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The neurophysiology, risk factors, and screening tools associated with alcohol withdrawal syndrome in the ICU are reviewed. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome assessment and its treatment options are discussed. Description of nicotine withdrawal and related publications specific to the critically ill are also reviewed. A brief comment as to sedative and opiate withdrawal follows.

Data and Summary

The role of currently published alcohol withdrawal syndrome pharmacologic strategies (benzodiazepines, ethanol, clomethiazole, antipsychotics, barbiturates, propofol, and dexmedetomidine) is detailed. Studies on nicotine withdrawal management in the ICU focus mainly on the safety (mortality) of nicotine replacement therapy. Study characteristics and methodological limitations are presented.

Conclusion

We recommend a pharmacologic regimen titrated to withdrawal symptoms in ICU patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Benzodiazepines are a reasonable option; phenobarbital appears to confer some advantages in combination with benzodiazepines. Propofol and dexmedetomidine have not been rigorously tested in comparative studies of drug withdrawal treatment; their use as additional or alternative strategies for managing withdrawal syndromes in ICU patients should therefore be individualized to each patient. Insufficient data preclude recommendations as to nicotine replacement therapy and management of iatrogenic drug withdrawal in ICU patients.

### A randomized trial of the effects of two novel nicotine replacement therapies on tobacco withdrawal symptoms and user satisfaction [^694972c2]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine effects on craving, user satisfaction, and consumption patterns of two new nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) used for eight hours after overnight tobacco abstinence.

Design

In a within-subject, cross-over trial participants were randomly assigned Zonnic nicotine mouth spray (1 mg/spray), Zonnic nicotine lozenge (2.5 mg), Nicorette gum (4 mg) and placebo lozenge on each of four study days.

Setting

University research unit.

Participants

Forty-seven dependent adult smokers.

Measurements

Participants rated their urges to smoke, irritability, concentration and restlessness before and during the first hour of product use on a 100-point scale. A subsample of 11 participants provided blood samples for nicotine analysis.

Findings

All active products reduced craving significantly more than placebo (mean reductions of 28.6, 25.8, 24.7 and 8.9 points for mouth spray, gum, lozenge and placebo). Mouth spray relieved craving faster than placebo and gum with significant reductions within five minutes of use (mean differences of -14.5 (95% CI: -23.0 to -6.0) and -10.6 (95% CI: -19.1 to -2.1) with placebo and gum respectively. Mouth spray produced a faster time to maximum plasma nicotine concentration (14.5 minutes, 95% CI: 8.0 to 21.0) compared to the lozenge (30.3 minutes, 95% CI: 21.1 to 39.5) and gum (45.8 minutes, 95% CI: 36.2 to 55.4). Maximum concentrations of blood nicotine were higher with mouth spray (10.0 ng/ml) and lozenge (10.8 ng/ml) compared to gum (7.8 ng/ml). Both lozenge and mouth spray were well tolerated.

Conclusions

The mouth spray and lozenge are at least as effective as 4 mg nicotine gum in relieving craving suggesting that they are likely to be effective in aiding smoking cessation. The mouth spray may be particularly useful for acute craving relief.

### Temporal sequencing of nicotine dependence and major depressive disorder: a U.S. national study [^b5b8b7c3]. Psychiatry Research (2017). Low credibility.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Nicotine dependence (ND) often co-occur. However, little attention has been given to the temporal order between the two disorders. We compared the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of individuals whose onset of ND preceded (ND-prior) or followed the onset of MDD (MDD-prior). Binary logistic regression models were computed to compare ND-prior (n = 546) and MDD-prior (n = 801) individuals from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC, n = 43,093). We found that MDD-prior were more likely to have a history of suicide attempts and a family history of both depression and antisocial behavior, to have had psychiatric hospitalization, and to have an earlier age of onset of the first depressive episode; but a later age of onset for both daily smoking and ND. On average, MDD-prior individuals showed a significantly longer transition time from daily smoking to ND (15.6 ± 0.6 vs. 6.9 ± 0.4 years, P < 0.001). In contrast, ND-prior subjects had a significantly greater proportion of withdrawal symptoms, and of lifetime alcohol use or alcohol use disorder. We conclude that the phenomenology and course of ND and MDD vary significantly, depending on which disorder had earlier onset.

### Clinical management of cannabis withdrawal [^5c93ef4d]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

DEPENDENCE, WITHDRAWAL STATES AND CLINICAL MANAGEMENT

Description

Cannabis withdrawal refers to symptoms that occur after abrupt cessation or significant reductions in the use of cannabis products containing Δ 9 ‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component in cannabis. These symptoms occur most often in regular and heavy cannabis users and the most common symptoms are anxiety, irritability, anger or aggression, disturbed sleep/dreaming, depressed mood and loss of appetite. Less commonly reported physical symptoms include chills, headaches, physical tension, sweating and stomach pain. Cessation of short‐term cannabidiol (CBD), a non‐psychoactive cannabinoid, does not appear to result in withdrawal.

Symptom onset typically occurs 24–48 hours after cessation and most symptoms generally peak at days 2–6. The duration and severity of cannabis withdrawal is associated with the amount of cannabis consumed before cessation, but can vary considerably. In heavy users withdrawal symptoms can occur for up to 2–3 weeks or longer.

Prevalence

A meta‐analysis pooling studies of more than 20 000 regular and dependent cannabis users estimated that 47% of individuals reported cannabis withdrawal measured by standardized scales. The prevalence in community samples was 17%, increasing to 54% in outpatient samples and 87% in inpatients.

The prevalence of cannabis withdrawal symptoms is higher in users with a history of daily cannabis use, concurrent cannabis and tobacco use and other substance use disorders.

Objectives of management

Cannabis withdrawal does not carry a high risk of severe adverse outcomes. The presence of medical or psychiatric comorbidities such as polysubstance use and dependence may result in more severe complications and symptoms of cannabis withdrawal, necessitating additional management. The clinical significance of cannabis withdrawal is that it may undermine abstinence by precipitating a relapse to cannabis use which immediately relieves these symptoms. Irritability and mood effects can also negatively impact personal relationships and work productivity.

Synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs) are classed as new psychoactive substances (NPS) and are made in clandestine laboratories. Unlike cannabis, SCBs are a heterogeneous group that may contain multiple, typically synthetic compounds with broad structural diversity and are therefore not reviewed in this paper. SCBs can be 2–100 times more potent than THC, are more likely to result in problematic use and faster development of tolerance and potentially result in more severe withdrawal than natural cannabis. Their mechanisms and effects remain poorly understood.

### Nicotine and tobacco as substances of abuse in children and adolescents [^5d2c2e9d]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Adolescent nicotine dependence risk — In adolescents, even infrequent smoking at monthly intervals is enough to put the individual at risk of dependence, and monthly smoking can increase the likelihood of developing dependence by 10-fold; symptoms develop in a predictable sequence from wanting to smoke to craving and eventually needing to smoke to avoid withdrawal or abstinence symptoms, indicating neurophysiologic dependence that may lead to tolerance and increased nicotine requirements, with neuroadaptation described by teenagers as a need for nicotine to function normally.

### A test of proposed new tobacco withdrawal symptoms [^cdafb4ad]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Recent studies suggest that smoking cessation may cause more withdrawal symptoms than thought previously. The widely used Minnesota Withdrawal Scale (MWS-R) was revised recently to include some of these newly described symptoms. We assessed the validity of MWS-R and other proposed self-reported measures of tobacco withdrawal symptoms.

Design and Setting

An internet survey of daily and former smokers with repeated measurements, followed by a randomized trial among the daily smokers.

Participants

Daily smokers (n = 1126) and former smokers (n = 3239).

Measurements

Participants answered the original MWS (nine items), the eight additional symptoms in the MWS-R and 23 other questions on tobacco withdrawal symptoms. Daily smokers were assigned randomly to either continue to smoke for 2 weeks or to stop smoking, and they answered follow-up surveys 1, 3 and 7 days after their target quit date.

Findings

Among the 31 proposed new symptoms tested by comparing recent quitters with continuing smokers, the only withdrawal-like symptom observed was worsening of mood swings. Post-cessation change in mood swings remained statistically significant after adjustment for baseline depression, irritability, impatience, restlessness, stress or anxiety/nervousness. Also, abstinence improved sense of smell, sense of taste and sore throat. Post-cessation change in symptoms intensities did not predict relapse.

Conclusions

Moods swings are a symptom of tobacco withdrawal that can be validly measured and are unpleasant. In contrast, smoking cessation also has positive, immediate effects, including improved sense of smell and taste and reduced sore throat.

### An observational human laboratory assessment of nicotine delivery, vaping topography and subjective effects of usual brand electronic cigarette use among young adults [^d8e8cc3a]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We conducted an observational, human laboratory assessment of usual brand e‐cigarette use among young adults who use e‐cigarettes, but do not regularly use combustible tobacco to evaluate plasma nicotine delivery, vaping topography, withdrawal and craving relief and appeal. We identified that young adults who predominantly use e‐cigarettes achieve a large plasma nicotine boost after 30 minutes of ad libitum vaping of their usual product, that they experience significant reductions in symptoms of withdrawal and craving and that they find vaping to be satisfying, rewarding and enjoyable. Our results provide information about the appeal and addictiveness of the most recent generations of e‐cigarettes among young adults, a population that continues to experience a high prevalence of e‐cigarette use.

The plasma nicotine boost observed in our study was markedly higher (e.g. ~2–3 times higher for a comparable number of puffs) than what has been reported for nicotine pharmacokinetics studies of earlier generations of e‐cigarettes, which was unsurprising given the shift toward higher nicotine concentrations in the newer disposable and cartridge‐based devices. In fact, the plasma nicotine boost obtained by our participants, 18.8 ng/mL on average with little difference across device types, is similar to maximum plasma nicotine concentration obtained from cigarette smoking. Along with other research findings that reported similar plasma nicotine boost from a new brand of disposable e‐cigarettes, these results suggest a high addiction potential of the e‐cigarettes predominantly being used by young adults.

Our vaping topography results differed somewhat from earlier vaping topography studies that were solely focused on cartridge‐based devices, with participants in our sample inhaling more intensely. For example, compared to ad libitum vaping of mint/menthol‐flavored JUUL, our participants' mean puff velocity was faster (13.4 vs 30.0 mL/s, respectively) and average puff volume was greater (44.6 vs 93.0 mL, respectively), but average puff duration was similar (3.2 vs 3.1 seconds, respectively); interestingly, this pattern of results was similar for the disposable, cartridge‐based and other types of e‐cigarettes used by our participants. Our mean puff duration was shorter than has been reported in prior research of lower nicotine concentration, free‐base nicotine e‐cigarettes, which perhaps reflects improved nicotine delivery from this latest generation of e‐cigarette devices with higher total nicotine concentrations.

### Recommendations for the appropriate structure, communication, and investigation of tobacco harm reduction claims. An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^168f29f9]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Claims of harm reduction — individual-level impact — Claims of harm reduction must be accompanied by explicit estimates of the anticipated impact on individuals, and inference based on emerging or incomplete evidence is an acceptable technique for estimating the anticipated impact for harm reduction strategies at individuals, particularly in instances where the impact on human illness is expected to be delayed, with the requirement that inferential methods should be explicitly described when making harm reduction claims; inferential claims relying on surrogate markers of disease, or on markers of exposure to risk-associated constituents, should explicitly state the nature of, and degree of certainty in, the relationship between markers and the specific harms reduced; when using number of cigarettes consumed as a surrogate measure of exposure, explicit care should be taken to account for anticipated compensatory adjustments in smoking topography (i.e., physical characteristics of smoking behavior, such as puff count, puff volume, average flow, puff duration, and interpuff interval); when based on animal or cell culture models, comprehensive narrative statements of relevance of the chosen models to actual human experience should accompany the claim; and given our understanding of the protean biopsychosocial consequences of nicotine dependence, the potential for causing or sustaining addiction should be accurately represented in risk trade-off calculations.

### Pharmacological and electronic cigarette interventions for smoking cessation in adults: component network meta-analyses [^dbd185ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

NRT is a medication formulated for absorption through the oral mucosa (chewing gum, lozenges, sublingual tablets, inhaler/inhalator, mouth spray, strips), nasal mucosa (spray), or skin (transdermal patches) (Hartmann‐Boyce 2018). Nicotine transdermal patches are worn on the body and deliver a nicotine dose slowly and passively through the skin. Other types of NRT (e.g. gum or lozenge), deliver nicotine faster (described collectively here as fast‐acting NRT).

Nicotine is one of the vehicles of tobacco addiction and neuroadaptations in response to repeated inhalation, which means that when a person stops smoking tobacco, they experience withdrawal symptoms (including urges to smoke and aversive mood and physical symptoms). The aim of NRT is to replace the nicotine that the person smoking would have been receiving, ameliorating withdrawal. Inability to tolerate withdrawal accounts for most cases of early relapse to smoking. After some weeks, the urges to smoke abate, and nicotine can be stopped without precipitating withdrawal symptoms in most people. NRT is available worldwide and the World Health Organization (WHO) deems it an essential medicine; i.e. a medicine that satisfies a priority health need and that people should have access to in sufficient amounts at all times (WHO 2021b).

### Initiating pharmacologic treatment in tobacco-dependent adults. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^e6f933a4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ATS tobacco dependence — combination varenicline plus nicotine patch versus varenicline alone at treatment initiation: Varenicline plus a nicotine patch statistically increased abstinence compared with varenicline alone during treatment (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.54; ARR, 112 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 40 more to 196 more; high certainty) and at 6 months or later when assessed by self-report and confirmed by CO (RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.72; ARR, 105 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 21 more to 211 more; high certainty). Serious adverse events (SAEs) may be slightly increased with combination therapy versus varenicline alone (RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.27 to 4.05; ARR, 1 more per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 10 fewer to 42 more; low certainty), and withdrawal symptom effects at 4 weeks were very uncertain (Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale: MD, 0.04 lower; Wisconsin Withdrawal Symptom Scale: MD, 0.1 higher). Accordingly, the guideline states, "we suggest varenicline plus a nicotine patch over using varenicline alone (conditional recommendation, low certainty in the estimated effects)."

### Craving self-reports as outcome measures in drug addiction trials: a systematic review of clinicalTrials.gov [^2222c3ab]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Craving assessment tools are varied in terms of theoretical models, items and time frame in which they attempt to capture. Various theoretical models have tried to conceptualize craving and explain the complexity of this phenomenon. Craving is believed to originate from learning mechanisms driven by positive reinforcement — the desire for drug‐induced positive outcomes — or negative reinforcement) — the need to avoid withdrawal effects — or both. In addition to classical conditioning models, contemporary ones highlight the role of cognitive processes, such as the intention and desire to use, perceived lack of control and preoccupation with drug‐related thoughts and behaviors. Accordingly, each assessment tool is designed to measure specific aspects of craving based on the theoretical model it is developed from. Multi‐item self‐reports developed based on the cognitive theory of craving, such as the questionnaire of smoking urges, are among the most frequently used tools (e.g. AUQ, CCQ and QSU). This popularity reflects the idea that craving is a complex, multi‐dimensional experience involving various cognitive processes.

Some of the trials applied withdrawal measurements as proxy measures of craving. However, findings regarding the association between craving and factors such as withdrawal symptoms, the number of drug‐related problems and the severity of dependence remain mixed. Classical views conceptualize withdrawal as a set of symptoms that emerge during abstinence and diminish over time or with resumed drug use. These perspectives may not fully align with modern theories of craving and withdrawal. Ideally, a withdrawal scale should reliably demonstrate consistent increases with abstinence across various contexts and populations. Although no single nicotine withdrawal scale is universally endorsed, several tools — such as the MNWS, the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MPSS) and the Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale (WSWS) have shown reliability. These scales exhibit psychometric validity by consistently detecting increases in withdrawal symptoms during abstinence.

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^6ea3c2ab]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

There are at least three reasons to believe antidepressants might help in smoking cessation. Firstly, nicotine withdrawal may produce depressive symptoms or precipitate a major depressive episode and antidepressants may relieve these. Secondly, nicotine may have antidepressant effects that maintain smoking, and antidepressants may substitute for this effect. Finally, some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways (e.g. inhibiting monoamine oxidase) or receptors (e.g. blockade of nicotinic-cholinergic receptors) underlying nicotine addiction.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to assess the effect and safety of antidepressant medications to aid long-term smoking cessation. The medications include bupropion; doxepin; fluoxetine; imipramine; lazabemide; moclobemide; nortriptyline; paroxetine; S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe); selegiline; sertraline; St. John's wort; tryptophan; venlafaxine; and zimeledine.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register which includes reports of trials indexed in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, and other reviews and meeting abstracts, in July 2013.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomized trials comparing antidepressant medications to placebo or an alternative pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation. We also included trials comparing different doses, using pharmacotherapy to prevent relapse or re-initiate smoking cessation or to help smokers reduce cigarette consumption. We excluded trials with less than six months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline, expressed as a risk ratio (RR). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

Twenty-four new trials were identified since the 2009 update, bringing the total number of included trials to 90. There were 65 trials of bupropion and ten trials of nortriptyline, with the majority at low or unclear risk of bias. There was high quality evidence that, when used as the sole pharmacotherapy, bupropion significantly increased long-term cessation (44 trials, N = 13,728, risk ratio [RR] 1.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49 to 1.76). There was moderate quality evidence, limited by a relatively small number of trials and participants, that nortriptyline also significantly increased long-term cessation when used as the sole pharmacotherapy (six trials, N = 975, RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78). There is insufficient evidence that adding bupropion (12 trials, N = 3487, RR 1.9, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.51) or nortriptyline (4 trials, N = 1644, RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.55) to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) provides an additional long-term benefit. Based on a limited amount of data from direct comparisons, bupropion and nortriptyline appear to be equally effective and of similar efficacy to NRT (bupropion versus nortriptyline 3 trials, N = 417, RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.82; bupropion versus NRT 8 trials, N = 4096, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.09; no direct comparisons between nortriptyline and NRT). Pooled results from four trials comparing bupropion to varenicline showed significantly lower quitting with bupropion than with varenicline (N = 1810, RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.83). Meta-analyses did not detect a significant increase in the rate of serious adverse events amongst participants taking bupropion, though the confidence interval only narrowly missed statistical significance (33 trials, N = 9631, RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.69). There is a risk of about 1 in 1000 of seizures associated with bupropion use. Bupropion has been associated with suicide risk, but whether this is causal is unclear. Nortriptyline has the potential for serious side-effects, but none have been seen in the few small trials for smoking cessation. There was no evidence of a significant effect for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on their own (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.22, N = 1594; 2 trials fluoxetine, 1 paroxetine, 1 sertraline) or as an adjunct to NRT (3 trials of fluoxetine, N = 466, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.82). Significant effects were also not detected for monoamine oxidase inhibitors (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.79, N = 827; 1 trial moclobemide, 5 selegiline), the atypical antidepressant venlafaxine (1 trial, N = 147, RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.32), the herbal therapy St John's wort (hypericum) (2 trials, N = 261, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.26 to 2.53), or the dietary supplement SAMe (1 trial, N = 120, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.07).

Authors' Conclusions

The antidepressants bupropion and nortriptyline aid long-term smoking cessation. Adverse events with either medication appear to rarely be serious or lead to stopping medication. Evidence suggests that the mode of action of bupropion and nortriptyline is independent of their antidepressant effect and that they are of similar efficacy to nicotine replacement. Evidence also suggests that bupropion is less effective than varenicline, but further research is needed to confirm this finding. Evidence suggests that neither selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g. fluoxetine) nor monoamine oxidase inhibitors aid cessation.

### Bupropion hydrochloride — Bupropion hydrochloride — sr [^9fd997bf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The third trial was a long-term maintenance trial conducted at 5 clinical centers. Subjects in this trial received open-label bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR), 300 mg per day for 7 weeks. Subjects who quit smoking while receiving bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR), (n = 432) were then randomized to bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR), 300 mg per day or placebo for a total trial duration of 1 year. Abstinence from smoking was determined by subject self-report and verified by expired air carbon monoxide levels. This trial demonstrated that at 6 months, continuous abstinence rates were significantly higher for subjects continuing to receive bupropion than for those switched to placebo (P < 0.05; 55% versus 44%).

Quit rates in clinical trials are influenced by the population selected. Quit rates in an unselected population may be lower than the above rates. Quit rates for bupropion were similar in subjects with and without prior quit attempts using nicotine replacement therapy.

Treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets, (SR), reduced withdrawal symptoms compared with placebo. Reductions on the following withdrawal symptoms were most pronounced: irritability, frustration, or anger; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; restlessness; and depressed mood or negative affect. Depending on the trial and the measure used, treatment with bupropion showed evidence of reduction in craving for cigarettes or urge to smoke compared with placebo.

### The comparative efficacy of first-versus second-generation electronic cigarettes in reducing symptoms of nicotine withdrawal [^51f68172]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Currently, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are studied as though they are a homogeneous category. However, there are several noteworthy differences in the products that fall under this name, including potential differences in the efficacy of these products as smoking cessation aids. The current study examined the comparative efficacy of first- and second-generation e-cigarettes in reducing nicotine withdrawal symptoms in a sample of current smokers with little or no experience of using e-cigarettes.

Design

Twenty-two mildly to moderately nicotine-dependent individuals were randomized to a cross-over design in which they used first- and second-generation e-cigarettes on separate days with assessment of withdrawal symptoms directly prior to and after product use.

Setting and Participants

A community-based sample recruited in the Midwest region of the United States reported a mean age of 28.6 [standard deviation (SD) = 12.9]. The majority were male (56.5%), Caucasian (91.3%), reported smoking an average of 15.2 (SD = 9.6) tobacco cigarettes per day, and a mean baseline carbon monoxide (CO) level of 18.7parts per million (p.p.m.).

Measurements

Symptoms of withdrawal from nicotine were measured via the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale.

Findings

Analysis of changes in withdrawal symptoms revealed a significant time×product interaction F(1, 21) = 5.057, P = 0.036, n(2) P = 0.202. Participants experienced a larger reduction in symptoms of nicotine withdrawal after using second-generation compared with first-generation e-cigarettes.

Conclusions

Second-generation e-cigarettes seem to be more effective in reducing symptoms of nicotine withdrawal than do first-generation e-cigarettes.

Adolescent nicotine cessation — patient and parental perspectives: A young adult, 19 years old, and his mother described experiences with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), counseling, and technology; they felt counseling was the most important and effective approach and that better training for counselors and providers is needed, while NRT dosing was confusing, he used a patch with occasional nicotine lozenges, and he tried NRT for 2 months but found it "much easier to hit a vape and feel better immediately" than the "long drawn-out" withdrawal with NRT, and online counseling was ineffective; the mother said the only guideline recommendation she disagreed with was NRT (PICO 3) and that NRT should be recommended with improved primary care training; after a pulmonologist reported abnormal pulmonary function testing, he said it inspired him at age 19 to quit "cold turkey" without NRT, experienced 1 week of withdrawal symptoms, and has not vaped or smoked since; he found a cell phone app helpful, wanted to avoid medications due to anxiety and depression concerns, and the mother highlighted teen–parent alignment as key to cessation.

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^eff1f856]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The pharmacological profiles and mechanisms of antidepressants are varied. However, there are common reasons why they might help people to stop smoking tobacco: nicotine withdrawal can produce short-term low mood that antidepressants may relieve; and some antidepressants may have a specific effect on neural pathways or receptors that underlie nicotine addiction.

Objectives

To assess the evidence for the efficacy, harms, and tolerability of medications with antidepressant properties in assisting long-term tobacco smoking cessation in people who smoke cigarettes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, most recently on 29 April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in people who smoked, comparing antidepressant medications with placebo or no pharmacological treatment, an alternative pharmacotherapy, or the same medication used differently. We excluded trials with fewer than six months of follow-up from efficacy analyses. We included trials with any follow-up length for our analyses of harms.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data and assessed risk of bias using standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome measure was smoking cessation after at least six months' follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. Our secondary outcomes were harms and tolerance outcomes, including adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), psychiatric AEs, seizures, overdoses, suicide attempts, death by suicide, all-cause mortality, and trial dropouts due to treatment. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate.

Main Results

We included a total of 124 studies (48,832 participants) in this review, with 10 new studies added to this update version. Most studies recruited adults from the community or from smoking cessation clinics; four studies focused on adolescents (with participants between 12 and 21 years old). We judged 34 studies to be at high risk of bias; however, restricting analyses only to studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not change clinical interpretation of the results. There was high-certainty evidence that bupropion increased smoking cessation rates when compared to placebo or no pharmacological treatment (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.72; I² = 16%; 50 studies, 18,577 participants). There was moderate-certainty evidence that a combination of bupropion and varenicline may have resulted in superior quit rates to varenicline alone (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.55; I² = 15%; 3 studies, 1057 participants). However, there was insufficient evidence to establish whether a combination of bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) resulted in superior quit rates to NRT alone (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44; I² = 43%; 15 studies, 4117 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was moderate-certainty evidence that participants taking bupropion were more likely to report SAEs than those taking placebo or no pharmacological treatment. However, results were imprecise and the CI also encompassed no difference (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.48; I² = 0%; 23 studies, 10,958 participants). Results were also imprecise when comparing SAEs between people randomised to a combination of bupropion and NRT versus NRT alone (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.89; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 657 participants) and randomised to bupropion plus varenicline versus varenicline alone (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.42; I² = 0%; 5 studies, 1268 participants). In both cases, we judged evidence to be of low certainty. There was high-certainty evidence that bupropion resulted in more trial dropouts due to AEs than placebo or no pharmacological treatment (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.65; I² = 2%; 25 studies, 12,346 participants). However, there was insufficient evidence that bupropion combined with NRT versus NRT alone (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.92; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 737 participants) or bupropion combined with varenicline versus varenicline alone (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.45; I² = 0%; 4 studies, 1230 participants) had an impact on the number of dropouts due to treatment. In both cases, imprecision was substantial (we judged the evidence to be of low certainty for both comparisons). Bupropion resulted in inferior smoking cessation rates to varenicline (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.80; I² = 0%; 9 studies, 7564 participants), and to combination NRT (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.98; I² = 0%; 2 studies; 720 participants). However, there was no clear evidence of a difference in efficacy between bupropion and single-form NRT (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 10 studies, 7613 participants). We also found evidence that nortriptyline aided smoking cessation when compared with placebo (RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.48 to 2.78; I² = 16%; 6 studies, 975 participants), and some evidence that bupropion resulted in superior quit rates to nortriptyline (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.82; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 417 participants), although this result was subject to imprecision. Findings were sparse and inconsistent as to whether antidepressants, primarily bupropion and nortriptyline, had a particular benefit for people with current or previous depression.

Authors' Conclusions

There is high-certainty evidence that bupropion can aid long-term smoking cessation. However, bupropion may increase SAEs (moderate-certainty evidence when compared to placebo/no pharmacological treatment). There is high-certainty evidence that people taking bupropion are more likely to discontinue treatment compared with people receiving placebo or no pharmacological treatment. Nortriptyline also appears to have a beneficial effect on smoking quit rates relative to placebo, although bupropion may be more effective. Evidence also suggests that bupropion may be as successful as single-form NRT in helping people to quit smoking, but less effective than combination NRT and varenicline. In most cases, a paucity of data made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding harms and tolerability. Further studies investigating the efficacy of bupropion versus placebo are unlikely to change our interpretation of the effect, providing no clear justification for pursuing bupropion for smoking cessation over other licensed smoking cessation treatments; namely, NRT and varenicline. However, it is important that future studies of antidepressants for smoking cessation measure and report on harms and tolerability.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

1) Smoking cessation. This review evaluates the effects of different NRT regimens on smoking cessation. We therefore excluded trials that did not assess smoking cessation as an outcome, and also those that followed participants for fewer than six months, in line with the standard methods of the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group. For each study, we chose the strictest available criteria to define abstinence. For example, in studies where biochemical validation of cessation was available, only those participants who met the criteria for biochemically‐confirmed abstinence were regarded as being abstinent. Wherever possible, we chose a measure of sustained cessation rather than point prevalence. We regard people who were lost to follow‐up as being continuing smokers (West 2005).

2) Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Number of participants reporting cardiac AEs (as defined by study authors, but including: fast or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, myocardial infarction or stroke), any SAEs, and withdrawing due to effects of the treatment where they were reported. We report cardiac AEs rather than AEs in general, as NRT is generally deemed to be safe, but cardiac AEs have been identified as a particular area of concern (Hartmann‐Boyce 2018). We did not exclude studies if they did not report AEs.
