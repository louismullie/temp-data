## Question

A 34-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of schwannomatosis presents to your clinic with severe, localized pain in her right thigh. MRI reveals a 2.5 cm schwannoma compressing the femoral nerve. She has failed conservative pain management, including medications and physical therapy. Neurological examination shows no motor or sensory deficits in the affected limb. She is eager for pain relief and asks about surgical options. You are practicing in a tertiary center with access to experienced peripheral nerve surgeons and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring.

Based on current guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient’s painful schwannoma, and what considerations should be taken into account before proceeding with surgery?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step in managing a 34-year-old woman with schwannomatosis, severe pain from a 2.5 cm femoral nerve schwannoma, and no neurological deficits, who has failed conservative therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the presentation fits schwannomatosis. Then, I should verify the guideline-based indications for surgery in schwannomatosis. Next, I will examine the risks and benefits of surgery in this specific anatomic location, including the role of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. After that, I need to check alternatives like radiotherapy and why they are not preferred here. Finally, I will outline preoperative planning, consent, and follow-up, and synthesize a clear recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and diagnostic framing. Schwannomatosis is characterized by multiple non-vestibular schwannomas and a predisposition to chronic neuropathic pain; this patient's known diagnosis, focal femoral nerve involvement, and severe pain despite medical therapy align with that phenotype, and the absence of motor or sensory deficits is not uncommon early on, so I should not let that delay definitive management when pain is refractory [^notfound].

> Next, I should review guideline indications for surgery in schwannomatosis. The ERN GENTURIS guidelines explicitly recommend early surgical intervention for painful schwannomas when surgery can be performed without causing neurological deficits, and they advise against repeated surgeries in the same symptomatic area if prior surgery failed to relieve pain because benefit diminishes and morbidity may rise. They also emphasize that symptomatic schwannomas should be operated on by surgeons with significant experience in nerve sheath tumor resection, ideally with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring for critical nerves [^74f526ca] [^359fdb04] [^68e2ddc8] [^e2c042c6] [^29bd6ea8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the anatomic risk profile. The femoral nerve is a critical mixed motor-sensory nerve supplying quadriceps function and anterior thigh sensation; however, schwannomas are typically encapsulated and amenable to subcapsular microsurgical enucleation that preserves functioning fascicles, and contemporary series of pelvic and lower-extremity schwannomas report high rates of complete pain relief with low rates of permanent deficit when nerve-sparing techniques are used, supporting the feasibility of safe resection in this location [^6720f9d2] [^e6d6438f] [^9466539f].

> I need to ensure we weigh alternatives appropriately. Radiotherapy is not recommended for routine management of schwannomatosis-associated schwannomas due to the risk of malignant transformation and lack of durable pain control; it is reserved for growing tumors that are not surgically accessible or when surgery is contraindicated, which does not apply here given the accessible peripheral location and lack of contraindications to surgery [^046e6f94].

> Let me consider preoperative planning and risk mitigation. High-quality MRI with thin slices helps delineate proximal and distal tumor extent and plan the approach; intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring is advised for surgery on critical nerves to map functional fascicles and reduce iatrogenic injury; and counseling should include the possibility of transient neuropathic symptoms and the very low but real risk of persistent deficit, balanced against the high likelihood of pain relief with experienced surgeons [^a9d54563] [^29bd6ea8] [^e6d6438f].

> I should double-check the timing. Because the patient has severe, refractory pain despite optimized medical therapy, and there is no neurological deficit to suggest irreversible injury, proceeding with timely surgical resection is appropriate; delaying surgery risks chronic pain consolidation and may reduce the chance of complete symptom resolution, whereas early intervention in this setting is guideline-concordant and supported by outcomes data in peripheral nerve schwannoma surgery [^74f526ca] [^e6d6438f].

> But wait, what if the tumor is actually a neurofibroma or something else? Preoperative MRI features and, when needed, targeted ultrasound can help distinguish schwannoma from neurofibroma and other mimics; if uncertainty remains, referral to a center with peripheral nerve tumor expertise is prudent to avoid non-nerve-sparing approaches that could cause unnecessary deficits, reinforcing the importance of experienced surgical teams for this pathology [^a28be0b0] [^d2b47f7f].

> Next, I should review postoperative expectations and follow-up. With complete resection of a benign schwannoma, recurrence is rare, and most patients experience durable pain relief; a baseline postoperative MRI within a few months can document extent of resection, and clinical follow-up should monitor for pain recurrence or new neurological symptoms, with ongoing surveillance for other schwannomas per schwannomatosis protocols [^9466539f] [^8ffe1248] [^33c71fbf].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. The most appropriate next step is to proceed with microsurgical resection of the femoral nerve schwannoma by an experienced peripheral nerve surgeon, utilizing intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring and a nerve-sparing, subcapsular enucleation technique, because this aligns with guideline recommendations for early surgery in painful schwannomas without deficits, offers high likelihood of pain relief, and minimizes the risk of permanent neurological injury in expert hands [^74f526ca] [^68e2ddc8] [^29bd6ea8] [^6720f9d2] [^e6d6438f].

---

The most appropriate next step is **surgical excision** of the femoral nerve schwannoma, given severe pain refractory to conservative therapy and the absence of neurological deficits. Early surgery is recommended in schwannomatosis when pain is significant and resection can be performed without expected neurological deficit, especially with access to experienced peripheral nerve surgeons and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring [^74f526ca] [^68e2ddc8] [^29bd6ea8]. Preoperative planning should include high-resolution MRI to define anatomy, and intraoperative mapping to preserve functional fascicles; patients should be counseled on risks of transient or rare permanent deficits and the high likelihood of pain relief with complete resection [^a9d54563] [^6720f9d2] [^e6d6438f]. Radiation is not indicated for benign schwannomas in schwannomatosis due to limited efficacy and potential harm [^046e6f94].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

According to the ERN GENTURIS guidelines, **early surgical intervention** is recommended for patients with schwannomatosis who have painful schwannomas, provided that surgery can be performed without causing neurological deficits [^74f526ca]. This recommendation is based on the following considerations:

- **Pain relief**: Surgery is the most effective modality for achieving durable pain relief in patients with painful schwannomas [^e6d6438f].

- **Functional preservation**: Given the absence of neurological deficits in this patient, there is a high likelihood of preserving nerve function postoperatively [^6720f9d2].

- **Avoidance of repeated surgeries**: The guidelines caution against repeated surgeries in the same symptomatic area if previous interventions fail to provide pain relief, as repeated surgeries may exacerbate pain and worsen the schwannomatosis pain syndrome [^359fdb04].

---

## Surgical technique and intraoperative considerations

Microsurgical resection with **nerve-sparing techniques** is the standard of care for peripheral nerve schwannomas [^6720f9d2]. Key intraoperative considerations include:

- **Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring**: Essential for identifying and preserving functional nerve fibers during tumor resection, particularly in critical nerves such as the femoral nerve [^29bd6ea8].

- **Microsurgical dissection**: Circumferential dissection, epineurial incision, and subcapsular enucleation of the tumor while preserving viable nerve fascicles [^6720f9d2].

- **Hemostasis**: Meticulous hemostasis to minimize postoperative complications and facilitate clear visualization of neural structures [^3e00bf8a].

---

## Risks and benefits of surgical intervention

The primary benefit of surgical intervention is **significant pain relief**, with complete pain resolution reported in the majority of patients undergoing nerve-sparing resection of peripheral nerve schwannomas [^e6d6438f]. Potential risks include:

- **Transient neurological deficits**: Commonly reported but typically resolve within weeks to months postoperatively [^notfound].

- **Permanent neurological deficits**: Rare, occurring in approximately 10–15% of cases, particularly when tumors are intimately adherent to critical nerve structures [^3e00bf8a].

- **Recurrence**: Rare after complete resection, with recurrence rates typically less than 5% [^notfound].

---

## Alternative treatment options

Conservative management, including pharmacological therapy and physical therapy, has already been attempted in this patient without significant benefit. Radiation therapy is **not recommended** for benign schwannomas in schwannomatosis due to limited efficacy and potential risks, including malignant transformation [^046e6f94].

---

## Preoperative planning and patient counseling

Preoperative planning should include **high-resolution MRI** to accurately delineate tumor anatomy and its relationship to the femoral nerve [^a9d54563]. Patient counseling should address the following:

- **Expected outcomes**: High likelihood of significant pain relief and low risk of permanent neurological deficits given the absence of preoperative deficits [^e6d6438f].

- **Potential risks**: Transient neurological deficits, rare permanent deficits, and low recurrence risk [^3e00bf8a].

- **Postoperative care**: Expectations for recovery, rehabilitation, and follow-up imaging to monitor for recurrence [^8ffe1248].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given the patient's severe pain refractory to conservative management, the absence of neurological deficits, and access to experienced peripheral nerve surgeons and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring, **surgical excision of the femoral nerve schwannoma is the most appropriate next step**. This approach aligns with current guidelines and offers the highest likelihood of durable pain relief while preserving nerve function [^74f526ca] [^68e2ddc8].

We report a very rare case of giant schwannomas of the sciatic nerve in a 39-year-old woman who presented with increasing swelling and discomfort in the posterior aspect of her right thigh. We demonstrate that even with such large tumours, surgical excision could be successfully carried out to resolve all symptoms while causing no permanent nerve damage. It remains paramount that large soft tissue tumours get referred to a sarcoma centre and be managed by a specialist multidisciplinary team.

### Operative steps in management of benign nerve sheath tumors [^3e00bf8a]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors include the neurofibroma, schwannoma, and their plexiform variants. Operative management begins with an assessment of the relative risks associated with surgery compared with observation. The risks of observation include the risk of malignancy, the progression of symptoms, risk of delayed surgery, and ongoing patient suffering. The risks of surgery include anesthetic problems, wound complications, and neurological injury. New neurological deficits have been reported to occur in approximately 10 to 15% of surgically treated cases. In general, surgery is recommended for symptomatic or progressive lesions. Although the surgical approach will vary depending on the location, type, and extent of tumor, adherence to certain principles will facilitate success. Adequate visualization and successful removal will be achieved with detailed anatomical knowledge, an adequate extensile exposure to visualize the proximal and distal tumor extent, circumferential dissection of the tumor, microsurgical dissection under appropriate magnification, and meticulous hemostasis throughout the procedure.

### A retroperitoneal femoral nerve schwannoma as a cause of chronic pelvic pain [^00e326cd]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

This is a case report of pelvic pain caused by a large retroperitoneal femoral nerve schwannoma. A 31-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 2, was referred for surgical treatment of her chronic right lower quadrant pain. Laparoscopy revealed normal pelvic anatomy and a 7- x 5-cm mass overlying the right psoas muscle and involving the right femoral nerve. A combination of laparoscopic and laparotomy dissection allowed complete excision of the mass. Pathological analysis of the mass revealed a benign schwannoma of the femoral nerve sheath. Transient right femoral neuropathy complicated her postoperative course. Nongynecologic causes of pelvic pain are common and may include neurologically derived causes. Retroperitoneal schwannomas are uncommon and occur in about 0.5% of schwannomas. Complete surgical excision is recommended and results in an excellent cure rate.

### Schwannomas: experience from a single center reference in Peru (...) [^b747cf86]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract e14043 Background: Schwannomas are nerve sheath tumors that originate in Schwann cells. They are usually solitary and sporadic and manifest on peripheral, spinal or cranial nerves. It is the most common type of benign peripheral nerve tumor in adults. These tumors represent a diagnostic challenge due to their rarity and difficult differential diagnosis. Our objective was to determine the clinical and pathological characteristics, as well as the therapeutic management of patients with Schwannoma admitted to our institution over a period of time. Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional and descriptive study was carried out on the cases of patients with Schwannoma over 14 years of age, diagnosed at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases from 2009 to 2023. Medical records and pathology reports were reviewed. Results: A total of 225 patients were diagnosed with schwannoma on anatomopathology. Median age was 44 years, with a range of 15 to 92 years.

135 patients were female and 90 male, with a ratio of 1. 5:
1. 19 patients had a second cancer before or after the diagnosis of schwannoma. 6 patients were previously diagnosed with neurofibromatosis. According to anatomical origin: 27 patients had schwanommas of the abdominal region, 36 of the head and neck, 42 of the spinal cord, 17 of the extremities, 83 of the intracranial region and 20 of the thorax. At the intracranial level, 71 patients had location at the cerebellopontine angle, 5 at the orbital level, 2 at the level of the cerebellum and 5 in another location. At the abdominal level, 13 patients had a retroperitoneal location, 8 at the gastric level, 2 at the renal level and 4 in another location. In 130 patients we can obtain the ki67, median score was 2%. Regarding treatment, 156 patients underwent surgery, and 42 patients received radiation treatment.

During their follow-up, only 5 patients had local recurrence. Conclusions: Schwannomas are rare benign tumors. In many cases, its suspected diagnosis is difficult due to its similarity to other tumors that must be part of the differential diagnosis. Its treatment is surgical, with the objective of complete macroscopic resection. Radiotherapy is a complementary treatment in case of residual disease.

### Obturator nerve transfer as an option for femoral nerve repair: case report [^3edecab8]. Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Nerve transfers have proved to be an important addition to the armamentarium in the repair of brachial plexus lesions, but have been used sparingly for lower extremity nerve repair. Here, we present what is believed to be the first description of a successful transfer of the obturator nerve to the femoral nerve.

Clinical Presentation

A 45-year-old woman presented with a complete femoral nerve lesion after removal of a large (15-cm) schwannoma of the retroperitoneum involving the lumbar plexus.

Intervention

The obturator nerve was transferred to the distal stump of the femoral nerve in the retroperitoneal space at the inguinal ligament three months post-injury. At 2 years post-repair, the patient demonstrated 4 out of 5 return (Medical Research Council grade) of quadriceps function and was able to walk nearly normally.

Conclusion

In cases in which there are extensive gaps in the femoral nerve, transfer of the obturator nerve provides an option to traditional nerve graft repair.

### Patient-guided peripheral nerve exploration for the management of chronic localized pain [^13ae7618]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

This technique represents a surgical adjunct for the management of chronic, localized pain in patients who continue to have pain despite exhaustive prior evaluation and treatment. The patient-guided approach was used in 10 patients referred with "intractable pain" and yielded good to excellent results in all but one patient. When applied selectively to cases with significantly distorted anatomy or previous failed interventions, this simple technique can minimize dissection and unnecessary resection, while offering relief to a patient population otherwise resigned to a life with chronic pain.

### The art of management decision making: from intuition to evidence-based medicine [^863fa75c]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

This article summarizes available evidence on various management options for vestibular schwannoma as they relate to the decision-making strategies used in selection. After a brief consideration of individual options, the literature directly comparing two or more management options is examined, noting the level of evidence supporting their claims. A discussion of the strategies developed to guide decision making follows. The article closes with a summary of the evidence-based findings and suggestions for further research. The focus is on management of sporadic, unilateral vestibular schwannomas, because patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 pose different management problems best discussed separately.

### Evidence-based approach to timing of nerve surgery: a review [^59b5133c]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Crisis scenarios can be a catalyst but are not the focus of discussions surrounding optimal treatment algorithms. Timing decisions are always critical to patient outcomes and are made by surgeons daily, regardless external circumstances. Although the current literature remains limited in many situations, the authors believe this review serves as a suitably condensed resource to allow surgeons to make educated assessments for individual patients with any type of nerve pathology. Although further investigation will be necessary to parse out nuances in clinical decision making, the authors believe that these data will allow physicians to better advocate for patients regarding the timing of nerve procedures and may ultimately lead to more optimal outcomes.

### Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors: an interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic challenge [^a28be0b0]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Tumors of peripheral nerves are commonly benign and can be removed without functional deficits in most cases. However, there is a high risk of initial misdiagnosis due to their rarity leading to a consecutive mistreatment with potential severe consequences. Therefore, treating disciplines have to keep these rare differential diagnoses in mind. Treatment should be performed only at a specialized center.

### Vestibular schwannomas | NEJM resident 360 (...) [^6480847d]. resident360.nejm.org (2021). Medium credibility.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published April 7, 2021 Widespread access to sensitive neurodiagnostic imaging has led to a notable rise in the detection of vestibular schwannomas; an increasing proportion of cases are diagnosed, often incidentally, when the tumor is small and the patient is at an advanced age. Read the NEJM Review Article here. Clinical Pearls Q: What are the most common presenting symptoms of vestibular schwannoma. A: Sporadic unilateral vestibular schwannomas account for more than 95% of cases. The most common presenting symptoms encompass ipsilateral sensorineural hearing loss in more than 90% of patients, dizziness or imbalance in up to 61%, and asymmetric tinnitus in 55%. There is a limited association between tumor size and the severity of hearing loss, tinnitus, or dizziness at diagnosis, and symptom progression is not strongly correlated with tumor growth. Q: How is vestibular schwannoma diagnosed.

A: Thin-slice, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the head is the standard diagnostic approach for the detection of vestibular schwannomas as small as 2 mm in diameter. Features seen on imaging are highly sensitive and specific, resulting in an accurate radiologic diagnosis in most cases, without the need for a confirmatory biopsy. A: Treatment strategies can be divided into an observational wait-and-scan approach, irradiation, microsurgery, and a combination of these methods. To date, there is no high-level evidence indicating that one treatment approach is unequivocally superior to others. Typically, tumors that have a maximal diameter of less than 1. 5 cm in the cerebellopontine angle are considered for a wait-and-scan approach. Given the unpredictable nature of tumor growth and the capacity for saltatory or delayed growth, lifelong follow-up is recommended.

The aim of radiosurgery for a schwannoma is to prevent tumor growth; treatment does not confer a radiographic cure, and the tumor will be visible indefinitely on MRI. Tumors that are less than 2. 5 cm are preferred in order to minimize the risk of radiation-induced brain-stem edema, trigeminal neuropathy or neuralgia, and hydrocephalus, as well as diminished long-term tumor control. Microsurgical resection can be performed on tumors of all sizes and is the treatment of choice for large tumors associated with symptomatic brain-stem compression, hydrocephalus, trigeminal neuralgia or neuropathy, or a combination of these complications. Microsurgery is generally preferred for the treatment of tumors that are larger than 3 cm in diameter.

However, in the absence of high-level evidence to inform decision making, there are multiple reasonable treatment options for most patients with small or medium-size vestibular schwannomas, including the wait-and-scan approach, radiosurgery, and microsurgery. As such, patient preference plays a major role in shared decision making. A: An important ramification of increased disease detection is a potential for overtreatment, which could result in unnecessary complications and health care expenditures. Many patients, who just decades ago would have lived out their lives without having their tumors detected, are now receiving treatment. Though the proportion of cases initially managed with a wait-and-scan strategy is higher than ever before, paradoxically, the total number of vestibular schwannomas per population that are treated with irradiation and microsurgery is probably greater today than in prior decades.

### Surgical neuropelveology: laparoscopic nerve-sparing excision of a pelvic schwannoma [^03dfd34a]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To show how advanced pelvic Schwannoma can be safely managed with a laparoscopic approach.

Design

Demonstration of the laparoscopic technique with narrated video footage.

Setting

Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from well-differentiated Schwann cells (glial cells) of peripheral nerve sheaths. Schwannomas are nonaggressive, slow-growing, solitary masses with a low rate of malignant transformation and a low risk of recurrence after resection. They rarely occur in the pelvis, with a reported incidence of 1% to 3%. Tumors involving spinal nerve roots commonly present with radicular pain and nerve compression syndromes (Supplemental Video 1-3). This video shows the management of pelvic Schwannoma originating from the left sacral root S1 by a minimally invasive approach.

Interventions

Laparoscopic nerve-sparing excision of a pelvic Schwannoma.

Conclusion

Historically, pelvic schwannomas have been managed mainly by laparotomy. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and safety of a large pelvic Schwannoma excision by a minimally invasive approach.

### Surgical management of sporadic and schwannomatosis-associated pelvic schwannomas [^e6d6438f]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Pelvic schwannomas are rare tumors that may occur either sporadically or in the context of schwannomatosis. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients harboring a pelvic schwannoma under conservative management or operated at our reference center between 2016 and 2023. All patients were operated by a multidisciplinary team, combining a vascular surgeon and a neurosurgeon. Twenty-four patients harboring 33 pelvic tumors were included in the cohort, including 12 patients with sporadic lesions, 2 patients with NF2-related schwannomatosis, and 10 patients with NF2-independent schwannomatosis. Multi-nodular tumors were more frequent in schwannomatosis compared to sporadic cases (p=0.005). The mean age at diagnosis was 41 years old. Schwannomas were located on branches of the sciatic nerve (23/33, 70%), the femoral nerve (6/33, 18%), and the obturator nerve (4/33, 12%). Over the course of the study, 16 patients were operated, including 11 sporadic cases. The indication for surgery was pain (12/16, 75%) or tumor growth (4/16, 25%). Complete resection was achieved in 14 of 16 patients (87%). The mean post-operative follow-up was 37 months (range: 2-168 months). At last-follow-up, complete pain relief was achieved in all 12 patients with pre-operative pain. Post-operative morbidity included 3 long-term localized numbness and one MRC class 4 motor deficit in a multi-nodular tumor in a schwannomatosis patient. Despite its limited size, our series suggests that nerve-sparing resection of pelvic schwannomas offers satisfying rates of functional outcome both in sporadic and schwannomatosis cases, except for multi-nodular tumors.

### Peripheral nerve tumors: management strategies and molecular insights [^f97062d7]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Because of its relative rarity and a wide variety of clinical manifestations, peripheral nerve tumors (PNTs) often present to specialists from widely different disciplines, thus often resulting in delayed diagnosis and a non-cohesive pattern of management. Critical appraisal of the history and physical examination followed by radiological investigations, by experienced medical personnel, ultimately suggests that the extremity mass is perhaps a PNT, rather than the wide variety and more common soft tissue tumors. Included in this appraisal is a search for a pre-disposition syndrome, the most common of which are neurofibromatosis-1 and -2 (NF1, NF2) and schwannomatosis, which may require life-long careful follow up. Intra-operative and post-operative management decisions in a multidisciplinary manner with knowledge of the biological, pathological and clinical behavior of the PNT, is of utmost importance. In the context of pre-disposition syndromes, where multiple tumors may exist along with other nervous system lesions, molecular biological insights and hopefully the biological therapies that stem from this knowledge are of interest. In this article the spectrum of PNTs and their management protocols, including the algorithm for treatment of malignant PNTs advocated by our institute, are presented and currently available genetic insights and probable role of experimental therapies are briefly reviewed.

Management

Benign Nerve Sheath Tumors

Schwannomas and neurofibromas causing intolerable radicular symptoms, spinal cord compression, and myelopathy, or those demonstrating growth on imaging warrant consideration of surgical resection. Gross total resection without causing new deficits is the goal, and as schwannomas and neurofibromas are generally non-infiltrative lesions, complete resection is usually achievable and prevents recurrence. Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring should be incorporated to identify and avoid sacrificing functional nerves.Surgical series report postoperative improvement or complete recovery in 69%–78% of,,,, patients, with the best chance of improvement in lumbosacral tumors (81.53% vs. 72/73% in cervical/thoracic in one study).,, Postoperatively, MRI is again the ideal imaging modality within 2–3 months to confirm the extent of resection. Longer-term radiologic follow-up is surgeon- and institution-specific depending on the extent of resection, post-operative symptoms, and NF-1 status. In uncomplicated patients with gross total resection, follow-up of 1–5 years has been reported. Recurrence is uncommon (3%–9%) and usually occurs within 4 years of surgery. If residual tumor is present, regular repeat imaging should be performed to rule out interval growth that may prompt further treatment. The frequency should take the patient’s individual risk factors into account, with sooner imaging if new symptoms or interval radiographic changes occur.

Surveillance with clinical examination and serial MRI is reasonable for asymptomatic or incidental lesions. Natural-history studies of schwannomas suggest that most remain stable or grow slowly and may never require intervention, but a subset of faster-growing tumors warrant closer monitoring. One study reported 27.5% of 109 spinal schwannomas demonstrated 84%/year volume increase versus moderate- (26%/year) and slow-growing (7.3%/year) tumors. Another study of 42 spinal schwannomas reported an average volume increase of 5.45% annually, and their analysis suggested that tumors with more than 2.5% annual growth, termed “growing” as opposed to “stable” tumors with slower growth, warranted close follow-up. There are no consensus guidelines for the frequency or duration of imaging in isolated findings of asymptomatic benign spinal nerve sheath tumors, but at least 2 follow-up scans to assess growth rate have been suggested as a minimum.Tumors associated with genetic syndromes may behave more aggressively and should be followed with regular repeat imaging according to their individual risk factors.

### A posterior tibial nerve neurilemoma unrecognized for 10 years: case report [^f9f58da9]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Neoplasms of peripheral nerves can be obscured, especially during the early phase. The author reports a patient with a posterior tibial nerve neurilemoma (schwannoma). For a decade, the tumor was misdiagnosed as nonspecific S1 radiculopathy and psychogenic chronic pain syndrome. The patient's presentation and initial management are unique.

Clinical Presentation

A 40-year-old woman reported severe left foot and calf pain, numbness, and weakness. The symptoms were evident during three pregnancies, and they gradually progressed. The neuropathic pain was protracted, despite implantation of a dorsal column stimulator and administration of a wide variety of medications and therapies. The symptoms were unresponsive to both inpatient and outpatient treatments, which resulted in a misdiagnosis of psychogenic pain for more than a decade. Diagnostic scans obtained by computed tomography, ultrasonography, and nuclear scintigraphy confirmed a popliteal fossa mass.

Intervention

A high, large posterior tibial nerve neurilemoma was found intraoperatively, positioned just below the sciatic nerve bifurcation with extensive degenerative features and hemorrhages. Surgical resection provided immediate recovery.

Conclusion

Peripheral nerve tumors are rarely acknowledged clinical entities. Chronic unexplained foot and calf pain and a positive Tinel's sign should raise suspicion of posterior tibial nerve neurilemoma. Even in patients who have had such tumors for a decade, surgical resection remains the treatment of choice.

### Schwannoma of thigh mimicking pseudoaneurysm of the profunda femoral artery [^a86edb53]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Femoral and popliteal artery aneurysms constitute the majority of peripheral arterial aneurysms. However, aneurysm of the profunda femoral artery is highly uncommon, being mainly of traumatic and mycotic origin. Diagnosis is usually straightforward with clinical and radiological examination, and such aneurysms are only rarely misdiagnosed as tumors. We herein report a case of preoperatively diagnosed pseudoaneurysm of the profunda femoral artery that was intraoperatively found to be a soft tissue tumor and finally revealed to be a schwannoma, by pathology. Our case's unusual presentation considerably confounded both diagnosis and management, thus providing a salutary clinical lesson.

The management of peripheral nerve schwannomas associated with NF2 and SWNT is complex due to multiplicity and comorbidities, prompting for interdisciplinary care. Indication for surgery is dictated by neurological deficits, drug-resistant pain, or significant tumor progression. Utilizing principles of microsurgery and interfascicular preparation, resection as associated with a very low complication rate and excellent results concerning pain reduction. Preoperative neurological impairment and total resection rate was higher in SWNT-associated PNS.

FIGURE 1

Intraoperative view.

Schwannomas originate from Schwann cells in the nerve sheath. Schwannomas are commonly found in patients aged 20–50 yrs in the head and neck region.However, it is sporadically observed in the sciatic nerve; hence, the diagnosis might be challenging.Schwannomas typically present with an enlarging soft tissue mass, although the patient would not experience acute or radicular pain until the tumor becomes large enough to squeeze the nerve roots.Schwannomas are hard to differentiate from ganglion cysts that present with similar clinical symptoms along with cystic fluid that commonly accumulates in the adjacent articular space. In addition to locating the lesion, magnetic resonance imaging is recognized as an effective means to diagnose a schwannoma or ganglion cyst. A magnetic resonance imaging outlines the size, shape, edge, and surrounding edema of the lesion, helps understand whether the adjacent blood nerves are invaded, and aids in making an accurate diagnosis based on the changes in signal intensity.Even if the tumor capsule is fragile or adherent to surrounding tissues, surgical excision is recommended to treat a sciatic nerve schwannoma. In conclusion, an accurate differential diagnosis of a sciatic nerve schwannoma could reinforce the management of this disease and improve the patient’s prognosis.

Neurofibromatoses are a complex set of genetic diseases with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Life-threatening complications may develop as the result of tumor progression. Surgical intervention is the only effective means of treatment for progressive pain, disfigurement, functional compromise, and malignancy. In the future, molecular advances should allow for the development of targeted therapies to treat patients who have neurofibromatosis in addition to those who have sporadic tumors. Tumor profiling should allow us to guide therapies and predict responses.

### Somatic instability of the NF2 gene in schwannomatosis (...) [^87f99618]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Context Schwannomatosis is a newly described form of neurofibromatosis of unclear pathogenesis. Patient and Methods We studied the NF2 locus on chromosome 22 in 7 tumor specimens resected from a 36-year-old man with schwannomatosis of the right ulnar nerve. Conclusions Molecular analysis of tumor specimens distinguishes schwannomatosis from other forms of neurofibromatosis. Further work is needed to understand the natural history and molecular biology of this condition. SCHWANNOMAS ARE benign tumors of peripheral myelin-producing cells most commonly seen as an isolated finding in otherwise healthy individuals. The occurrence of multiple schwannomas in the same individual suggests an underlying diagnosis of neurofibromatosis. Most such patients have bilateral vestibular schwannomas and thus neurofibromatosis 2.

Recently, a small number of patients with multiple pathologically proved schwannomas without vestibular tumors were shown to have a distinct clinical entity termed schwannomatosis. 1, 2 Most cases of schwannomatosis are isolated in patients without affected family members, 2 and one third of cases of schwannomatosis. are characterized by localization of tumors to a single arm, leg, or segment of the spine. 3 The NF2 tumor suppressor is the primary tumor suppressor in sporadic and NF2-associated schwannomas, with both constitutional and somatic mutations in the latter condition. 4 Patients with schwannomatosis, like those with NF2, frequently have NF2 mutations in their tumors, 1 but the germline cause of schwannomatosis remains unknown. Analysis of multiple tumors in a single patient may be especially valuable in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder, and we present a unique opportunity to do so.

Report of a case A 36-year-old man had a 12-year history of slowly growing painful tumors on the ulnar aspect of his right forearm and hand. Family history was negative for similar tumors or other manifestations of neurofibromatosis 1 or NF2. Physical examination results revealed several smooth nodular masses extending from the cubital tunnel to the proximal phalanx of the fifth finger. Strength was normal. Sensory deficit was noted in an ulnar distribution. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right arm revealed 8 well-circumscribed lesions surrounding the right ulnar nerve. Contrast material–enhanced cranial magnetic resonance images acquired with 3-mm sections through the internal auditory canals were normal. Eight tumors were surgically resected in 2 procedures. The patient's pain resolved after tumor resection, though minimal sensory deficits remained. Histological examination by one of us demonstrated typical features of schwannoma in each tumor.

No clinical or pathological differences were seen among the 4 tumors in which we subsequently detected NF2 mutation, as compared with findings in the other 4 tumors. Loss of heterozygosity in the NF2 region was determined using the proximal marker D22S193, 2 intragenic markers, and 3 distal markers. The distance from the most centromeric marker to the most telomeric was 2. 4 megabases. Loss of heterozygosity was then determined at the pericentromeric marker D22S421 and at 6 markers spaced relatively evenly on 22q distal to the NF2 locus itself: D22S280, D22S283, D22S284, D22S274, D22S1170, and D22S1169. Microsatellite analysis revealed LOH of the same allele in the NF2 region and the proximal marker D22S421 in all 7 tumors studied. Four of 7 tumors also lost heterozygosity at all markers telomeric to the NF2 region, while 3 retained a single marker at the tip of chromosome 22.

### Evidence-based approach to timing of nerve surgery: a review [^e4ce0fd0]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

CHRONIC PAIN DUE TO NERVE INJURY-INDUCED PAINFUL NEUROMA

The term “chronic pain” can be misleading, and the need for timely surgical intervention is often mistakenly dismissed in these cases. Such delays and assumptions can lead to significant impairment and/or inability to return to work and may have even more devastating outcomes, especially if suicidal ideation is present.– Although a variety of treatment options are currently used for pain secondary to neuroma formation, most are focused on treatment of symptoms. Nonsurgical or symptomatic treatments are often unsuccessful, as they fail to address the root cause of pain. When pain persists despite reasonable treatment via supportive symptomatic modalities, surgical intervention targeting the source of the pain is indicated.

Take-Home Messages

If chronic pain persists 3 to 6 months after nerve injury, it is recommended that surgical exploration/treatment be electively scheduled, with patient goals and rate of symptom progression taken into consideration. Although the literature is unclear regarding exact timing, increased duration of symptoms has been associated with unfavorable outcomes.

If a patient presents with uncontrolled pain that is severe, progressing, or incapacitating despite nonoperative management, acute exploration/intervention should be considered. Ultimately, intervention must be determined using clinical judgment for each patient regardless of whether pain has persisted for 3 months.

After drafting recommendations amongst the GG these were subjected to a modified Delphi assessment. Delphi is a structured communication technique or method in which opinions of a large number of experts are assessed on a topic in which there is no consensus, and this was used as a consensus building exercise. Experts included in this exercise included the members of the Core Working Group, the Schwannomatosis GG, the Patient Advisory Group, as well as other (external) experts identified by the GG.

The survey existed of four rounds, in which the threshold for consensus was defined by a simple majority of the survey participants agree with the recommendation (>60% rated ‘agree’ or ‘totally agree’). Recommendations were graded using a 4-point Likert scale (totally disagree, disagree, agree, totally agree) and a justification for the given rating was obligatory. Even if consensus was met recommendations were still modified if a higher consensus was thought achievable from written responses. The facilitator of the Delphi survey provided anonymised summaries of the experts’ decisions after each round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgements. The recommendations are presented in the Table 1.

### Benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors: an interdisciplinary diagnostic and therapeutic challenge [^9466539f]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Complete resection of schwannomas is standard of care and possible without loss of function. Preservation of function must be the primary goal of surgery, especially if these benign tumors have not caused any neurological deficits before surgery. After complete, subcapsular removal of the schwannoma, recurrence is very rare.

Removal of a neurofibroma can be more challenging for the surgeon as these often do not have a clear capsule, and injury of the fascicles is more likely. This makes it even more relevant to use a consistent microsurgical technique in these procedures, supported by a surgical microscope, stimulating forceps and, the appropriate microsurgical instrumentation to avoid unnecessary postoperative neurological damage.

The treatment of perineuriomas has changed over time. A biopsy of a thickened and non-functional fascicle including an epineurotomy is more and more common, due to the slowly progressive course and the lack of delimitation. Complete removal is not recommended, as this would ultimately necessitate nerve replacement with poor neurological outcomes.

However, the correct diagnosis did not lead to sufficient therapy in several cases. In our analysis, 26.3% of the patients were treated insufficiently, or surgical treatment was not performed in the recommended manner. Treatment by an experienced nerve surgeon showed significantly lower rates of mistreatment compared with treatment by other specialists. Performing a closed biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of a benign nerve tumor should be the exception and not the norm to avoid unnecessary nerve injury.

Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors

The aggressive nature of MPNSTs demands accurate and timely tissue diagnosis if there is suspicion of malignancy.As previously discussed, MRI should be performed to characterize suspicious lesions, andFDG-PET can be useful in assessing potential malignancy. If ANNUBP or MPNST is suspected, imaged-guided needle biopsy is performed for histopathological diagnosis and guidance of the next steps. Unplanned incomplete resection of a sarcoma where malignancy is only realized upon the reporting of pathology results is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.This should be avoided with prompt referral to a sarcoma specialist center upon suspicious of a possible malignancy, and the referral should not await completion of imaging or biopsy. Indeed, some surgical reports of MPNSTs specifically have noted that radiographic misdiagnoses as benign entities are common, with 63.5% (5/8 patients) misdiagnosed on imaging in a series of craniospinal MPNSTs. A multidisciplinary team at a sarcoma center should guide management decisions, including surgical management and whether there is a role for radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or experimental treatments. En-bloc surgical resection with negative margins is the mainstay of treatment for ANNUBP and MPNSTs when possible, though this is often limited by surrounding anatomy., An MRI with gadolinium performed within 24 hours of surgery before the development of post-surgical radiographic changes is ideal for an accurate baseline assessment, though international consensus guidelines developed from a surgical perspective suggest a baseline at 2–3 months is acceptable as well. Subsequent imaging should be tailored to the patient’s individual management. Though rare, schwannomas can also undergo malignant transformation into MPNSTs, and those with aggressive radiologic or clinical features should be similarly investigated.

### Peripheral nerve schwannoma: a review of varying clinical presentations and imaging findings [^6ff8270a]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

A schwannoma or neurilemmoma is a benign, isolated, noninvasive, and encapsulated tumor originating from Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve sheath. The incidence of a schwannoma occurring in the foot and ankle is rare, with prevalence rate of 1% to 10%. Schwannomas have no sex predilection, and they commonly occur in patients in their fourth decade. Malignant transformation of benign schwannoma is unusual; however, it is important to note that malignant variants of schwannomas do exist and account for about 5% to 10% of all soft tissue sarcomas. We present 3 cases of benign schwannoma in the lower extremity. All 3 patients presented with varying clinical symptoms, including pain, paresthesia, weakness, and a palpable mass. A schwannoma was eventually diagnosed in all 3 patients. We discuss and review the known entities of peripheral nerve schwannoma and describe the clinical and imaging findings and therapeutic strategies for treating and diagnosing peripheral nerve schwannoma.

### Intrapelvic sciatic notch schwannoma: microsurgical excision using the infragluteal approach [^6332bb6d]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Benign neurogenic tumors at the sciatic notch that are purely intrapelvic have rarely been reported. Because of this tumor's particular position, a transabdominal or combined transabdominal-gluteal approach is usually used to achieve total resection. However, the transabdominal approach carries a remarkable surgical risk because of the manipulation of intraperitoneal organs. Here, the authors describe a 59-year-old woman harboring a purely intrapelvic sciatic notch schwannoma extrinsic to the sciatic nerve, which was totally removed via the infragluteal approach preserving sciatic function. The postoperative course was uneventful. The infragluteal approach can be safely used for the effective resection of intrapelvic benign neurogenic tumors at the sciatic notch that are extrinsic to the sciatic nerve, avoiding the more invasive and risky transabdominal approach.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^ffc4feae]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Sciatica can be managed both conservatively and surgically. In the Netherlands, sciatica care is organised following the stepped care principle, involving a general practitioner (GP) as gatekeeper for hospital care, and a hospital-based neurologist, before a neurosurgeon is consulted. Therefore, a chain of decisions and referrals precede surgery. Both the diagnostic process and timing of surgical treatment and the (societal) value of surgery over conservative treatment are topics of ongoing discussion, and practice variation has been widely reported.This practice variation may be driven by both differences between and within patient and provider preferences.This makes the management of sciatica of interest. Which preferences of patients and physician(s) shape these decisions?

In the Netherlands, the GP is the point of entry for non-acute health complaints. For sciatica, the GP guideline advises conservative treatment for 6–8 weeks, combining a strategy of watchful waiting, informing the patient and providing painkillers. If the patients’ complaints last longer, the GP can refer to a neurologist.Neurologists can confirm the diagnosis and might order imaging. However, the neurologists’ guideline advises against imaging, unless surgery is considered or there is doubt about underlying cause or pathology.Recent research showed that only 11% of Dutch neurologists routinely order imaging.Apart from conservative options, the neurologist can also prescribe more invasive pain treatments, usually performed by a pain team. In case of persisting complaints, the patient might be referred to a neurosurgeon or orthopaedic surgeon to consider surgery. The Dutch neurosurgery guideline advices not to perform surgery on patients with less than 8 weeks of complaints, and proposes surgery after more than 6 months of complaints without any proper improvement.In the intermediary period natural recovery could occur. Therefore, a shared decision on treatment should be pursued with the patient. A multidisciplinary guideline exists, of which the implementation faces difficulties.

### Pelvic schwannoma: robotic laparoscopic resection [^e4dfe2a3]. Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Schwannoma is a rare benign tumor of peripheral nerves arising from Schwann cells of the ubiquitous nerve sheath.

Objective

To describe the operative steps and technical aspects of robotic laparoscopic resection of pelvic schwannoma.

Methods

We describe 2 patients with pelvic schwannoma: a 34-year-old woman with schwannoma of the right lumbosacral trunk and a 58-year-old woman with schwannoma of a left S1 nerve. Pain was the main symptom in both patients. The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and nerve biopsies. Both patients were operated on by robotic laparoscopy.

Results

Lesions were totally enucleated after incising the epineurium. After dissection of the schwannoma, the vascular pedicle and nerve fascicles involved were identified, coagulated, and then sectioned. The remaining fascicles of the nerve were preserved. The postoperative course was uneventful in both patients. With follow-up of 9 and 13 months, both patients obtained complete pain relief with no neurological sequelae.

Conclusion

Robotic laparoscopic resection of pelvic nerve tumors such as schwannomas is technically feasible.

### Microsurgical resection of a common peroneal nerve schwannoma: a 3-dimensional operative video [^a2d47de8]. Operative Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Peripheral nerve sheath tumors are benign entities that manifest with pain or neurological deficits from mass effect. Treatment is mostly surgical, however, the aggressiveness of treatment needs to be carefully considered with respect to preserving function. We present a case of a 62-year-old male with a 2-year history of left lower extremity pain radiating toward the dorsolateral foot. There was a tender and palpable mass in the lateral popliteal fossa with imaging consistent with Schwannoma of the common peroneal nerve. The patient was counseled for surgery and informed consent was obtained. Microsurgical resection was undertaken and gross total resection was achieved without compromise of function. We demonstrate the placement of neurophysiological monitoring electrodes in all 3 compartment of the calf as well as the use of stimulation to identify a nonfunctioning area for entering the nerve sheath. Anatomy of the popliteal fossa and microsurgical technique for resection of nerve sheath tumors are discussed. When dealing with these pathologies, it is important to use intraoperative neurophysiology as well as careful technique in order to achieve maximal resection without compromising neurological function.

Scope of the guideline

This guideline is intended to define the optimal diagnosis, clinical management and surveillance of people with a confirmed diagnosis of schwannomatosis and has been elaborated by members of the European Reference Network (ERN) for Genetic Tumour Risk Syndromes (GENTURIS).

It aims specifically to integrate available information to assist healthcare professionals in the identification and clinical management and surveillance of people with schwannomatosis. These guidelines do not signify nor intend to be a legal standard of care, they should support clinical decision making, but never replace clinical professionals.

### Management of neurofibromatosis type 1-associated plexiform neurofibromas [^62f4c653]. Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Plexiform Neurofibromas (PN) are a common manifestation of the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These benign nerve sheath tumors often cause significant morbidity, with treatment options limited historically to surgery. There have been tremendous advances over the past two decades in our understanding of PN, and the recent regulatory approvals of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib are reshaping the landscape for PN management. At present, there is no agreed upon PN definition, diagnostic evaluation, surveillance strategy, or clear indications for when to initiate treatment and selection of treatment modality. In this review, we address these questions via consensus recommendations from a panel of multidisciplinary NF1 experts.

### ERN GENTURIS clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis, treatment, management and surveillance of people with schwannomatosis [^86c65db3]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

The ERN GENTURIS schwannomatosis Guideline Group (GG) consists of clinicians with expertise from clinical genetics, (neuro-, peripheral nerve) surgery, dermatology, anaesthesiology, neurology, radiology, and affected individuals and their representatives. The GG was led by a Core Working Group of ERN GENTURIS Healthcare Provider (HCP) Members from different Member States and who are recognised experts in specialised clinical practice in the diagnosis and management of schwannomatosis. A Patient Advisory Group was established and included 4 affected individuals that have experience with schwannomatosis.

The guideline was developed based on 237 published articles extracted from PubMed, using the following terms: schwannomatosis [title/abstract].

Additional papers were requested from experts in the field and references of all the papers were considered. Papers were included if they contained any data on diagnosis, treatment, management or surveillance of people with schwannomatosis.

As is typical for many rare diseases, the volume of peer-reviewed evidence available to consider for these guidelines was small and came from a limited number of articles, which typically reported on small samples or series. To balance the weight of both published evidence and quantify/wealth of expert experience and knowledge, we have used the following scale to grade the recommendation: (i) strong evidence: Expert consensus AND consistent evidence; (ii) moderate evidence: Expert consensus WITH inconsistent evidence AND/OR new evidence likely to support the recommendation, and (iii) weak evidence: Expert majority decision WITHOUT consistent evidence. Expert consensus (an opinion or position reached by a group as whole) or expert majority decision (an opinion or position reached by the majority of the group) is established after reviewing the results of the modified Delphi approach within the Core Working Group.

### A stepwise approach to' groin pain': a common symptom, an uncommon cause [^716ebf29]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 70-year-old man was admitted with stinging pain in his right groin radiating towards his inner thigh. In a few days, the pain increased in intensity, he experienced diminished strength in his right leg and got dependent on morphine. Conventional investigations did not show any pathology. A CT-scan revealed a mass in the obturator foramen, indicative of a possible obturator hernia or neuroma of the obturator nerve. However, an additional MRI showed a well-circumscribed cystic mass in the obturator foramen, indicative of a ganglion cyst. This cyst was percutaneously punctured under the CT-guidance and the viscous material was aspirated, after which corticosteroids were injected. After the puncture all symptoms of the patient had completely resolved and the patient was discharged from the hospital without any painkillers.

### Femoral nerve compression after migration of bone cement to the groin after hip arthroplasty [^d07389cd]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2011). Low credibility.

Although often a benign complication of total hip arthroplasty, cement extrusion can cause nerve, vessel, and organ compression. We report the case of a 70-year-old male patient in whom an extruded cement mass migrated anteriorly and compressed the femoral nerve and impinged on the femoral artery producing acute, severe groin pain with neuralgia 9 years postoperatively. Paresthesia of the anterior and medial thigh was found on examination. Radiographic, ultrasound, and computed tomographic studies confirmed a 6 × 1.5-cm mass of bone cement in the right groin compressing the femoral nerve that was removed successfully at surgery. Six months postoperatively, the patient's pain had resolved, but hyperesthesia of the medial thigh remained.

### Management of vestibular schwannoma (including NF2): facial nerve considerations [^cafc8b3d]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Current consensus on optimal treatment of vestibular schwannoma remains poorly established; treatment options include observation, stereotactic radiosurgery, microsurgical resection, medical therapy, or a combination of these. Treatment should be individualized and incorporate the multitude of patient- and tumor-specific characteristics known to affect outcome. Treatment paradigms for sporadic and neurofibromatosis type 2-related tumors are distinct and decision-making in neurofibromatosis type 2 is uniquely challenging. In all cases, treatment should maximize tumor control and minimize functional deficit.

### Chronic pain in neurofibromatosis 1, neurofibromatosis 2, and schwannomatosis: a review on epidemiology, pathophysiology, symptomatology and treatment [^615355d7]. Pain Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a group of neurogenetic disorders (including neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, and schwannomatosis) known for their tendency to induce the development of numerous nerve sheath tumors. Pain is a common symptom associated with NF, and the incidence of this pain can vary significantly, severely affecting the quality of life for many patients.

Objective

This narrative review aims to compile recent epidemiological data on NF1, NF2 and schwannomatosis, covering prevalence, incidence, and distribution across populations. It explores the disease's pathophysiology, highlighting the molecular mechanisms behind its development, and examines the diverse clinical manifestations and their impacts on patients. Additionally, the review evaluates current treatment approaches, synthesizing recent advancements to provide a comprehensive understanding. This review aims to offer researchers and health care professionals an updated perspective on managing NF effectively.

Study Design

A narrative review of peer-reviewed literature for NF, the management of its associated pain, and quality of life for patients who have the condition.

Methods

The MEDLINE and Embase databases were reviewed to identify peer-reviewed research that discussed factors relevant to NF-related pain and its management.

Limitations

This narrative review is not systematic and focuses primarily on existing literature without presenting new data.

Conclusions

While advances have been made in understanding pain associated with NF, particularly for NF1, NF2, and schwannomatosis, significant gaps in treatment and understanding remain. Future research should prioritize targeted therapies and improved pain management strategies to enhance the quality of life for NF patients.

### Pain symptomology, functional impact, and treatment of people with neurofibromatosis type 1 [^94a050d8]. Journal of Pain Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

NF1 is a lifelong medical condition in which chronic pain is a prominent feature. The current study demonstrates that individuals with NF1 report a higher incidence of pain severity and interference than observed in NF1 previous studies, with pain symptoms not localized to any specific region of the body. The lack of utilization of complementary treatments in this population needs to be further evaluated.

Rating quality of evidence and linking it to recommendations—diagnostic testing evidence for the current guidelines is retrospective and categorized using the Congress of Neurological Surgeons Guidelines Development Methodology. For diagnostic testing, class I evidence is evidence provided by one or more well-designed clinical studies of a diverse population using a “gold standard” reference test in a blinded evaluation appropriate for the diagnostic applications and enabling the assessment of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and, where applicable, likelihood ratios; class II evidence is similar to class I evidence, but with the study being conducted in restricted population; and class III evidence is evidence provided by expert opinion or studies that do not the meet the criteria for the delineation of sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and, where applicable, likelihood ratios. Class I evidence is used to support recommendations of the strongest type, defined as Level I recommendations, indicating a high degree of clinical certainty, class II supports Level II reflecting a moderate degree of clinical certainty, and class III supports Level III recommendations, reflecting unclear clinical certainty.

### Current state of spinal nerve sheath tumor management and future advances [^ad79415d]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Schwannomas

Approximately 95% of schwannomas arise spontaneously and are solitary. In contrast, multiple schwannomas are usually associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 or Schwannomatosis. These tumors can occur at any age, but peak incidence is in the 4th to 6 decades of life.Spinal schwannomas typically occur along a dorsal (sensory) spinal nerve root. The most common presenting symptoms are radicular pain and sensory symptoms in the distribution of the involved nerve, followed by motor weakness and sphincter dysfunction.If large enough, schwannomas with an intradural component can compress the spinal cord and cause symptoms of myelopathy as well. Rarely, schwannomas can occur within the spinal cord, most commonly in the cervical region.The pathophysiology of these intramedullary schwannomas remains unclear, given the absence of Schwann cells in the spinal cord. Like their intradural extramedullary counterparts, sensory disturbances are the most common presenting symptom, and sphincter dysfunction is a late sign.Schwannomas can but very rarely transform into malignant tumors.

### Surgical management of sacral schwannomas: a 21-year mayo clinic experience and comparative literature analysis [^197aaf09]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sacral and presacral schwannomas are rare, accounting for a minority of spinal schwannomas. We present our institution's experience surgically treating spinal schwannomas and compare it to the literature.

Methods

Data were collected for 27 patients treated surgically for sacral or presacral schwannoma between 1997 and 2018 at all Mayo Clinic locations and 93 patients in the literature. Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival analysis was conducted. Unpaired two-sample t tests and Fisher's exact tests assessed statistical significance between groups.

Results

Our patients and those in the literature experienced a similar age at diagnosis (49.9 y/o. vs 43.4 y/o., respectively). Most of our patients (59.3%) reported full recovery from symptoms, while a minority reported partial recovery (33.3%) and no recovery (11.1%). A smaller percentage in the literature experienced full recovery (31.9%) and partial recovery (29.8%) but also no recovery (1.1%). Our patients experienced fewer complications (14.8% versus 25.5%). Disease-free survival curves for all patients showed no significant variation in progression by extent of resection of schwannoma (log-rank P=0.26). No lesion progression was associated with full or partial symptom improvement (p=0.044), and female patients were more likely to undergo resection via a posterior approach (p=0.042).

Conclusion

Outcomes of patients with sacral or presacral schwannomas vary based on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, symptoms, and surgical treatment. Among the range of symptoms experienced by these patients, the most common is pain. Prognosis improves and overall survival is high when the surgical approach towards sacral schwannomas is prepared and executed appropriately.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines update for the role of imaging in the management of patients with vestibular schwannomas [^f02e305b]. Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for vestibular schwannoma, more specifically with respect to surveillance imaging (treated conservatively), CNS 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain imaging for vestibular schwannomas associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, similar to sporadic schwannomas, with the following considerations:

- consider adopting more frequent imaging in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients due to a more variable growth rate for vestibular schwannomas, with annual imaging once the growth rate is established

- recognize that in neurofibromatosis type 2 with bilateral vestibular schwannomas, the growth rate of a vestibular schwannoma may increase after resection of the contralateral tumor, indicating the need for more frequent imaging based on the non-operated tumor's historical rate of growth

- consider whether contrast is necessary in follow-up studies or if high-resolution T2 MRI, including CISS or FIESTA-type sequences, may adequately characterize changes in lesion size instead.

### Cascade of decisions meet personal preferences in sciatica treatment decisions [^b4f8165c]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Results

Four steps in the care process proved relevant for the clinical pathway of patients. These were uncertainty about the diagnosis, analgesia, epidural injections and surgery. Patients and physicians differed in opinion on the subjects of a certain diagnosis and analgesia. They had relatively similar opinions with respect to the different treatment options. Different options existed on the topic of surgical treatment, within both the group of patients as well as the group of physicians. A summary of the positions of patients and physicians on the four steps is presented in table 3.

Table 3 
A summary of the perspectives of patients and physicians on the four main topics

Certainty and diagnosis

After the onset of sciatica, two prominent decisions or conflicts appear, concerning (1) diagnosing sciatica and the need for MRI-imaging to confirm the diagnosis and (2) the appropriate timing for referral to the hospital. Physicians felt confident about diagnosing sciatica, although the GPs mentioned that they sometimes doubted their diagnosis. They would discuss such doubts with their patients and generally would wait to see how symptoms developed. GPs acknowledged that their first objective in patients with subjected sciatica is to help the patient through the first period of pain and restricted mobility, rather than to determine the ‘true’ diagnosis rapidly. When patients did not improve, or pushed for referral, GPs would refer to a neurologist earlier than the 6–8 weeks suggested in the guideline. However, because of waiting lists, these patients often waited a few weeks before a specialist was available, and the total duration of complaints generally exceeded 6 weeks.

Patients understood the 6–8 weeks of conservative treatment by the GP as mandatory ‘waiting time’, after which their diagnosis would be confirmed by a specialist and with an MRI scan. When a neurologist deemed the scan to be unnecessary, patients were disappointed. Physicians were conscious of such patient expectations. Some kept refusing, others gave in:

Sometimes you notice within a minute that whatever you say, it won't matter.(…)And in such cases you can say ‘according to the guideline you are not entitled to a scan’. But I am not treating the guideline, I am treating the patient. In my experience, if you do not refer such a patient for a scan, if you do not manage to get the patient to understand, and you kind of quarrel with the patient, next month you will receive information from another hospital and they'll have made the scan.

### Sciatic nerve schwannoma in the lower limb mimicking ganglion cyst [^8e1273c0]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

We present the case of a 49-yr-old woman with a 2-mo history of right lower limb pain radiating to her foot. The back of the right lower limb was touched with a jujube-like mass. On physical examination, both lower limbs were negative in the active straight leg raise test. The lower limb skin was normal but sensitive to pain, and the knee and heel tendon reflexes were normal in the neurologic examination. Ultrasound scanning revealed enlargements and effusions in the sciatic, tibial, and common peroneal nerves and hypoechoic nodules in the epineurium of the sciatic nerve, with a blood flow signal inside. A computed tomography scan with contrast revealed a significantly enhanced sciatic nerve nodule with no enhancement in the diffuse nerve bundle. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed cystic fluid displaying a water signal intensity that expanded to the tibial and common peroneal nerves, with apparent enhancement on contrast imaging; low-medium signal intensity on the T1-weighted image and high signal intensity on the T2-weighted image were observed in the lower sciatic nerve along with a thickened epineurium (Fig. 1). The patient underwent surgical resection, with the removal of a 30 × 20 × 20-mm, gray-white, encapsulated mass adhered to the peripheral nerve bundles (Fig. 2). Histopathological examination showed crowded spindle cells with palisading nuclei in Antoni A areas, supporting the diagnosis of a sciatic nerve schwannoma. At follow-up 1 mo later, the patient reported the disappearance of the radiating pain, and a magnetic resonance imaging showed no effusion in the nerve bundles and no residual tumor.

Vestibular schwannoma (VS) guideline methods—literature search and eligibility describe that the task force, in conjunction with medical librarians, conducted a search for articles published between January 1, 2015 to May 20, 2021, and two electronic databases were searched (Ovid Medline, EMBASE). Seven hundred and four citations were manually reviewed by the task force with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria; two independent reviewers reviewed and abstracted full-text data for articles meeting initial screening criteria, and inconsistencies regarding inclusion/exclusion were refereed by a third reviewer. Articles included as evidence had to investigate patients with VSs, be a full article report of a clinical study, and appear in a peer-reviewed publication or a registry report. The qualifying evidence derived from the searches was collected and compared to the evidence reported in the 2018 publication which incorporated evidence until 12/31/2014.

The patient was a 45-year-old man with a 4-year history of chronic low back pain, intensifying insidiously over the previous 8 months. On physical examination, generalized, severe low back pain was increased with all motions, with no abnormal neurologic signs. The initial physical therapy diagnosis was nonspecific low back pain; however, when the patient reported worsening symptoms at 2-week follow-up, he was advised to complete his previously scheduled magnetic resonance imaging and physician follow-up before further physical therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass at L5 consistent with benign nerve sheath tumor.

### Two interesting cases of meralgia paraesthetica [^23d397a2]. Pain Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Meralgia paraesthetica (MP) is a condition originally described by Bernhardt in 1878 and was eventually named by Roth in 1895. It is caused by compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN) resulting in varying types of discomfort. Severity of the symptoms can range from mildly uncomfortable to painfully disabling. In this article we discuss 2 patients with a LFCN injury occurring as a result of laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR). The first patient is a 46-year-old female who reported pain and dysesthesia in the left groin and the anterolateral thigh, 2 days post LCR. A conservative approach was taken and at the 6-month follow-up the symptoms had resolved. The second patient is a 51-year-old female who reported increased sensitivity to bed sheets over the anterolateral aspect of her left thigh, in the immediate post-operative period following LVR. She was similarly managed conservatively but her symptoms persisted. The LFCN arises from the dorsal branches of the second and third lumbar roots. It crosses the iliacus muscle deep to the fascia. Injury or entrapment to surrounding neural structures including the LFCN, commonly results following common laparoscopic procedures. In some cases, additional surgical intervention is required for successful management of the symptoms. In our patients, the MP syndrome was clearly related to the operation because symptoms appeared in the immediate post-operative period and were not present beforehand. LVR is a relatively new and evolving procedure with few reports of associated peri-operative complications.Key words: Meralgia paraesthetica, laparoscopy, rectopexy, lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.

### Schwannoma of the facial nerve: indications for surgical treatment [^99b84a06]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

There is no preoperative diagnostic modality that can identify facial nerve schwannoma with certainty. Difficulty in locating the facial nerve intraoperatively raises suspicion of a neurogenous tumor of the facial nerve, and this may prevent unnecessary damage to the nerve. Not every facial nerve schwannoma should be resected.

### Differential diagnosis of intramuscular schwannoma of the craniocervical region [^695fd042]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Schwannomas in the head and neck are a relatively common condition. However, intramuscular schwannomas in the craniocervical region are extremely rare. The preoperative consideration of schwannomas is very important to preserve adjacent circulation and nerve function during the surgery in this area. Moreover, the treatment and preoperative evaluation of this condition is not firmly established in the past literatures. The authors successfully managed the intramuscular schwannoma in the craniocervical region, and provide the differential diagnoses with appropriate treatments.

### Management of neurofibromatosis type 2 and schwannomatosis associated peripheral and intraspinal schwannomas: influence of surgery, genetics, and localization [^149fccc5]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition, the exact influence of the detailed resection extent needs to be further investigated within MRI- and or ultrasound-based volumetric studies. For the current study, MRI datasets are insufficient because superficial lesions, in particular, were predominantly examined by ultrasound. Measurement by volumetry requires a prospective study protocol, which is not given for the current retrospective data set but our group is currently in the process of designing such a study.The association between the genetic status on the surgical outcome of resected peripheral nerve schwannomas has not yet been reported in the literature.

Genotype–phenotype correlations are well studied and confirmed in NF2, contrary to SWNT. However, the influence of genetics on the outcome of therapy has not yet been adequately elucidated. An association is suspected, but case numbers are too small, as in the presented cohort, and mosaic cases, in particular, should be re-examined using next-generation sequencing. Postulated is a higher mutation rate than previously demonstrated. In particular, the genetic diagnosis of schwannomatosis is not yet fully developed. In addition, a clear distinguishment between mosaic NF2 and SWNT cases is not often possible.

### Nonoperative treatment of an interosseous ganglion cyst [^aeaeac9b]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Ganglion cysts of the knee are being reported more frequently secondary to an increased rate of magnetic resonance imaging studies. Although knee pain is the impetus for imaging, ganglion cysts are often incidental findings. Nonoperative treatment is a successful therapeutic option. We report a patient with variable pain presentations over the course of her treatment. The pattern of complaints pointed to different primary etiologies about the knee, but all were common to an interosseous ganglion cyst. A stepwise assessment and expansion of the differential diagnosis allowed for appropriate utilization of modalities and limited morbidity with nonoperative therapy.

### Intraneural perineurioma of the median nerve: case report and literature review [^76f61e66]. Hand (2010). Low credibility.

Intraneural perineurioma is a benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor of perineurial cell origin. We present the case of an intraneural perineurioma of the median nerve in a 23-year-old woman which posed a diagnostic challenge. Ultrasonography was found to be a quick, easy, and effective screening tool for identifying the source of the deficit followed by MRI to further elucidate the lesion. We discuss surgical management options for optimizing functional outcomes when addressing such lesions.

### Nerve sheath tumor surgery: case-guided discussion of ambiguous findings, appropriateness of removal, repeated surgery, and nerve repairs [^b0846762]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

In this article the authors attempt to raise awareness of the pitfalls and controversial issues in nerve tumor surgery. In a case-guided format, examples of ambiguous findings, inappropriate tumor removal, repeated surgery, and nerve repairs are provided. The authors also discuss the need to establish a correct diagnosis preoperatively and to avoid the erroneous identification of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). They emphasize that not all of the principles of soft tissue sarcoma treatment protocols are applicable to MPNST. A situation of repeated surgery for supposedly malignant tumor is described, and an outline of the indications for, and an approach to, repair after lesion removal is given.

These slow-growing and benign tumors typically arise from intercostal nerves and are supplied by intercostal arteries, which may increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications with surgical resection. Due to the rarity of intercostal schwannomas, there exists no standardized management algorithms. Pre-operative angiography and embolization can supplement surgical thoracotomy and resection by decreasing intra-operative hemorrhage and minimizing the risk of anterior spinal cord hypoperfusion.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guideline on the role of radiosurgery (stereotactic radiosurgery) and radiation therapy in the management of patients with vestibular schwannomas: updates [^acde1c4c]. Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for vestibular schwannoma, more specifically with respect to surveillance imaging (treated with radiosurgery), CNS 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain follow-up imaging at intervals after stereotactic radiosurgery based on clinical indications, patient circumstances, or institutional protocols. Obtain long-term follow-up with serial MRI to evaluate for recurrence.

### Screening trial for pain relief in schwannomatosis, STARFISH trial (...) [^441dd862]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Screening Trial for Pain Relief in Schwannomatosis, STARFISH Trial This phase II STARFISH screening and multi-sub study trial is being done to test the safety, pain responses, and pharmacodynamic activity of multiple experimental therapies simultaneously in patients with schwannomatosis and moderate-to-severe pain. Patients with SWN overwhelmingly present with intractable pain. The etiology of pain in SWN remains poorly understood, and there are no effective therapies that relieve SWN-related pain. Therefore, developing a platform to study tumor-induced pain and identify novel strategies that relieve pain in patients with SWN is a significant unmet need. Siltuximab acts by blocking the activity of growth pathways and inflammation in tumors. Because tumors need these signals to grow, siltuximab may slow or reverse the growth of the tumors that develop in people with schwannomatosis.

Inclusion Criteria
- MASTER: Patients must have a confirmed diagnosis of schwannomatosis by fulfilling diagnostic criteria
- MASTER: A diagnosis of SMARCB1-SWN can be made when an individual meets one of the following criteria: At least one pathologically confirmed schwannoma or hybrid nerve sheath tumor AND a SMARCB1 pathogenic variant in an unaffected tissue such as blood. A shared SMARCB1 pathogenic variant in two schwannomas or hybrid nerve sheath tumors.
- MASTER: A diagnosis of LZTR1-SWN can be made when an individual meets one of the following criteria: At least one pathologically confirmed schwannoma or hybrid nerve sheath tumor AND an LZTR1 pathogenic variant in an unaffected tissue such as blood. A shared LZTR1 pathogenic variant in two schwannomas or hybrid nerve sheath tumors.
- MASTER: A diagnosis of 22q-related schwannomatosis can be made when an individual does not meet criteria for NF2-related schwannomatosis, SMARCB1-related schwannomatosis, or LTZR1-related schwannomatosis, does not have a germline DGCR8 pathogenic variant and has both of the following molecular features: Loss of heterozygosity of the same chromosome 22q markers in two anatomically distinct schwannomas or hybrid nerve sheath tumors AND. A different NF2 pathogenic variant in each tumor which cannot be detected in unaffected tissue.
- MASTER: A clinical diagnosis of schwannomatosis-not elsewhere classified is confirmed if the following criteria are met: Presence of two or more lesions on appropriate imaging consistent with non-intradermal schwannomas, AND Pathologic confirmation of at least one schwannoma or hybrid nerve sheath tumor.
- MASTER: A clinical diagnosis of schwannomatosis-not elsewhere classified is made if a person fulfills criteria for SWN-NOS AND genetic testing of unaffected tissue and at least 2 anatomically distinct tumors does not reveal a pathogenic variant in known schwannomatosis-related genes.
- SILTUXIMAB ARM: Subject must have moderate to severe pain secondary to schwannomatosis, defined as having a median Numeric Rating scale-11 score ≥ 5 during screening
- SILTUXIMAB ARM: Subject must have insufficient response to, intolerance of, be unwilling to try, or contraindication to medical therapies for SWN-related pain, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs therapy, opioid treatment, or neuropathic pain medications.
- SILTUXIMAB ARM: Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL and < 17 g/dL.
- SILTUXIMAB ARM: Female subjects of childbearing potential and at risk for pregnancy (e. g.

### Increasing the specificity of diagnostic criteria for schwannomatosis [^366b88b5]. Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for schwannomatosis have been proposed in a recent consensus statement. These criteria permit schwannomatosis to be distinguished from neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) in most patients, but there is some clinical overlap between the two diseases. In this study, the authors use data from the population-based United Kingdom NF2 Registry to recommend modifications that increase the specificity of the schwannomatosis diagnostic criteria.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines update for the role of imaging in the management of patients with vestibular schwannomas [^88b7329c]. Neurosurgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for vestibular schwannoma, more specifically with respect to surveillance imaging (treated with surgery), CNS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining postoperative MRI in patients receiving gross total resection to document the surgical impression, which may occur as late as 1 year after surgery. Consider obtaining more frequent surveillance in patients not receiving gross total resection; annual MRI scans may be reasonable for 5 years. Adjust imaging follow-up accordingly for continued surveillance if any change in nodular enhancement is demonstrated.

### A brief history of surgery for peripheral nerve sheath tumors [^3cb363e3]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

The authors present a brief and selective history of surgery for peripheral nerve tumors to illustrate how the current understanding of the nature of disease influences the choice of surgical intervention. There was very little understanding of the anatomy and function of peripheral nerves in ancient times; consequently, surgical treatments for peripheral nerve tumors were based on the writings of authorities. The confusion between traumatic neuromas and genuine nerve sheath tumors coupled with the belief that manipulation of a peripheral nerve might be lethal to the patient stifled the development of surgical techniques for the management of nerve tumors in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was not until the 20th century, with an increased understanding of the microscopic anatomy of nerve sheath tumors, that efficacious surgical treatments for these diseases were developed. Continued advances in the understanding of the biology of these tumors will continue to impact their surgical management.
