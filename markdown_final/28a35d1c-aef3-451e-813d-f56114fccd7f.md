## Question

Fentanyl withdrawal treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat and manage fentanyl withdrawal. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the unique pharmacology of fentanyl and how it alters withdrawal kinetics and precipitated withdrawal risk. Then, I should verify the evidence-based foundation for withdrawal management and the principle that detoxification alone is inadequate. Next, I will examine methadone-based strategies, including dose, titration, and inpatient protocols. After that, I need to analyze buprenorphine initiation challenges, including precipitated withdrawal, timing, and dose optimization. I will then consider emerging strategies such as low-dose initiation, high-dose buprenorphine, and extended-release formulations. I should also review adjunctive and alternative inpatient options, including short-acting full agonists and dexmedetomidine. Finally, I will integrate special populations, monitoring and safety, and a practical decision framework, while double-checking areas of uncertainty and noting where evidence is evolving or limited [^115pim5J] [^114th8zu] [^112AEEHY].

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and its pharmacologic basis. Fentanyl's high potency, short duration of action, and pronounced lipophilicity drive frequent redosing and deep tissue accumulation, which can prolong withdrawal and increase the risk of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal even after seemingly adequate abstinence, with case series and cohort data showing measurable precipitated withdrawal in a minority of ED and hospitalized patients using fentanyl, particularly with higher body mass index and higher urine fentanyl concentrations, supporting the bioaccumulation hypothesis [^115PmRXY] [^115fHRry] [^117YEu7R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about management without anchoring the evidence base. I need to ensure that the foundation remains methadone or buprenorphine for withdrawal management, with explicit counseling that withdrawal management alone is not treatment for opioid use disorder and that ongoing maintenance with psychosocial support is the standard of care, given the elevated risk of relapse and overdose after detoxification without maintenance therapy [^115pim5J] [^114th8zu] [^116RXS8N].

> Next, I should review methadone-based strategies, since methadone's full mu-agonism avoids precipitated withdrawal and can be initiated before overt withdrawal. Wait, let me verify the dosing guidance: traditional initiation at 20–30 mg with cautious titration every 3–5 days is conservative and may be insufficient for fentanyl-tolerant patients; emerging practice includes initiation at 30 mg with faster titration by 10–15 mg every 3–5 days, and case series describe achieving 80 mg within the first week for patients using fentanyl, while inpatient protocols increasingly employ rapid methadone titration to stabilize severe withdrawal, all with close monitoring for sedation and QTc effects [^113fUJtB] [^114eFnVb] [^116WYcKD] [^112fmE2d].

> I will now examine buprenorphine initiation, where precipitated withdrawal risk is the key constraint. I should confirm timing: for fentanyl, many clinicians wait for at least moderate withdrawal with COWS around 13 or higher given fentanyl's long effective half-life and tissue sequestration, though evidence is limited; standard initial dosing of 2–4 mg sublingual with titration to 4–16 mg in the first day is typical, but higher maintenance doses may be needed in the fentanyl era, with observational data suggesting improved retention at 24 mg compared with 16 mg, a dose historically derived from pre-fentanyl studies [^113JpPeS] [^113LmRhK] [^1125RiSV] [^11479HKD].

> But wait, what if traditional initiation fails due to precipitated withdrawal or fear of it. Let me consider emerging buprenorphine strategies. Low-dose initiation with overlapping full agonist use, sometimes called the Bernese method, can mitigate precipitated withdrawal risk, though retention benefits are not yet definitive; high-dose initiation has observational support for reducing precipitated withdrawal and improving retention in some settings, and extended-release injectable buprenorphine offers a path to rapid initiation with sustained levels, with a recent randomized trial showing higher retention with rapid induction onto extended-release buprenorphine, particularly among fentanyl-positive participants, and FDA labeling updates now support single-day initiation pathways for certain long-acting products [^113Uxsce] [^111d4Fvd] [^113bKH1E] [^111SezBz].

> I need to check inpatient alternatives when methadone or buprenorphine alone are insufficient in the acute setting. Short-acting full agonist opioids such as oxycodone or hydromorphone can be used as adjuncts to control breakthrough withdrawal, with observational data showing inverse correlation between morphine-equivalent doses and COWS and relatively low rates of serious adverse events when protocols are in place; in refractory cases, IV fentanyl itself has been used in monitored settings, though with notable opioid toxicity events, underscoring the need for careful dosing and monitoring; and for severe autonomic dysregulation, especially with suspected xylazine or medetomidine co-exposure, dexmedetomidine has been effective when standard opioid withdrawal regimens fail [^115uodVd] [^111vwuZy] [^115fcwaM] [^115vChHR].

> Let me think about special populations and settings. In pregnancy, I should confirm that buprenorphine initiation timing follows the same principle of waiting for objective withdrawal, with hospitalization considered in the third trimester, and that dose adjustments are similar to nonpregnant patients; in correctional settings, I need to ensure protocols account for fentanyl contamination and the possibility of unrecognized opioid exposure; and in adolescents and young adults, initiation principles remain the same, with attention to developmental context and linkage to ongoing care [^117Sdi64] [^112WXEdA] [^117KyBDM].

> I should double-check monitoring and safety elements that cut across strategies. Objective withdrawal scoring with COWS guides initiation timing and titration, though I must remember COWS alone may not fully predict precipitated withdrawal risk in fentanyl users; urine drug testing can contextualize fentanyl exposure and support risk stratification; and overdose risk is highest in the first month after initiation or discharge, so naloxone distribution, education, and linkage to care are essential, with particular vigilance for respiratory depression when combining opioids with benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants [^113JpPeS] [^115PmRXY] [^114eFnVb] [^116R3pKv].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework and verify it aligns with evidence. For patients using fentanyl with high risk of precipitated withdrawal or preference to avoid it, methadone is a reasonable first choice given full agonism and the feasibility of inpatient initiation; for those preferring buprenorphine, consider extended-release rapid induction or low-dose initiation with overlap, recognizing that traditional initiation remains appropriate for many and that higher maintenance doses may be needed; in all cases, plan for maintenance therapy and psychosocial support rather than detoxification alone, and adapt inpatient protocols to include adjunctive short-acting agonists when withdrawal remains refractory despite best practices [^115pim5J] [^113bKH1E] [^113Uxsce] [^114th8zu].

> Hold on, I should verify areas of uncertainty and note them transparently. Evidence for high-dose buprenorphine initiation is largely observational and heterogeneous, so randomized trials are needed; low-dose initiation shows promise but has not consistently translated into improved retention; and while short-acting full agonist adjuncts are increasingly used in hospitals, formal guidance remains limited and implementation requires institutional protocols and addiction consultation when available [^111d4Fvd] [^113Uxsce] [^1168i3rT].

> Finally, let me synthesize the clinical implications. Fentanyl's pharmacology necessitates higher starting doses and faster titration for methadone, more cautious timing and potentially higher maintenance doses for buprenorphine, and a lower threshold to use inpatient or ED-initiated strategies that reduce time spent in withdrawal and facilitate linkage to care; throughout, I need to ensure patient-centered, harm-reduction oriented care, anticipate and manage precipitated withdrawal when it occurs, and prioritize initiation of maintenance treatment to reduce overdose risk and improve long-term outcomes [^112AEEHY] [^115pim5J] [^114th8zu].

Fentanyl withdrawal treatment centers on **methadone or buprenorphine** as first-line therapies, with methadone preferred for fentanyl-tolerant patients due to its full agonism and lower risk of precipitated withdrawal [^114th8zu] [^116mp8ZM]. Buprenorphine should be started only when patients are in **objective withdrawal** (COWS ≥ 13) to avoid precipitated withdrawal, and higher buprenorphine doses (up to 24 mg/day) may be needed in fentanyl-tolerant patients [^113JpPeS] [^1125RiSV]. Adjuncts such as clonidine, lofexidine, gabapentin, and ondansetron help manage symptoms, and inpatient care is recommended for severe or refractory cases. Rapid methadone titration or short-acting full agonists (e.g. oxycodone) may be used short term in hospital settings when standard regimens are insufficient [^112AEEHY] [^1168i3rT]. Withdrawal management alone is inadequate; patients should be linked to ongoing medication for opioid use disorder and psychosocial support to reduce relapse and overdose risk [^116RXS8N] [^113bAohq].

## Clinical features of fentanyl withdrawal

Fentanyl withdrawal presents with characteristic symptoms, including:

- **Autonomic symptoms**: Restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, mydriasis, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and increased blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate [^111quMu9].

- **Severity and duration**: Fentanyl withdrawal may be more severe and prolonged than withdrawal from other opioids due to fentanyl's high potency and lipophilicity, leading to accumulation in fat tissues and prolonged elimination [^113YiHdu] [^115fHRry].

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line medications

Methadone, a full mu-opioid receptor agonist, is effective for fentanyl withdrawal and is **preferred for patients with high opioid tolerance** or those who have experienced precipitated withdrawal with buprenorphine [^112fmE2d]. Typical inpatient initiation is 20–30 mg, with titration by 5–10 mg every 3–5 days based on clinical response [^113fUJtB]. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist, is effective but carries a **higher risk of precipitated withdrawal** in fentanyl users; initiate only when patients exhibit objective withdrawal signs (COWS ≥ 13) [^113JpPeS]. Start with 2–4 mg sublingually, titrating to 8–16 mg on day 1 and up to 24 mg/day as needed [^113LmRhK] [^1125RiSV].

---

### Adjunctive medications

Adjunctive medications help manage specific withdrawal symptoms:

| **Medication** | **Indication** | **Dose** |
|-|-|-|
| Clonidine | Autonomic symptoms (hyperalgesia, sweating, anxiety) | 0.1–0.3 mg orally every 6–8 hours |
| Lofexidine | Autonomic symptoms | 0.18 mg orally three times daily |
| Gabapentin | Anxiety, insomnia, neuropathic pain | 300–900 mg orally three times daily |
| Ondansetron | Nausea, vomiting | 4–8 mg orally every 8 hours |

---

## Emerging strategies

- **Rapid methadone titration**: Higher initial doses (up to 40 mg) with faster titration (every 2–3 days) may be necessary for fentanyl-tolerant patients, with close monitoring for sedation and respiratory depression [^114eFnVb] [^116WYcKD].

- **Short-acting full agonists**: Temporary use of oxycodone or hydromorphone in inpatient settings can manage severe withdrawal while initiating methadone or buprenorphine, but should not be prescribed at discharge [^1168i3rT] [^116mp8ZM].

- **Extended-release buprenorphine**: Rapid initiation of extended-release buprenorphine (e.g. CAM2038) has shown promise in reducing precipitated withdrawal and improving retention [^113bKH1E] [^111SezBz].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Precipitated withdrawal**: Buprenorphine can precipitate severe withdrawal if initiated too early; ensure objective withdrawal (COWS ≥ 13) before induction [^113JpPeS] [^115PmRXY].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients about withdrawal symptoms, medication side effects, and the importance of adherence to reduce relapse risk [^notfound].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess withdrawal severity, vital signs, and medication adherence throughout treatment [^notfound].

---

## Post-withdrawal care and relapse prevention

- **Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD)**: Continue methadone or buprenorphine maintenance therapy to reduce relapse and overdose risk [^116RXS8N] [^111SezBz].

- **Psychosocial support**: Provide counseling, behavioral therapies, and peer support to address underlying psychological factors contributing to opioid use disorder [^114th8zu].

- **Naloxone distribution**: Ensure patients have access to naloxone and are trained in its use to prevent overdose [^1155UXC9].

---

Fentanyl withdrawal treatment requires a **comprehensive approach**, with methadone or buprenorphine as first-line therapies, adjunctive medications for symptom control, and careful monitoring to prevent precipitated withdrawal. Emerging strategies such as rapid methadone titration and extended-release buprenorphine offer promising alternatives. Post-withdrawal care, including ongoing MOUD and psychosocial support, is essential to reduce relapse and overdose risk.

### Establishing a research agenda for the study and assessment of opioid withdrawal [^112xD74R]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

The opioid crisis is an international public health concern. Treatments for opioid use disorder centre largely on the management of opioid withdrawal, an aversive collection of signs and symptoms that contribute to opioid use disorder. Whereas in the past 50 years more than 90 medications have been developed for depression, only five medications have been developed for opioid use disorder during this period. We posit that underinvestment has occurred in part due to an underdeveloped understanding of opioid withdrawal syndrome. This Personal View summarises substantial gaps in our understanding of opioid withdrawal that are likely to continue to limit major advancements in its treatment. There is no firm consensus in the field as to how withdrawal should be precisely defined; 10–550 symptoms of withdrawal can be measured on 18 scales. The imprecise understanding of withdrawal is likely to result in overestimating or underestimating the severity of an individual's withdrawal syndrome or potential therapeutic effects of different candidate medications. The severity of the opioid crisis is not remitting, and an international research agenda for the study and assessment of opioid withdrawal is necessary to support transformational changes in withdrawal management and treatment of opioid use disorder. Nine actionable targets are delineated here: develop a consensus definition of opioid withdrawal; understand withdrawal symptomatology after exposure to different opioids (particularly fentanyl); understand precipitated opioid withdrawal; understand how co-exposure of other drugs (eg, xylazine and stimulants) influences withdrawal expression; examine individual variation in withdrawal phenotypes; precisely characterise the protracted withdrawal syndrome; identify biomarkers of opioid withdrawal severity; identify predictors of opioid withdrawal severity; and understand which symptoms are most closely associated with treatment attrition or relapse. The US Food and Drug Administration recently established a formal indication for opioid withdrawal that has invigorated interest in drug development for opioid withdrawal management. Action is now needed to support these interests and help industry identify new classes of medications so that real change can be achieved for people with opioid use disorder.

### High-dose buprenorphine treatment in the setting of fentanyl [^111d4Fvd]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

The emergence of fentanyl in the setting of the US opioid crisis demands reconsideration of clinical approaches to buprenorphine initiation for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD), with the rationale that fentanyl's unique pharmacology leads to a greater risk of precipitated withdrawal (PW). Use of high-dose buprenorphine for initiation is a strategy that has been hypothesized to lead to less PW and better retention. In the absence of randomized clinical trials, it is important for clinicians to understand the evidence that suggests benefits of high-dose approaches while recognizing methodological limitations.

Observations

This article summarizes observational studies that have been published as of 2025 addressing key questions relevant to a high-dose buprenorphine approach. First, how common is PW with the standard-dose initiation of buprenorphine for persons who use fentanyl? Is the risk greater than for persons who do not use fentanyl? Second, is high-dose buprenorphine initiation associated with lower risk of PW compared with standard dose? Finally, is initiation of high-dose buprenorphine associated with better long-term treatment outcomes (greater retention and less health care utilization) compared with standard dose?

Conclusions and Relevance

Several recent studies provided a range of prevalence rates (1%-16%) for PW with buprenorphine initiation for persons with OUD using fentanyl, which may reflect differences in study design and setting. While certain studies described rates of PW that were 3 to 4 times higher among those with fentanyl use compared with those without, they were limited by low power due to the small number of PW events. Studies also did not provide clear evidence as to whether higher buprenorphine initiation is associated with lower risk of PW. Studies suggest higher retention and lower health care utilization with high dose vs the standard approach; however, there were methodologic problems due to observational study design, such as immortal time bias and unmeasured confounding. Evidence to inform clinicians' decisions whether to initiate buprenorphine treatment with high-dose strategies among patients who use fentanyl was limited, and more definitive studies are needed.

### Clinical management of opioid withdrawal [^114Dr9fy]. Addiction (2022). Medium credibility.

Appropriate clinical management of opioid withdrawal is a crucial bridge to long-term treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), because it is a high-risk time for potential opioid overdose and relapse. We provide a narrative review of evidence-based opioid withdrawal management strategies applicable to a variety of treatment settings and geographies. The goals of opioid withdrawal management include relieving suffering associated with withdrawal, providing appropriate diagnosis and screening, engaging patients in initiation of OUD treatment, and using harm reduction strategies, all guided by a patient-centered approach to care. In addition, we discuss complex cases, relapse prevention strategies, and new developments in opioid withdrawal management.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^111RZEbq]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — opioid withdrawal management (Part 3) highlights that further study is needed on methods to accelerate the withdrawal process and facilitate the introduction of antagonists, including combinations of buprenorphine and low doses of oral naltrexone to rapidly detoxify patients; more research is needed before these can be accepted as standard practice and there are insufficient data to determine whether opioid antagonists in combination with alpha-2 adrenergic agonists reduce withdrawal duration or increase retention; further research is needed to make recommendations on the optimal duration of a buprenorphine taper and to compare short versus long tapers; further research is needed to evaluate the safety of inpatient as compared to outpatient withdrawal management; and further research is needed to address whether protocols for buprenorphine initiation should be modified for patients regularly using fentanyl and other high potency opioids.

### Management of opioid use disorder, opioid withdrawal, and opioid overdose prevention in hospitalized adults: a systematic review of existing guidelines [^1155UXC9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hospitalizations related to the consequences of opioid use are rising. National guidelines directing in-hospital opioid use disorder (OUD) management do not exist. OUD treatment guidelines intended for other treatment settings could inform in-hospital OUD management.

Objective

Evaluate the quality and content of existing guidelines for OUD treatment and management.

Data Sources

OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, Ovid PsychINFO, EBSCOhost CINHAL, ERCI Guidelines Trust, websites of relevant societies and advocacy organizations, and selected international search engines.

Study Selection

Guidelines published between January 2010 to June 2020 addressing OUD treatment, opioid withdrawal management, opioid overdose prevention, and care transitions among adults.

Data Extraction

We assessed quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument.

Data Synthesis

Nineteen guidelines met the selection criteria. Most recommendations were based on observational studies or expert consensus. Guidelines recommended the use of nonstigmatizing language among patients with OUD; to assess patients with unhealthy opioid use for OUD using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Diseases-5th Edition criteria; use of methadone or buprenorphine to treat OUD and opioid withdrawal; use of multimodal, nonopioid therapy, and when needed, short-acting opioid analgesics in addition to buprenorphine or methadone, for acute pain management; ensuring linkage to ongoing methadone or buprenorphine treatment; referring patients to psychosocial treatment; and ensuring access to naloxone for opioid overdose reversal.

Conclusions

Included guidelines were informed by studies with various levels of rigor and quality. Future research should systematically study buprenorphine and methadone initiation and titration among people using fentanyl and people with pain, especially during hospitalization.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113JpPeS]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — buprenorphine initiation timing and withdrawal thresholds: Patients who are currently dependent on opioids should wait until they are experiencing mild to moderate opioid withdrawal before the first dose, and clinicians should use objective signs of opioid withdrawal before initiating buprenorphine; generally, initiation should occur at least 6–12 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioids and 24–72 hours after the last use of long-acting opioids such as methadone, with a COWS score of 11–12 or more generally indicative of sufficient withdrawal. During office-based initiation, use of the COWS can be helpful, and some clinicians have recommended waiting for at least moderate withdrawal (COWS score of 13 or higher) in the context of fentanyl exposure, which is short acting but has a long half-life (8–10 hours), although there is little existing evidence addressing this issue.

### Optimal drug, optimal dose, or both in the pharmacological treatment of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome? [^112iAgYp]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The drugs and drug dose regimens used to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms in newborns with in utero opioid exposure have been developed in a mostly empiric fashion. Clonidine has long been used as an adjunct but has been explored as part of an opioid‐free approach to primary therapy. The tools of pharmacometrics can provide a path for rational exploration of drug exposure and response.

Antenatal opioid exposure results in post‐natal neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) with cardinal symptomatology in the central and autonomic nervous systems and the gastrointestinal tract. The natural history of NOWS is characterized by an initial increase in symptoms as placentally transferred opioids are cleared from the infant's system. The therapeutic focus in treating newborns is on the reduction in symptom severity, with a goal of ensuring normal infant growth and development and maternal–infant bonding. Rates of NOWS have risen 7‐fold over the past 20 years, and in parallel, there has been progress in therapeutic approaches to improving neonatal outcomes. Supportive measures with functional‐based symptom assessment control symptoms for many infants. Non‐pharmacologic measures have been standardized and refined, and their systematic implementation has reduced the number of infants requiring pharmacologic treatment. This has been an advantage since while pharmacologic treatment controls symptoms, it is associated with prolonged hospital stays and can impair maternal infant bonding. Clonidine is currently used as a rescue therapy in NOWS. The parent trial of Bada(NCT03396588) tested the contrarian hypothesis that clonidine can improve outcomes for those requiring pharmacologic treatment compared with the current standard of opioid replacement using oral morphine. NOWS investigations are often difficult to interpret due to suboptimal design, such as before/after quality improvement programs that implement a suite of interventions, making the impact of any single action hard to assess. Retrospectiveor single‐arm studies with historical controlsare subject to differences in NOWS incidence or temporal changes in of maternal drug exposure such as the emergence of fentanyl. In contrast, the Bada study was large (for NOWS investigations), randomized, and blinded. All of these helped to mitigate the temporal bias of fentanyl use patterns as well as the difficult to predict impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic. Importantly, the clinical data were magnified by the use of rich pharmacokinetic (PK) collection sampling, outlined in the work of Tang. External validity of the work is strengthened by parameter estimates congruent with both adult IV administration and the prior work of Xie in NOWS patients. Simulations provided a number of options to consider in future investigations. Critically, the work is welcomed in moving improvements of NOWS therapeutics from empiric dose optimization to a PK data‐driven approach.

### Fentanyl for neuropathic pain in adults [^114PMFyW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Opioid drugs, including fentanyl, are commonly used to treat neuropathic pain, and are considered effective by some professionals. Most reviews have examined all opioids together. This review sought evidence specifically for fentanyl, at any dose, and by any route of administration. Other opioids are considered in separate reviews.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of fentanyl for chronic neuropathic pain in adults, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to June 2016, together with the reference lists of retrieved articles, and two online study registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing fentanyl (in any dose, administered by any route, and in any formulation) with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently searched for studies, extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality and potential bias. We did not carry out any pooled analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

Only one study met our inclusion criteria. Participants were men and women (mean age 67 years), with postherpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, or chronic postoperative pain. They were experiencing inadequate relief from non-opioid analgesics, and had not previously taken opioids for their neuropathic pain. The study used an enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal design. It was adequately blinded, but we judged it at unclear risk of bias for other criteria. Transdermal fentanyl (one-day fentanyl patch) was titrated over 10 to 29 days to establish the maximum tolerated and effective dose (12.5 to 50 µg/h). Participants who achieved a prespecified good level of pain relief with a stable dose of fentanyl, without excessive use of rescue medication or intolerable adverse events ('responders'), were randomised to continue with fentanyl or switch to placebo for 12 weeks, under double-blind conditions. Our prespecified primary outcomes were not appropriate for this study design, but the measures reported do give an indication of the efficacy of fentanyl in this condition. In the titration phase, 1 in 3 participants withdrew because of adverse events or inadequate pain relief, and almost 90% experienced adverse events. Of 258 participants who underwent open-label titration, 163 were 'responders' and entered the randomised withdrawal phase. The number of participants completing the study (and therefore continuing on treatment) without an increase of pain by more than 15/100 was 47/84 (56%) with fentanyl and 28/79 (35%) with placebo. Because only 63% responded sufficiently to enter the randomised withdrawal phase, this implies that only a maximum of 35% of participants entering the study would have had useful pain relief and tolerability with transdermal fentanyl, compared with 22% with placebo. Almost 60% of participants taking fentanyl were 'satisfied' and 'very satisfied' with their treatment at the end of the study, compared with about 40% with placebo. This outcome approximates to our primary outcome of moderate benefit using the Patient Global Impression of Change scale, but the group was enriched for responders and the method of analysis was not clear. The most common adverse events were constipation, nausea, somnolence, and dizziness. There was no information about other types of neuropathic pain, other routes of administration, or comparisons with other treatments. We downgraded the quality of the evidence to very low because there was only one study, with few participants and events, and there was no information about how data from people who withdrew were analysed.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the suggestion that fentanyl works in any neuropathic pain condition.

### Managing opioid use disorder in primary care: PEER simplified guideline [^113hgtfP]. Canadian Family Physician Medecin de Famille Canadien (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to withdrawal management (PEER), CFPC 2019 guidelines recommend to do not initiate opioid agonist treatment with the intention to discontinue in the short term. Initiate opioid agonist treatment as long-term management. Insufficient evidence to recommend optimal duration, although it might be indefinite.

### Point / counterpoint: should full agonist opioid medications be offered to hospitalized patients for management of opioid withdrawal? [^1168i3rT]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

As the Point authors argue, hospitalized patients who decline MOUD for long-term OUD treatment still deserve effective opioid withdrawal management. However, based on existing evidence, the safest and most effective management of opioid withdrawal involves methadone or buprenorphine (or, in regions where it is available, i.e. Canada, slow-release oral morphine). We urgently need to update this evidence in the era of high-potency synthetic opioids, like fentanyl. While this evidence develops, we believe hospitalists should adapt established best practices for hospital-based opioid withdrawal management rather than starting anew. Thus, we recommend short-acting full agonist opioids for opioid withdrawal, when necessary, to augment methadone or buprenorphine as long as there is no medical contraindication to these medications.

Oxycodone or hydromorphone as monotherapy for opioid withdrawal is likely to be less effective and could lead to adverse events, including overdose. The Point authors suggest that hospitalists should ideally use "knowledge of the potency of the local drug supply" to guide initial dosing for oxycodone or hydromorphone. However, even addiction specialists have difficulty predicting response to an initial dose of oxycodone or hydromorphone since, as the Point authors acknowledge, "morphine equivalent calculations for a given quantity of heroin or fentanyl are not straightforward". We believe it is unrealistic to expect a hospitalist with little or no addiction training and high patient volumes to initiate and titrate these medications alone for opioid withdrawal. The Point authors do suggest that this approach would ideally be implemented in a hospital setting with an addiction consultation, however, most nonacademic hospitals in the United States do not have an addiction consultation service or regular access to an addiction specialist, making the Point authors' recommendations inaccessible to many readers of the Journal of Hospital Medicine. Without up-to-date knowledge of the potency of unregulated opioid supplies or expert advice to inform dosing, patients are at high risk of iatrogenic under- or overdosing of opioids with this approach.

### Fentanyl (fentanyl system) [^111quMu9]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on fentanyl transdermal system who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.

It may be necessary to provide the patient with a lower dosage strength to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.

When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time, and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.21), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

### Treatment of inpatient opioid withdrawal with short-acting full agonist opioids at a safety-net hospital [^111vwuZy]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Potent synthetic opioids such as fentanyl have increasingly dominated the illicit drug market in North America, leading to high opioid tolerance in patients with opioid use disorder. Consequently, these patients may experience more severe opioid withdrawal syndrome while hospitalized. Patients with opioid use disorder are nearly three times more likely to have patient-directed discharge than patients without opioid use disorder, and qualitative studies have shown that inadequate treatment of opioid withdrawal syndrome contributes to this disparity. – These premature discharges contribute to higher all-cause mortality and readmission rates, underscoring the need for interventions that adequately treat opioid withdrawal syndrome in the inpatient setting. –

The American Society of Addiction Medicine guidelines recommend treating acute opioid withdrawal syndrome with methadone, buprenorphine, and/or non-opioid adjuncts. Medications for opioid use disorder, including methadone and buprenorphine, are gold standard treatments but can be insufficient to treat acute opioid withdrawal syndrome, particularly among patients using fentanyl. Consequently, using short-acting full agonist opioids (SAFAO) to treat opioid withdrawal syndrome during hospitalization has recently gained interest, as these medications can provide timely relief in the first few days of hospitalization when withdrawal peaks. – Since 2019, our Addiction Consult Team (ACT) has offered SAFAO in addition to medications for opioid use disorder and non-opioid adjuncts to treat opioid withdrawal syndrome in hospitalized patients who endorse daily heroin or fentanyl use.

Use of SAFAO to treat opioid withdrawal syndrome may allow for more effective, patient-centered care. However, given the relative novelty of this practice, limited data are available to support widespread implementation. Additionally, there is disagreement in the literature regarding the role of SAFAO for the management of opioid withdrawal syndrome, highlighting the need for more robust evidence.

In this study, we characterize how SAFAO were used to treat inpatient opioid withdrawal syndrome at an urban, safety-net hospital. We describe (1) the population and hospitalization characteristics of patients receiving SAFAO, (2) SAFAO doses used to manage opioid withdrawal syndrome, and (3) the number and nature of adverse events among patients who received SAFAO.

### Induction to methadone 80 mg in the first week of treatment of patients who use fentanyl: a case series from an outpatient opioid treatment program [^114eFnVb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Illicitly manufactured fentanyl and related analogues continue to drive the overdose crisis in the United States, where over 100,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in 2022. Medication treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) using opioid agonist therapies like methadone and buprenorphine were developed to address OUD from heroin, and they are mainstay treatment options proven to reduce overdose mortality.

Methadone and buprenorphine remain effective in reducing mortality and morbidity for individuals using fentanyl, but new challenges have emerged and may continue to evolve as other high-potency synthetic opioids become more prevalent in the drug supply. The unique pharmacodynamics of fentanyl often lead dependent individuals to use fentanyl several times per day to stave off withdrawal, resulting in development of a much higher opioid tolerance compared to heroin or prescription opioids. Buprenorphine appears to be more likely to precipitate opioid withdrawal in patients using fentanyl (vs heroin and other short-acting opioids), complicating the induction process and leading to a proliferation of different strategies for helping patients achieve induction. Methadone doses that were effective for patients using heroin seem to be less effective at eliminating fentanyl use, suggesting that higher doses may be required.

Methadone induction guidelines are conservative, focused on minimizing overdose risk from the methadone itself rather than rapidly reaching a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal. One reason for this caution is that studies of individuals conducted before the introduction of fentanyl to illicit drug markets found that risk of overdose is highest in the first 4 weeks after starting methadone. The specific reasons for this are not known, and guideline titration schedules are based on patient response to a dose at steady state, which is reached after 4–5 days given an average half-life of 24 hours. A 2013 expert panel convened by the American Society of Addiction Medicine recommended a maximum initial dose of 30 mg, followed by 5-mg increases no sooner than every 5 days. Other expert panels are marginally more aggressive, recommending an initial dose of 10–30 mg, followed by increases of 5–10 mg no sooner than every 3 to 4 days of daily dosing. Following either approach may still require several weeks, if not months, to reach an effective dose — generally estimated to be between 80 and 120 mg for people using heroin — that reduces nonmedical opioid use by suppressing withdrawal and opioid cravings. Achieving successful induction may become even more challenging in patients with co-occurring substance use disorders, such as methamphetamine use disorder, which has been linked to decreased retention rates. Another possibility for the increased mortality early in treatment with methadone, then, is ongoing nonmedical opioid use.

### Caring for hospitalized adults with opioid use disorder in the era of fentanyl: a review [^112AEEHY]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The rise of fentanyl and other high-potency synthetic opioids across US and Canada has been associated with increasing hospitalizations and unprecedented overdose deaths. Hospitalization is a critical touchpoint to engage patients and offer life-saving opioid use disorder (OUD) care when admitted for OUD or other medical conditions.

Observations

Clinical best practices include managing acute withdrawal and pain, initiating medication for OUD, integrating harm reduction principles and practices, addressing in-hospital substance use, and supporting hospital-to-community care transitions. Fentanyl complicates hospital OUD care. Fentanyl's high potency intensifies pain, withdrawal, and cravings and increases the risk for overdose and other harms. Fentanyl's unique pharmacology has rendered traditional techniques for managing opioid withdrawal and initiating buprenorphine and methadone inadequate for some patients, necessitating novel strategies. Further, co-use of opioids with stimulants drugs is common, and the opioid supply is unpredictable and can be contaminated with benzodiazepines, xylazine, and other substances. To address these challenges, clinicians are increasingly relying on emerging practices, such as low-dose buprenorphine initiation with opioid continuation, rapid methadone titration, and the use of alternative opioid agonists. Hospitals must also reconsider conventional approaches to in-hospital substance use and expand clinicians' understanding and embrace of harm reduction, which is a philosophy and set of practical strategies that supports people who use drugs to be safer and healthier without judgment, coercion, or discrimination. Hospital-to-community care transitions should ensure uninterrupted access to OUD care after discharge, which requires special consideration and coordination. Finally, improving hospital-based addiction care requires dedicated infrastructure and expertise. Preparing hospitals across the US and Canada to deliver OUD best practices requires investments in clinical champions, staff education, leadership commitment, community partnerships, quality metrics, and financing.

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this review indicate that fentanyl creates increased urgency and new challenges for hospital OUD care. Hospital clinicians and systems have a central role in addressing the current drug crisis.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113LmRhK]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Withdrawal management with buprenorphine — initiation, dosing, and special considerations indicates buprenorphine withdrawal management can be done either in an outpatient or an inpatient setting, none of the available forms are specifically FDA-approved for withdrawal management but they may be used for this purpose, and none of the products have shown superiority over another for this purpose. Because buprenorphine is a partial μ opioid receptor agonist with a higher affinity for the mu-receptor than most full agonists, it is important that buprenorphine not be started until a patient is exhibiting objective signs of opioid withdrawal to avoid precipitated withdrawal; opioid withdrawal usually occurs up to 12–18 hours after the last dose of short-acting opioids and up to 24–48 hours after the last dose of a long-acting agonist. Providers should consider dosing for buprenorphine in an inpatient setting where the patient can be closely monitored. With fentanyl, which has a long half-life (8–10 hours), some clinicians have recommended waiting until patients are in at least moderate withdrawal (COWS score of 13 or more) before initiating buprenorphine. Withdrawal management with buprenorphine should start with an initial dose of 2–4 mg, titrated up as needed to control withdrawal (generally 4–16 mg per day), and the duration of the tapering schedule can be as brief as 3–5 days or over 30 days; clinicians should be guided by patient response in determining the optimum duration of the taper.

### Point / counterpoint: should full agonist opioid medications be offered to hospitalized patients for management of opioid withdrawal? [^111KVUrq]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Opioid agonist therapy can be considered a bridge to several potential treatment pathways for hospitalized patients with OUD. For a patient who is initially reluctant to initiate MOUD, an alternate opioid agonist such as oxycodone or hydromorphone can be utilized to effectively manage pain and opioid withdrawal during the initial phase of hospitalization, buying time to revisit interest in MOUD when initial symptoms are better controlled. Regarding transition to buprenorphine, prescription oxycodone has a more predictable half-life than illicitly manufactured fentanyl, and when timed properly, the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal during transitions from oxycodone to buprenorphine can be all but eliminated. For a patient interested in methadone treatment, oxycodone can be utilized to control pain and withdrawal symptoms until methadone can be titrated to effective dosing. What about the patient who is uninterested in MOUD? A patient with OUD and significant opioid dependence should not be required to accept MOUD to receive medical care, and treatment with opioid agonist therapies during a period of hospitalization can be considered a safe bridge to continued opioid use after discharge, protecting a patient's opioid tolerance as a form of harm reduction, and ultimately mitigating the risk of fatal overdose following hospitalization.

### Fentanyl [^112CKFJj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to taper the dose of the opioid gradually. For patients on fentanyl transdermal system who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g., no greater than 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for briefer periods of time may tolerate a more rapid taper.

It may be necessary to provide the patient with a lower dosage strength to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms, should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms also may develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period of time or raise the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose, and then proceed with a slower taper. In addition, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.

When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period of time and/or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper. A multimodal approach to pain management may optimize the treatment of chronic pain, as well as assist with the successful tapering of the opioid analgesic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.21), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.3)].

RECOMMENDATIONS

Assess patients for opioid withdrawal and offer and initiate evidence-based treatment, using shared decision making, regardless of a patient's plan to disrupt opioid use or continue treatment after discharge.
When patients prefer methadone titrate it appropriately (Table 1) recognizing that dosing guidelines may not reflect patient needs in the setting of potent opioids (e.g. fentanyl).
Offer adjunctive medications (e.g. clonidine, loperamide, and ondansetron) in addition to opioid agonist therapy to mitigate opioid withdrawal symptoms.
Link patients who want to continue methadone to local OTPs on discharge. If there is no accessible OTP, discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives to methadone.
Prescribe naloxone and discuss harm reduction as part of overdose prevention.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^116mp8ZM]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

WHAT WE SHOULD DO

We should assess patients for risk of opioid withdrawal and offer and initiate evidence-based treatment, including methadone, in patients who select it. For patients without a formal OUD diagnosis who want to continue methadone after discharge, confirm the diagnosis using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition. Start and titrate methadone (Table 1) when patients endorse early opioid withdrawal symptoms after confirming they have opioid tolerance and are not actively sedated. Because methadone is a full opioid agonist and can be initiated before withdrawal develops it is unnecessary to obtain a Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score when starting it. We should also offer adjunctive medications (e.g. clonidine, loperamide, and ondansetron) for withdrawal, though these do not address the underlying pathophysiology of opioid withdrawal and insufficiently mitigate symptoms. Clinicians should recognize that patients using fentanyl or other potent synthetic opioids may have high tolerance and need higher doses of opioid agonists, including methadone, to alleviate withdrawal. When patients decline methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal, their opioid withdrawal symptoms or pain are not controlled on methadone or buprenorphine alone, or they are undergoing low-dose buprenorphine initiation, hospitalists can offer alternative opioid agonists (e.g. oxycodone, hydromorphone) during hospitalization though we cannot prescribe these medications for withdrawal at discharge.

Next Steps: A Research Agenda

A research agenda can build on these results to continue moving the field forward. First, prioritize clinical trials. Suen et alhighlighted an urgent need for prospective, randomized, and/or blinded clinical trials that evaluate buprenorphine initiation and retention strategies for people who use fentanyl. The lack of evidence for basic treatment nearly 7 years into the fentanyl crisis is glaring. Funding agencies should continue to prioritize such research.

Second, use new approaches to research design. Novel methodologies can build on traditional clinical trials and work to provide clinical insights. Trial emulation studies, adaptive trial designs, and partially randomized preference trials seek to address limitations in feasibility and ethical concerns by simulating randomization or incorporating patient preferences, thus enhancing the applicability of findings to clinical settings and supporting more personalized approaches to addiction treatment.

Third, characterize risk factors. We must identify and examine risk factors for buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal and treatment retention. Treatment protocols may not generalize to all regions, drug use patterns, and individuals. By better understanding risks, clinicians can provide patient-specific approaches.

Fourth, explore cotreatment of stimulant use disorder. Given the high prevalence of co-occurring methamphetamine use in this study sample (with similar patterns nationally), future studies should investigate cotreatment of stimulant use disorders. Some preliminary data highlight how stimulant treatment may improve buprenorphine treatment retention.

A challenge remains for patients and clinicians who must make decisions about how to start buprenorphine today, while awaiting further evidence. Outpatient LDI may serve as one way to support patients who fear precipitated withdrawal and want to continue drug use during the initiation process. Some of the fear may be overstated: hospitaland emergency departmentstudies, as well as survey studies based on outpatient self-report, indicate that traditional buprenorphine initiation does not trigger precipitated withdrawal for most patients, even in those using fentanyl. However, these studies did not evaluate treatment retention. Data from Suen et alsuggest that avoiding precipitated withdrawal with LDI does not seem to translate into a robust treatment retention rate. Thus, perhaps LDI is not yet ready to replace traditional initiation as the standard of care in outpatient settings.

With the worst opioid overdose death crisis in the United States history, urgent new approaches to assist people who use drugs onto medication for opioid use disorder are necessary. In this commentary, addiction medicine clinicians and drug user union representatives align to argue that conventional ways of buprenorphine initiation that require periods of withdrawal must be augmented with additional novel approaches to initiation. In the fentanyl era, members of the New England Users Union and Portland Users Union report encountering precipitated withdrawal, being unable to stop using full agonist opioids for a required period of time, and difficulty initiating this medication that could offer them some stability and life-saving treatment. People who use drugs should be involved at all levels with ongoing research, clinical and policy efforts to improve buprenorphine initiation as their lives and their suffering are at stake.

2.9 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Fentanyl Transdermal System

Do not rapidly reduce or abruptly discontinue fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse. Patients may also attempt to treat their pain or withdrawal symptoms with illicit opioids, such as heroin, and other substances.

When a decision has been made to decrease the dose or discontinue therapy in an opioid-dependent patient using fentanyl transdermal system, there are a variety of factors that should be considered, including the total daily dose of opioid (including fentanyl transdermal system) the patient has been using, the duration of treatment, the type of pain being treated, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. It is important to ensure ongoing care of the patient and to agree on an appropriate tapering schedule and follow-up plan so that patient and provider goals and expectations are clear and realistic. When opioid analgesics are being discontinued due to a suspected substance use disorder, evaluate and treat the patient, or refer for evaluation and treatment of the substance use disorder. Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.

5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome

Use of fentanyl transdermal system for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.6 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^115pim5J]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM 2020 opioid withdrawal — summary of recommendations includes the following: Using methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids, and abrupt cessation may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome with risks including relapse, overdose, and overdose death. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method and is not recommended; patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and ongoing maintenance medication with psychosocial treatment is the standard of care. Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. By regulation, methadone-based withdrawal management must be done in an OTP or an acute care setting; for patients withdrawing from short acting opioids the initial dose should typically be 20–30 mg per day and patients may be tapered off in approximately 6–10 days. Opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal; once confirmed, a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms is given (an initial dose of 2–4 mg of buprenorphine may be considered), and the dose is increased as needed. However, methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, in retaining patients in withdrawal management, and in supporting the completion of withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management using ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be safe and effective but should be used only by clinicians experienced with this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation are not employed.

Interventions for the management and prevention of fentanyl overdose

Similar treatments are prescribed for opioid use disorder and opioid overdose, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications methadone, buprenorphine, extended-release naltrexone, and naloxone. Lofexidine, a central α 2 -adrenergic receptor agonist, was the first non-opioid medication that was approved by the United States FDA for the treatment of opioid withdrawal. Lofexidine has fewer prescriptive barriers and comparable efficacy and safety relative to other opioid receptor agonizts, but it is generally more expensive. Sparse data are available on the effectiveness of interventions to prevent overdoses that are caused by illicitly manufactured fentanyl (Table 1). Compared with other opioid-related overdoses, illicit fentanyl-related overdoses appear to be accompanied by distinct symptoms, such as body and chest rigidity, dyskinesia, and slow or irregular heart rate, which can affect overdose management, such as oxygen provisions and appropriate doses of naloxone. To avoid or reduce the adverse effects of fentanyl, the FDA proposed to control the duration of use and doses of fentanyl. One study showed that the majority of patients who were presumed to experience fentanyl overdose could be discharged after brief emergency room observation, thus unlikely requiring additional naloxone dosing in the emergency room.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is one of the first reports of a randomized clinical trial to examine medication treatment of OUD among patients using fentanyl that has compared subgroups with vs without fentanyl use at baseline. The findings support previous observational studies, suggesting that buprenorphine is effective among people who use fentanyl. Participant retention in this 24-week trial was similar between the fentanyl-positive (60.2%) and fentanyl-negative (56.7%) subgroups, comparing favorably with other large trials that have shown 24-week retention rates for buprenorphine treatment in the 40% to 50% range. Withdrawal and craving scores improved rapidly across the fentanyl-positive and fentanyl-negative subgroups. Adverse events were comparable across groups and consistent with the known safety profile of buprenorphine. The main association of the fentanyl-positive subgroup with the summary score of percentage of urine samples negative for any opioids across the 24-week trial (point estimates, 24.7% in the fentanyl-positive subgroup and 34.6% in the fentanyl-negative subgroup) and the slow increase in opioid-negative rates over the early weeks of the trial in the fentanyl-positive subgroup (Figure 2) suggest that abstinence may be more difficult to achieve among people who use fentanyl. Nonetheless, studies of OUD in which participants were treated with placebo or counseling without medication have shown much lower opioid-negative rates. Participants in the fentanyl-positive subgroup had baseline characteristics suggestive of greater disease severity compared with the fentanyl-negative subgroup, such as more heroin use and more co-occurring cocaine and benzodiazepine use. Thus, lower percentages of urine samples negative for opioids and slower response in the fentanyl-positive subgroup could be associated with greater overall disease severity.

### Low-dose initiations of buprenorphine in the fentanyl era – A search for evidence-based approaches to an evolving crisis [^111E4vQh]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

As fentanyl has become dominant in the US drug supply, clinicians and patients have sought alternative strategies for buprenorphine initiation to avoid precipitated withdrawal. Limited evidence on the effectiveness of alternative strategies leaves a noticeable absence of guidelines on best practices on how to start buprenorphine treatment for individuals with opioid use disorder in the fentanyl era, particularly in the outpatient setting. Suen et alsought to address this gap. Using a retrospective cohort analysis, the authors compared 2 low-dose initiation (LDI) protocols to start buprenorphine in patients using fentanyl. The results: we still have a long way to go.

Prior to the fentanyl era, initiation of buprenorphine through traditional protocols was relatively simple and effective. Barriers to treatment were less clinical and more policy based (eg, X waiver) or logistic (eg, pharmacy availability). Today, the X waiver has been abolished and access to buprenorphine is increasing nationwide, but fentanyl has elevated the concern surrounding buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal (ie, the rapid onset of withdrawal symptoms associated with taking buprenorphine too soon after using a full-agonist opioid, such as fentanyl).

### Buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal among hospitalized patients using fentanyl [^115PmRXY]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is safe, effective, and scalable under existing US federal regulations. Buprenorphine is a partial μ-opioid receptor agonist with high binding affinity; when introduced while a full-agonist opioid such as fentanyl or heroin is present, buprenorphine displaces the full agonist and can precipitate sudden opioid withdrawal. To prevent this phenomenon of precipitated withdrawal (PW), the traditional initiation approach is to administer successive doses of 2 to 4 mg of sublingual buprenorphine at least 8 to 16 hours after the last use of a short-acting opioid, once patients develop opioid withdrawal (typically assessed as a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale [COWS] score ≥ 8 on a scale of 0–48, with higher scores indicating more severe opioid withdrawal). This approach quickly and effectively relieves opioid withdrawal, with a low rate of PW among individuals who use short-acting opioids such as heroin or oxycodone.

As fentanyl has adulterated or replaced heroin in the unregulated drug supply and as access to buprenorphine treatment has expanded, patient, and clinician, reports of buprenorphine PW have increased. Patients have described PW despite 48 hours of abstinence from fentanyl, and case series, have documented that some patients using fentanyl develop PW despite moderate opioid withdrawal (COWS score ≥ 13). Since fentanyl is detectable in urine for an average of 7 days after last use for persons with OUD, there is concern that fentanyl retained in adipose or skeletal muscle after chronic use might increase the risk of PW despite 8 to 48 hours of abstinence. Due to fear of PW, some patients using fentanyl now decline buprenorphine, and some clinicians use alternative buprenorphine initiation approaches such as low-dose initiation with opioid continuation.

Introduction

Increasing the uptake of buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is critical, with overdose deaths reaching alarming levels. Buprenorphine and methadone are gold standard treatments for OUD, reducing mortality by over 50%. Buprenorphine is more accessible than methadone in outpatient settings, and any physician with a US Drug Enforcement Administration license is now able to prescribe it. However, despite its proven effectiveness, buprenorphine uptake remains low, with estimates suggesting that less than 20% of individuals with OUD receive any medication treatment. In San Francisco, California, individuals with OUD have predominantly used fentanyl since the late 2010s. Despite efforts to expand treatment locally, uptake of both OUD medication options has been decreasing, with approximately 2900 unique individuals enrolled in buprenorphine in 2021 to 2538 individuals in 2022 and approximately 2286 unique individuals enrolled in methadone in 2021 to 2272 individuals in 2022.

One factor in low buprenorphine uptake is people's fear of experiencing precipitated withdrawal during initiation, particularly among those using fentanyl. Prior to the introduction of fentanyl, a highly potent opioid associated with a substantial proportion of overdoses, rates of successful buprenorphine initiation were relatively high, and although exact estimates of successful initiation in the fentanyl era are not known, experts have highlighted increased challenges. Buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist with high binding affinity to the μ-opioid receptor, can displace other opioids, leading to severe precipitated withdrawal symptoms if other opioids are present in the body. Traditional buprenorphine initiation requires individuals to stop opioid use and experience moderate withdrawal symptoms before initiating buprenorphine to avoid precipitating withdrawal. However, fentanyl is hypothesized to accumulate in fat stores much longer than other opioids, and individuals initiating buprenorphine can still undergo severe precipitated withdrawal despite waiting until experiencing withdrawal. These challenges complicate successful initiation and highlight the pressing need to explore alternative strategies for initiating buprenorphine among individuals who use fentanyl, such as low-dose initiation (LDI) of buprenorphine.

2.9 Safe Reduction or Discontinuation of Fentanyl Transdermal System

Do not abruptly discontinue fentanyl transdermal system in patients who may be physically dependent on opioids. Rapid discontinuation of opioid analgesics in patients who are physically dependent on opioids has resulted in serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide.

Treatment should include evidence-based approaches, such as medication assisted treatment of opioid use disorder. Complex patients with comorbid pain and substance use disorders may benefit from referral to a specialist.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to withdrawal management, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to do not offer opioid withdrawal management (detoxification) on its own without ongoing treatment for OUD in patients with OUD. Counsel patients about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns including increased risk of overdose and overdose death. Offer ongoing maintenance medication in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient's needs as the standard of care for treating OUD.

### Buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal among hospitalized patients using fentanyl [^112Wrfga]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Buprenorphine treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) is safe and effective, but opioid withdrawal during treatment initiation is associated with poor retention in care. As fentanyl has replaced heroin in the drug supply, case reports and surveys have indicated increased concern for buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal (PW); however, some observational studies have found a low incidence of PW.

Objective

To estimate buprenorphine PW incidence and assess factors associated with PW among emergency department (ED) or hospitalized patients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study at 3 academic hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, included adults with OUD who underwent traditional or high-dose buprenorphine initiation between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. Exclusion criteria included low-dose buprenorphine initiation and missing documentation of opioid withdrawal severity within 4 hours of receiving buprenorphine.

Exposure

Buprenorphine initiation with an initial dose of at least 2 mg of sublingual buprenorphine after a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of 8 or higher. Additional exposures included 4 predefined factors potentially associated with PW: severity of opioid withdrawal before buprenorphine (COWS score of 8–12 vs ≥ 13), initial buprenorphine dose (2 vs 4 or ≥ 8 mg), body mass index (BMI) (< 25 vs 25 to < 30 or ≥ 30; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and urine fentanyl concentration (0 to < 20 vs 20 to < 200 or ≥ 200 ng/mL).

Main Outcome and Measures

The main outcome was PW incidence, defined as a 5-point or greater increase in COWS score from immediately before to within 4 hours after buprenorphine initiation. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of PW associated with the 4 aforementioned predefined factors.

Results

The cohort included 226 patients (150 [66.4%] male; mean [SD] age, 38.6 [10.8] years). Overall, 26 patients (11.5%) met criteria for PW. Among patients with PW, median change in COWS score was 9 points (IQR, 6–13 points). Of 123 patients with confirmed fentanyl use, 20 (16.3%) had PW. In unadjusted and adjusted models, BMI of 30 or greater compared with less than 25 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 5.12; 95% CI, 1.31–19.92) and urine fentanyl concentration of 200 ng/mL or greater compared with less than 20 ng/mL (AOR, 8.37; 95% CI, 1.60–43.89) were associated with PW.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this retrospective cohort study, 11.5% of patients developed PW after buprenorphine initiation in ED or hospital settings. Future studies should confirm the rate of PW and assess whether bioaccumulated fentanyl is a risk factor for PW.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113XK9XV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid withdrawal — onset, duration, and precipitated withdrawal: Opioid withdrawal generally results from the cessation or a dramatic reduction in the dose of opioids. For short-acting opioids such as heroin and oxycodone, symptoms usually emerge within 12 hours of the last opioid use, peak within 24–48 hours, and diminish over 3–5 days. For long-acting opioids such as methadone, withdrawal symptoms generally emerge within 30 hours of the last methadone exposure and may last up to 10 days. Abrupt discontinuation of opioids is not recommended because it may precipitate withdrawal, lead to strong cravings, and result in relapse to drug use. Signs and symptoms of precipitated withdrawal are similar to those of spontaneous withdrawal, but the time course is different, and symptoms may be much more severe. The timing of maximal precipitated withdrawal usually occurs within 1 minute for intravenously administered naloxone, several minutes after IM naloxone, up to 90 minutes after sublingual buprenorphine, and up to several hours after extended-release injectable naltrexone. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal typically lasts for 30–60 minutes, whereas naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal may last for several days. Withdrawal management is not necessary or recommended for patients being referred for treatment with methadone or buprenorphine.

5.5 Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome

Use of fentanyl transdermal system for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate. Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, unlike opioid withdrawal syndrome in adults, may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated, and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for an extended period of time of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.6 Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. Under the requirements of the REMS, drug companies with approved opioid analgesic products must make REMS-compliant education programs available to healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are strongly encouraged to do all of the following:

Complete a REMS-compliant education program offered by an accredited provider of continuing education (CE) or another education program that includes all the elements of the FDA Education Blueprint for Health Care Providers Involved in the Management or Support of Patients with Pain.
Discuss the safe use, serious risks, and proper storage and disposal of opioid analgesics with patients and/or their caregivers every time these medicines are prescribed. The Patient Counseling Guide (PCG) can be obtained at this link: www.fda.gov/OpioidAnalgesicREMSPCG.
Emphasize to patients and their caregivers the importance of reading the Medication Guide that they will receive from their pharmacist every time an opioid analgesic is dispensed to them.
Consider using other tools to improve patient, household, and community safety, such as patient-prescriber agreements that reinforce patient-prescriber responsibilities.

### Treatment of inpatient opioid withdrawal with short-acting full agonist opioids at a safety-net hospital [^115uodVd]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fentanyl use leads to increased opioid tolerance in people with opioid use disorder, complicating management of opioid withdrawal syndrome. While accepted as gold standard, methadone and buprenorphine may be insufficient to treat acute opioid withdrawal. Short-acting full agonist opioids (SAFAO) may improve treatment in the acute care setting.

Aim

Characterize use of SAFAO to treat opioid withdrawal syndrome for inpatients.

Setting

Urban safety-net hospital.

Participants

Inpatients with opioid use disorder.

Program Description

Addiction Consult Team offers SAFAO to manage opioid withdrawal syndrome.

Program Evaluation

We performed retrospective chart review of hospitalizations (n = 124) for patients with opioid use disorder who received SAFAO between March and June 2023. Patients received methadone or buprenorphine during 94% of hospitalizations. On average, 278 mg (SD 407 mg) oral morphine equivalents (OMEs) of SAFAO were administered daily during the first hospitalization week. Daily Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale scores and SAFAO OMEs were inversely correlated (Spearman rank correlation = -0.96, p = 0.003). Five hospitalizations exhibited adverse events (AEs).

Discussion

Use of methadone/buprenorphine did not alleviate the need for SAFAO, suggesting that SAFAO administration may be an important intervention for opioid withdrawal. Use of escalating OMEs of SAFAO was associated with reduced withdrawal severity. This practice was well-tolerated with few AEs.

Buprenorphine initiation in pregnancy — timing, precautions, and fentanyl considerations: Initiation of buprenorphine may lead to withdrawal symptoms in patients with physical dependence on opioids and should begin when objective, observable withdrawal is present, typically at least 6–12 hours after a short‑acting opioid and up to 24–48 hours after a long‑acting opioid; hospitalization during initiation may be advisable, especially in the third trimester; fentanyl is short acting but has a long half life (8–10 hours), and some clinicians recommend waiting for at least moderate withdrawal (COWS score of 13 or higher) before initiating buprenorphine, although evidence is limited; drug dosing is similar to that in women who are not pregnant.

### The nexus of opioids, pain, and addiction: challenges and solutions [^112t4571]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Pain and addiction are complex disorders with many commonalities. Beneficial outcomes for both disorders can be achieved through similar principles such as individualized medication selection and dosing, comprehensive multi-modal therapies, and judicious modification of treatment as indicated by the patient's status. This is implicit in the term "medication assisted treatment" (MAT) for opioid use disorders (OUD), and is equally important in pain management; however, for many OUD and pain patients, medication is central to the treatment plan and should neither be denied nor withdrawn if critical to patient well-being. Most patients prescribed opioids for pain do not develop OUD, and most people with OUD do not develop it as a result of appropriately prescribed opioids. Nonetheless, concerns about undertreatment of pain in the late 20th century likely contributed to inappropriate prescribing of opioids. This, coupled with a shortfall in OUD treatment capacity and the unfettered flood of inexpensive heroin and fentanyl, behavioral economics and other factors facilitated the 21st century opioid epidemic. Presently, injudicious reductions in opioid prescriptions for pain are contributing to increased suffering and suicides by pain patients as well as worsening disparities in pain management for ethnic minority and low-income people. Many of these people are turning to illicit opioids, and no evidence shows that the reduction in opioid prescriptions is reducing OUD or overdose deaths. Comprehensive, science-based policies that increase access to addiction treatment for all in need and better serve people with pain are vital to addressing both pain and addiction.

### Point / counterpoint: should full agonist opioid medications be offered to hospitalized patients for management of opioid withdrawal? [^115fGwBQ]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

We appreciate that the Counterpoint authors highlight use of supplemental short-acting opioids for management of opioid withdrawal. We believe that the distinction between short-acting and long-acting opioids may be exaggerated. In our experience, extended-release oxycodone is an attractive medication in the hospital setting for the management of opioid dependence for many reasons, including the ability to rapidly titrate dosing without concern for a stacking effect, the lack of peaks and troughs compared to short-acting opioids alone, and the absence of significant QTc prolongation. The Counterpoint authors are correct to highlight the limited number of addiction specialists in the United States, but with unprecedented morbidity and mortality for patients with OUD, we cannot afford to wait for a specialty workforce to develop. Hospitalists are experienced with the use and safety profile of opioid agonist therapy for the management of pain, familiar with concepts of dose titration, and perhaps most importantly, uniquely situated to interact with people experiencing withdrawal when presenting for medical care. Why not add a tool to more rapidly mitigate withdrawal symptoms, ease the physical burden of hospitalization, and facilitate transition to lifesaving MOUD?

Our nation is in the midst of a historic public health crisis, and in the past year an unprecedented number of people died from overdose. We have a limited number of effective tools at our disposal to contend with an ever-changing, highly potent, unregulated drug supply. All patients should be offered evidence-based, guideline-driven MOUD. The medical community should take concrete steps to minimize legislative, educational, and logistical barriers to this treatment, and the hospital setting should truly be considered a "reachable moment" for the initiation of buprenorphine and methadone. But we also need to acknowledge spaces where current options may fall short, and identify additional tools such as full agonist opioids, to help patients complete hospital care and facilitate transitions to evidence-based treatment and safe discharge.

### Buprenorphine dose and time to discontinuation among patients with opioid use disorder in the era of fentanyl [^1125RiSV]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

During a period when fentanyl was common in the illicit drug supply in Rhode Island, nearly 5 times as many patients with OUD were initially prescribed a buprenorphine daily dose of 16 mg compared with 24 mg. However, those prescribed the higher dose were 20% more likely to be retained in treatment over 180 days. Of those prescribed 16 mg buprenorphine, 59% discontinued treatment within 180 days compared with 53% of those prescribed 24 mg. Patients prescribed an initial daily dose of 24 mg were more likely than those prescribed 16 mg to have initiated treatment in later years (eg, 2019 and 2020).

We interpret the findings as evidence that future research should examine whether fentanyl predominance in the drug supply may be associated with increases in the optimal buprenorphine dose for treatment of OUD. The currently recommended dose of 16 mg, was derived from studies conducted prior to the widespread availability of fentanyl, and our finding suggests that a higher dose may now improve retention in treatment. This interpretation is consistent with addiction specialist commentaries that have challenged the value of 16 mg as an optimal buprenorphine dose, as well as limited observational analyses suggesting that higher doses may potentially improve buprenorphine treatment effectiveness. The findings also support clinician accounts that higher than recommended buprenorphine doses are increasingly needed to suppress withdrawal and cravings.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^114th8zu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Part 3: Treating opioid withdrawal — core recommendations and dosing: Using methadone or buprenorphine for opioid withdrawal management is recommended over abrupt cessation of opioids, since abrupt cessation may lead to strong cravings and/or acute withdrawal syndrome placing patients at risk for relapse, overdose, and overdose death. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended; patients should be advised about relapse and safety risks, and ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. Assessment of a patient undergoing opioid withdrawal management should include a thorough medical history and physical examination, focusing on signs and symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal. By regulation, opioid withdrawal management with methadone must be done in an opioid treatment program (OTP) or in an acute care setting (under limited circumstances); for patients withdrawing from short acting opioids, methadone doses should typically be 20–30 mg per day and the dose may be tapered off in approximately 6–10 days. Opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine should not be initiated until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal; once signs of withdrawal have been objectively confirmed, a dose sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms is given with an initial dose of 2–4 mg titrated up as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (e.g. FDA-approved lofexidine and off-label clonidine) are safe and effective for management of opioid withdrawal; however, methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing symptoms, in retaining patients in withdrawal management, and in supporting completion of withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management using ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) is not recommended due to high risk for adverse events or death, and naltrexone-facilitated opioid withdrawal management can be safe and effective but should be used only by clinicians experienced with this clinical method, and in cases in which anesthesia or conscious sedation are not employed.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding methadone for opioid withdrawal [^112fmE2d]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

WHY HOSPITALISTS SHOULD OFFER METHADONE FOR OPIOID WITHDRAWAL

More than 50 years of data demonstrate that methadone is safe and effective when titrated appropriately. Hospitalists can legally provide methadone for opioid withdrawal per 1306.07 Code of Federal Regulations. This code states that hospitalized patients can be "administered or dispensed opioids for maintenance or detoxification as an adjunct to a condition other than addiction". In other words, hospitalists can start, continue, and titrate methadone and other opioids for opioid withdrawal when patients are hospitalized for a primary condition other than a substance use disorder (e.g. cellulitis, heart failure, high-risk pregnancy).

Methadone is a life-saving medication that reduces overdose and all-cause mortality. It is associated with decreased acute care utilization and, by treating opioid withdrawal, a lower risk of self-discharges. Methadone should be offered for withdrawal management regardless of a patient's desire or ability to continue it after hospitalization. In addition to treating and preventing withdrawal, prescribing methadone during hospitalization offers an opportunity to initiate OUD treatment. Patients started on methadone for OUD are more than twice as likely to present to an OTP after discharge. Even when patients are ambivalent about continuing methadone after discharge, their readiness to engage in outpatient treatment likely increases as they achieve relief of withdrawal. However, only 15% of people with OUD receive OUD treatment during admission.

Without treatment, patients may use unprescribed opioids to manage withdrawal symptoms and self-discharge before completing medical treatment, increasing mortality and risk for rehospitalization. In one study, more than 40% of individuals who used drugs reported unprescribed substance use during hospitalization. Opioid agonists, like methadone, treat opioid withdrawal and may decrease in-hospital substance use while improving trust.

Methadone, in addition to being OUD treatment, offers important advantages to other full-agonist opioids in withdrawal treatment. This includes methadone's analgesic and long-acting properties, which we can leverage by splitting dosing to treat both acute pain and withdrawal. In addition, compared with a partial opioid agonist like buprenorphine, situations when patients may prefer methadone over buprenorphine include: (1) previous buprenorphine-induced precipitated withdrawal; (2) regular fentanyl use, which may increase the risk of precipitated withdrawal with buprenorphine initiation; (3) methadone's full opioid agonism; and (4) acute pain.

Overview of medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder and potential implications for the treatment of fentanyl overdose

MOR μ-opioid receptor, KOR κ-opioid receptor, OU D opioid use disorder

There are limited data on the efficacy of methadone or buprenorphine for the treatment of illicit fentanyl use. A retrospective study in Rhode Island showed that 6 months of methadone maintenance protected against death and promoted abstinence in fentanyl-exposed patients, but relapse rates were still high. Buprenorphine is a μ-opioid receptor partial agonist and κ-opioid receptor antagonist that is commonly used to treat opioid use disorder. It also exerts antidepressant and anxiolytic activity and is a promising treatment for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. A retrospective cohort study showed that 6-month treatment retention rates and opioid abstinence rates were not different between individuals who were positive for fentanyl or heroin at baseline before initiating buprenorphine treatment, indicating that buprenorphine may still be beneficial for treating fentanyl exposure. Repeated treatment with buprenorphine produced a greater magnitude of antinociceptive tolerance than higher-efficacy agonizts (e.g. morphine and etonitazene) in rats. Studies in pigeons and rhesus monkeys showed that the amount of tolerance that develops to the reinforcing potency of opioids depends on their efficacy, and the higher-efficacy μ-opioid receptor agonist sufentanil was more difficult to antagonize than the low-efficacy μ-opioid receptor agonist morphine –. These data indicate that buprenorphine may have lower efficacy for the treatment of fentanyl overdose compared with heroin overdose, although no human trials have been performed to date.

### Intravenous fentanyl for symptom management in hospitalized patients with refractory opioid withdrawal: a retrospective cohort study [^115fcwaM]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Potent synthetic opioids in the drug supply have resulted in patients with increasingly refractory opioid withdrawal syndromes. This study describes patient characteristics and short-term treatment outcomes for a cohort of hospitalized individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) treated with intravenous fentanyl for opioid withdrawal.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of inpatients with fentanyl use disorder and refractory opioid withdrawal, treated with intravenous fentanyl at St. Paul's Hospital (Vancouver, Canada) between November 2019 and December 2021. Descriptive variables included sociodemographic factors, substance use history, and fentanyl dosing. Treatment outcomes included retention in the hospital and initiation of medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Safety outcomes included opioid toxicity (excessive drowsiness, myoclonus, administration of naloxone, etc) and transfer to a higher level of care.

Results

Fifty-nine encounters were identified, consisting of 43 individuals (56% men), with 56% (n = 24) hospitalized with infection. Intravenous fentanyl bolus doses ranged from 250–5000 mcg. In 71% of encounters (n = 42), patients were prescribed 1000 mcg intravenously every 1–2 hours as needed. The average maximum dose received within 24 hours was a median of 6000 mcg (IQR: 3500–10150 mcg). Patients received a median of 9 days of treatment (IQR: 5–16 d). At discharge, 80% of encounters (n = 47) received an MOUD prescription. Opioid toxicity occurred in 19% of encounters (n = 11), including 8% (n = 5) overdoses. All overdose events involved the use of unregulated fentanyl.

Conclusions

Prescribed intravenous fentanyl may support the management of refractory opioid withdrawal for hospitalized patients with severe OUD. Further evaluation of approaches to manage patients with tolerance to fentanyl and other high-potency opioids is a research priority.

### Evidence of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in persons who use fentanyl [^115GEXkw]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Buprenorphine can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent persons with recent fentanyl use. However, the prevalence of this phenomenon is not clinically established. We sought to evaluate the incidence of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal in persons who use fentanyl.

Methods

We collected self-report data on opioid withdrawal symptoms after buprenorphine use, and, as a comparator, after methadone use, in 1679 individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorder across 49 addiction treatment centers in the United States.

Results

The odds of developing severe withdrawal symptoms significantly increased when taking buprenorphine within 24 hours after fentanyl use (OR = 5.202, 95% CI = 1.979–13.675, P = 0.001), and within 24 to 48hours after fentanyl use (OR = 3.352, 95% CI = 1.237–9.089, P = 0.017). As expected, patients did not report significantly higher rates of withdrawal when taking methadone after fentanyl use. Of those who waited less than 24hours after fentanyl before using buprenorphine or methadone, 22.19% (n = 152 of 685) and 11.56% (n = 23 of 199), respectively, reported severe opioid withdrawal.

Conclusions

This study supports previous anecdotal reports of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal from fentanyl. The odds of withdrawal symptoms significantly increased when taking buprenorphine after recent (within 48 hours) fentanyl use, however, this relationship was not observed in persons taking methadone, suggesting that this effect is specific to buprenorphine. Further research is urgently needed to describe the pharmacokinetics of non-medical fentanyl use to improve buprenorphine inductions strategies.

### Fentanyl transdermal [^115Fu5YS]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

9.3 Dependence

Both tolerance and physical dependence can develop during use of opioid therapy.

Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose).

Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of a physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.

Withdrawal may be precipitated through the administration of drugs with opioid antagonist activity (e.g., naloxone), mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics (e.g., pentazocine, butorphanol, nalbuphine), or partial agonists (e.g., buprenorphine). Physical dependence may not occur to a clinically significant degree until after several days to weeks of continued use.

Do not abruptly discontinue fentanyl transdermal system in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Rapid tapering of fentanyl transdermal system in a patient physically dependent on opioids may lead to serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, and suicide. Rapid discontinuation has also been associated with attempts to find other sources of opioid analgesics, which may be confused with drug-seeking for abuse.

When discontinuing fentanyl transdermal system, gradually taper the dosage using a patient-specific plan that considers the following: the dose of fentanyl transdermal system the patient has been taking, the duration of treatment, and the physical and psychological attributes of the patient. To improve the likelihood of a successful taper and minimize withdrawal symptoms, it is important that the opioid tapering schedule is agreed upon by the patient. In patients taking opioids for an extended period of time at high doses, ensure that a multimodal approach to pain management, including mental health support (if needed), is in place prior to initiating an opioid analgesic taper [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Infants born to mothers physically dependent on opioids will also be physically dependent and may exhibit respiratory difficulties and withdrawal signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Opioid withdrawal — onset and management in the emergency department notes that onset from the last exposure varies by opioid and amount, nominally 12 hours for heroin and up to 30 hours for methadone. Treatment may be symptomatic with α2-adrenergic agonists such as clonidine or lofexidine, plus antiemetics and atypical antipsychotics, but appropriate use of buprenorphine or methadone effectively alleviates withdrawal symptoms, and initial dosing may also serve to initiate medication for addiction treatment (MAT) for OUD.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^112WXEdA]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Clinical assessment and diagnosis — there are no validated clinical assessment tools for stimulant withdrawal, and individuals who appear unwell to a layperson should be evaluated by a qualified health care professional to determine the types and intensities of treatment needed. Health care staff should also be aware of the potential risk for opioid withdrawal, since stimulant drugs may be contaminated with opioids, including powerful synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and individuals may not be aware of everything they have taken and may not report opioid use or opioid withdrawal risk. If opioid use is suspected, the individual should be monitored for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and, when necessary, referred for an immediate clinical assessment. S-3 specifies that the clinical assessment of withdrawal risk should evaluate stimulant use in the past 48 hours, including amount used.

### Early results of implementing rapid methadone titration for hospitalized patients: a case series [^116WYcKD]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

With the rise of illicit fentanyl use in the United States, hospitalizations involving opioid use disorder (OUD) have increased. Fentanyl's high potency has resulted in challenges with treating OUD and opioid withdrawal during hospitalization. Given the fear of undertreated withdrawal, patients with OUD may delay hospitalization, self-direct their discharge, or use drugs in the hospital. – Gold standard treatment with methadone can help alleviate opioid withdrawal during hospitalization, though traditional starting doses are often insufficient to treat withdrawal among individuals using fentanyl.

With the challenges posed by fentanyl, medication initiations for OUD and opioid withdrawal are rapidly evolving. In hospital settings, clinicians have reported using full agonist opioids (FAO) to manage opioid withdrawal and rapid methadone titration (RMT) to more quickly alleviate opioid withdrawal symptoms. The use of RMT during hospitalization is relatively new, and clinicians are actively developing and piloting these among patients with OUD. Prior to RMT, traditional hospital methadone titrations have been guided by outpatient standards developed for patients using less potent opioids such as oxycodone and heroin. – These slower titrations were developed with consideration for methadone's half-life of 24 h, recommending time to allow methadone to reach steady state and reduce the risk of sedation. However, these methadone titrations may not effectively manage OUD and opioid withdrawal among patients primarily using fentanyl.

To improve opioid withdrawal and OUD treatment among patients initiating methadone, we developed and piloted RMT for hospitalized patients with OUD and daily fentanyl use and present the first 12 weeks of RMT findings. To our knowledge, our RMT protocol is among the fastest currently used. We hope shedding light on its use will help inform larger clinical practice.

### Examining the severity and progression of illicitly manufactured fentanyl withdrawal: a quasi-experimental comparison [^113YiHdu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Illicitly manufactured fentanyl has largely replaced heroin throughout the United States. Characteristics of fentanyl-specific withdrawal are not well understood compared to traditional opioid withdrawal. This study examines opioid withdrawal severity among 2 cohorts of study participants who underwent identical morphine stabilization procedures before and after fentanyl was introduced to the local drug market.

Methods

The Non-Fentanyl study (n = 103) included participants testing positive for non-fentanyl opioids, and the Fentanyl study (n = 30) included participants testing positive for fentanyl. Both studies completed a 7-day morphine stabilization protocol (30 mg subcutaneous, 4 times daily) and multiple daily self-report and observer-rated assessments of opioid withdrawal and vital signs. Two-way repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) examined the effects of study, time, and study × time on daily peak ratings for each outcome.

Results

There were significant elevations in self-report and observer-rated withdrawal scores among the Fentanyl versus Non-Fentanyl study (study × time, P < 0.05) during stabilization days 2–5 and days 2–6, respectively. There was a higher rate of tachycardia among the Fentanyl group compared to the Non-Fentanyl study, and peak diastolic blood pressure was greater among the Fentanyl study compared to the Non-Fentanyl study.

Conclusions

Individuals with fentanyl exposure were less stabilized by morphine and experienced more severe opioid withdrawal via several metrics compared to persons with non-fentanyl opioid exposure. Withdrawal also remained elevated for several days despite morphine initiation. Adjustments to existing treatment induction protocols may be needed given the permeation of fentanyl into the heroin supply.

### Buprenorphine precipitated opioid withdrawal: prevention and management in the ED setting [^117RiBCZ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Buprenorphine precipitated opioid withdrawal (BPOW) is an uncommon complication of buprenorphine initiation in the emergency department (ED), but it can produce significant discomfort and be distressing to patients. As EDs continue to care for those with opioid use disorder (OUD), clinicians should be aware of how to prevent and treat BPOW.

Objective

This narrative review provides an evidence-based update of the epidemiology, prevention strategies, and management of BPOW for the emergency clinician.

Discussion

BPOW is a rapid worsening of opioid withdrawal symptoms upon initiating buprenorphine. BPOW can be prevented by waiting for the onset of moderate Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) > 13 opioid withdrawal symptoms and a sufficient amount of time since last full opioid agonist use before buprenorphine administration. Risk factors for BPOW include chronic fentanyl use, methadone use, and concurrent benzodiazepine use. Alternative dosing strategies such as low-dose or "microdosing" and high-dose or "macrodosing" are options for buprenorphine that may impact the development of BPOW. The strategy of treating BPOW with more buprenorphine has a pharmacological basis and has been effective in case reports. Additional management is symptom-based and supportive. Although most cases have a benign course, patients may be significantly less likely to use buprenorphine for OUD in the future or seek care for substance use disorder.

Conclusions

Appropriate initiation of buprenorphine is important to prevent BPOW. Dosing buprenorphine should be based on the patient's patterns of opioid use and response to therapy. Management of BPOW should be symptom-based but include additional buprenorphine and adjunctive medications.

### Synergistic effect of ketamine and buprenorphine observed in the treatment of buprenorphine precipitated opioid withdrawal in a patient with fentanyl use [^111tDQwb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal treatment of buprenorphine precipitated opioid withdrawal (BPOW) is unclear. Full agonist treatment of BPOW is limited by buprenorphine's high-affinity blockade at mu-opioid receptors (μORs). Buprenorphine's partial agonism (low intrinsic efficacy) at μORs can limit the effectiveness of even massive doses once BPOW has begun. Adjunct medications, such as clonidine, are rarely effective in severe BPOW. Ketamine is an N -methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist with a potentially ideal pharmacologic profile for treatment of BPOW. Ketamine reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms independently of direct μOR binding, synergistically potentiates the effectiveness of buprenorphine μOR signaling, reverses (resensitizes) fentanyl induced μOR receptor desensitization, and inhibits descending pathways of hyperalgesia and central sensitization. Ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects potentially address depressive symptoms and subjective distress that often accompanies BPOW. Ketamine is inexpensive, safe, and available in emergency departments. To date, neither ketamine as treatment for BPOW nor to support uncomplicated buprenorphine induction has been described.

Case Description

We report a case of an illicit fentanyl-using OUD patient who experienced severe BPOW during an outpatient low-dose cross taper buprenorphine induction (ie, "microdose"). The BPOW was successfully treated in the emergency department with a combination of ketamine (0.6 mg/kg intravenous over 1 hour) combined with high-dose buprenorphine (16 mg sublingual single dose); 3 days later he was administered a month-long dose of extended-release subcutaneous buprenorphine which was repeated monthly (300 mg). At 90 days the patient remained in treatment and reported continuous abstinence from fentanyl use.

Conclusions

This single case observation raises important questions about the potential therapeutic role of ketamine as a treatment for BPOW. BPOW is an important clinical problem for which there is currently only limited guidance and no universally accepted approach. Prospective study comparing the effectiveness of differing pharmacologic approaches to treat BPOW is urgently needed.

### Buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal among hospitalized patients using fentanyl [^115fHRry]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

It is important to establish the incidence of buprenorphine PW from fentanyl because fentanyl is the predominant opioid involved in overdosesand because buprenorphine is the only US Food and Drug Administration–approved medication for OUD that is both associated with decreased mortalityand available across all US treatment settings. Opioid withdrawal during treatment initiation is associated with poor retention in outpatient careand with hospital discharges before medically advised. Concern for PW has led some individuals to decline treatment, and prompted 2 unions representing people who use drugs to call for new ways of initiating buprenorphine. Precipitated withdrawal may also dissuade clinicians, especially those less experienced with addiction treatment, from offering buprenorphine. This study found that PW occurred in only a minority of cases, suggesting that traditional or high-dose buprenorphine initiation should still be successful for most individuals using fentanyl. However, the higher incidence of PW in this study compared with prior research, indicates that further study is needed to identify at-risk individuals and elucidate underlying mechanisms.

To our knowledge, our exploratory analysis of factors associated with PW provides the first evidence supporting the theory that persistent opioid agonism from bioaccumulated fentanyl contributes to PW in a minority of persons using fentanyl. With chronic use, fentanyl accumulates in muscle and fat. As a result, terminal kidney clearance of fentanyl takes an average of 7 daysfor individuals with OUD and may be slower for people with higher BMI. We found that higher BMI and higher urine fentanyl concentration were associated with PW despite a COWS score of 8 or higher prior to receiving buprenorphine. One potential interpretation of these findings is that during early opioid abstinence, some individuals have low enough μ-opioid receptor activation to experience clinical opioid withdrawal but high enough μ-opioid receptor activation from bioaccumulated fentanyl to put them at risk of buprenorphine PW. Based on this interpretation, the amount of fentanyl exposure over time, the route of administration, and each person's capacity to store fentanyl might determine PW risk, not simply the presence of any fentanyl in the drug supply. These factors might explain divergent experiences with PW across regions. Currently in Philadelphia, 99% of powdered opioids contain fentanyl, intravenous fentanyl use is common, and average fentanyl purity (percentage of fentanyl by weight) is 12% to 15% but can be as high as 40%. In other regions, heroin is still available, fentanyl is smoked more than injected, and fentanyl purity may be lower.

### Extended-release injection vs sublingual buprenorphine for opioid use disorder with fentanyl use: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114PzeMG]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Fentanyl has exacerbated the opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid overdose epidemic. Data on the effectiveness of medications for OUD among patients using fentanyl are limited.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of sublingual or extended-release injection formulations of buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD among patients with and without fentanyl use.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Post hoc analysis of a 24-week, randomized, double-blind clinical trial conducted at 35 outpatient sites in the US from December 2015 to November 2016 of sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone vs extended-release subcutaneous injection buprenorphine (CAM2038) for patients with OUD subgrouped by presence vs absence of fentanyl or norfentanyl in urine at baseline. Study visits with urine testing occurred weekly for 12 weeks, then 6 times between weeks 13 and 24. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis from March 2022 to August 2023.

Intervention

Weekly and monthly subcutaneous buprenorphine vs daily sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Retention in treatment, percentage of urine samples negative for any opioids (missing values imputed as positive), percentage of urine samples negative for fentanyl or norfentanyl (missing values not imputed), and scores on opiate withdrawal scales and visual analog craving scales.

Results

Of 428 participants, 123 (subcutaneous buprenorphine, n = 64; sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone, n = 59; mean [SD] age, 39.1 [10.8] years; 75 men [61.0%]) had evidence of baseline fentanyl use and 305 (subcutaneous buprenorphine, n = 149; buprenorphine-naloxone, n = 156; mean [SD] age, 38.1 [11.1] years; 188 men [61.6%]) did not have evidence of baseline fentanyl use. Study completion was similar between the fentanyl-positive (60.2% [74 of 123]) and fentanyl-negative (56.7% [173 of 305]) subgroups. The mean percentage of urine samples negative for any opioid were 28.5% among those receiving subcutaneous buprenorphine and 18.8% among those receiving buprenorphine-naloxone in the fentanyl-positive subgroup (difference, 9.6%; 95% CI, -3.0% to 22.3%) and 36.7% among those receiving subcutaneous buprenorphine and 30.6% among those receiving buprenorphine-naloxone in the fentanyl-negative subgroup (difference, 6.1%; 95% CI, -1.9% to 14.1%), with significant main associations of baseline fentanyl status and treatment group. In the fentanyl-positive subgroup, the mean percentage of urine samples negative for fentanyl during the study was 74.6% among those receiving subcutaneous buprenorphine vs 61.9% among those receiving sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (difference, 12.7%; 95% CI, 9.6%-15.9%). Opioid withdrawal and craving scores decreased rapidly after treatment initiation across all groups.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial of sublingual vs extended-release injection buprenorphine for OUD, buprenorphine appeared to be effective among patients with baseline fentanyl use. Patients with fentanyl use had fewer opioid-negative urine samples during the trial compared with the fentanyl-negative subgroup. These findings suggest that the subcutaneous buprenorphine formulation may be more effective at reducing fentanyl use.

### Evidence on buprenorphine dose limits: a review [^1123sNKr]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

More than 80,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in 2021, an increase of 61% in only 2 years. The mortality surge is largely due to exposure to unregulated, illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogues (hereafter referred to as "fentanyl"). Fentanyl's lethality is conferred by its exceedingly high potency and lipophilicity. Buprenorphine and methadone, the 2 most effective medications for opioid use disorder (MOUDs), remain valuable tools to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) and reduce fentanyl overdose death and other harms. It is more important than ever to optimize their use at scale.

Dr. Nora Volkow, Director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, observes that "higher rates of tolerance and physical dependence associated with repeated fentanyl use might necessitate higher doses of methadone or buprenorphine than for other OUDs". Evolving research findings suggest a dangerous trend toward lower rates of MOUD initiation and retention since fentanyl use became prevalent, as well as a trend toward higher required doses of methadone.

The increased lethality of the drug supply highlights the importance of patient-centered care, which respects and responds to individuals' specific health needs and desired health outcomes, and ensures that patient values drive healthcare decisions. Examples of effective patient-centered strategies in treating substance use disorders include use of harm reduction principles, trauma-informed care, and peer recovery support. – A key component of patient-centered care in buprenorphine treatment for OUD is shared decision making in titrating the dose to achieve mutually agreed-upon treatment goals. Instead of collaboration, however, patients frequently face absolute dose limits of 16 or 24 mg/d. These limits often lead to inadequate protection against fentanyl use because of persistent withdrawal symptoms and craving — ultimately inducing patients to leave treatment.

In medicine, we are generally concerned about too high a dose being potential "poison". However, underdosing (eg, with oxygen, vasopressors, and antibiotics) can also lead to patient harm. Widespread underdosing of buprenorphine, if responsible for treatment failure, could directly harm many patients whose primary goals are simply to survive and avoid withdrawal. Because ongoing use of illicit fentanyl is frequently lethal, the rationale for buprenorphine dose limits must be evaluated carefully and justified using the highest standards of evidence.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to withdrawal management, ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend to do not initiate opioid withdrawal management with buprenorphine until there are objective signs of opioid withdrawal. Administer a dose of buprenorphine sufficient to suppress withdrawal symptoms (an initial dose of 2–4 mg titrated up as needed to suppress withdrawal symptoms) once signs of withdrawal have been objectively confirmed.

### Clinical practice guideline: assessment and treatment of adolescents and young adults with substance use disorders and problematic substance use (excluding tobacco) [^117KyBDM]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Adolescents and young adults with opioid use disorder (OUD) — buprenorphine initiation, settings, and treatment course are detailed as follows: Initiation of buprenorphine treatment can occur in office or by the patient at home, and can be in tablet, sublingual film, or injectable formulations, and to avoid precipitation of opioid withdrawal, buprenorphine is initiated only when the patient is already in opioid withdrawal. Long-acting opioids, such as methadone, require at least 48 to 72 hours since last use; short-acting opioids (eg, heroin) require approximately 12 hours since last use; however, fentanyl and its analogues may require longer time intervals. The initiation dose is used to calculate subsequent daily doses with the aim of achieving a maintenance dose, relapse is common but not incompatible with eventual successful treatment, and treatment should continue for as long as the patient is benefiting and it aligns with the patient's goals. Discontinuation carries significant risk of return to illicit opioid use, including elevated risk for a fatal or nonfatal opioid overdose, and combination with naloxone helps to prevent injection diversion and is safe to use during pregnancy.

WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE OF FENTANYL TRANSDERMAL SYSTEM

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess patient's risk before prescribing, and monitor regularly for these behaviors or conditions. (5.1)
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely, especially upon initiation or following a dose increase. (5.2)
Accidental exposure to fentanyl transdermal system, especially in children, can result in fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.3)
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate; limit dosages and durations to the minimum required; and follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. (5.4, 7)
Prolonged use of fentanyl transdermal system during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. (5.5)
To ensure that the benefits of opioid analgesics outweigh the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) for these products. (5.6)
Concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) can result in a fatal overdose of fentanyl. (5.7)

### Escalation of opioid withdrawal frequency and subsequent AMA rates in hospitalized patients from 2017 to 2020 [^114UwqGi]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Opioid-related overdose death rates continue to escalate. The emergence of fentanyl into the illicit drug supply has been implicated. The impact of the evolving opioid epidemic on health systems during the pandemic is less well described. Though Emergency room visits for nonfatal opi-oid-related overdoses increased despite decreases in overall admissions, – rates of hospitalizations of patients with opioid use disorders (OUD) and their outcome has not been reported. It is well known that patients who leave against medical advice (AMA) are at increased risk of adverse outcomes and readmissions. Moreover, patients with OUD are at high risk of leaving AMA because of the fear and under treatment of opioid withdrawal (OW). We hypothesized that the number of hospital admissions with OW and AMA increased during the last 4 years because of both the emerging fentanyl epidemic and COVID 19 pandemic. We conducted a retrospective study at a tertiary care health system in which Electronic Health Records-embedded screening and monitoring using the Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS), urine drug screening (UDS), and treatment of OW using buprenorphine or methadone are standardized practices.

### Fentanyl transdermal system [^1118WgeV]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

Discontinuation of Fentanyl Transdermal System

To convert patients to another opioid, remove fentanyl transdermal system and titrate the dose of the new analgesic based upon the patient's report of pain until adequate analgesia has been attained. Upon system removal, 17 hours or more are required for a 50% decrease in serum fentanyl concentrations. Opioid withdrawal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, and shivering) are possible in some patients after conversion or dose adjustment. For patients requiring discontinuation of opioids, a gradual downward titration is recommended since it is not known at what dose level the opioid may be discontinued without producing the signs and symptoms of abrupt withdrawal.

Tables C, D, and E should not be used to convert from fentanyl transdermal system to other therapies. Because the conversion to fentanyl transdermal system is conservative, use of Tables C, D, and E for conversion to other analgesic therapies can overestimate the dose of the new agent. Overdosage of the new analgesic agent is possible.

### Rapid vs standard induction to injectable extended-release buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial [^113bKH1E]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the only large, completed, multicenter, randomized clinical trial to compare 2 buprenorphine induction strategies onto extended-release buprenorphine. In participants with high-risk opioid use, these findings demonstrate that RI onto extended-release buprenorphine is well tolerated and had higher retention than SI at the second injection (primary end point; 312 [66.4%] vs 138 [54.5%]; difference, 11.8%). Similarly, RI had higher retention than SI in more difficult-to-treat fentanyl-positive participants (difference, 14.8%). RI did not increase the frequency or severity of AEs. These data add to the evolving published evidence supporting effectiveness and safety of single-day buprenorphine initiation, with or without fentanyl use, and are consistent with other instances in which only a single transmucosal buprenorphine dose is administered prior to initiation of an extended-release buprenorphine product.

Buprenorphine induction is the first step to stable buprenorphine maintenance. The ultimate goal of RI is to reach a therapeutic buprenorphine concentration as soon as possible to manage OUD without inducing precipitated withdrawal that could jeopardize continued engagement in extended-release buprenorphine treatment. This study shows that RI with same-day administration of extended-release buprenorphine increases the number of individuals who complete induction and receive injections 2 and 3. It also supports safe administration of the second injection at least 1 week after the first. By receiving the second extended-release buprenorphine injection earlier, patients minimized the time below target plasma buprenorphine levels (≥ 2 ng/mL), which helps to control symptoms of craving and withdrawal.

Many participants in this study reported long-term opioid (including fentanyl) use, daily use, polysubstance abuse, and prior failed attempts at opioid withdrawal or maintenance treatment with buprenorphine or other medications for OUD. Fentanyl use was a particularly strong risk factor for early withdrawal symptoms and discontinuation during buprenorphine therapy initiation. Poorer outcomes associated with fentanyl use were particularly apparent in the SI treatment arm. Despite differences in timing of visits and injection, treatment retention in the fentanyl-negative SI subpopulation in this study appears broadly consistent with expectations from the original phase 3 study conducted before widespread fentanyl availability, which reported induction (run-in) failure in 161 of 665 participants (24.2%). In contrast, the high induction failure rate 94 of 196 (48%) in the fentanyl-positive SI subpopulation supports reports of more difficult buprenorphine induction in the current fentanyl-dominated era.

### Replacement of fentanyl infusion by enteral methadone decreases the weaning time from mechanical ventilation: a randomized controlled trial [^116Um87K]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Abrupt interruption of IV opioids after more than five days of continuous infusion may lead to withdrawal manifestations; however, gradual tapering of fentanyl may delay extubation.

- Replacement of fentanyl by enteral methadone in critically ill adult patients who were on fentanyl infusion for more than five days may abbreviate weaning from mechanical ventilation without increasing withdrawal manifestations.

- Larger randomized controlled trials are required to confirm these observations.

### Opioid antagonists under sedation or anaesthesia for opioid withdrawal [^111zNgB8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Withdrawal (detoxification) is necessary prior to drug-free treatment. It may also represent the end point of long-term treatment such as methadone maintenance. The availability of managed withdrawal is essential to an effective treatment system.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions involving the administration of opioid antagonists to induce opioid withdrawal with concomitant heavy sedation or anaesthesia.

Search Strategy

Multiple electronic databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycLIT, Australian Medical Index, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, and CINAHL) were systematically searched. Reference lists of retrieved studies, reviews and conference abstracts were handsearched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the administration of opioid antagonists under sedation or anaesthesia with another form of treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

One reviewer assessed studied for inclusion and undertook data extraction. Inclusion decisions and the overall process were confirmed by consultation between all three reviewers.

Main Results

As yet, no studies have been published comparing treatment regimes involving the administration of opioid antagonists under sedation or anaesthesia with other approaches to detoxification. Treatment regimes for the studies considered for this review varied in the opioid antagonist used, the dose and mode of administration, the anaesthetic agent, duration of anaesthesia and adjunct medications employed. More detailed monitoring of withdrawal is required before any conclusions can be drawn as to what comprises a typical pattern of withdrawal and what factors might influence the pattern. There is only very limited information on referral to ongoing treatment, and relapse to opioid use. Together with the lack of adequate comparisons, this makes it impossible to draw any conclusions about the long-term effectiveness, or the cost-effectiveness, of withdrawal induced by opioid antagonists under sedation or anaesthesia.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Considerably more research evidence will be needed before any conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of managing withdrawal by administration of opioid antagonists under sedation or anaesthesia. The risk of vomiting during sedation and respiratory depression point to the approach being limited to facilities equipped for intubation and assisted ventilation, and with the capacity to respond to adverse events that might occur. The approach must be regarded as experimental with both risks and benefits remaining uncertain.

### Buprenorphine dose and time to discontinuation among patients with opioid use disorder in the era of fentanyl [^113V1jS8]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Fentanyl and other potent synthetic opioids (hereafter referred to as fentanyl) are driving overdose deaths in the US, with more than 71 000 fentanyl-related deaths in 2021 alone. Buprenorphine is effective for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) and is known to decrease mortality risk by 50% and confer other health and social benefits. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends a target dose of 16 mg for buprenorphine maintenance treatment, with an upper limit of 24 mg. This dosing guidance was established prior to the emergence of fentanyl in the illicit drug supplyand has not been formally reevaluated since fentanyl became widely available.

Some physicians have suggested that the current daily maintenance target dose of buprenorphine (16 mg) may be inadequate to control withdrawal and cravings in patients who used fentanyland that a higher daily dose may better suppress withdrawal and cravings. Such opinions are consistent with case studies demonstrating benefits of higher buprenorphine doses in patients who used fentanyl. Preclinical studies have shown that fentanyl is more efficacious as an agonist of mu opioid receptors than morphine, and so it downregulates opioid receptor expression to a higher degree. Correspondingly, fentanyl also induces tolerance to a higher degree than morphine, a result of reduced opioid receptor expression. Together, these findings perhaps explain why substitution therapy with a low-efficacy agonist like buprenorphine may require higher doses when treating patients exposed to fentanyl than those exposed to morphinan opioids (eg, heroin and oxycodone). Although observational analyses have also suggested higher buprenorphine doses may potentially improve treatment effectiveness, the findings have not been confirmed in a large study using data from the fentanyl era that considers patients' daily dose throughout follow-up.

To better understand the effectiveness of buprenorphine doses in the era of fentanyl for treatment of OUD, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to estimate the association between patients' daily buprenorphine dose and retention in treatment over 180 days. The study was conducted in a statewide population of Rhode Island residents initiating buprenorphine treatment during a period with widespread fentanyl availability (2016 to 2020). During this period, fentanyl was involved in most unintentional overdose deaths in Rhode Island, with 59% in 2016 and increasing to 76% in 2020. We hypothesized that, if fentanyl use increases the optimal buprenorphine dose, patients prescribed a lower dose would be more likely to discontinue treatment within 180 days of initiation.

### Extended-release injection vs sublingual buprenorphine for opioid use disorder with fentanyl use: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113Dt6dL]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

This 24-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 study was conducted at 35 US outpatient clinical centers. The study involved a 3-week screening period, a 12-week phase 1 (weekly visits), a 12-week phase 2 (monthly visits at weeks 16, 20, and 24, with 3 additional visits randomly assigned for urine sample collection and self-reporting of illicit drug use), and a 4-week follow-up period.

On day 1 (start of phase 1), eligible participants presented in opioid withdrawal and received a test dose of open-label sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone, 4 mg/1 mg. Participants who tolerated the test dose were randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment with daily sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone tablets (up to 24 mg/d) and weekly subcutaneous placebo injections (group 1) or daily sublingual placebo tablets and weekly subcutaneous buprenorphine injections (≤ 32 mg/week; group 2) for 12 weeks (phase 1). During phase 2 (weeks 13–24), participants continued to receive the same medications in a double-blind fashion, except that the subcutaneous injections transitioned from weekly to monthly administration (subcutaneous buprenorphine ≤ 160 mg/mo or matching placebo). After completing phase 2, patients transitioned to standard treatment (eg, sublingual buprenorphine) during the 4-week follow-up period.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^116SqHnP]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Opioid withdrawal — drug supply considerations and naloxone — Individuals may not always know that they have been using opioids or which opioids they have been using, and increasingly individuals are consuming counterfeit pills or drugs containing fentanyl; given the high potency of fentanyl mixed in with the drug supply, multiple doses of naloxone may be necessary to reverse an overdose. It is important for qualified health care professionals to understand the regional drug supply, remain current on clinical guidance, and regularly revisit response protocols. The veterinary tranquilizer xylazine, which is currently added to fentanyl and other illicit opioids, has been linked to many overdose deaths in the Northeast, and naloxone may be less effective in cases of overdoses involving opioids mixed with xylazine.

### Injectable-only overlapping buprenorphine starting protocol in a low-threshold setting [^111SezBz]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Unregulated fentanyl has substantially increased overdose fatalities in the community of drug users. Buprenorphine has been shown to effectively treat opioid use disorder (OUD), reducing all-cause mortality and overdose mortality; however, only approximately 20% of individuals who would benefit from medication for OUD receive treatment.

Initiating buprenorphine for OUD has become more challenging in the context of widespread unregulated fentanyl. Novel strategies for starting buprenorphine in acute care settings have shown promise. However, implementing these approaches in outpatient settings can be challenging.

Barriers to successful buprenorphine initiation include the multistep complexity of overlapping sublingual (low dose) buprenorphine starting protocols, the need to cease fentanyl use in withdrawal-first (high dose) protocols, and deliberate precipitation of withdrawal in naloxone-assisted methods. Such barriers can be heightened for people who experience homelessness, while the overdose risk among this population makes access to medications for OUD more crucial than ever.

There is considerable interest in the role long-acting injectable buprenorphine may have in reducing overdose risk and supporting patients who aim to reduce or stop using unregulated fentanyl. Implementation of long-acting injectable buprenorphine has been associated with high patient satisfaction; favorable changes in abstinence, accessibility, employment, and social relationships; and reduced fentanyl use in people with OUD.

In February 2025, the US Food and Drug Administration approved label changes for a monthly long-acting injectable buprenorphine product to include a rapid initiation protocol after a single 4-mg dose of sublingual buprenorphine to lessen practical obstacles to medication initiation. The manufacturer of the weekly long-acting injectable buprenorphine product also recommends a sublingual buprenorphine dose of at least 4 mg prior to injectable buprenorphine initiation. Recent evidence suggests that long-acting injectable buprenorphine can be effectively used to initiate patients in emergency department settings with minimal risk of precipitated withdrawal, provided these patients have a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of 4 or higher (with higher scores indicating greater opioid withdrawal).

### Investigation of monoclonal antibody CSX-1004 for fentanyl overdose [^1154jUo3]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

While our data provide strong evidence of CSX-1004's utility as an overdose reversal therapy, its most useful application may be in preventing fentanyl-related overdose. We consider the 5–15 fold fentanyl potency shifts in the NHP model requiring up to 0.18 mg/kg fentanyl (equal to 14.4 mg in a 80 kg adult) to be clinically relevant for overdose prevention regardless of opioid tolerance. While chronic opioid users exhibit a 4.3-fold reduced sensitivity to fentanyl-induced respiratory depression, the doses tested in NHPs are considered lethal regardless of opioid history. In patients who have experienced an opioid overdose or recently released from a controlled setting (e.g. in-patient detoxification program), the risk of a repeat overdose is extremely high within a 30-day period –. A single administration of CSX-1004 has the potential to provide 30-day protection during such a high-risk period. Thus CSX-1004 can provide a life-saving bridge to other treatments (e.g. buprenorphine) that address craving and withdrawal symptoms, with the option of receiving additional monthly infusions of CSX-1004. The extent, if any, that CSX-1004 may precipitate withdrawal in the setting of fentanyl dependence is currently being explored. However, the lack of competitive antagonism at MOR as well as the compatibility with withdrawal-relieving MOR agonists suggests any precipitated withdrawal symptoms could be adequately managed. Furthermore, CSX-1004, as a large molecule that does not enter the CNS, has no intrinsic abuse potential and does not impact the effects of opioids commonly employed in pain management and anesthesia.

### A case of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal managed with high-dose buprenorphine [^111WC6KS]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Buprenorphine-naloxone has a very high affinity for the mu-receptor and can cause precipitated opioid withdrawal, typically more severe than withdrawal that occurs naturally, when administered while a full mu-opioid receptor agonist remains in a person's system. To avoid precipitated withdrawal, one needs to be in mild to moderate opioid withdrawal at the time of buprenorphine-naloxone induction. Recently, there have been reported cases of precipitated withdrawal occurring in patients taking fentanyl knowingly or unknowingly, despite them being in adequate opioid withdrawal at the time of induction. When this occurs, the current recommendation is to provide 2 mg of buprenorphine-naloxone every 1–2 hours.

Objectives

Describe a case of successful management of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal with escalation of the dose of buprenorphine and highlight implications for future management.

Methods

We present a case of a patient with a history of opioid use disorder who was in moderate opioid withdrawal at the time of buprenorphine-naloxone induction and experienced precipitated withdrawal after buprenorphine-naloxone administration.

Results

High-dose buprenorphine-naloxone was given to the patient and precipitated withdrawal subsided after receiving a total of 20 mg. On the next day, the patient had no symptoms of opioid withdrawal and is currently maintained on 16 mg/day.

Conclusion

With the rising prevalence of fentanyl-laced drugs, increased instances of precipitated withdrawal are likely to be encountered. In cases of precipitated withdrawal, giving a high dose of buprenorphine-naloxone rapidly is safe and will allow rapid reversal of withdrawal symptoms.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^111PKyb5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Managing taper when BZDs are obtained illicitly — tapering can be complicated by counterfeit or novel synthetic BZDs that may evade standard testing; determining an equivalent starting dose is difficult; in general, clinicians should titrate the BZD dose to the minimum dose necessary to control withdrawal symptoms and taper from that point; clinicians should consider residential treatment if after-hours clinical monitoring or medical management is needed; counterfeit pills may contain fentanyl, so clinicians should monitor for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and counsel on harm reduction medications such as naloxone.

### Initiation and dose of methadone monotherapy vs combination therapy, 2015 to 2023 [^112asPSu]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The North American opioid toxicity crisis has claimed more than 500 000 lives since 2016, with an estimated two-thirds of deaths occurring among people with opioid use disorder (OUD). North America's potent and unpredictable fentanyl-dominated unregulated drug supply is the primary driver of this crisis, with more than 80% of opioid-related deaths attributed to fentanyl since 2018. Although methadone and buprenorphine are safe and effective opioid agonist treatments (OATs) for patients with OUD, treatment retention remains low, in part owing to the increased potency of the unregulated drug supply, and resultant elevated opioid tolerance among people with OUD. Specifically, patients are dissatisfied with traditional treatment regimens and often require much higher OAT doses compared with when the unregulated drug supply was dominated by heroin.

The increasing prevalence of opioid toxicities and need for improved OAT retention have driven rapid adaptation in OAT prescribing practices, particularly for methadone. Population-level evidence suggests improved treatment retention among persons using fentanyl compared with buprenorphine-naloxone. However, requirements for methadone initiation at subtherapeutic doses with gradual titration — owing to substantial interpatient variability in its pharmacokinetics — complicate the timely achievement of therapeutic doses that effectively manage opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It is suggested that individuals who use fentanyl are partially cross-tolerant to methadone's sedative and respiratory suppressant effectsand may initiate methadone at higher doses, with more rapid titration than previously considered appropriate. Therefore, in March 2021, the College of Physician and Surgeons of Ontario rescinded its methadone policy, which recommended a start low, go slow approach and prohibited physicians from initiating methadone at doses greater than 30 mg. Since then, the Ontario-based Mentoring, Education, and Clinical Tools for Addition–Partners in Health Integration (META-PHI) has released new recommendations for methadone prescribing among people who use fentanyl. Key components of the new guidance included initiation of methadone at 30 mg (the higher end of the previously allowed range), which may be increased by 10 to 15 mg every 3 to 5 days and in combination with slow-release oral morphine (SROM; used as OAT in Canada). The extent to which new approaches to methadone prescribing were adopted across Ontario remains unknown. Therefore, we described methadone initiation trends during the first 2 weeks of treatment across Ontario, Canada, in the context of changing prescribing guidance and an increasingly volatile unregulated drug supply.

### Withdrawal signs and symptoms among patients positive for fentanyl with and without xylazine [^1144EGpe]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) continues to be a major public health concern in the United States. Of the 106,699 overdose deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2021, 80,411 involved an opioid. Provisional data for 2022 from the CDC show that 68% of the 107,081 overdose deaths involve synthetic opioids other than methadone. One factor fueling the rise in overdoses is a diversification of opioids available in the illicit drug supply, from predominantly heroin to predominantly illicitly manufactured fentanyl, with other novel psychoactive substances introduced regularly, including xylazine.

Assessment of withdrawal may be complicated by the presence of substances other than opioids. The recent, widespread incorporation of xylazine into the illicit drug supply has introduced a new, nonopioid cause of central nervous system depression. Xylazine is a central α-2 adrenergic agonist, which causes sedation, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, and, potentially, cardiac arrest. The presence of substances in other drug classes (nonopioids) in the illicit opioid drug supply may result in a secondary withdrawal syndrome when exposed repeatedly. Therefore, providers may benefit from knowing what substances are present in the local illicit drug supply and local toxicology findings from biological specimens.

In this study, we investigate whether the presence of xylazine in the fentanyl drug supply impacts the clinical withdrawal syndrome. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a "xylazine withdrawal syndrome" that should be assessed for and potentially treated separately when managing patients with fentanyl use and suspected or confirmed xylazine exposure. To that aim, clinical measures were compared between individuals presenting for inpatient withdrawal management who positive for fentanyl (control group) compared to those copositive for fentanyl and xylazine (cases). We hypothesized that objective measures of Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), heart rate, blood pressure, and/or rates of self-directed discharge (SDD) and treatment completion will be different between cases and controls.

### Extended-release injection vs sublingual buprenorphine for opioid use disorder with fentanyl use: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113My27P]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Consistent with the primary outcome analysis, the main association of medication with the summary score of percentage of urine samples negative for any opioids suggests that subcutaneous buprenorphine is modestly more effective than buprenorphine-naloxone in reducing overall opioid use. The difference between treatment groups in the fentanyl-positive subgroup, although numerically favoring subcutaneous buprenorphine, was not significant. However, the treatment by time interaction in the repeated-measures analysis suggests that after the slow start for opioid-negative urine samples in the fentanyl-positive subgroup mentioned above, those treated with subcutaneous buprenorphine had more negative urine samples than those treated with buprenorphine-naloxone in the later weeks of the trial (Figure 2). Furthermore, within the fentanyl-positive subgroup, the summary scores of percentage of urine samples negative for fentanyl or norfentanyl were significantly greater among those treated with subcutaneous buprenorphine compared with buprenorphine-naloxone. An extended-release injectable formulation of buprenorphine may be advantageous, particularly for more severely ill patients using fentanyl, perhaps due to blood levels of the medication being more sustained than with sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone (for which patients may miss daily doses). The extended-release injectable formulation of naltrexone has been found to be advantageous for patients with alcohol use disorder or OUD and indicators of greater severity or adverse social determinants.

In the present study, there was no evidence of greater early dropout or withdrawal symptoms suggestive of precipitated withdrawal among the fentanyl-positive subgroup, consistent with recent studies. However, precipitated withdrawal continues to be described when buprenorphine is initiated in the setting of fentanyl or other high-potency opioids, which have increased in prevalence and in likely levels of exposure since the present study. As this study was not specifically designed to evaluate withdrawal during buprenorphine initiation, more research is needed to clarify the factors and conditions that may complicate buprenorphine initiation among individuals using high-potency opioids.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112XaVAG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Medications in opioid withdrawal — strategy overview describes two main strategies: the provision of gradually tapering doses of opioid agonists, typically methadone or buprenorphine, and the use of alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (FDA-approved lofexidine, and off-label use of clonidine) with other non-narcotic medications to reduce withdrawal symptoms; both are superior to no treatment with respect to withdrawal severity and treatment completion. Methadone and buprenorphine are generally more effective in reducing the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, and in patients that are quite anxious about the symptoms of the abstinence syndrome, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may be preferred. Evidence cited indicates methadone tapers or alpha-2 adrenergic agonists result in similar severity of withdrawal symptoms, buprenorphine may be more effective than alpha-2-adrenergic agonists in terms of withdrawal severity, duration, and treatment completion, managing withdrawal with alpha-2 adrenergic agonists may enable a more rapid initiation if treatment with naltrexone is planned, and buprenorphine and methadone appear to be similarly effective although data are limited.

### Methadone induction for a patient with precipitated withdrawal in the emergency department: a case report [^111RLGqX]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In the era of illicit fentanyl, reports on difficulties with buprenorphine inductions for patients with opioid use disorder are emerging. Methadone is the only other approved medication treatment with efficacy similar to buprenorphine but without risks of precipitated withdrawal. Unfortunately, outpatient methadone inductions can take days to weeks to complete, due in part to regulations that limit administration to opioid treatment programs. We describe a patient with opioid use disorder who presented to the emergency department in precipitated withdrawal who completed a same-day methadone induction with next-day dosing at an opioid treatment program as part of an emergency department methadone protocol. As opioid-related deaths rise, emergency department-initiated methadone is feasible for patients with opioid use disorder.

### Treatment of inpatient opioid withdrawal with short-acting full agonist opioids at a safety-net hospital [^112Jf5jx]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The use of SAFAO to treat opioid withdrawal syndrome in the acute care setting represents an expansion beyond current society guidelines, which endorse using methadone, buprenorphine, and non-opioid adjuncts. In this initiative to improve inpatient management of opioid withdrawal syndrome by an ACT, offering SAFAO to alleviate withdrawal did not dissuade the majority of patients from receiving medications for opioid use disorder during hospitalization. Despite this high rate of using methadone or buprenorphine, adequate treatment of opioid withdrawal syndrome required high doses of SAFAO, including IV agents. This supports the observation that methadone or buprenorphine alone may be insufficient to treat acute opioid withdrawal syndrome.– The inverse correlation between OMEs of SAFAO and COWS suggests this practice may have alleviated opioid withdrawal. Notably, pregnant and post-partum patients received higher SAFAO doses, which may reflect pregnancy-related augmentation of drug metabolism and/or more aggressive treatment of this sub-population.

Adverse events resulting directly from SAFAO were rare among these 124 hospitalizations. In-hospital substance use contributed to two adverse events and may have reflected under-treated withdrawal. Patients receiving additional sedating medications and those using only heroin may be at increased risk for adverse events. This latter finding suggests that despite high levels of fentanyl contamination in the heroin supply, patients with heroin use disorder may have lower opioid tolerance than those intentionally using fentanyl.

Patient-directed discharge was common in our cohort despite SAFAO use, although these discharges mostly preceded administration of peak doses. Patient-directed discharge may have been driven in part by opioid withdrawal, suggested by elevated COWS relative to patients with regular discharge and as shown in prior studies. The early timing of patient-directed discharge in this cohort suggests a need for more proactive management of opioid withdrawal syndrome early in hospitalization.

### Reddit discussions about buprenorphine associated precipitated withdrawal in the era of fentanyl [^114HKowa]. Clinical Toxicology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 Background

Buprenorphine (Suboxone ®, a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone) is an effective, evidence-based treatment for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). Buprenorphine has unique pharmacologic properties: it is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and has very high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor. Therefore, to avoid buprenorphine from displacing lower affinity, full agonist opioids (e.g. heroin) from the opioid receptor and causing withdrawal, patients seeking buprenorphine treatment must wait until they start experiencing withdrawal before initiating standard dosing regimens. If buprenorphine is initiated prior to withdrawal onset, it can displace residual opioids, causing an uncomfortable and sometimes severe acute withdrawal syndrome known as precipitated opioid withdrawal (POW). POW has been defined as an increase in the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), which measures the signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal, of 6 or more while initiating buprenorphine. Fear of POW poses a barrier to both clinicians and patients to buprenorphine initiation.

Multiple recently published reports suggest that POW can occur even after waiting the recommended amount of time in patients with a history of heavy fentanyl use. It has been proposed that this phenomenon may occur due to the high lipophilicity of fentanyl, resulting in a long tail of elimination after chronic use. One study showed that in patients with OUD and chronic fentanyl use, urinary metabolites of fentanyl could be detected 2–3 weeks after last use when hospitalized in a treatment program. Additional risk of severe POW could be related to the dose or length of use of full opioid agonist used prior to buprenorphine induction, time interval to receiving buprenorphine, and other comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions that alter metabolism of opioids or symptoms of POW. One potential alternative approach to avoid POW is microdosing, which involves overlapping induction of buprenorphine in very small escalating doses while still using full agonist opioids. The "Bernese Method" is one such method, although several different regimens have been described in the medical literature. While the literature on this subject is growing, many people with OUD have discovered these methods through their own lived experiences.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1122JZHe]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Withdrawal management with opioid agonists — methadone and buprenorphine notes that methadone and buprenorphine are both recommended for management of opioid withdrawal, and withdrawal management with methadone must be done in an OTP or inpatient setting. Opioid withdrawal management, on its own, without ongoing pharmacotherapy, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended, and ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate to the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. If the decision is made to taper, patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and methadone tapers generally start with doses in the range of 20–30 mg per day and are completed in 6–10 days.

### Precipitated withdrawal in the era of street fentanyl… [^117YEu7R]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The medication buprenorphine revolutionized the treatment of opioid use disorder. Whereas methadone involved complex dosing limited to highly regulated opioid treatment programs, buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist with efficacy similar to that of methadone, is rapidly titrated, has a low risk of overdose, and can be prescribed by any clinician for home use.

1. The only unique consideration in starting buprenorphine has been the recognition and avoidance of precipitated withdrawal. Due to its high affinity for the μ-opioid receptor, buprenorphine given too soon after the use of a full agonist may precipitate opioid withdrawal symptoms, including restlessness, sweating, anxiety, cramps, and tremors. Historically, avoiding precipitating withdrawal was straightforward and involved waiting to administer buprenorphine until the patient began to experience withdrawal, measured by the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale score.

However, reports of higher rates of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal have grown as fentanyl has replaced heroin in the street drug supply, even with high COWS scores and extended periods of abstinence. 2 Compared with heroin, fentanyl has a higher potency and shorter duration of action, resulting in patients using it more frequently and developing higher tolerance. Fentanyl is also lipophilic and may be retained in the body for a longer period. 3 Despite reports, 4 evidence confirming the association of buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal with street fentanyl remains limited. Patients missing COWS documentation before or 4 hours after buprenorphine initiation and those with a low COWS score were excluded. The primary outcome was precipitated withdrawal, defined as an increase in COWS score of 5 points or greater from immediately before to within 4 hours after buprenorphine administration.

The investigators also examined potential moderators including initial COWS score, initial buprenorphine dose, body mass index, and quantitative measurements of fentanyl in urine. With the relaxation of restrictions and advances in administration of buprenorphine and methadone, patients who use drugs have more options than ever to engage in medical treatment for OUD.

### Precipitated withdrawal with ED-initiated buprenorphine in the era of fentanyl… [^114ZeXQ6]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Data Sharing Statement Buprenorphine treatment is associated with decreased mortality and morbidity, 1 yet the treatment gap remains wide. Emergency departments offer an effective, low-barrier setting in which to initiate buprenorphine. 2 Retrospective case series3 have raised concerns about increased incidence of precipitated withdrawal when buprenorphine is initiated in persons using fentanyl, a high-potency μ-opioid agonist with high affinity and slow dissociation from the μ receptor. We report the incidence of PW as part of an ongoing randomized clinical trial4 comparing traditional sublingual buprenorphine with CAM2038, a 7-day extended-release injectable form of buprenorphine, conducted in sites with high prevalence of fentanyl. Patients with a COWS score of 8 or higher received 8 mg of sublingual buprenorphine in the ED and were discharged with a prescription for 16 mg/day.

Individuals with COWS scores of 4 to 7 received uniform instructions for unobserved induction, up to 12 mg the first day, and then 16 mg/day. In the extended-release buprenorphine group, on the basis of dose equivalency to 16 mg of sublingual buprenorphine, patients received 24 mg of injectable CAM2038 in the ED during the index visit and follow-up. 3 Data analysis was performed with SAS statistical software version 9.
4. Routes of use, changes in baseline and peak COWS scores, and time elapsed from buprenorphine administration to PW varied. Time since last use ranged from 8 to more than 24 hours. All patients experiencing PW were discharged after symptoms resolved, with 1 self-directed discharge. Follow-up rates at 7 days after the ED visit were 86%. Limitations include possible undetected fentanyl analogues or nitazenes leading to PW.

We may have missed PW after discharge, although follow-up rates at 7 days after the ED visit were 86% and likely would be captured as adverse events. In this geographically diverse observational cohort, buprenorphine induction in the ED remained safe and effective, even with fentanyl present. Continued access to buprenorphine for opioid use disorder treatment is essential given the ongoing overdose crisis.

10. 1001/jama.
1980. 03300300021018. Clonidine hydrochloride was administered to ten patients in an inpatient setting after abrupt discontinuation of chronic methadone hydrochloride administration. Clonidine produced a rapid and statistically significant decrease in opiate withdrawal signs and symptoms. Clonidine administration for 14 days enabled all patients to be successfully detoxified from chronic opiate administration. In all patients studied, clonidine was a safe and effective nonopiate treatment of opiate withdrawal that suppressed the affect, signs, and symptoms of opiate withdrawal. These data support the hypothesis that the α2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine, has substantial antiwithdrawal effect by replacing opiate-mediated inhibition with α2-mediated inhibition of brain noradrenergic activity.

### Notes from the field: suspected medetomidine withdrawal syndrome among fentanyl-exposed patients-Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, September 2024-January 2025… [^115vChHR]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

During September 2024–January 2025, 165 patients at three Philadelphia health systems were hospitalized for fentanyl withdrawal complicated by profound autonomic dysfunction, including severe hypertension and tachycardia. This syndrome was resistant to medications that had previously been effective in managing fentanyl and xylazine withdrawal but was responsive to dexmedetomidine., or oxycodone), sedatives, and adjunctive opioid and xylazine withdrawal medications. Median age was 38 years. This evaluation was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of health systems A, B, and C. Among the 165 patients, 150 required intensive care unit care, including 39 who received endotracheal intubation.

A total of 137 patients were treated with and responded to dexmedetomidine* infusion, a drug eventually recognized as potentially effective; medetomidine is an enantiomer † of dexmedetomidine, and prolonged dexmedetomidine exposure can induce a withdrawal syndrome manageable with controlled weaning from the drug. Traditional dosages of dexmedetomidine were used and titrated to control symptoms or sedate patients with intubation. In a majority of patients requiring dexmedetomidine, the drug was titrated to a maximum dosage of 1. 5 μ g/kg/hr. Top Preliminary Conclusions and Actions The syndrome described in this report is similar to that described among ICU patients with days-long exposure to dexmedetomidine, an enantiomer of medetomidine, who experience an autonomic withdrawal syndrome with vomiting and agitation when dexmedetomidine is discontinued.

In the patients described in this report, these signs and symptoms were not resolved by increasing doses of medications previously effective in managing fentanyl and xylazine withdrawal; however, they were responsive to dexmedetomidine, as described in the management of dexmedetomidine withdrawal.
