## Question

can kids with ear tubes swim

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether children with tympanostomy tubes can swim and whether routine water precautions are necessary. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality evidence base, especially randomized trials and contemporary guidelines. Then, I should verify the magnitude of any benefit from earplugs or avoidance. Next, I will consider subgroup exceptions where precautions might still be reasonable. Finally, I will translate this into practical, safety-focused counseling for families, including what to do if drainage occurs and how to handle different water environments.

> Let me first confirm the core recommendation from the most authoritative sources. The 2022 American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) update issues a strong recommendation against routine, prophylactic water precautions for children with tympanostomy tubes, concluding that the balance of benefits and harms favors allowing normal swimming without plugs or avoidance, with aggregate evidence quality graded as Grade B and a high level of confidence in the evidence [^10a9649b] [^c94ee9a1].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base behind that stance. Multiple randomized controlled trials and a Cochrane review show that routine earplugs or swimming avoidance do not meaningfully reduce otorrhea. One RCT found a small, statistically significant reduction in otorrhea with plugs but concluded the absolute benefit was tiny and clinically insignificant, estimating a child would need to wear plugs for 2.8 years to prevent a single episode, while another multicenter RCT found no difference in otorrhea between protected and unprotected ears, and a Cochrane review rated the overall quality of evidence for routine precautions as low to very low [^345c9634] [^9ed9bb10] [^f8038f82] [^d69cd437].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider subgroup exceptions where precautions may be reasonable. Guidelines advise that water precautions can be considered selectively in children with recurrent or persistent tube otorrhea, those with discomfort when water enters the ear, exposure to contaminated or non-chlorinated water (e.g., lakes), deep diving or forceful water entry, or during active drainage episodes, recognizing that these are exceptions rather than the rule [^c94ee9a1] [^c3885432] [^d69cd437].

> I need to ensure I'm distinguishing tympanostomy tube otorrhea from swimmer's ear. Tube otorrhea is middle-ear drainage through the tube and is typically managed with topical antibiotic drops without oral antibiotics, whereas swimmer's ear is an external canal infection where water-exposure precautions are standard during treatment; conflating these can lead to over-restriction for children with tubes who do not have external otitis [^d5044d93] [^c7241823] [^bdeb38e9].

> Next, I should review practical counseling points. Families should be told that most children with tubes can swim freely in chlorinated pools, bathe, and shower without plugs; if there is current drainage or the child reports pain with water exposure, temporary precautions such as silicone earplugs or a petroleum-jelly-coated cotton ball can be used during bathing or swimming until the episode resolves; after water exposure, gentle drying maneuvers like tilting the head and pulling the earlobe, or using a hair dryer on low, can be used if the child is prone to moisture-related discomfort, though these are optional and not mandated by evidence [^c3885432] [^bdeb38e9] [^5d6c66dc].

> But wait, what if the child is swimming in a lake or dunking deeply underwater? I should double-check that nuance. Observational modeling suggests higher rates of middle-ear contamination with deeper submersion, so for lake swimming or repeated deep dives, a cautious approach with plugs or avoidance may be reasonable even though direct causal links to otorrhea are inconsistent; this aligns with guideline allowances for selective precautions in higher-risk exposures or in children with prior water-triggered symptoms [^b273fe1c] [^c94ee9a1] [^d69cd437].

> I will now examine what to do if drainage occurs. If there is otorrhea, caregivers should treat with topical antibiotic drops (commonly ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin with or without steroid) and avoid getting the ear wet until the drainage stops; oral antibiotics are not routinely needed for uncomplicated tube otorrhea, and families should be taught to clean crusts and deliver drops effectively, often with tragal pumping to improve middle-ear penetration [^d5044d93] [^bdeb38e9] [^310c85ee].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. Yes, most children with tympanostomy tubes can swim without routine earplugs or water avoidance; routine precautions do not provide a clinically meaningful reduction in otorrhea and may impose burden and anxiety, so the default should be unrestricted swimming with selective, situation-specific precautions for those with recurrent otorrhea, water sensitivity, or high-risk exposures, and any active drainage should be managed with topical therapy and brief water avoidance until cleared [^10a9649b] [^c94ee9a1] [^d69cd437].

Children with ear tubes **can swim without routine water precautions** [^10a9649b] because high-quality evidence shows no clinically significant reduction in otorrhea with earplugs or avoidance [^d69cd437] [^f8038f82]. Routine use of earplugs or headbands is **not recommended** [^c94ee9a1]; however, consider plugs for children with recurrent otorrhea, discomfort with water exposure, or when swimming in contaminated or untreated water (e.g. lakes, rivers) [^c3885432] [^d69cd437]. If drainage occurs, treat with topical antibiotic drops and avoid water until clear [^bdeb38e9] [^d5044d93]. Overall, **most children with tubes can enjoy swimming** with minimal risk and normal activities [^c3885432].

---

## Evidence on swimming and water exposure

Multiple studies and guidelines consistently show that routine water precautions (earplugs, headbands, or avoidance) **do not significantly reduce otorrhea** in children with tympanostomy tubes [^10a9649b] [^f8038f82]. A Cochrane review found only a small, clinically insignificant reduction in otorrhea with earplugs, and no benefit from avoiding swimming or head immersion [^f8038f82]. Similarly, a randomized controlled trial found no difference in otorrhea between children using ear protection and those without during water activities [^9ed9bb10].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) 2022 guidelines **strongly recommend against routine water precautions** for children with tympanostomy tubes [^10a9649b]. They advise that earplugs and headbands are unnecessary for most children, though they may be considered in specific scenarios such as recurrent otorrhea, discomfort with water exposure, or swimming in contaminated or untreated water [^c94ee9a1] [^c3885432].

---

## Risks associated with swimming

While swimming itself does not significantly increase the risk of otorrhea, certain factors may increase susceptibility to infection or discomfort:

- **Water quality**: Swimming in contaminated or untreated water (e.g. lakes, rivers) may increase the risk of infection [^c3885432] [^d4bb387d].
- **Individual susceptibility**: Children with recurrent otorrhea or sensitive ears may experience discomfort or infection more frequently [^c94ee9a1].
- **Depth of immersion**: Deeper immersion or diving may increase the likelihood of water entering the middle ear, though the clinical significance of this is limited [^b273fe1c].

---

## Practical recommendations for parents and caregivers

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following practical recommendations are advised:

- **Routine swimming**: Most children with ear tubes can swim without routine use of earplugs or headbands [^10a9649b].
- **Contaminated water**: Consider using earplugs or avoiding swimming in untreated or contaminated water sources [^c3885432].
- **Recurrent otorrhea**: If a child experiences frequent ear drainage, consider using earplugs during water activities [^c94ee9a1].
- **Discomfort**: If a child experiences discomfort or pain during water activities, consider using earplugs or other protective measures [^c3885432].
- **Active drainage**: If there is active ear drainage, avoid swimming until the drainage resolves and treat with topical antibiotic drops as recommended by a healthcare provider [^bdeb38e9] [^d5044d93].

---

## Management of ear infections or drainage

If a child with ear tubes develops ear drainage or infection, the following steps are recommended:

- **Topical antibiotic drops**: Use topical antibiotic drops (e.g. ofloxacin) as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated otorrhea [^d5044d93] [^b6df5e4b].
- **Avoid water exposure**: Temporarily avoid swimming or water exposure until the drainage resolves [^bdeb38e9].
- **Regular follow-up**: Ensure regular follow-up with the healthcare provider to monitor tube function and address any complications [^759956de].

---

## Conclusion

Children with ear tubes **can safely swim without routine water precautions** [^10a9649b]. Current evidence and guidelines indicate that routine use of earplugs or avoidance of swimming does not significantly reduce the risk of otorrhea or infection [^f8038f82]. Parents and caregivers should use judgment regarding water quality and individual susceptibility, and consult with their healthcare provider if the child experiences recurrent otorrhea or discomfort [^c94ee9a1].

### Water precautions for prevention of infection in children with ventilation tubes (grommets) [^f8038f82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Following middle ear ventilation tube (tympanostomy tube or grommet) insertion, most surgeons advise that a child's ears should be kept dry during the immediate postoperative period. Following the initial period some surgeons will permit swimming or bathing, whereas other surgeons will recommend ongoing water precautions. A large number of studies have been conducted to explore the association between water exposure and ear infections in children with ventilation tubes, however a range of differing conclusions exist regarding the need for water precautions and there is wide variation in clinical practice.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of water precautions for the prevention of ear infections in children with ventilation tubes (grommets), at any time while the tubes are in place.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 8); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Clinicaltrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 September 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials recruiting children (0 to 17 years) with ventilation tubes and assessing the effect of water precautions while the tubes are in place. We considered all forms of water precautions, including behavioural (i.e. avoidance or swimming/bathing restrictions) and mechanical (ear plugs/moulds or hats/bands).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcome measures were episodes of otorrhoea and adverse effects; secondary outcomes were antimicrobial prescriptions for ear infections, ventilation tube extrusion, surgical intervention to remove ventilation tubes and hearing outcomes.

Main Results

Two randomised controlled trials recruiting a total of 413 patients met the criteria for inclusion in our review; one study had a low risk of bias and the other study had a high risk of bias. Ear plugs versus control One study recruited 201 children (aged six months to six years) who underwent myringotomy and ventilation tube insertion. The study compared an intervention group who were instructed to swim and bathe with ear plugs with a control group; the participants were followed up at one-month intervals for one year. This study, with low risk of bias, showed that the use of ear plugs results in a small but statistically significant reduction in the rate of otorrhoea from 1.2 episodes to 0.84 episodes in the year of follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.36 episodes per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.45 to -0.27). There was no significant difference in ventilation tube extrusion or hearing outcomes between the two study arms. No child required surgical intervention to remove ventilation tubes and no adverse events were reported. Water avoidance versus control Another study recruited 212 children (aged three months to 12 years) who underwent myringotomy and ventilation tube insertion. The study compared an intervention group who were instructed not to swim or submerge their heads while bathing with a control group; the participants were followed up at three-month intervals for one year. This study, with high risk of bias, did not show any evidence of a reduction or increase in the rate of otorrhoea (1.17 episodes per year in both groups; MD 0 episodes, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.14). No other outcomes were reported for this study and no adverse events were reported. Quality of evidence The overall quality (GRADE) of the body of evidence for the effect of ear plugs on the rate of otorrhoea and the effect of water avoidance on the rate of otorrhoea are low and very low respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

The baseline rate of ventilation tube otorrhoea and the morbidity associated with it is usually low and therefore careful prior consideration must be given to the efficacy, costs and burdens of any intervention aimed at reducing this rate. While there is some evidence to suggest that wearing ear plugs reduces the rate of otorrhoea in children with ventilation tubes, clinicians and parents should understand that the absolute reduction in the number of episodes of otorrhoea appears to be very small and is unlikely to be clinically significant. Based on the data available, an average child would have to wear ear plugs for 2.8 years to prevent one episode of otorrhoea. Some evidence suggests that advising children to avoid swimming or head immersion during bathing does not affect rates of otorrhoea, although good quality data are lacking in this area. Currently, consensus guidelines therefore recommend against the routine use of water precautions on the basis that the limited clinical benefit is outweighed by the associated cost, inconvenience and anxiety. Future high-quality studies could be undertaken but may not be thought necessary. It is uncertain whether further trials in this area would change the findings of this review or have an impact on practice. Any future high-quality research should focus on determining whether particular groups of children benefit more from water precautions than others, as well as on developing clinical guidelines and their implementation.

Water exposure with tympanostomy tubes — routine precautions and when to consider them — is summarized as follows: Water precautions with consistent use of ear plugs are unnecessary for most children with tympanostomy tubes, but water precautions may be implemented during an episode of acute TTO, if the child is prone to recurrent acute TTO, or if the child has transient discomfort upon exposure to water during swimming, diving, or hair washing.

Ear tubes — indications and water guidance emphasize benefits and simple precautions. Ear tubes are recommended for "frequent ear infections or prolonged fluid in the ears" to "Help decrease the number of ear infections," allow treatment with "antibiotic ear drops instead of antibiotics that are taken by mouth," "Help prevent fluid from backing up" into the middle ear, and "Improve hearing" reduced by fluid. For water activities, "Your child will not usually need ear plugs," and "Head bands or other special efforts… are also unnecessary, but may be helpful" when there is "Pain or discomfort when water enters the ear canal," "Current fluid or drainage," "Swimming in lakes or non-chlorinated pools that are not clean," or "Dunking head in the bathtub." The guide cautions, "NEVER use Play-Doh or Silly Putty as an ear plug — these materials can become trapped in the ear canal and even require surgical removal."

### Prevention and treatment of tympanostomy tube otorrhea: a meta-analysis [^28c6867a]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Children with tympanostomy tubes often develop ear discharge.

Objective

Synthesize evidence about the need for water precautions (ear plugs or swimming avoidance) and effectiveness of topical versus oral antibiotic treatment of otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes.

Data Sources

Searches in Medline, the Cochrane Central Trials Registry and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Excerpta Medica Database, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature.

Study Selection

Abstracts and full-text articles independently screened by 2 investigators.

Data Extraction

25 articles were included.

Results

One randomized controlled trial (RCT) in children assigned to use ear plugs versus no precautions reported an odds ratio (OR) of 0.68 (95% confidence interval, 0.37–1.25) for > 1 episode of otorrhea. Another RCT reported an OR of 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.29–1.76) for nonswimmers versus swimmers. Network meta-analyses suggest that, relative to oral antibiotics, topical antibiotic-glucocorticoid drops were more effective: OR 5.3 (95% credible interval, 1.2–27). The OR for antibiotic-only drops was 3.3 (95% credible interval, 0.74–16). Overall, the topical antibiotic-glucocorticoid and antibiotic-only preparations have the highest probabilities, 0.77 and 0.22 respectively, of being the most effective therapies.

Limitations

Sparse randomized evidence (2 RCTs) and high risk of bias for nonrandomized comparative studies evaluating water precautions. Otorrhea treatments include non-US Food and Drug Administration approved, off-label, and potentially ototoxic antibiotics.

Conclusions

No compelling evidence of a need for water precautions exists. Cure rates are higher for topical drops than oral antibiotics.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^d69cd437]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Water precautions after tympanostomy tubes — evidence and selective use: Routine water precautions do not show a clinically significant reduction in otorrhea; in a randomized trial, a child would need to wear plugs for 2.8 years to prevent one acute TTO, with any-otorrhea episodes reduced from 56% to 47% and mean incidence from 0.10 per month to 0.07 per month. Additional randomized trials randomized 244 children to water precautions versus none with no benefits attributable to the routine water precautions, and randomized 80 children with no group differences during months 2 to 13 after surgery. The available clinical evidence continues to find no clinically significant reduction in otorrhea with routine water precaution. Water precautions may be prudent for some children in defined clinical situations, including children with recurrent or persistent otorrhea (particularly with P aeruginosa or S aureus), those with risk factors such as immune dysfunction, exposure to highly contaminated water, deep diving, or ear discomfort during swimming, and an acceptable approach would be to first avoid water precautions and instead reserve them for children with recurrent or persistent TTO.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^10a9649b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Water precautions for children with tympanostomy tubes — recommendation and rationale: Clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs or headbands, avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. Recommendation against is based on systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials with consistent effects and a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade B and the level of confidence in evidence is High. Benefits include allowing for normal activity and swimming, reduced anxiety, and cost savings; risks include potential for slight increase in otorrhea rates in some children. The benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, and intentional vagueness clarifies that the word routine allows advising water precautions for subgroups in specific situations (eg, lake swimming, deep diving, history of recurrent otorrhea, head dunking in the bathtub, or otalgia from water entry into the ear canal).

### Water precautions and tympanostomy tubes: a randomized, controlled trial [^345c9634]. The Laryngoscope (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

The objective was to determine whether there is an increased incidence of otorrhea in young children with tympanostomy tubes who swim and bathe without water precautions as compared with children who use water precautions in the form of ear plugs.

Study Design

Prospective, randomized, investigator-blinded, controlled trial.

Methods

Two hundred one children (age range, 6 mo-6 y) who had undergone bilateral myringotomy and tube insertion were randomly assigned into one of two groups: swimming and bathing with or without ear plugs. Children were seen monthly for 1 year and whenever there was intercurrent otorrhea.

Results

Ninety children with and 82 children without ear plugs returned for at least one follow-up visit. Mean (SD) duration of follow-up was 9.4 (4.1) months for the children with ear plugs and 9.1 (4.4) months for the children without ear plugs. Forty-two children (47%) who wore ear plugs developed at least one episode of otorrhea, as compared with 46 (56%) who did not use ear plugs (logistic regression adjusting for stratification variables, P = 0.21). The mean (SD) rate of otorrhea per month was 0.07 (0.31) for the children who wore ear plugs as compared with 0.10 (0.31) for the children who did not wear ear plugs (Poisson regression adjusting for stratification variables, P = 0.05).

Conclusion

There is a small but statistically significant increase in the rate of otorrhea in young children who swim and bathe without the use of ear plugs as compared with children who use ear plugs. Because the clinical impact of using ear plugs is small, their routine use may be unnecessary.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^bcb412d7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — perioperative and postoperative care: in the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications; clinicians should not routinely prescribe postoperative antibiotic ear drops after tympanostomy tube placement; and clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs or headbands, avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^402a631c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for otitis media with effusion, more specifically with respect to tympanostomy tube care (AAO-HNSF), AAO-HNS 2022 guidelines recommend to do not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs or headbands, avoidance of swimming or water sports) in pediatric patients with tympanostomy tubes.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^d1e773bc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Table 5 key action statements (KAS) for tympanostomy tubes in children specify the following actions: The clinician should not place long-term tubes as initial surgery for children who meet criteria for tube insertion unless there is a specific reason based on an anticipated need for prolonged middle ear ventilation beyond that of a short-term tube. Clinicians may perform adenoidectomy as an adjunct to tympanostomy tube insertion for children with symptoms directly related to the adenoids (adenoid infection or nasal obstruction) OR in children aged 4 years or older to potentially reduce future incidence of recurrent otitis media or the need for repeat tube insertion. In the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications. Clinicians should not routinely prescribe postoperative antibiotic ear drops after tympanostomy tube placement. Clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. Clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs or headbands, avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. The surgeon or designee should examine the ears of a child within 3 months of tympanostomy tube insertion AND should educate families regarding the need for routine, periodic follow-up to examine the ears until the tubes extrude.

### Effect of water precautions on otorrhea incidence after pediatric tympanostomy tube: randomized controlled trial evidence [^9ed9bb10]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Tympanostomy with ventilation tube insertion is the most common otologic surgery. Many surgeons recommend water precautions, although its utility is questioned. We aimed to investigate if water precautions reduce the rate of otorrhea after transtympanic tube insertion.

Study Design

Multicenter randomized controlled trial.

Subjects and Methods

A total of 244 children aged 2 to 10 years undergoing their first set of Shepard tubes for otitis media with effusion and concomitant adenoidectomy were randomized to 2 groups: 1 with ear protection during water exposure (ear plugs and headbands, n = 130) and 1 without (n = 114). Bathing or swimming with unprotected ears was considered the exposure event and incidence of otorrhea, the primary outcome. Outcomes were assessed during the 6-month follow-up period.

Results

In the water precaution group, 32% had at least 1 episode of otorrhea as compared with 22% in the unprotected group, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.09). Only 37% of the episodes of otorrhea in the protected group and 36% in the unprotected group had a temporal relation to water exposure (no difference, P = 0.81). Respectively, 56% and 52% of the episodes of otorrhea were in the context of upper respiratory tract infection. Global quality of life improved significantly, irrespective of whether water protection was prescribed.

Conclusion

The incidence of otorrhea was not different with or without prescription of ear protection during water exposure among children with tympanostomy tubes, which supports current guideline recommendations that routine water precautions are unnecessary in this population.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^bdeb38e9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — care during ear drainage and use of ear drops is addressed as follows: If you see drainage from the ear, we recommend the following: Antibiotic ear drops, without oral antibiotics, are all that is needed in most cases (usually ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone). Do NOT use over the counter ear drops. Ear drainage may build up or dry at the opening of the ear canal, so remove the crusting with a cotton-tipped swab dipped in hydrogen peroxide or warm water, and if thick you can roll up a piece of tissue or toilet paper to help soak it up before using ear drops. Do not swim during infections when there is drainage or discharge coming from the ear; during bathing, use silicone ear plugs, or coat a small cotton ball with petroleum jelly and use it to cover the opening of the ear canal. Use the ear drops only for the amount of time recommended by your doctor, because using them too long could result in a yeast infection. Antibiotics taken by mouth are not needed for most ear drainage with tubes in place, although they may be needed if there is another reason to be on an antibiotic or if the infection does not go away after using only ear drops. When using ear drops, do the following to help pump the drops in the ear canal and get down to the ear tube: Have your child lay down on their side, put ear drops into opening of ear canal, then push down on tragus 4–5 times to help pump the drops into the canal. Most children do not typically have fever or pain when they have ear drainage with tubes in place.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^ec18fff4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Generalizability of evidence regarding risks and benefits — population scope: most high-quality evidence on tympanostomy tube efficacy and adverse events comes from studies of otherwise healthy children without comorbid illnesses, syndromes, or disorders; the need to identify at-risk children for intervention with tubes was reaffirmed and the scope of underlying conditions was expanded, and recommendations in this update must be interpreted with the caveat that they may involve extrapolations from studies in otherwise healthy children.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^3cefa46b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Statement 1 — OME of short duration: Clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) of less than 3 months' duration, from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Recommendation against based on systematic review of observational studies of natural history and an absence of any randomized controlled trials on efficacy of tubes for children with OME less than 2 to 3 months' duration and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile highlights a quality improvement opportunity to prevent overuse of tympanostomy tubes in children unlikely to derive benefit from surgery (National Quality Strategy Domain: Patient Safety, Effective Prevention and Treatment) and lists aggregate evidence quality as Grade C.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^759956de]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — follow-up after insertion: The surgeon or designee should examine the ears of a child within 3 months of tympanostomy tube insertion AND should educate families regarding the need for routine, periodic follow-up to examine the ears until the tubes extrude. Strong recommendation based on randomized controlled trials, a systematic review, and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^b6b3f988]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Ear tubes — a caregiver's guide outlines tube longevity and follow-up intervals. Most ear tubes last about 6 to 18 months, and by the time the tube comes out about 80% of children will have much better ear function and will not need replacement. Postoperative surveillance is described as "We will see your child within 3 months," with ongoing follow-up "usually every 6 months" while tubes are in place, and a "Final Visit" after 6–12 months once the tubes fall out for an ear check.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^d5b8bb98]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Ear tubes — complications and tube course include perforation, tube position, and extrusion/retention timelines. Perforation risk is reported as "About 1–2 out of every 100 children" after a short-term tube, with "up to 1 in every 5 children" after a long-term tube, and "The hole will often close on its own" or can be repaired. Tubes almost always fall out into the ear canal, though "Very rarely" one can fall "into the middle ear." Most tubes come out "within 12 to 24 months," while tubes still present "after 2 to 3 years" can be removed; early extrusion can occur "before 6 months." Scarring on the eardrum is "usually of no concern."

Middle Ear Infection

A middle ear infection is a bacterial infection behind the eardrum. People with a hole or a tube in the eardrum may notice a discharge (fluid draining) in the ear canal.

Ear canal infection

An ear canal infection (also known as "Swimmer's Ear") is a bacterial infection of the ear canal. The ear canal and the outer part of the ear may swell, turn red, and be painful. Also, a fluid discharge may appear in the ear canal.

Who should NOT use Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

Do not use this product if you are allergic to ofloxacin or to other quinolone antibiotics.
Do not give this product to pediatric patients who:
have an ear canal infection and are less than 6 months of age because no data were collected from this population
have a middle ear infection and have a tube in the eardrum and are less than one year of age because no data were collected from this population
have a middle ear infection and have a hole in the eardrum and are less than 12 years of age because no data were collected from this population

This plain language summary explains tympanostomy tubes, also known as ear tubes, to patients and families. The summary applies to children aged 6 months to 12 years with tympanostomy tubes or children being considered for tympanostomy tubes. It is based on the "Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy Tubes in Children (Update)", published in 2022 as a major update to the original guideline from 2013. This plain language summary is written explicitly for consumers, patients, and families as a companion publication to the full guideline, which provides greater detail for health care providers. A primary purpose is to facilitate insight and understanding that foster shared decision making regarding ear tubes. Guidelines and their recommendations may not apply to every child, but they do identify best practices and quality improvement opportunities that can help you and your child benefit most from ear tubes.

Patient Information

IMPORTANT PATIENT INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTIONS.

Rev. 06/22

READ BEFORE USE.

What is Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

Ofloxacin Otic Solution is an antibiotic in a sterile solution used to treat ear infections caused by certain bacteria found in:

patients (12 years and older) who have middle ear infection and have a hole in the eardrum
pediatric patients (between 1 and 12 years of age) who have a middle ear infection and have a tube in the eardrum
patients (6 months and older) who have an infection in the ear canal

Middle Ear Infection: A middle ear infection is a bacterial infection behind the eardrum. People with a hole or a tube in the eardrum may notice a discharge (fluid draining) in the ear canal.

Ear Canal Infection: An ear canal infection (also known as "Swimmer's Ear") is a bacterial infection of the ear canal. The ear canal and the outer part of the ear may swell, turn red, and be painful. Also, a fluid discharge may appear in the ear canal.

Who should NOT use Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

Do not use this product if allergic to ofloxacin or to other quinolone antibiotics.
Do not give this product to pediatric patients who:
have an ear canal infection and are less than 6 months of age because no data were collected from this population
have a middle ear infection and have a tube in the eardrum and are less than one year of age because no data were collected from this population
have a middle ear infection and have a hole in the eardrum and are less than 12 years of age because no data were collected from this population

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^bcb1631a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa guideline — methods and evidence search details state that the MEDLINE search was updated from July 2005 to October 2012 on PubMed using "otitis externa" and "swimmer's ear," identifying 6 clinical practice guidelines, 4 systematic reviews, and 52 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), of which none of the guidelines, 2 of the systematic reviews, and 12 RCTs were retained after assessing quality and relevance. The working group held 1 conference call and 1 face-to-face meeting to review comments and the literature for each action statement, and recommendations are based on the best available published data through October 2012, with a combination of clinical experience and expert consensus used where data were lacking and a scheduled review process to occur at 5 years from publication or sooner if new compelling evidence warrants earlier consideration.

### Ofloxaxin (ofloxacin) [^29045968]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

How should Ofloxacin Otic Solution be given?

1. Wash hands

The person giving Ofloxacin Otic Solution should wash his/her hands with soap and water.

2. Clean ear & warm bottle

Gently clean any discharge that can be removed easily from the outer ear. DO NOT INSERT ANY OBJECT OR SWAB INTO THE EAR CANAL.

Hold the bottle of Ofloxacin Otic Solution in the hand for one or two minutes to warm the solution.

3. Add drops

For a Middle Ear Infection: The person receiving Ofloxacin Otic Solution should lie on his/her side with the infected ear up. Patients (12 and older) should have 10 drops of Ofloxacin Otic Solution put into the infected ear. Pediatric patients under 12 should have 5 drops put into the infected ear. The tip of the bottle should not touch the fingers or the ear or any other surfaces.

For an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"): The person receiving Ofloxacin Otic Solution should lie on his/her side with the infected ear up. Patients (13 and older) should have 10 drops of Ofloxacin Otic Solution put into the infected ear. Pediatric patients under 13 should have 5 drops put into the infected ear. The tip of the bottle should not touch the fingers or the ear or any other surfaces.

BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW FOR THE PATIENT'S SPECIFIC EAR INFECTION.

4. Press ear or pull ear

For a Middle Ear Infection: While the person receiving Ofloxacin Otic Solution lies on his/her side, the person giving the drops should gently press the TRAGUS (see diagram) 4 times in a pumping motion. This will allow the drops to pass through the hole or tube in the eardrum and into the middle ear.

For an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"): While the person receiving the drops lies on his/her side, the person giving the drops should gently pull the outer ear upward and backward. This will allow the ear drops to flow down into the ear canal.

5. Stay on side

The person who received the ear drops should remain on his/her side for at least 5 minutes.

Repeat steps 2–5 for the other ear if both ears are infected.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^b10ddfea]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy Tubes in Children (Update) — key changes include need for routine, periodic follow-up to examine the ears until the tubes extrude; a new option for the clinician to perform adenoidectomy as an adjunct to tympanostomy tube insertion for children with symptoms directly related to the adenoid (adenoid infection or nasal obstruction) or in children aged 4 years or older to reduce future incidence of recurrent otitis media or the need for repeat tube insertion; a new recommendation against placing long-term tubes as initial surgery for children who meet criteria for tube insertion unless there is an anticipated need for prolonged middle ear ventilation beyond that of a short-term tube; a new recommendation against routinely prescribing prophylactic antibiotic ear drops after tympanostomy tube surgery to prevent or reduce otorrhea; addition of intellectual disability, learning disorder, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder to the list of risk factors that place children who have otitis media with effusion (OME) at increased risk for developmental difficulties (at-risk child); and updated categories of normal to mild hearing loss in children, with normal hearing as 0 to 15 decibels (dB), slight hearing loss as 16 to 25 dB, and mild hearing loss as 26 to 40 dB.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^3c12b227]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — post-insertion follow-up scheduling and strength of recommendation: We recommend that the surgeon or designee examine the ears of a child within 3 months of tympanostomy tube insertion. Follow-up schedules are largely consensus-driven, with initial follow-up at up to 1 to 3 months after tube insertion, and most US clinicians advocate 6-month intervals until tube extrusion; the discussion should reinforce that routine water precautions are unnecessary but regular follow-up visits are important until the tube extrudes. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B; Level of confidence in evidence: Medium; Policy level: Strong recommendation. Intentional vagueness: "Within 3 months of tympanostomy tube insertion:" is intended to set an upper limit for initial follow-up, but earlier assessment is permitted; subsequent follow-up intervals are at the clinician's discretion and should continue until the tubes have extruded.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^faa4faa0]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline — tympanostomy tubes in children: The guideline is intended for clinicians managing children aged 6 months to 12 years with tympanostomy tubes or being considered for tympanostomy tubes as an intervention for otitis media of any type, and it does not discuss evaluation or medical management of AOM, recurrent AOM, or OME, assuming underlying conditions have been addressed. Children younger than 6 months and children older than 12 years are excluded, and the guideline also does not pertain to children diagnosed as having retraction-type ear disease, complications of AOM, barotrauma, or those who have tubes placed for drug delivery to the middle ear for conditions such as sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss or Ménière's disease. Although at-risk children for developmental delays or disorders are often excluded from research, the group decided to include them in the target audience because these patients may derive enhanced benefit from tympanostomy tubes. The update does not include any recommendations regarding office insertion of tubes in children without general anesthesia due to insufficient research and instead notes a companion commentary article.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^ee6352c3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) with persistent middle ear effusion (MEE) — tympanostomy tube evidence and guidance: Tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent AOM decreased the average number of AOM episodes by about 2.5 per child-year in 2 RCTs; an RCT of children younger than 2 years reported a significant but modest reduction of 0.55 per child-year, and when otitis media with effusion (OME) lasts 2 months or longer, reductions of 0.20–0.72 per child-year are reported, whereas one trial in children with recurrent AOM but without MEE found no reduction. Additional benefits include decreased pain and the ability to manage AOM with topical antibiotic eardrops, and eardrops alone are highly effective for AOM with tubes; audiometric benefits are noted but are no longer present after 2 years. Clinicians should offer tympanostomy tubes to children with recurrent AOM and MEE with shared decisions with the child's caregiver, and a period of surveillance with reassessment at 3- to 6-month intervals can be used when there is uncertainty about surgery appropriateness.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^e3e7d108]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — tube longevity and likelihood of reinsertion — are characterized as follows: Short-term tubes generally last 6 to 18 months, but long-term tubes typically remain in place for several years, and there is no definite way to predict the duration of tube function. Rarely, the tube will displace into the middle ear space and may require surgical removal. For every 5 or 6 children with tubes, however, about 1 requires reinsertion of a second set of tubes within 3 years.

### Tympanostomy tube controversies and issues: state-of-the-art review [^e478c532]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review current pragmatic issues and controversies related to tympanostomy tubes in children, in the context of current best research evidence plus expert opinion to provide nuance, address uncertainties, and fill evidence gaps.

Methods

Each issue or controversy is followed by the relevant current best evidence, expert insight and opinion, and recommendations for action. The role of expert opinion and experience in forming conclusions is inversely related to the quality, consistency, and adequacy of published evidence. Conclusions are combined with opportunities for shared decision-making with caregivers to recommend pragmatic actions for clinicians in everyday settings.

Results

The issues and controversies discussed include (1) appropriate tube indications, (2) rationale for not recommending tubes for recurrent acute otitis media without persistent middle ear effusion, (3) role of tubes in at-risk children with otitis media with effusion, (4) role of new, automated tube insertion devices, (5) appropriateness and feasibility of in-office tube insertion in awake children, (6) managing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acute tube otorrhea, and (7) managing recurrent or persistent tube otorrhea.

Conclusions

Despite a substantial, and constantly growing, volume of high-level evidence on managing children with tympanostomy tubes, there will always be gaps, uncertainties, and controversies that benefit from clinician experience and expert opinion. In that regard, the issues discussed in this review article will hopefully aid clinicians in everyday, pragmatic management decisions.

### Otitis externa [^3b17e079]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Otitis externa is thought to affect 10% of people at some stage, and can present in acute, chronic, or necrotising forms. Otitis externa may be associated with eczema of the ear canal, and is more common in swimmers, humid environments, people with absence of ear wax or with narrow ear canals, hearing-aid users, and after mechanical trauma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of empirical and prophylactic treatments for otitis externa? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to October 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: oral antibiotics, specialist aural toilet, topical acetic acid drops or spray, topical aluminium acetate drops, topical antibacterials, topical antifungals, topical anti-infective agents, topical corticosteroids, and water exclusion.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^78925a57]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy tubes in children — research needs emphasize diagnostic prediction and testing strategies, including whether we can "identify clinical factors that predict persistence of MEE" and define "the ideal timing of audiologic testing for a child being considered for tubes — before surgery, after surgery, or both," and how "abnormal tympanometry at the initial clinical encounter" relates to persistence of otitis media with effusion (OME). Questions address evaluation and risk prediction in recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), such as the "best time to evaluate children referred for possible surgical treatment of recurrent AOM with relation to the last episode of AOM" and whether the "presence of middle ear fluid in one or both ears" predicts more AOM episodes in children with recurrent AOM. For at‑risk populations, the guideline asks about the "benefits of tympanostomy tube placement on frequency of AOM, prevalence of OME, and speech and language development," whether surgery presents "unique risks or greater complications," the "actual frequency of AOM and prevalence of OME," and the potential for "underdiagnosis of OME because of attention to other conditions or overdiagnosis of OME because of greater clinical exposure for some of the at-risk populations." Indicators for repeated intervention are prioritized, including "the clinical indicators that best predict the need for repeated tympanostomy tube placement" and the "role of allergy testing" and management for children with "recurrent tube otorrhea" or repeated placement. Device and adjunct decisions are highlighted by asking whether certain "types of long-term tubes" are more often linked to complications and "which subgroups of children should be considered for adenoidectomy at the time of the first set of tubes or when younger than age 4 years." Communication and postoperative care topics include how "face-to-face" counseling and educational resources "facilitate shared surgical decision making," indications to prescribe "postoperative ototopical antibiotics," whether limiting routine drop use changes "the incidence of postoperative otorrhea" and microbiology, predictors of failure of "ototopical therapy as initial treatment for TTO," identifying children at risk for otorrhea and criteria for "posttympanostomy water precautions," whether child water‑precaution recommendations can be "generalized to adults with tympanostomy tubes," and the "ideal follow-up schedule" for patients with tubes.

### Don't let swimmer's ear keep you out of the water… [^5d6c66dc]. publications.aap.org (2011). Low credibility.

Swimming is a great way for kids to stay active, especially during the summer months. However, the combination of heat, humidity and water can lead to an ear condition called acute otitis externa, more commonly known as swimmer's ear. The infection often is caused by bacteria being carried into the outer ear canal. Symptoms of swimmer's ear include redness, swelling, itching, drainage of pus and pain. Following are some tips from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent and treat swimmer's ear: Keep your ears as dry as possible. Use a bathing cap, ear plugs or custom-fitted swim molds when swimming to keep water out of ears. Dry your ears thoroughly after swimming or showering. Use a towel to dry your ears well. Tilt your head and hold each ear facing down to allow water to escape the ear canal. Pull your earlobe in different directions while the ear is faced down to help water drain out.

If water is still in the ears, consider using a hair dryer to move air within the ear canal. Be sure the hair dryer is on the lowest heat and speed/fan setting, and hold it several inches from the ear. Don't put objects, including cotton-tip swabs, pencils, paperclips or fingers, in the ear canal. Don't try to remove ear wax. It helps protect your ear canal from infection. If you think the ear canal is blocked by ear wax, consult your pediatrician rather than trying to remove it yourself. Consult your pediatrician about using commercial alcohol-based ear drops or a 1: 1 mixture of rubbing alcohol and white vinegar after swimming. Drops should not be used by people with ear tubes, damaged ear drums, outer ear infection or ear drainage. Consult your pediatrician if your ears are itchy, flaky, swollen or painful, or if you have drainage from your ears. © 2011 American Academy of Pediatrics.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^5cb08c76]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children with frequent ear infections without persistent middle ear fluid — middle ear effusion after infection often resolves; within 3 months about 90% of children no longer have middle ear fluid. Children may still meet a recurrent infection definition (3 or more in the past 6 months, or 4 in the past 12 months) but, when no effusion is present at the specialty visit, research notes that nearly half will not have more ear infections and only about 1 in 3 children continue to have recurrent ear infections, and Other research shows that 2 out of every 3 children who see an otolaryngologist for repeated ear infections, but who have a normal examination (no middle ear fluid) in the office, do not require ear tubes in the future. The best research evidence we have suggests that inserting tubes will not reduce future ear infections when there is no persistent effusion, but the procedure does involve some minor risks related to the ear tube and general anesthesia. Waiting a bit more time to see how your child does on their own does not carry any risk or harm, since many children will not have any further ear infections at all and most will never need tubes. Exceptions are acknowledged; If any of the following apply to your child, you should discuss with your doctor whether ear tubes may still be of benefit, including weak immune system or other problems putting them at higher risk for infections; prior complications of ear infections; adverse antibiotic reactions, allergies, or inability to take oral antibiotics that make it difficult to treat ear infections when antibiotics are needed; and high risk of developmental problems including permanent hearing loss, delays in speech or language, delays in learning, autism-spectrum disorder, syndromes (e.g. Down) or structural problems with the face and head (e.g., cleft palate), or severe vision loss.

Acute otitis externa — patient counseling on water exposure and canal manipulation — advises that clinicians should advise patients with AOE to resist manipulating the ear and discuss water restrictions; inserting earplugs or cotton (with petroleum jelly) prior to showering or swimming can reduce moisture, and the external auditory canal can be dried after swimming or bathing with a hair dryer on the lowest heat setting. Patients with AOE should preferably abstain from water sports for 7 to 10 days during treatment; competitive swimmers sometimes return to competition after 2 to 3 days after completing treatment or, if using well-fitting earplugs, after pain resolution; patients with hearing aids or ear phones should limit insertion until pain and discharge (if present) have subsided.

### Achondroplasia in latin America: practical recommendations for the multidisciplinary care of pediatric patients [^68755f20]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Another otorhinolaryngologic concern is the middle ear dysfunction, which is observed both in children and adolescents with achondroplasia. The proposed mechanism is of the poor functioning and abnormally oriented Eustachian tubes, which may be derived from aberrant growth of the chondrocranium. Although there is a lack of a well-structured prospective study, there is evidence that the frequency of otitis media is nearly 50–70% of individuals with achondroplasia.
Patients with achondroplasia may present with at least one episode of otitis media during the first year of life and almost 90% had an episode by the age of two years. Thus, hearing assessment and tympanometry should be performed before the age of one year and should be annually repeated. Moreover, hearing evaluation should be performed in case of suspicion of hearing loss.
Nearly half of the patients with achondroplasia are subjected to the placement of pressure equalizing tubes throughout their infancy. Pediatricians need to be aware of the occurrence of jugular bulb dehiscence into the middle ear space due to abnormalities of the chondrocranium.
Hearing impairment may be suspected during the language acquisition period, constituting a factor in speech and language delay.

The role of physical therapy and physical activity

Physiotherapy involvement should be part of the health supervision plan and would include prevention of secondary complications and targeted education. Physiotherapist should educated caretakers about appropriate physical activities, the importance of avoiding unsupported sitting (in order to avoid gibbus) and different positions to use during rest and periods of play. Parents should be informed early on how to position the children, specially to avoid sitting without head support until adequate head control is achieved.

If the child is left without any intervention, there is a risk of developing a marked spine flexion, with a possible wedging of vertebrae, causing fixed thoracolumbar kyphosis.

In adults, lumbosacral spinal stenosis is a very common problem. They should be instructed to perform periodic clinical examinations and avoid jobs/functions that require prolonged maintenance of standing posture or that perform trunk flexion /extension.
The choice of physical activity must be careful in children and adolescents with achondroplasia. Sports like swimming and cycling are encouraged to improve strength, coordination and expend calories. Conversely, sports with emphasis in force, physical contact or jumps should be avoided to reduce undesirable stress on the joints.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^3a85d823]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy Tubes in Children (Update) — introductory epidemiology and indications are summarized as follows: Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States. The tympanostomy tube, which is approximately 1/20th of an inch in width, is placed in the child's eardrum (tympanic membrane) to ventilate the middle ear space. Tubes were inserted into 667,000 children under the age of 15 years in 2006 (more than 20% of all ambulatory surgery in this age group), declining to 413,000 procedures in 2010; despite this decline, in 2014 about 9% of children under the age of 17 years had undergone tube surgery, and tubes were placed in 25% to 30% of children with frequent ear infections. Tympanostomy tubes are most often inserted because of persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. Otitis media (middle ear inflammation) is second in frequency only to acute upper respiratory infection as the most common illness diagnosed in children by health care professionals, and children younger than 7 years are at increased risk of otitis media because of their immature immune systems and poor function of the eustachian tube.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^386a01a7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — risk factors and prevention highlight moisture, barrier disruption, and environmental sources, while noting a lack of randomized prevention trials. Regular cleaning of the ear canal removes cerumen, which is an important barrier to moisture and infection, and other factors such as sweating, allergy, and stress have also been implicated. Most, but not all, studies have found an association with water quality (in terms of bacterial load) and the risk of AOE. The causative organisms are present in most swimming pools and hot tubs; however, even those that comply with water quality standards may still contain AOE pathogens, and these organisms are present in the healthy external auditory canal, which may be a source of AOE. Strategies to prevent AOE are aimed at limiting water accumulation and moisture retention in the external auditory canal and maintaining a healthy skin barrier, but no randomized trials have compared the efficacy of different strategies to prevent AOE.

### Executive summary of clinical practice guideline on tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^59d778a1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This executive summary of the guideline update provides evidence-based recommendations for patient selection and surgical indications for managing tympanostomy tubes in children. The summary and guideline are intended for any clinician involved in managing children aged 6 months to 12 years with tympanostomy tubes or children being considered for tympanostomy tubes in any care setting as an intervention for otitis media of any type. The target audience includes specialists, primary care clinicians, and allied health professionals.

Purpose

The purpose of this executive summary is to provide a succinct overview for clinicians of the key action statements (recommendations), summary tables, and patient decision aids from the update of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's "Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy Tubes in Children (Update)". The new guideline updates recommendations in the prior guideline from 2013 and provides clinicians with trustworthy, evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and surgical indications for managing tympanostomy tubes in children. This summary is not intended to substitute for the full guideline, and clinicians are encouraged to read the full guideline before implementing the recommended actions.

Methods

The guideline on which this summary is based was developed using methods outlined in the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's "Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual, Third Edition: A Quality-Driven Approach for Translating Evidence Into Action", which were followed explicitly. The guideline update group represented the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, otology, pediatrics, audiology, anesthesiology, family medicine, advanced practice nursing, speech-language pathology, and consumer advocacy.

Action Statements

Strong recommendations were made for the following key action statements: (14) Clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. (16) The surgeon or designee should examine the ears of a child within 3 months of tympanostomy tube insertion AND should educate families regarding the need for routine, periodic follow-up to examine the ears until the tubes extrude. Recommendations were made for the following key action statements: (1) Clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) of less than 3 months' duration, from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). (2) Clinicians should obtain a hearing evaluation if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR prior to surgery when a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion. (3) Clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer AND documented hearing difficulties. (5) Clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who do not receive tympanostomy tubes, until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected. (6) Clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who do not have middle ear effusion (MEE) in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy. (7) Clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral MEE at the time of assessment for tube candidacy. (8) Clinicians should determine if a child with recurrent AOM or with OME of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from otitis media because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors. (10) The clinician should not place long-term tubes as initial surgery for children who meet criteria for tube insertion unless there is a specific reason based on an anticipated need for prolonged middle ear ventilation beyond that of a short-term tube. (12) In the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications. (13) Clinicians should not routinely prescribe postoperative antibiotic ear drops after tympanostomy tube placement. (15) Clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs or headbands, avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. Options were offered from the following key action statements: (4) Clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) AND symptoms that are likely attributable, all or in part, to OME that include, but are not limited to, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life. (9) Clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is likely to persist as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or a documented effusion for 3 months or longer. (11) Clinicians may perform adenoidectomy as an adjunct to tympanostomy tube insertion for children with symptoms directly related to the adenoids (adenoid infection or nasal obstruction) OR in children aged 4 years or older to potentially reduce future incidence of recurrent otitis media or the need for repeat tube insertion.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children – executive summary [^30f1c882]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the new Clinical Practice Guideline: Tympanostomy Tubes in Children. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 12 recommendations developed address patient selection, surgical indications for and management of tympanostomy tubes in children. The development group broadly discussed indications for tube placement, perioperative management, care of children with indwelling tubes, and outcomes of tympanostomy tube surgery. Given the lack of current published guidance on surgical indications, the group focused on situations in which tube insertion would be optional, recommended, or not recommended. Additional emphasis was placed on opportunities for quality improvement, particularly regarding shared decision making and care of children with existing tubes.

### Interventions for the prevention of postoperative ear discharge after insertion of ventilation tubes (grommets) in children [^4f09b727]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Grommets are frequently inserted in children's ears for acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion. A common complication is postoperative ear discharge (otorrhoea). A wide range of treatments are used to prevent the discharge, but there is no consensus on whether or not intervention is necessary nor which is the most effective intervention.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of prophylactic interventions, both topical and systemic, in reducing the incidence of otorrhoea following the surgical insertion of grommets in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 3 July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the efficacy of prophylactic interventions against placebo/control and/or with other prophylactic interventions for postoperative otorrhoea in children.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. The outcome data were dichotomous for all the included trials. We calculated individual and pooled risk ratios (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. We also calculated the numbers needed to treat to benefit (NNTB).

Main Results

We found 15 eligible RCTs (2476 children, aged from four months to 17 years). We graded seven RCTs as being at a low risk of bias (n = 926 children) and for an eighth RCT we also graded two of the arms as being at a low risk of bias. We graded the other seven trials as being at a high risk of bias. For a single application at surgery, there was evidence from two low risk of bias trials that at two weeks postoperatively the risk of otorrhoea was reduced by multiple saline washouts (from 30% to 16%; RR 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 1.00; NNTB 7; one RCT; 140 children) and antibiotic/steroid ear drops (from 9% to 1%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.57; NNTB 13; one RCT; 322 ears). A meta-analysis of two low risk of bias trials (222 ears) failed to find an effect of a single application of antibiotic/steroid ear drops at four to six weeks postoperatively. For a prolonged application of an intervention, there was evidence from four low risk of bias trials that the risk of otorrhoea was reduced two weeks postoperatively by antibiotic ear drops (from 15% to 8%; RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.97; NNTB 15; one RCT; 372 children), antibiotic/steroid ear drops (from 39% to 5%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.31; NNTB 3; one RCT; 200 children), aminoglycoside/steroid ear drops (from 15% to 5%; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.74; NNTB 11; one RCT; 356 children) or oral antibacterial agents/steroids (from 39% to 5%; RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.51; NNTB 3; one RCT; 77 children). Only one trial assessed the secondary outcome of ototoxicity, but no effect was found. There were no trials that assessed quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found that each of the following were effective at reducing the rate of otorrhoea up to two weeks following surgery: (1) multiple saline washouts at surgery, (2) a single application of topical antibiotic/steroid drops at surgery, (3) a prolonged application of topical drops (namely antibiotic ear drops, antibiotic/steroid eardrops or aminoglycoside/steroid ear drops) and (4) a prolonged application of oral antibacterial agents/steroids. However, the rate of otorrhoea between RCTs varied greatly and the higher the rates of otorrhoea within a RCT, the smaller the NNTB for therapy. We conclude that if a surgeon has a high rate of postoperative otorrhoea in children then either saline irrigation or antibiotic ear drops at the time of surgery would significantly reduce that rate. If topical drops are chosen, it is suggested that to reduce the cost and potential for ototoxic damage this be a single application at the time of surgery and not prolonged thereafter.

### Clinical practice guidelines: pediatric amplification [^79ed83be]. AAA (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric amplification — ear hook and tubing considerations note that "Manufacturers generally send adult size ear hooks unless otherwise instructed" and that "A pediatric ear hook can be crucial for ensuring retention of the hearing aid." "BTE tubing systems (comprising the receiver tube, earhook, and earmold tubing) add resonant peaks to the hearing aid response," and "These peaks can increase the chance of acoustic feedback and may dictate the maximum output setting of the hearing aid thereby unnecessarily decreasing the headroom (the difference between the level of speech and the saturation level of the hearing aid) of the instrument." "A filtered (damped) ear hook will smooth the frequency response," and "Changing from an adult to pediatric earhook will alter the hearing aid response," therefore "Any changes to the sound channel require that new real-ear measures are made." Safety notes include "Earmolds and tubing can separate from the hearing aid and can be swallowed" and "The integrity of the connection between the earmold, tubing, ear hook, and hearing aid should be checked at the child's regular visits to the clinic."

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^c133d38c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — long-term tympanic membrane changes and subsequent surgery risk are described as follows: tubes produce visible tympanic membrane changes and may cause a small or trivial decrease in long-term hearing levels that do not appear to be clinically significant or require intervention in most patients; persistent perforation is the sequela most likely to require intervention, with 80%-90% success rates for surgical closure with a single outpatient procedure; treatment with tubes was associated with a 9.5-times greater risk of subsequent tympanoplasty versus middle ear disease not treated with tubes and a > 200-times greater risk versus no ear disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children [^81bac93f]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States. Tympanostomy tubes are most often inserted because of persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. Despite the frequency of tympanostomy tube insertion, there are currently no clinical practice guidelines in the United States that address specific indications for surgery. This guideline is intended for any clinician involved in managing children, aged 6 months to 12 years, with tympanostomy tubes or being considered for tympanostomy tubes in any care setting, as an intervention for otitis media of any type.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and surgical indications for and management of tympanostomy tubes in children. The development group broadly discussed indications for tube placement, perioperative management, care of children with indwelling tubes, and outcomes of tympanostomy tube surgery. Given the lack of current published guidance on surgical indications, the group focused on situations in which tube insertion would be optional, recommended, or not recommended. Additional emphasis was placed on opportunities for quality improvement, particularly regarding shared decision making and care of children with existing tubes. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic eardrops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea. The panel made recommendations that (1) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) of less than 3 months' duration; (2) clinicians should obtain an age-appropriate hearing test if OME persists for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) or prior to surgery when a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion; (3) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and documented hearing difficulties; (4) clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who did not receive tympanostomy tubes until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected; (5) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who do not have middle ear effusion in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (6) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with recurrent AOM who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (7) clinicians should determine if a child with recurrent AOM or with OME of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from otitis media because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (8) in the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications; (9) clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs, headbands; avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. The development group provided the following options: (1) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) and symptoms that are likely attributable to OME including, but not limited to, vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life and (2) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is unlikely to resolve quickly as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or persistence of effusion for 3 months or longer (chronic OME).

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^2a23a970]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Post–tympanostomy tube insertion management — The guideline development group is advising against routine prescribing of antibiotic ear drops following tube insertion, and intraoperative management may involve saline washout, a single application of antibiotic ear drops (with or without a steroid), or no treatment; children with active acute otitis media or purulent effusions at the time of tube insertion are excluded from this recommendation. Supporting data include that a review of nearly 600 patients from 3 RCTs did not find an increase in intraluminal occlusion in patients who did not receive ear drops, although antibiotic drops decreased the rate of postoperative tube obstruction by about 12% (number needed to treat of 8).

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^6efe0f1e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tube otorrhea and complications — frequencies and management — are reported as follows: Acute TTO occurs in up to 50% of children who are closely monitored in RCTs, with cohort studies finding 16% postoperative otorrhea (first 30 days), 26% delayed otorrhea, 7% recurrent otorrhea, and 4% chronic otorrhea. Caregivers should be counseled that TTO responds to topical antibiotic ear drops, does not usually require oral antibiotics, and benefits from water precautions until the discharge is no longer present. Up to 3% of tubes may fail to extrude and require active removal; persistent tympanic membrane perforation occurs with about 2% of short-term tubes and up to 20% of long-term tubes; and localized cholesteatoma may be seen in 0.5% of cases.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^00a25788]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — reasons an ear infection may be diagnosed without visible drainage include that the tube is open and drainage has started but is not yet seen at the ear canal opening, suggesting an early stage of infection for which antibiotic ear drops will help it go away quickly; the tube is not working or is blocked, so the ear infection is treated as if the tube were not present and antibiotics by mouth may be needed, with the blocked tube doing no harm and acetaminophen or ibuprofen recommended for pain; or the tube is open but there is no drainage in the tube opening or ear canal, in which case no special treatment is necessary even if the eardrum appears red or irritated when a child cries or has fever without an ear infection.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^7178cf57]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) without middle ear effusion (MEE) — evidence and policy emphasize natural improvement without tubes and limited prophylactic benefit, with Policy level: Recommendation. In placebo arms of randomized trials, children entered with a mean baseline rate of 5.5 or more annual episodes but averaged only 2.8 annual episodes while on placebo, and 41% had no additional episodes for a median 6 months while 83% had only 2 or fewer episodes; individual episodes were treated with a 7- to 10-day course of oral antibiotic. Systematic reviews of tympanostomy tube insertion for recurrent AOM have shown a transient benefit of questionable clinical significance with no additional benefit when compared with antibiotic use, and an RCT specifically excluding baseline MEE found no benefit for reducing subsequent AOM, although tubes decreased the mean percentage time with otitis media over the next 2 years by about 8%, or 30 days per year. Another RCT reported significant benefits in children aged 10 months to 2 years, but it included children with persistent MEE with effusions aspirated during surgery. After watchful waiting in recurrent AOM without MEE at assessment, only 34% of 123 children proceeded to tube placement and about two-thirds were managed successfully without tympanostomy tube insertion. Exceptions noted include at-risk children, severe or persistent AOM, immunosuppression, prior complications of otitis media (mastoiditis, meningitis, facial nerve paralysis), or multiple antibiotic allergy or intolerance.

### Otitis media and ear tubes [^f8dc59be]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The placement of myringotomy tubes remains an effective treatment of recurrent acute otitis media and chronic otitis media with effusion. Infants and young children are prone to these entities because of their immature anatomy and immunology. Several host, pathogenic, and environmental factors contribute to the development of these conditions. The identification and modification of some these factors can preclude the need for intervention. The procedure continues to be one of the most common outpatient pediatric procedures. Close vigilance and identification of potential complications is of utmost importance in the ongoing management of the child with middle ear disease.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^68d09818]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Insertion of tympanostomy tubes is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children in the United States. Tympanostomy tubes are most often inserted because of persistent middle ear fluid, frequent ear infections, or ear infections that persist after antibiotic therapy. All these conditions are encompassed by the term otitis media (middle ear inflammation). This guideline update provides evidence-based recommendations for patient selection and surgical indications for managing tympanostomy tubes in children. The guideline is intended for any clinician involved in managing children aged 6 months to 12 years with tympanostomy tubes or children being considered for tympanostomy tubes in any care setting as an intervention for otitis media of any type. The target audience includes specialists, primary care clinicians, and allied health professionals.

Purpose

The purpose of this clinical practice guideline update is to reassess and update recommendations in the prior guideline from 2013 and to provide clinicians with trustworthy, evidence-based recommendations on patient selection and surgical indications for managing tympanostomy tubes in children. In planning the content of the updated guideline, the guideline update group (GUG) affirmed and included all the original key action statements (KASs), based on external review and GUG assessment of the original recommendations. The guideline update was supplemented with new research evidence and expanded profiles that addressed quality improvement and implementation issues. The group also discussed and prioritized the need for new recommendations based on gaps in the initial guideline or new evidence that would warrant and support KASs. The GUG further sought to bring greater coherence to the guideline recommendations by displaying relationships in a new flowchart to facilitate clinical decision making. Last, knowledge gaps were identified to guide future research.

Methods

In developing this update, the methods outlined in the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation's "Clinical Practice Guideline Development Manual, Third Edition: A Quality-Driven Approach for Translating Evidence Into Action" were followed explicitly. The GUG was convened with representation from the disciplines of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, otology, pediatrics, audiology, anesthesiology, family medicine, advanced practice nursing, speech-language pathology, and consumer advocacy.

Action Statements

The GUG made strong recommendations for the following KASs: (14) clinicians should prescribe topical antibiotic ear drops only, without oral antibiotics, for children with uncomplicated acute tympanostomy tube otorrhea; (16) the surgeon or designee should examine the ears of a child within 3 months of tympanostomy tube insertion AND should educate families regarding the need for routine, periodic follow-up to examine the ears until the tubes extrude. The GUG made recommendations for the following KASs: (1) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of otitis media with effusion (OME) of less than 3 months' duration, from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown); (2) clinicians should obtain a hearing evaluation if OME persists for 3 months or longer OR prior to surgery when a child becomes a candidate for tympanostomy tube insertion; (3) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for 3 months or longer AND documented hearing difficulties; (5) clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who do not receive tympanostomy tubes, until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected; (6) clinicians should not perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media who do not have middle ear effusion in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (7) clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion in children with recurrent acute otitis media who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; (8) clinicians should determine if a child with recurrent acute otitis media or with OME of any duration is at increased risk for speech, language, or learning problems from otitis media because of baseline sensory, physical, cognitive, or behavioral factors; (10) the clinician should not place long-term tubes as initial surgery for children who meet criteria for tube insertion unless there is a specific reason based on an anticipated need for prolonged middle ear ventilation beyond that of a short-term tube; (12) in the perioperative period, clinicians should educate caregivers of children with tympanostomy tubes regarding the expected duration of tube function, recommended follow-up schedule, and detection of complications; (13) clinicians should not routinely prescribe postoperative antibiotic ear drops after tympanostomy tube placement; (15) clinicians should not encourage routine, prophylactic water precautions (use of earplugs or headbands, avoidance of swimming or water sports) for children with tympanostomy tubes. The GUG offered the following KASs as options: (4) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) AND symptoms that are likely attributable, all or in part, to OME that include, but are not limited to, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life; (9) clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is likely to persist as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or a documented effusion for 3 months or longer; (11) clinicians may perform adenoidectomy as an adjunct to tympanostomy tube insertion for children with symptoms directly related to the adenoids (adenoid infection or nasal obstruction) OR in children aged 4 years or older to potentially reduce future incidence of recurrent otitis media or the need for repeat tube insertion.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^88935f13]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — evidence-based recommendations for tympanostomy tube insertion specify that clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with bilateral OME for ≥ 3 mo (chronic OME) and documented hearing difficulties; clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for ≥ 3 mo (chronic OME) and symptoms attributable to OME (e.g., vestibular problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life); clinicians should offer bilateral tympanostomy tube insertion to children with recurrent acute otitis media (AOM) who have unilateral or bilateral middle ear effusion (or OME) at the time of assessment for tube candidacy; and clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is unlikely to resolve quickly as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or persistence of effusion for ≥ 3 mo (chronic OME). Recommendations against tube insertion are that clinicians should NOT perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with a single episode of OME of < 3 mo of duration or in children with recurrent AOM who do not have middle ear effusion (or OME) in either ear at the time of assessment for tube candidacy.

Key points
- Is your child's ear hurting. It could be an ear infection.
- Some ear infections, in particular some middle ear infections, need antibiotic treatment, but many can get better without antibiotics. Talk to your child's healthcare provider about the best treatment. Overview Children are more likely than adults to get ear infections. There are different types of ear infections. Middle ear infection is an infection in the middle ear. Otitis media with effusionis another condition that affects the middle ear.
- Occurs when fluid builds up in the middle ear without causing an infection.
- Does not cause fever, ear pain, or pus build-up in the middle ear. Swimmer's earis an infection in the outer ear canal.
- Different from a middle ear infection.
- For more information, visit "Swimmer's Ear" Signs and symptoms
- Ear pain
- Fever
- Fussiness or irritability
- Rubbing or tugging at an ear
- Difficulty sleeping.

Prevention Help prevent ear infections by doing your best to stay healthy and keep others healthy:

- Receive recommended vaccines, such as flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine.
- Pneumococcal vaccine protects against a common cause of middle ear infections, Streptococcus pneumonia.
- Pneumococcal vaccine protects against a common cause of middle ear infections
- Clean your hands.
- Breastfeed exclusively until your baby is 6 months old and continue to breastfeed for at least 12 months.
- Don't smoke and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.
- Dry your ears thoroughly after swimming. Diagnosis A healthcare provider can diagnose a middle ear infection by asking about symptoms and examining your child. They will look inside your child's ear to examine the eardrum and look for pus in the middle ear. watchful waitingor delayed antibiotic prescribing.

Watchful waiting: Your child's healthcare provider may suggest watching and waiting for 2–3 days to see if your child needs antibiotics. This gives the immune system time to fight off the infection. If your child's symptoms don't improve, the healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic. Delayed prescribing: Your child's healthcare provider may prescribe an antibiotic but suggest that you wait 2–3 days before filling the prescription.

### Interventions for children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet (ventilation tube) insertion [^b6df5e4b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ear discharge (otorrhoea) is common in children with grommets (ventilation/tympanostomy tubes); the proportion of children developing discharge ranges from 25% to 75%. The most common treatment strategies include oral broad-spectrum antibiotics, antibiotic eardrops or those containing a combination of antibiotic(s) and a corticosteroid, and initial observation. Important drivers for one strategy over the other are concerns over the side effects of oral antibiotics and the potential ototoxicity of antibiotic eardrops.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of current treatment strategies for children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet (ventilation tube) insertion.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register, CENTRAL (2016, Issue 5), multiple databases and additional sources for published and unpublished trials (search date 23 June 2016).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing at least two of the following: oral antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid), corticosteroid eardrops, microsuction cleaning of the ear canal, saline rinsing of the ear canal, placebo or no treatment. The main comparison of interest was antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) versus oral antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were: proportion of children with resolution of ear discharge at short-term follow-up (less than two weeks), adverse events and serious complications. Secondary outcomes were: proportion of children with resolution of ear discharge at intermediate- (two to four weeks) and long-term (four to 12 weeks) follow-up, proportion of children with resolution of ear pain and fever at short-term follow-up, duration of ear discharge, proportion of children with chronic ear discharge, ear discharge recurrences, tube blockage, tube extrusion, health-related quality of life and hearing. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included nine studies, evaluating a range of treatments, with 2132 children who developed acute ear discharge beyond the immediate postoperative period. We judged the risk of bias to be low to moderate in most studies. Antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) versus oral antibioticsAntibiotic eardrops with or without corticosteroid were more effective than oral antibiotics in terms of:- resolution of discharge at one week (one study, 42 children, ciprofloxacin eardrops versus amoxicillin: 77% versus 30%; risk ratio (RR) 2.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 5.22; moderate-quality evidence);- resolution of discharge at two weeks (one study, 153 children, bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: 95% versus 56%; RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.08; moderate-quality evidence);- duration of discharge (two studies, 233 children, ciprofloxacin eardrops versus amoxicillin: median 4 days versus 7 days and bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: 4 days versus 5 days; moderate-quality evidence);- ear discharge recurrences (one study, 148 children, bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: 0 versus 1 episode at six months; low-quality evidence); and- disease-specific quality of life (one study, 153 children, bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: difference in change in median Otitis Media-6 total score (range 6 to 42) at two weeks: -2; low-quality evidence). We found no evidence that antibiotic eardrops were more effective in terms of the proportion of children developing chronic ear discharge or tube blockage, generic quality of life or hearing. Adverse events occurred at similar rates in children treated with antibiotic eardrops and those treated with oral antibiotics, while no serious complications occurred in either of the groups. Other comparisons(a) Antibiotic eardrops with or without corticosteroid were more effective thancorticosteroid eardrops in terms of:- duration of ear discharge (one study, 331 children, ciprofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin-fluocinolone acetonide versus fluocinolone acetonide eardrops: median 5 days versus 7 days versus 22 days; moderate-quality evidence).(b) Antibiotic eardrops were more effective than saline rinsing of the ear canal in terms of:- resolution of ear discharge at one week (one study, 48 children, ciprofloxacin eardrops versus saline rinsing: 77% versus 46%; RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.69; moderate-quality evidence); but not in terms of tube blockage. Since the lower limit of the 95% CI for the effect size for resolution of ear discharge at one week approaches unity, a trivial or clinically irrelevant difference cannot be excluded.(c) Eardrops containing two antibiotics and a corticosteroid (bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone) were more effective than no treatment in terms of:- resolution of discharge at two weeks (one study; 151 children: 95% versus 45%; RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.69; moderate-quality evidence);- duration of discharge (one study; 147 children, median 4 days versus 12 days; moderate-quality evidence);- chronic discharge (one study; 147 children; RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.62; low-quality evidence); and- disease-specific quality of life (one study, 153 children, difference in change in median Otitis Media-6 total score (range 6 to 42) between groups at two weeks: -1.5; low-quality evidence). We found no evidence that antibiotic eardrops were more effective in terms of ear discharge recurrences or generic quality of life.(d) Eardrops containing a combination of an antibiotic and a corticosteroid were more effective than eardrops containing antibiotics (low-quality evidence) in terms of:- resolution of ear discharge at short-term follow-up (two studies, 590 children: 35% versus 20%; RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.31); and- duration of discharge (three studies, 813 children); but not in terms of resolution of discharge at intermediate-term follow-up or proportion of children with tube blockage. However, there is a substantial risk of publication bias, therefore these findings should be interpreted with caution.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate to low-quality evidence that antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) are more effective than oral antibiotics, corticosteroid eardrops and no treatment in children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet insertion. There is some limited, inconclusive evidence that antibiotic eardrops are more effective than saline rinsing. There is uncertainty whether antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops are more effective than eardrops containing antibiotics only.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^7682e62c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — optional procedures: clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in children with unilateral or bilateral OME for 3 months or longer (chronic OME) AND symptoms that are likely attributable, all or in part, to OME that include, but are not limited to, balance (vestibular) problems, poor school performance, behavioral problems, ear discomfort, or reduced quality of life; clinicians may perform tympanostomy tube insertion in at-risk children with unilateral or bilateral OME that is likely to persist as reflected by a type B (flat) tympanogram or a documented effusion for 3 months or longer; and clinicians may perform adenoidectomy as an adjunct to tympanostomy tube insertion for children with symptoms directly related to the adenoids (adenoid infection or nasal obstruction) OR in children aged 4 years or older to potentially reduce future incidence of recurrent otitis media or the need for repeat tube insertion.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^b185ee13]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — short-term versus long-term devices differ in duration, indications, and trade-offs. Short-term tubes ventilate for "8 to 18 months, on average; some stay in place 3 years or longer," are the "Routine choice for first ear tube surgery for a child," have "Reduced incidence (vs long-term tubes) of perforation, chronic otorrhea, granulation tissue, myringosclerosis; ease of insertion," but carry "Potential for early extrusion and need for repeat tube surgery." Long-term tubes provide ventilation for "15 months or longer, usually 2 to 3 years; some stay in place 5 years or longer," are a "Selective choice for first ear tube surgery for a child when a need for prolonged ventilation is anticipated; option for repeat tube surgery," offer "Longer period of middle ear ventilation, potential to avoid repeat insertion of short-term tubes and exposure to general anesthesia; ability to insert silastic T-tube in stenotic canal," but have "Increased incidence (vs short-term tube) of perforation, chronic otorrhea, granulation tissue, myringosclerosis, medialization (if short shaft with no outer flange); more difficult to insert." Relative uses include, for short-term tubes, "Repeat ear tube surgery in children without significant risk factors or anatomic changes in the eardrum that would warrant a long-term tube," and for long-term tubes, "Cleft palate, stenotic ear canal, abnormal tympanic membrane (atrophy, atelectasis, retraction pocket), premature extrusion of multiple prior short-term tubes."

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^d03dbb21]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Postoperative otorrhea prevention in children with tympanostomy tubes — saline washout versus antibiotic ear drops: The recommendation against prescribing relates to continuing use of antibiotic ear drops that may be prescribed for up to 10 days after surgery. Based on 2 low‑risk randomized controlled trials (RCTs), saline washouts reduced otorrhea incidence from 30% to 16% (relative risk, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27–1.00) with a number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) of 7 children, while a single application of antibiotic‑steroid ear drops reduced otorrhea from 9% to 1% (relative risk, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03–0.57) with an NNTB of 13. In a trial of 291 children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) whose ears (N = 560) were randomized to four interventions — saline washout, oral amoxicillin for 7 days, oral amoxicillin for 7 days plus ciprofloxacin ear drops for 3 days, or observation — no significant differences in postoperative otorrhea were found, with rates ranging from 1.1% to 12.3%, supporting no added benefit from continuing antibiotic ear drops after surgery when compared with saline washout. A more recent RCT showed no benefit of routine prescribing of antibiotic ear drops as compared with saline solution: Children (N = 174) were randomized to intraoperative ciprofloxacin or normal saline ear drops continued for 5 days after surgery; of the remaining 128 children, about 62% had recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), 21% chronic OME, and 48% mucoid effusions, and there were no differences at 4 or 6 weeks in the incidence, duration, and QOL impact of early tympanostomy tube otorrhea or tube patency between groups.

### Extracts from the cochrane library: interventions for the prevention of postoperative ear discharge after insertion of ventilation tubes (grommets) in children [^45811b32]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The "Cochrane Corner" is a section in the journal that highlights systematic reviews relevant to otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, with invited commentary to aid clinical decision making. This installment features a Cochrane Review, "Interventions for the Prevention of Postoperative Ear Discharge after Insertion of Ventilation Tubes (Grommets) in Children", that concludes if a surgeon has a high rate of postoperative otorrhea in children, then saline irrigation or antibiotic ear drops at the time of surgery would significantly reduce that rate. If topical drops are chosen, a single application at the time of surgery is suggested to reduce the cost and potential for ototoxic damage (if applicable).

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^1693102e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) surgical options — shared decision grid compares watchful waiting, ear (tympanostomy) tube placement, and adenoidectomy across age limits, process, timing, benefits, risks, and long‑term expectations. Watchful waiting and ear tubes can be done at any age, but "Adenoidectomy is not recommended for age < 4 y for treating ear fluid that persists for at least 3 mo." Watchful waiting involves "Checking the eardrum every 3 to 6 mo in your doctor's office." Ear tube surgery "takes about 10 to 20 min and usually requires general anesthesia," while adenoidectomy "takes about 30 min and requires general anesthesia." Benefits include that ear tubes "Relieves fluid and hearing loss promptly and prevents relapse of fluid while the tube is in place and stays open," and adenoidectomy "reduces the need for future ear surgery," with "The chance that your child may need future ear tubes is reduced by about 50% after adenoidectomy." Risks for tubes include "About 1 in 4 children get an ear infection (drainage) that is treated with eardrops" and "About 2 or 3 in 100 children have a tiny hole in the eardrum that does not close after the tube falls out and may need surgery." Long‑term, "Most tubes fall out in about 12 to 18 mo" and "About 1 in every 4 children may need to have them replaced."

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^ff1a7c5a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) and cochlear implantation — use of tympanostomy tubes in children is summarized as follows: when a child who is a candidate for cochlear implantation also has chronic OME or a history of recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), the appropriateness of tympanostomy tube insertion prior to implant surgery is questioned; a review supports using a tympanostomy tube in otitis-prone children undergoing cochlear implantation; the preponderance of evidence and policy statements favor using tubes in children with recurrent AOM undergoing cochlear implantation with no evidence of increased infectious complications from a tube; for OME prior to implantation, evidence is less robust, but a case series reported that infectious complications are rarely associated with tubes and that tube insertion is safe; a more recent literature review concluded that chronic OME and recurrent AOM should have tympanostomy tubes placed to treat any middle ear infection before cochlear implantation.

### Observation or otolaryngology surveillance after ventilation tube insertion in children: the conVenTu noninferiority randomized clinical trial [^4492a6db]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is observation by general practitioners a sufficient alternative to routine otorhinolaryngology (ear, nose, and throat [ENT]) follow-up for the postoperative care of children with middle-ear ventilation tubes (VTs) in terms of audiometric outcomes?

Findings

In the multicenter ConVenTu (Control of Ventilation Tubes) noninferiority randomized clinical trial including 290 children between 3 and 10 years of age, hearing outcomes 2 years after VT insertion were noninferior in children assigned to observation by their general practitioner compared to those who underwent routine follow-up through an ENT department.

Meaning

Observation without routine control yielded noninferior audiometric outcomes when compared to routine ENT follow-up 2 years after VT insertion.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^6e50c20e]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Statement 5 — Surveillance of chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) states that clinicians should reevaluate, at 3- to 6-month intervals, children with chronic OME who do not receive tympanostomy tubes, until the effusion is no longer present, significant hearing loss is detected, or structural abnormalities of the tympanic membrane or middle ear are suspected. This is a recommendation based on observational studies, with a preponderance of benefit over harm, with aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, based on observational studies, and level of confidence in evidence: High. Benefits include detection of structural changes in the tympanic membrane that may require intervention, detection of new hearing difficulties or symptoms that would lead to reassessing the need for tympanostomy tube insertion, discussion of strategies for optimizing the listening-learning environment for children with OME, and ongoing counseling and education of parents/caregiver; risks, harms, costs are the cost of examination(s). The surveillance interval is intentionally vague and is broadly defined at 3 to 6 months, and "significant" hearing loss is broadly defined as one that is noticed by the caregiver, reported by the child, or interferes in school performance or quality of life, and there is a role for patient (caregiver) preferences with opportunity for shared decision making regarding the surveillance interval. Quality improvement opportunity items include promoting continuity of care, avoiding preventable complications through surveillance, and gaining insight into natural history of chronic middle ear fluid.

### Ofloxacin (ofloxacin otic) [^47c90c22]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

How should Ofloxacin Otic Solution be given?

BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW FOR THE PATIENT'S SPECIFIC EAR INFECTION.

Repeat Steps 2–5 for the other ear if both ears are infected.

How often should Ofloxacin Otic Solution be given?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given once daily at about the same time each day (for example, 8 AM or 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

In patients with a Middle Ear Infection, Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given 2 times each day (about 12 hours apart, for example 8 AM and 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise. The best times to use the ear drops are in the morning and at night.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops are not used for as long as the doctor has instructed, the infection may be more likely to return.

What if a dose is missed?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), it is important that you take the drops every day. If you miss a dose which may have been scheduled for earlier in the day, (for example 8 AM), you should take that day's dose as soon as possible and then go back to your regular daily dosing schedule.

### Estimating waterborne infectious disease burden by exposure route, United States, 2014 [^d4bb387d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Of the estimated 7.15 million infectious waterborne illnesses in 2014 in the United States, 78% of illnesses were attributed to recreational water, 16% to drinking water, and 6% to NRND water. Drinking water exposure caused 40% of hospitalizations and 50% of deaths, recreational water exposure 36% of hospitalizations and 20% of deaths, and NRND exposure 24% of hospitalizations and 30% of deaths. ED visits and hospitalizations from exposure to drinking or recreational water exposure cost > $2 billion annually.

Acute otitis externa, which can be acutely painful and cause itchiness, drainage, and swelling, was the most common recreational water–associated illness. Risks for acute otitis externa have been correlated with water quality measures, levels of Pseudomonas and other pathogens in water, and increased bather load in recreational water venues in some studies but not others. Water can displace the protective coating of cerumen (ear wax) in the ear canal, leaving the outer ear more vulnerable to infection by endogenous flora. Whether otitis externa is caused by endogenous flora or contamination introduced by water remains unclear. In the structured expert judgment study, experts were asked to consider this question while estimating the proportion of otitis externa transmitted through water versus other pathways. They estimated 81% (95% uncertainty interval 67%–95%) of Pseudomonas otitis externa was transmitted through water. In response to the absence of national standards for recreational water venues, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) participated in the development and updating of the Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC). For treated water venues, the MAHC includes guidance for health authorities and aquatics sector to minimize risks for acute otitis externa and other illnesses and injuries. For both treated and untreated venues, risk for acute otitis externa can be minimized by keeping ears as dry as possible when swimming and ensuring ears are dry after swimming. Recreational swimmers and parents of young swimmers can educate themselves about steps to minimize the risks for infection from enteric pathogens at trusted sites, such as the CDC's healthy swimming webpage. Signage at treated and untreated recreational water venues and adoption of CDC's MAHC for treated public recreational water venues can further improve prevention. The number of illnesses and ED visits for acute otitis externa caused by drinking water exposure might seem counterintuitive, but drinking water was defined as water used for drinking, bathing, or showering.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^218b3b1a]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Comparison with existing literature

We initiated this trial after establishing the superiority of antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops over oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge. Our current findings in a small sample of children without ventilation tubes who present with AOMd indicate that these findings cannot be extrapolated to this patient population. While there is a patent passage between the ear canal and the middle ear in children with ventilation tubes, the spontaneous eardrum perforation in children with AOMd may close too early to allow antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops to completely resolve the middle ear inflammation.

During the preparation of our trial, we collaborated with the UK-based team developing the REST (Runny Ear Study, trial registry number ISRCTN12873692) addressing the same topic. We harmonized design and outcomes to enable future meta-analysis. This trial however was also terminated early due to issues with its electronic health record system platform and no formal statistical analysis was performed on its sample of 22 children.

### Topical or oral antibiotics in childhood acute otitis media and ear discharge: a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial [^ae5a6f27]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Of children with acute otitis media (AOM), 15%–20% present with acute ear discharge due to a spontaneous perforation of the eardrum. These children experience equal levels of ear pain, suffer from more frequent AOM recurrences and hearing problems, and benefit more from antibiotic treatment than those with AOM who do not present with ear discharge. Current guidelines suggest clinicians can consider oral antibiotics for children with AOM and ear discharge (AOMd), but this must always be balanced against the risk of side effects and the significant public health danger of antibiotic resistance. We have previously shown that treatment with antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops is superior to oral antibiotics in children with ventilation tubes presenting with acute ear discharge. The question is whether this strategy is also effective in children without ventilation tubes who present with acute ear discharge as one of the symptoms of AOM, arguing that the spontaneous perforation of the eardrum would provide an entry for topical antibiotics to act in the middle ear. Such approach would contribute to antibiotic stewardship and avoid systemic antibiotic side effects. We, therefore, conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment with oral antibiotics and antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops in children presenting in primary care with AOMd.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^e5a114a9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Methods for assessing hearing in children — The preferred method of hearing assessment is age-appropriate audiologic testing through conventional audiometry or comprehensive audiologic assessment. Children aged 4 years or older are usually able to reliably respond to conventional audiometry, which in primary care can use a fail criterion of > 20 dB HL at 1 or more frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 4000 Hz) in either ear. Comprehensive audiologic evaluation by an audiologist is recommended for children aged 6 months to 4 years and for any child who fails conventional audiometry; age-specific methods include visual reinforcement audiometry for 6 months to 2.5 years and play audiometry for 2.5 to 4 years. Ear-specific audiologic testing is recommended whenever possible, using insert earphones to detect unilateral or asymmetrical hearing loss.

### Ventilation tubes (grommets) for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^1d448be2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. It may cause hearing loss which, when persistent, may lead to developmental delay, social difficulty and poor quality of life. Management includes watchful waiting, autoinflation, medical and surgical treatment. Insertion of ventilation tubes has often been used as the preferred treatment.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of ventilation tubes (grommets) for OME in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials on 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in children (6 months to 12 years) with OME for ≥ 3 months. We included studies that compared ventilation tube (VT) insertion with five comparators: no treatment, watchful waiting (ventilation tubes inserted later, if required), myringotomy, hearing aids and other non-surgical treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise and were: 1) hearing; 2) OME-specific quality of life; 3) persistent tympanic membrane perforation (as a severe adverse effect of the surgery). Secondary outcomes were: 1) persistence of OME; 2) other adverse effects (including tympanosclerosis, VT blockage and pain); 3) receptive language skills; 4) speech development; 5) cognitive development; 6) psychosocial skills; 7) listening skills; 8) generic health-related quality of life; 9) parental stress; 10) vestibular function; 11) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for key outcomes. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We included 19 RCTs (2888 children). We considered most of the evidence to be very uncertain, due to wide confidence intervals for the effect estimates, few participants, and a risk of performance and detection bias. Here we report our key outcomes at the longest reported follow-up. There were some limitations to the evidence. No studies investigated the comparison of ventilation tubes versus hearing aids. We did not identify any data on disease-specific quality of life; however, many studies were conducted before the development of specific tools to assess this in otitis media. Short-acting ventilation tubes were used in most studies and thus specific data on the use of long-acting VTs is limited. Finally, we did not identify specific data on the effects of VTs in children at increased risk of OME (e.g. with craniofacial syndromes). Ventilation tubes versus no treatment (four studies) The odds ratio (OR) for a return to normal hearing after 12 months was 1.13 with VTs (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 2.74; 54% versus 51%; 1 study, 72 participants; very low-certainty evidence). At six months, VTs may lead to a large reduction in persistent OME (risk ratio (RR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.65; 20.4% versus 68.0%; 1 study, 54 participants; low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the chance of persistent tympanic membrane perforation with VTs at 12 months (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.91; 8.3% versus 9.7%; 1 RCT, 144 participants). Early ventilation tubes versus watchful waiting (six studies) There was little to no difference in the proportion of children whose hearing returned to normal after 8 to 10 years (i.e. by the age of 9 to 13 years) (RR for VTs 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.03; 93% versus 95%; 1 study, 391 participants; very low-certainty evidence). VTs may also result in little to no difference in the risk of persistent OME after 18 months to 6 years (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.74; 15% versus 12%; 3 studies, 584 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We were unable to pool data on persistent perforation. One study showed that VTs may increase the risk of perforation after a follow-up duration of 3.75 years (RR 3.65, 95% CI 0.41 to 32.38; 1 study, 391 participants; very low-certainty evidence) but the actual number of children who develop persistent perforation may be low, as demonstrated by another study (1.26%; 1 study, 635 ears; very low-certainty evidence). Ventilation tubes versus non-surgical treatment (one study) One study compared VTs to six months of antibiotics (sulphisoxazole). No data were available on return to normal hearing, but final hearing thresholds were reported. At four months, the mean difference was -5.98 dB HL lower (better) for those receiving VTs, but the evidence is very uncertain (95% CI -9.21 to -2.75; 1 study, 125 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No evidence was identified regarding persistent OME. VTs may result in a low risk of persistent perforation at 18 months of follow-up (no events reported; narrative synthesis of 1 study, 60 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ventilation tubes versus myringotomy (nine studies) We are uncertain whether VTs may slightly increase the likelihood of returning to normal hearing at 6 to 12 months, since the confidence intervals were wide and included the possibility of no effect (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.53; 74% versus 64%; 2 studies, 132 participants; very low-certainty evidence). After six months, persistent OME may be reduced for those who receive VTs compared to laser myringotomy, but the evidence is very uncertain (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.38; 1 study, 272 participants; very low-certainty evidence). At six months, the risk of persistent perforation is probably similar with the use of VTs or laser myringotomy (narrative synthesis of 6 studies, 581 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There may be small short- and medium-term improvements in hearing and persistence of OME with VTs, but it is unclear whether these persist after longer follow-up. The RCTs included do not allow us to say when (or how much) VTs improve hearing in any specific child. However, interpretation of the evidence is difficult: many children in the control groups recover spontaneously or receive VTs during follow-up, VTs may block or extrude, and OME may recur. The limited evidence in this review also affects the generalisability/applicability of our findings to situations involving children with underlying conditions (e.g. craniofacial syndromes) or the use of long-acting tubes. Consequently, RCTs may not be the best way to determine whether an intervention is likely to be effective in any individual child. Instead, we must better understand the different OME phenotypes to target interventions to children who will benefit most, and avoid over-treating when spontaneous resolution is likely.

### Ofloxaxin (ofloxacin) [^2b45fe99]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

How often should Ofloxacin Otic Solution be given?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given once daily at about the same time each day (for example, 8 AM or 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

In patients with a Middle Ear Infection, Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given 2 times each day (about 12 hours apart, for example 8 AM and 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise. The best times to use the ear drops are in the morning and at night.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops are not used for as long as the doctor has instructed, the infection may be more likely to return.

What if a dose is missed?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), it is important that you take the drops every day. If you miss a dose which may have been scheduled for earlier in the day, (for example, 8 AM), you should take that day's dose as soon as possible and then go back to your regular daily dosing schedule.

In patients with Middle Ear Infection, if a dose of Ofloxacin Otic Solution is missed, it should be given as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule.

Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the infection is not improved after one week, you should consult your doctor. If you have two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended that you see your doctor for further evaluation.

What activities should be avoided while using Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

It is important that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet. Avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

### Prognostic factors of successful tympanoplasty in pediatric patients: a cohort study [^56f8aaa5]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Arguments in favor of surgery at an earlier age (under 5 years) are the following: 1) reduction in the number of visits to the doctor, which are required for the follow-up of a minor with perforated eardrum; 2) hypoacusis and privation of aquatic activities with affect on the quality of life; 3) higher incidence of severe secondary complications due to chronic otitis media in younger children; 4) better cochlear reserve at younger ages, with greater potential to restore and preserve hearing; 5) limitation of the damage that chronic infection can cause to other structures in the middle ear; and 6) auditory loss that alters the development and the quality of academic activities. Despite this arguments, the recommendation to delay tympanoplasty, generally until six years of age, is widely accepted. In support of said recommendation are the following aspects: alterations in the healing process or re-perforation of the graft by repetitive infections of the superior respiratory tracts; unpredictable function of the Eustachian tubes; immunological immaturity; possibility of spontaneous resolution; difficulty of post-operative care; lack of confidence of the part of the parents in the procedure; and equivalence of the perforation to the function of the ventilation tube. There is evidence that tympanoplasty is more successful in children over six years of age, although other studies have not demonstrated significant differences in this respect.

In addition to age, other factors have been suggested as interfering with the success of the surgery: the size and site of the perforation; cause of the perforation; active infection at the time of surgery; the state of the auditory ossicles and of the mucosa of the middle ear; state of the contralateral ear (as a measure of the function of the Eustachian tube), and the surgical technique utilized. The presence of adenoid tissue, whether it be hypertrophic or chronically infected, has been proposed as a prognostic factor; however, no statistically significant association has been demonstrated, above all in short-term results. A factor that could have interfered in the result was the definition of success that was used. Children with craniofacial syndromes, with or without cleft palate, present a different evolution; for these children, the results reported in the literature are controversial.

The objectives of the present work were to analyze which factors are predictive of success of tympanoplasty in pediatric patients and to construct and validate a prognostic index that could be used as a tool to predict the success of tympanoplasty in children.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^abb57935]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Statement 13 — perioperative ear drops after tympanostomy tube placement — states: Clinicians should not routinely prescribe postoperative antibiotic ear drops after tympanostomy tube placement. This is a recommendation against prescribing based on systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials with a preponderance of benefit over harm. The action statement profile specifies Quality improvement opportunity: Reduce overuse and routine use of antibiotic ear drops after tympanostomy tube surgery; Aggregate evidence quality: Grade B; Level of confidence in evidence: Moderate; Benefits: Avoidance of unnecessary antibiotics, cost savings, reduced local side effects (skin irritation, allergic reactions, fungal overgrowth), simplification of postoperative care; Risks, harms, costs: Potential for perioperative TTO or tube occlusion that may need subsequent treatment, no cost in not prescribing; Benefit–harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm; Intentional vagueness: The word routinely is used to acknowledge that there are specific circumstances that might require or would benefit from antibiotic ear drops; Exceptions: Purulent middle ear fluid or AOM at the time of tube placement; Policy level: Recommendation; and Differences of opinion: None.

### Pacific northwest survey… [^ea3ec39e]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations for swimming precautions are not universal among the physician groups that routinely see patients with tympanostomy tubes. Most primary care physicians and many otolaryngologists continue to prescribe water precautions to patients or parents of patients with tympanostomy tubes, despite published articles that have shown no reduction in the incidence of otorrhea from the use of barrier devices or from the avoidance of swimming. However, postsurgical recommendations regarding water exposure continue to vary widely, even between otolaryngologists. Some otolaryngologists suggest avoiding swimming altogether while others recommend using earplugs as a barrier to water exposure while swimming or bathing. Otolaryngologists are not the only physicians who deal with patients after tympanostomy tube insertion.

Both family practitioners and pediatricians alike routinely see patients with tympanostomy tubes and are undoubtedly asked the question, "Is it appropriate for my child to go swimming". Another such study by Salata and Derkay9 in 1996 reinforced the concept that swimming is not contraindicated with inserted tympanostomy tubes. This study prospectively studied 533 children who underwent myringotomy with tube insertion during a 5-year period. This ambitious and detailed article looked at 3 different treatment groups and a control: group 1, group 2, group 3, and a control group 4. This study evaluated middle ear penetration with 4 types of water exposure: showering, bathing, hair rinsing, and swimming. No positive test results were obtained for showering, hair rinsing, or head submersion in tap water.

They reported that water entered the middle ear space infrequently with submersion in soapy water and in pool water at depths greater than 60 cm. However, there is a lack of evidence linking middle ear contamination with an increased incidence of otorrhea, even in bathwater and while diving. A randomized, controlled trial was published in 2005 by Goldstein et al11 that was the first of its kind to report a statistically significant difference in otorrhea in children who used earplugs vs those who did not while swimming or bathing. They reported no significant differences between episodes of otorrhea between their treatment groups when following up the patients during a 9-month period. Additional Contributions: Carlos R. Esquivel, MD, Brooke Army Medical Center, made a conceptual contribution to this research.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^72f304e1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Safety assessments

Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, otoscopy for presence of bilateral effusion, tube occlusion assessment, audiometric testing, tympanometry, physical examination, and vital sign measurement. Adverse events were classified with standard terminology (ie, system organ class and preferred term) according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 16.1).

Patients, if able, completed audiometric testing (typically ≥ 4 years of age) at screening and days 15 and 29; the audiologist determined the most appropriate test method (visual reinforcement audiometry, conditioned play audiometry, or conventional). The degree of hearing loss was calculated through the pure tone average (PTA; the sum of the threshold levels in decibels obtained for 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, divided by the number of thresholds obtained) was used to calculate the degree of hearing loss and to categorize it as normal hearing (0–15 dB), slight hearing loss (16–25 dB), mild hearing loss (26–40 dB), moderate hearing loss (41–55 dB), moderate-severe hearing loss (56–70 dB), severe hearing loss (71–90 dB), and profound hearing loss (> 90 dB). Shifts from screening in PTA for air conduction, bone conduction, and the air-bone gap — depicting shifts in air-bone gap ≤ 10 vs > 10 dB — were calculated for each ear, each frequency, and each treatment group at each postbaseline measurement. Shifts were also noted from baseline to day 15 and to day 29 for the type of tympanogram (A, B [small/normal/large canal volume], or C), with ears as the unit of analysis.

Statistical Analysis

The cumulative proportion of treatment failures at each time point through day 29 was analyzed via the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, stratified by age (6 months to 2 years and > 2 years), to determine whether the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was equal to 1.0 (ie, no association between treatment and outcome) at the 2-tailed 0.05 alpha level for the full analysis set. Estimates of the strength of association were provided with the adjusted relative risk (RR) and adjusted OR with associated 95% confidence intervals. The cumulative proportions presented were not adjusted for age.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^463cb052]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes in children — ventilation duration, device types, and when to consider long-term tubes: Short-term tubes usually afford 8 to 18 months of middle ear ventilation, with Shepard usually extruding by 8 months; commonly used long-term tubes typically remain in place for 2 years or longer, and subannular ventilation tubes achieve long-term ventilation with median 35 months. The main benefit of T-tubes is prolonged ventilation but they are accompanied by increased risk of perforation, myringosclerosis, granulation tissue, cholesteatoma, and chronic otorrhea. About 25% of children need a second set of short-term tympanostomy tubes and about 8% require a third set, with additional risk factors for repeat surgery including having a parent who is a smoker, daycare attendance, breastfeeding for under 3 months, pacifier use, tympanic membrane atelectasis, male sex, asthma, gastrointestinal disease, and prematurity; however, there are no prospective studies to identify specific risk factors that identify children who would benefit from initial long-term tube placement. Consideration for placement of long-term tympanostomy tubes may be reserved for a subset with conditions such as cleft palate, Trisomy 21, or stenotic ear canals that make short-term tube placement difficult or impossible; other relative indications include an atrophic or atelectatic tympanic membrane or a history of premature extrusion of at least 2 sets of prior short-term tubes, and less often family preference to avoid multiple exposures to general anesthesia.

Tympanometry — parameters and interpretation: Standard tympanometry uses a 226-Hz probe tone for patients 6 months and older. A normal type A tympanogram with peak pressure greater than −100 mm water is associated with effusion in only 3% of ears at any age, whereas a type B (flat) tympanogram is associated with middle ear effusion (MEE) in 85% to 100% of ears. When a patent tympanostomy tube is present, the equivalent ear canal volume is typically between 1.0 and 5.5 cm3.

### Modifiable risk factors for developing otitis media with effusion in children under 12 years in high-income countries: a systematic review [^e2c11547]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To systematically assess the modifiable risk factors for developing otitis media with effusion (OME) in children under 12 years.

Methods

We searched Embase, MEDLINE, INAHTA database, CENTRAL, CDSR and Epistemonikos for cohort studies with ≥ 40 children per arm/prognostic factor, published in English from 2000 to November 2022. We assessed risk of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies checklist, and overall evidence quality was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. Outcomes were analysed as risk ratio (RR), OR or Peto OR.

Results

Seven studies totalling 2760292 children were included. The evidence was very low quality. Fluid or pus discharge from ears (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.01 to 4.35) and exposure to other children (RR 2.79, 95%CI 1.98 to 3.93) (OR 5.21, 95%CI 2.9 to 9.36) were strongly associated with development of OME. Coughs/colds ≥ 5 times (OR 1.91, 95%CI 1.22 to 2.99), breathing problems ≥ 5 times (RR 1.78, 95%CI 1.26 to 2.53) and ear infections (RR 1.95, 95%CI 1.39 to 2.72) in past year were associated with development of OME. Adenoid hypertrophy was strongly associated with development of fluctuating OME (recurrent OME) (OR 9.96, 95%CI 5.17 to 19.19). There was scare evidence for some potential modifiable risk factors, including breast feeding, household smoking, gastro-oesophageal reflux, dummy use and swimming.

Conclusions

Upper respiratory tract infection, ear infection, adenoid hypertrophy and exposure to other children could be the predictors for development of OME. Further observational studies are needed to investigate other potential modifiable risk factors.

### Phase 3 trials of thermosensitive ciprofloxacin gel for middle ear effusion in children with tubes [^3224710b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy, safety, and microbiology of a thermosensitive otic suspension of ciprofloxacin (OTO-201) in children with bilateral middle ear effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement.

Study Design

Two randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled phase 3 trials. Patients were randomized to intratympanic OTO-201 or sham.

Setting

Children with bilateral middle ear effusion undergoing tympanostomy tube placement.

Subjects/Methods

Studies evaluated 532 patients (6 months to 17 years old) in a combined analysis of efficacy (treatment failure: presence of otorrhea, otic or systemic antibiotic use, lost to follow-up, missed visits), safety (audiometry, otoscopy, tympanometry), and microbiology.

Results

There was a lower cumulative proportion of treatment failures in patients receiving OTO-201 vs tympanostomy tubes alone (1) on days 4, 8, 15, and 29; (2) on day 15, primary end point (23.0% vs 45.1%; age-adjusted odds ratio, 0.341; P < .001; reduction in relative risk, 49%); and (3) on day 15, blinded-assessor otorrhea treatment failure (7.0% vs 19.4%; age-adjusted odds ratio, 0.303; P < .001; reduction in relative risk, 64%). Per-protocol and subgroup analyses (baseline demographics, pathogen type, culture status, effusion type, microbiologic response) supported these findings. There were no drug-related serious adverse events; the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in both groups were pyrexia, postoperative pain, nasopharyngitis, cough, and upper respiratory tract infection. OTO-201 administration had no evidence of increased tube occlusion and no negative effect on audiometry, tympanometry, or otoscopy.

Conclusions

Combined analysis of 2 phase 3 trials demonstrated a lower cumulative proportion of treatment failures through day 15 compared with TT alone when OTO-201 was administered intratympanically for otitis media with bilateral middle ear effusion at time of tympanostomy tube placement.

### Health supervision for people with achondroplasia [^5aef82d9]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Achondroplasia — anticipatory guidance and safety — Discuss early-intervention services if needed. This is not a uniform recommendation simply because of the diagnosis of achondroplasia. Review the increased risk of serous otitis media because of short eustachian tubes. Indicate that an ear examination is appropriate with any persistent or severe upper respiratory tract infection or when parents suspect that ear pain may be present. There is a risk of jugular bulb dehiscence (absence of the temporal bone "roof" over the jugular bulb) in patients with achondroplasia. This malformation predisposes to accidental puncture of the jugular bulb during tympanostomy tube placement. Avoid infant carriers and seated positions that "curl up" the infant or young child and avoid prolonged unsupported sitting. Advise parents to use an infant seat or infant carrier that has a firm back (reduced padding) to support the neck and to use a rear-facing car safety seat for as long as possible. Infants should not sleep unattended in car seats; this is especially important in those with achondroplasia because decreased axial tone and strength in combination with the large head creates great risk of craniocervical and airway compromise. Be aware that external rotation of the hips is commonly present and usually disappears spontaneously when the child begins to bear weight. This finding does not require bracing for the infant.

### Interventions for ear discharge associated with grommets (ventilation tubes) [^0edac2a7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The insertion of grommets (also known as ventilation or tympanostomy tubes) is one of the most common surgical procedures performed on children. Postoperative otorrhoea (discharge) is the most common complication with a reported incidence ranging from 10% to 50%. In the UK, many ENT surgeons treat with topical antibiotics/steroid combinations, but general practitioners, mainly through fears of ototoxicity, are unlikely to prescribe these and choose systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Objectives

1. To identify the most effective non-surgical management of discharge from ears with grommets in place.2. To identify the risks of non-surgical management for this condition (e.g. ototoxicity), and to set benefits of treatment against these risks.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005) and EMBASE (1974 to 2005). We also searched the CINAHL, AMED, LILACS, ISI WEB OF KNOWLEDGE, ISI PROCEEDINGS, mRCT, NNR, ZETOC, KOREAMED, CSA, MEDCARIB, INDMED and SAMED databases. The date of the last search was February 2005.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of adults or children, with any type of grommet and an ear with discharge were included. The trials compared treatment with placebo or one treatment with another. The primary outcome measure was the duration of the discharge.

Data Collection and Analysis

The trials were selected independently according to the above criteria by the four reviewers. Differences in opinion over the inclusion of studies were resolved by discussion. The studies were graded using the CASP critical appraisal tool. Analyses were based on the presence of discharge seven days from the onset of treatment.

Main Results

There was very little good quality evidence. Four studies were included, all of them investigating different interventions and therefore a meta-analysis was not possible. Only one study demonstrated a significant difference. Oral amoxicillin clavulanate was compared to placebo in 79 patients. The odds of having a discharge persisting eight days after starting treatment was 0.19 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.49). The number needed to treat to achieve that benefit is 2.5. Participants in both arms of this study also received daily aural toilet. The results will therefore not be applicable to most settings including primary care. No significant benefit was shown in the two studies investigating steroids (oral prednisolone with oral amoxicillin clavulanate and topical dexamethasone with topical ciprofloxacin ear drops), or the one study comparing an antibiotic-steroid combination (Otosporin(R)) drops versus spray (Otomize(R)) (although more patients preferred the spray form).

Authors' Conclusions

The authors of this review have been unable to identify the most effective intervention or to assess the associated risks. Research is urgently needed into the effectiveness of oral versus topical antibiotics in this group of patients. Clinicians considering antibiotic treatment need to balance any potential benefit against the risks of side effects and antibiotic resistance.

### Testosterone (testim) [^c83807c6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Administration Instructions

Upon opening the tube the entire contents should be squeezed into the palm of the hand and immediately applied to the shoulders and/or upper arms (area of application should be limited to the area that will be covered by the patient's short sleeve T-shirt (see figure below). Do not apply TESTIM to the genitals or to the abdomen.

Application sites should be allowed to dry for a few minutes prior to dressing. Hands should be washed thoroughly with soap and water after TESTIM has been applied. Avoid fire, flame or smoking during the application of TESTIM until the TESTIM has dried [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.16)].

In order to prevent transfer to another person, wear clothing to cover the application sites. If direct skin-to-skin contact with another person is anticipated, the application sites must be washed thoroughly with soap and water [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The patient should avoid swimming or showering or washing the administration site for a minimum of 2 hours after application [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Strict adherence to the following precautions is advised in order to minimize the potential for secondary exposure to testosterone from TESTIM-treated skin:

Children and women should avoid contact with unwashed or unclothed application site(s) of men using TESTIM.
TESTIM should only be applied to the upper arms and shoulders. The area of application should be limited to the area that will be covered by a short sleeve T-shirt.
Patients should wash their hands with soap and water immediately after applying TESTIM.
Patients should cover the application site(s) with clothing (e.g., a T-shirt) after the gel has dried.
Prior to situations in which direct skin-to-skin contact is anticipated, patients should wash the application site(s) thoroughly with soap and water to remove any testosterone residue.
In the event that unwashed or unclothed skin to which TESTIM has been applied comes in direct contact with the skin of another person, the general area of contact on the other person should be washed with soap and water as soon as possible.

### Tympanostomy tubes and water exposure… [^b273fe1c]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Of 1266 board-certified otolaryngologists surveyed, 13% forbade all swimming, 53% recommended using ear plugs during swimming, and only 3% allowed unrestricted swimming. These water precautions deter a parent or pediatrician from proceeding with M/T or even seeking otolaryngology consultation. This study sought to determine whether and under what conditions water exposure causes middle ear contamination via a patent TT. Four types of practical water exposure were evaluated: showering, bathing, hair rinsing, and swimming. A positive test result corresponded to water entering the middle ear cavity via the patent TT and was confirmed by a zero resistance reading on the ohmmeter. A negative test result indicated no change in the initial high resistance reading. Most parents ask, "Can he get water in his ears. " when confronted with the recommendation for TTs.

For generations, strict water precautions have been recommended, forcing parents to struggle with avoiding water exposure and assumed contamination of the middle ear. In turn, children have been restricted from swimming or have been forced to wear ear plugs during everyday activities involving water exposure. We found that surface swimming had a 13% incidence of water entry in our model, whereas swimming in depths greater than 60 cm led to an increased incidence of 55%. This difference was statistically significant and may increase the chance of otorrhea. Our data also correlate with those of Lonusbury, 9 who concluded that diving and deep swimming led to a higher incidence of otorrhea, yet surface swimming was found to be safe even without ear protection. Considering that most patients of M/T age are less daring than their older counterparts, most will likely surface swim only, thereby reducing their risk of middle ear contamination.

Our recommendations for water exposure in children with tympanostomy are as follows: Showering, hair rinsing, and head submersion in clean tap water do not require EAC protection. Protection of the EAC during bathing in soapy water is not necessary, although head submersion does increase the incidence of middle ear contamination and is not advised. Surface swimming in chlorinated pool water without EAC protection is allowable. Because deeper swimming or diving significantly increases the likelihood of middle ear contamination, restrictions may be considered. Given the lack of evidence that water contamination actually leads to otorrhea, we do not advise restrictions unless a patient clearly develops suppurative otitis media after water contamination.
