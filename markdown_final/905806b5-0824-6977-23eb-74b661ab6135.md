## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate treatment plan for a 42-year-old man with COVID-19, shortness of breath, and fever, who is stable on 2 L/min nasal cannula with SpO2 98%, and whether remdesivir, dexamethasone, nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, and tocilizumab are indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about severity classification and whether he meets criteria for severe disease. Then, I should verify the timing of symptom onset to determine eligibility for antivirals. Next, I will review indications and contraindications for each proposed therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a guideline-concordant plan and highlight what to avoid and what to monitor, making sure I double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the severity classification, because everything hinges on this. Severe COVID-19 is defined by SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air or the need for supplemental oxygen, whereas mild-to-moderate disease is SpO2 > 94% without oxygen; this patient has SpO2 98% on room air and only receives low-flow oxygen for comfort, so he does not meet severe criteria, and I should not misclassify him as severe just because he has dyspnea and fever [^c4a6db27] [^72a1cf62] [^27e8fc97].

> Wait, let me verify the timing of symptom onset, because antiviral benefit drops with delay. He has had symptoms for 3 days, so he is within the window for nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (≤ 5 days) and within the window for remdesivir in high-risk outpatients (≤ 7 days), which matters for eligibility and expected benefit [^c02e783f] [^1b47521c].

> I will now examine nirmatrelvir/ritonavir. For mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in patients at high risk for progression, a 5-day oral course started within 5 days of symptom onset reduces hospitalization and death; I should confirm he has risk factors such as age ≥ 50, BMI ≥ 25, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, or is unvaccinated, and if so, this is first-line outpatient therapy unless contraindicated by significant renal or hepatic impairment or drug–drug interactions that cannot be managed [^c02e783f] [^3b698540].

> Next, I should review remdesivir. In high-risk outpatients with mild-to-moderate disease within 7 days of symptom onset, a 3-day IV regimen reduces progression; however, it requires infusion access and is generally reserved for those who cannot take nirmatrelvir/ritonavir due to contraindications or drug interactions, so I need to check whether oral therapy is feasible before choosing IV remdesivir [^d169fd10] [^1b47521c] [^c02e783f].

> Hold on, I should verify dexamethasone indications. Dexamethasone is indicated for hospitalized patients with severe or critical COVID-19, particularly those requiring supplemental oxygen, and confers mortality benefit in that context; it is not recommended for mild-to-moderate disease without hypoxemia, and using it too early may be harmful by suppressing antiviral immunity during the viremic phase, so I should avoid dexamethasone here [^3cd5fe0b] [^025e3cb8] [^cf22dd6b].

> Let me consider tocilizumab carefully. Tocilizumab is indicated for hospitalized patients with severe or critical COVID-19 who have rapidly progressive disease with elevated inflammatory markers and are receiving corticosteroids; it is not indicated for mild-to-moderate outpatient disease, so prescribing it now would be inappropriate and exposes the patient to unnecessary risks and costs [^a9bd3e62] [^3cd5fe0b].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought remdesivir might be indicated in all hospitalized patients, but I should double-check that nuance. Remdesivir is recommended in hospitalized patients with severe but not critical disease, and in some high-risk nonhospitalized patients within 7 days of symptoms; it is not routinely recommended for critical illness or for those already on mechanical ventilation, where benefit is uncertain, so I need to ensure I apply it to the right severity and timing [^d4801c0c] [^1b47521c] [^3cd5fe0b].

> I need to ensure supportive care is addressed. For mild-to-moderate disease, management is supportive with antipyretics, hydration, and monitoring for deterioration; I should advise home pulse oximetry and clear return precautions if dyspnea worsens or SpO2 drops below 94% on room air, aligning with outpatient guidance and severity definitions [^3b698540] [^c4a6db27].

> But wait, what if he declines oral therapy or has unmanageable drug interactions with ritonavir? In that scenario, I should reconsider remdesivir as an outpatient infusion over 3 days, recognizing the logistical burden and the need to start within 7 days; I should also document the rationale and counsel on expected benefits and risks [^d169fd10] [^1b47521c].

> Final synthesis: This patient has mild-to-moderate COVID-19 without hypoxemia, so he does not meet criteria for dexamethasone or tocilizumab; if he is high risk for progression, I would prioritize nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for 5 days started now, and if that is not feasible, consider a 3-day outpatient remdesivir course; I would avoid dexamethasone and tocilizumab, monitor symptoms and oxygenation closely, and arrange follow-up within 24–48 hours to ensure stability and adherence [^c02e783f] [^1b47521c] [^3cd5fe0b] [^3b698540].

This 42-year-old male with COVID-19, shortness of breath, and fever for 3 days is **clinically stable with SpO2 98% on 2 L NC** and does not meet criteria for severe disease [^c4a6db27]. The proposed regimen is **inappropriate**: remdesivir and tocilizumab are for severe/critical illness [^d4801c0c] [^a9bd3e62], and dexamethasone is not indicated without hypoxemia [^025e3cb8]. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is the only appropriate therapy if he is high risk for progression, started within 5 days of symptom onset [^c02e783f]. Otherwise, manage supportively with oxygen, fluids, and monitoring [^3b698540].

---

## Clinical severity assessment

By IDSA/ACC definitions, **severe illness** is SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air or needing supplemental oxygen; **critical illness** is mechanical ventilation or ECMO [^c4a6db27] [^005aa08a]. This patient has SpO2 98% on 2 L NC, so he has **mild-to-moderate disease**, not severe or critical [^c4a6db27].

## Indications for proposed therapies

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Evidence/guideline** |
|-|-|-|
| Remdesivir | Severe/critical COVID-19 or high-risk outpatients within 7 days | IDSA 2025; FDA [^d4801c0c] [^1b47521c] |
| Dexamethasone | Severe/critical COVID-19 with hypoxemia | IDSA 2022; RECOVERY [^025e3cb8] [^b56353ed] |
| Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir | Mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients within 5 days | FDA; IDSA 2025 [^c02e783f] [^3b698540] |
| Tocilizumab | Severe/critical COVID-19 with elevated inflammatory markers and corticosteroids | IDSA 2025; FDA [^a9bd3e62] [^8f8c8ea9] |

---

This patient does not meet criteria for remdesivir, dexamethasone, or tocilizumab; **only nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is appropriate if he is high risk and within 5 days of symptoms** [^c02e783f].

---

## Risks of inappropriate therapies

- **Remdesivir**: unnecessary IV therapy, cost, and adverse effects (e.g. liver enzyme elevations) [^c02e783f].
- **Dexamethasone**: harm without hypoxemia, including infections and delayed viral clearance [^cf22dd6b].
- **Tocilizumab**: unnecessary immunosuppression, infections, and cost [^notfound].

---

## Recommended management

- **Supportive care**: oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 94%, fluids, antipyretics, and close monitoring [^3b698540].
- **Antiviral therapy**: nirmatrelvir/ritonavir if high risk for progression and within 5 days of symptoms [^c02e783f].
- **Monitoring**: vitals, oxygen needs, and symptoms; escalate care if deterioration [^3b698540].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The proposed regimen is **not guideline-concordant** for this patient's mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Use supportive care and consider nirmatrelvir/ritonavir only if high risk and within 5 days; avoid remdesivir, dexamethasone, and tocilizumab unless severe/critical criteria emerge [^c4a6db27] [^c02e783f].

### Outpatient management of COVID-19: rapid evidence review [^6be96ac8]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Common presenting symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 include fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue. However, patients may have a wide range of symptoms representing a spectrum of mild to severe illness. Symptoms in children tend to be milder and may include fever, cough, and feeding difficulty. The incubation period is two to 14 days, although symptoms typically appear within five days of exposure. Multiple testing modalities exist, but infection should be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing using a nasopharyngeal swab. There are no evidence- based treatments appropriate for use in the outpatient setting; management is supportive and should include education about isolation. In hospitalized patients, remdesivir should be considered to reduce time to recovery, and low-dose dexamethasone should be considered in patients who require supplemental oxygen. Overall, 85% of patients have mild illness, whereas 14% have severe disease requiring hospitalization, including 5% who require admission to an intensive care unit. Predictors of severe disease include increasing age, comorbidities, lymphopenia, neutrophilia, leukocytosis, low oxygen saturation, and increased levels of C-reactive protein, d-dimer, transaminases, and lactate dehydrogenase.

### Review of burden, clinical definitions, and management of COVID-19 cases [^0af632da]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Severe and critical illness.

Severe COVID-19 (Figure 1) is defined by symptoms of significant respiratory distress which in adults are tachypnea ≥ 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation ≤ 93%, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio < 300 mmHg, lung infiltrates > 50% within 24–48 hours, or clinical assessment of severe distress. This definition encompasses acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), defined by acute onset, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, and bilateral infiltrates on CXR.Through the course of the illness, most patients will develop a fever (77–98.6%) and cough (48.2–76%)., Other common symptoms include myalgia or fatigue, which appear early in the illness and are seen in around 18–32.1% of cases,sore throat,and dyspnea.Fatigue may ultimately occur in up to 69.6% of patients through the course of the illness, but is nonspecific.Severe COVID-19 appears to be more common in men, with 54.3–68% of hospitalized patients in studies being males. It has likewise been associated with comorbidities; however, severe illness and death can occur in previously young, healthy individuals, including infants.

Case presentation

A 25-year-old male presented to an outside emergency department (ED) with a five-day history of cough, shortness of breath, nasal congestion, fatigue and loss of taste and smell. He had a past medical history of asthma and morbid obesity (BMI 50.5 kg/m 2). The patient had no known connective tissue disease or hypertrophic scarring reactions. He had a 2-year history of vaping but states he quit one month prior to presentation. Sick contacts include a brother and his mother who tested positive for COVID-19 four days prior. He had a positive COVID-19 test three days prior to admission. In the ED, he was hypoxic to 88% on room air and tachycardic at 133 bpm. He improved to 90% saturation on 3 L nasal cannula (NC). Venous blood gas revealed normal venous pH of 7.4 and increased PCO2 of 50. Chest x-ray (CXR) revealed bilateral airspace disease consistent with known COVID-19 infection. He was admitted to the MICU and treated with Remdesivir and high dose steroids. He became febrile to 102.9 F, tachycardic to 134 bpm, tachypneic to 28, and required 15 L O 2 via high-flow nasal cannula. D-dimer was normal at 0.28. His respiratory status continued to decline over the night of admission, requiring BiPAP with a minute volume of 25 L and respiratory rate of 40. Due to worsening respiratory distress and persistent hypoxia, despite aggressive respiratory support, the patient required intubation.

### Post-discharge symptoms among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Nigeria: a single-center study [^6c116b8d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Two asymptomatic patients on day 7 of follow-up later developed symptoms on days 14 and 30. One of these previously asymptomatic patients is a 28-year-old health-care worker who developed fever and dry cough 30 days after a previously negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19 and 6 weeks after the first diagnosis of COVID-19. A repeat PCR test confirmed COVID-19, but viral culture could not be done, and genomic sequencing of patient samples was not available at the time of this report. The second patient was a 46-year-old housewife who developed chest pain and throat discomfort on day 14 of follow-up.

Lower limb numbness and leg pain were reported by four patients on days 7, 21, and 58 of follow-up. Two of these patients reported associated painful leg swelling and were confirmed to have deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which was corroborated by lower limb Doppler ultrasound (Figure 3). These cases of DVT resolved on days 14 and 238 of follow-up after use of compression stockings and oral anticoagulant therapy (20 mg rivaroxaban twice daily). A 71-year-old who was diagnosed as hypertensive for the first time during hospitalization for COVID-19 complained of fatigue and excessive expectoration of mucus on day 7 of follow-up. On day 37 post-discharge, he developed progressive right-side limb weakness associated with slurring of speech and worsening fatigue. A brain computed tomographic scan was normal. A diagnosis of ischemic stroke was made. After physiotherapy, anti-platelet therapy, and blood pressure control, limb weakness and slurred speech resolved completely within 2 weeks. At day 154 post-discharge, this patient complained of persistent fatigue but was otherwise clinically stable. A 45-year-old health-care worker complained of nighttime shortness of breath and nightmares on day 7 of follow-up. Nighttime shortness of breath persisted on day 21 of follow-up and was associated with dry cough. On clinical evaluation, vital signs and chest examination were essentially normal. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry remained > 98% at every follow-up visit. All symptoms resolved on day 31 of follow-up and the patient has remained asymptomatic at day 211 of follow-up.

### Undetectable SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal swab but persistent viral RNA from deep lung swabs: findings from an autopsy [^570c9af0]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

During the global pandemic of COVID-19 accurate diagnosis of the infection by demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA by PCR in specimens is crucial for therapeutic and preventative interventions. There have been instances where nasal and throat swabs have been negative despite the patient having typical clinical and radiological findings compatible with the disease. We report a case of a man in his late 50s, brought to the hospital following a cardiac arrest and prolonged unsuccessful resuscitation. The history was typical for COVID-19 with fever for 10 days and worsening shortness of breath. His throat and nasal swabs (after death) were negative for SARS-CoV-2. A limited diagnostic autopsy was performed after 27 days, and lung swabs confirmed presence of SARS-CoV-2. This case highlights the importance of lung swabs when initial upper respiratory tract swabs are negative and proves that the virus can be detected from dead human tissue almost a month later.

Mild to Moderate Illness Most patients with COVID-19 experience asymptomatic or mild illness that does not warrant medical intervention, or mild to moderate illness that can be managed in the outpatient setting. These patients can benefit from supportive care and symptomatic treatment, including antipyretics, analgesics, and antitussives. Patients can also be instructed on efforts they can take to reduce transmission and symptoms that indicate the need for additional medical attention. Some patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 may be at increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19. For these patients, therapeutics, such as antivirals, have been shown to significantly decrease the risk of hospitalization and death, and outcomes are improved if therapeutics are started within the first days of illness. The FDA has approved the intravenous antiviral medication remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients.

The FDA has also approved the oral antiviral nirmatrelvir with ritonavir for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progression to severe disease. In addition, the FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for the oral antiviral molnupiravir, which can be used for treatment of patients with mild to moderate illness who are at risk for severe illness. Clinicians should refer to the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines for up-to-date recommendations regarding eligibility, effectiveness of therapeutics, rationale for treatment of sub-populations, specific drug classes, general management, and therapeutic management. Additionally, the FDA has issued an EUA to permit the emergency use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma with high titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19 in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment, in either the outpatient or inpatient setting.

Case presentation

A 17-year-old, previously healthy male developed fevers to a maximum temperature of 102 °F, drenching night sweats, cough, nasal congestion, and chest tightness. One week prior to the onset of illness, the patient and his family were exposed to a COVID-19 positive sick contact, so at the onset of symptoms, our patient was tested and returned positive for COVID-19 via nasal polymerase chain reaction (PCR). For the next seven days, these infectious symptoms continued including a five-pound weight loss during this time. On day seven of illness, the patient complained of acute worsening of shortness of breath, lightheadedness, two episodes of hemoptysis, and was noted to have an oxygen saturation of 86% on a home oxygen monitor. He was then brought to a local community hospital for evaluation on day seven of illness for evaluation. On arrival, patient was febrile to 101.2 °F, but otherwise had reassuring respiratory rate, regular heart rate, normal lung exam, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Repeat COVID-19 PCR again was positive. On a routine chest x-ray, he was found to have a 5 cm left upper lobe mass and a 3 cm right paratracheal mass (Fig. 1). Concurrent lab findings noted a normal complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function testing, and liver function tests. To better delineate chest x-ray findings, patient underwent a chest computed tomography (CT) which showed multiple bilateral cavitary lung lesions, largest within the left upper lobe measuring 6.5 cm in diameter (Fig. 2). With these findings, patient was transferred to our tertiary care pediatric hospital for further management.

Case Presentation

A 27-year-old accountant came to the ED with difficulty walking and progressive weakness of both lower limbs for 4 days' duration. He did not report a history of trauma or fall. He demonstrated no vertigo, headache, neck or back pain, disturbed vision, loss of weight, or weakness in upper limbs. He also reported difficulty breathing, fever, severe abdominal pain, and loose stools of 1 day's duration. His recorded maximum temperature at home was 38.3 °C. The fever subsided with oral paracetamol 500 mg. He did not report having weakness in any limb before the current presentation. He did not have comorbid diabetes mellitus or hypertension. Thirty days before presentation, he experienced fever, cough, and rhinorrhea and received a diagnosis of COVID-19 after reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. At that time, symptoms had been minimal, vitals signs and chest radiography findings were normal, and he had undergone home isolation. He had maintained an oxygen saturation of 98% to 99% as measured on pulse oximetry. He had not received any treatment at that time. His symptoms had lasted for 7 days, and he remained asymptomatic up to the current presentation with paraparesis.

### Outpatient treatment for COVID-19 (...) [^c02e783f]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir has US Food and Drug Administration approval for people aged 18 years or older and is available under Emergency Use Authorization for individuals aged 12 to 17 years who weigh at least 40 kg. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir is taken orally, twice daily for 5 days, and should be started within 5 days of onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The most common side effects of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir are altered taste, nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir should not be prescribed to people with severe kidney or liver disease, and it should not be taken with certain drugs. Doctors may temporarily stop, replace, or decrease the dose of medications that interact with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Some patients experience a return of COVID-19 symptoms after completing a 5-day course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir.

This symptom “rebound” is not associated with an increased risk of developing severe disease and does not need to be treated with another course of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Remdesivir has FDA approval for treatment of COVID-19 in people aged 28 days or older who weigh at least 3 kg. For outpatients, remdesivir is given intravenously daily for 3 days and should be started within 7 days of COVID-19 symptoms. Because intravenous infusion is required, remdesivir is reserved for patients who are ineligible for treatment with nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Remdesivir commonly causes nausea and diarrhea and, rarely, causes allergic reactions and elevations in liver function tests. Nirmatrelvir-ritonavir and remdesivir substantially decrease risk of hospitalization and work best when taken early in the course of COVID-19.

Most patients improve several days to 2 weeks after starting these medications, but those who develop shortness of breath or other concerning symptoms should seek immediate medical care. Patients with weakened immune systems who have prolonged COVID-19 symptoms and persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 test results may benefit from longer courses of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir or remdesivir.

### Steroid harms if given early in COVID-19 viraemia [^cf22dd6b]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

COVID-19 is a biphasic illness with an initial viraemia phase and later effective adaptive immune phase, except in a minority of people who develop severe disease. Immune regulation is the key target to treat COVID illness. In anticipation, an elderly man self-medicated himself with dexamethasone on the day of symptom onset of a flu-like illness, took other symptomatic measures and was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. His condition deteriorated with each passing day resulting in hospitalisation. He demanded oxygen and declared as severe COVID. With supportive treatment, he recovered after the 20th day of illness. Immunosuppression and anti-inflammation are likely to benefit when the immune response is dysregulated and turning into a cytokine storm. A medication that has saved many could be the one predisposing to severity if taken as a preventive measure, too early in the disease course, especially the viraemia phase.

### Signs and symptoms to determine if a patient presenting in primary care or hospital outpatient settings has COVID-19 disease [^2e301a2b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Some people with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain asymptomatic, whilst in others the infection can cause mild to moderate COVID-19 disease and COVID-19 pneumonia, leading some patients to require intensive care support and, in some cases, to death, especially in older adults. Symptoms such as fever or cough, and signs such as oxygen saturation or lung auscultation findings, are the first and most readily available diagnostic information. Such information could be used to either rule out COVID-19 disease, or select patients for further diagnostic testing.

Objectives

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of signs and symptoms to determine if a person presenting in primary care or to hospital outpatient settings, such as the emergency department or dedicated COVID-19 clinics, has COVID-19 disease or COVID-19 pneumonia.

Search Methods

On 27 April 2020, we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the University of Bern living search database, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Studies were eligible if they included patients with suspected COVID-19 disease, or if they recruited known cases with COVID-19 disease and controls without COVID-19. Studies were eligible when they recruited patients presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings. Studies including patients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection while admitted to hospital were not eligible. The minimum eligible sample size of studies was 10 participants. All signs and symptoms were eligible for this review, including individual signs and symptoms or combinations. We accepted a range of reference standards including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), clinical expertise, imaging, serology tests and World Health Organization (WHO) or other definitions of COVID-19.

Data Collection and Analysis

Pairs of review authors independently selected all studies, at both title and abstract stage and full-text stage. They resolved any disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently extracted data and resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 checklist. Analyses were descriptive, presenting sensitivity and specificity in paired forest plots, in ROC (receiver operating characteristic) space and in dumbbell plots. We did not attempt meta-analysis due to the small number of studies, heterogeneity across studies and the high risk of bias.

Main Results

We identified 16 studies including 7706 participants in total. Prevalence of COVID-19 disease varied from 5% to 38% with a median of 17%. There were no studies from primary care settings, although we did find seven studies in outpatient clinics (2172 participants), and four studies in the emergency department (1401 participants). We found data on 27 signs and symptoms, which fall into four different categories: systemic, respiratory, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular. No studies assessed combinations of different signs and symptoms and results were highly variable across studies. Most had very low sensitivity and high specificity; only six symptoms had a sensitivity of at least 50% in at least one study: cough, sore throat, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache. Of these, fever, myalgia or arthralgia, fatigue, and headache could be considered red flags (defined as having a positive likelihood ratio of at least 5) for COVID-19 as their specificity was above 90%, meaning that they substantially increase the likelihood of COVID-19 disease when present. Seven studies carried a high risk of bias for selection of participants because inclusion in the studies depended on the applicable testing and referral protocols, which included many of the signs and symptoms under study in this review. Five studies only included participants with pneumonia on imaging, suggesting that this is a highly selected population. In an additional four studies, we were unable to assess the risk for selection bias. These factors make it very difficult to determine the diagnostic properties of these signs and symptoms from the included studies. We also had concerns about the applicability of these results, since most studies included participants who were already admitted to hospital or presenting to hospital settings. This makes these findings less applicable to people presenting to primary care, who may have less severe illness and a lower prevalence of COVID-19 disease. None of the studies included any data on children, and only one focused specifically on older adults. We hope that future updates of this review will be able to provide more information about the diagnostic properties of signs and symptoms in different settings and age groups.

Authors' Conclusions

The individual signs and symptoms included in this review appear to have very poor diagnostic properties, although this should be interpreted in the context of selection bias and heterogeneity between studies. Based on currently available data, neither absence nor presence of signs or symptoms are accurate enough to rule in or rule out disease. Prospective studies in an unselected population presenting to primary care or hospital outpatient settings, examining combinations of signs and symptoms to evaluate the syndromic presentation of COVID-19 disease, are urgently needed. Results from such studies could inform subsequent management decisions such as self-isolation or selecting patients for further diagnostic testing. We also need data on potentially more specific symptoms such as loss of sense of smell. Studies in older adults are especially important.

Hospitalized patients with SpO2 ≤94% on room air—remdesivir use and course length: The panel agreed that the overall certainty of the evidence for treatment of persons with severe disease with remdesivir compared to no remdesivir treatment was moderate, and they agreed that the reported data supported the prioritization of remdesivir among persons with severe but not critical COVID-19. The panel recognized a knowledge gap when assessing whether greater benefit could be attained for patients with oxygen saturation >94% and no supplemental oxygen. For treatment duration, the panel agreed on the overall certainty of the evidence for a five-day course compared to a 10-day course as low due to concerns with risk of bias and imprecision, recognized the benefit of a shorter course if providing similar or greater efficacy on the availability of remdesivir, and noted that in a subgroup analysis of mechanically ventilated patients the duration of treatment was 10 days in ACCT-1 trial; therefore, the panel recognized that a longer course of treatment could be desirable in this population.

### Logistical challenge with prehospital use of high-flow nasal oxygen therapy in COVID-19-induced respiratory distress: a case report [^bbf4139a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Although commonly used inside hospitals, no previous case report has been published on high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) therapy in an adult in the prehospital setting. Case Report A 46-year-old nonsmoking man presented with a cough and fever. He deteriorated suddenly 5 days later. When the basic life support team arrived, his peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) in ambient air was 56% and respiratory rate was 46 breaths/min. The man was weak with thoracoabdominal asynchrony. An emergency medical team with a physician was dispatched. As France was still under lockdown for the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic, COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) was suspected. In spite of 15 L/min of oxygen delivered with a nonrebreathing mask, the patient's SpO 2 tended to drop below 90% at the slightest effort and during transport from home to the ambulance. It was therefore decided to start HFNO therapy. The patient was transferred to an intensive care unit, where HFNO was continued. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? As the trend in emergency medical services may move toward prehospital HFNO, this case report is an opportunity to question the feasibility of HFNO therapy in the prehospital setting.

CASE PRESENTATION

Case 1.

The first case is a 74-year-old man known to have asthma, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), and dyslipidemia (Table 1). He was admitted to a quarantine facility because of an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection identified through screening (RT-PCR). The local guideline at the time warranted two negative PCR swabs before discharge. SARS-CoV-2 was repeatedly positive for 49 days. He showed clinical improvement and was discharged after negative results (Table 1).

Table 1 
Summary of baseline characteristics, clinical features, and laboratory test results, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes of six cases with prolonged viral shedding

Case 2.

A healthy 19-year-old man presented with a short history of fever and sore throat. The examination was remarkable for low-grade fever and tachycardia, and laboratory investigations and chest X-ray were unremarkable. He was diagnosed as a case of COVID-19 mild URTI and did not require hospital admission but transited through quarantine. His PCR swab remained positive for 48 days.

Case 3.

A previously healthy 46-year-old man presented with a 7-day history of fever, dry cough, and mild dyspnea. On examination, he was febrile, mildly tachypneic, tachycardic, but maintained oxygen saturation on room air. His chest X-ray revealed consolidation involving the left mid and lower zones. SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested positive, and he was started on COVID-19 management for pneumonia following local protocols. The repeated PCR tests were persistently positive for 47 days. The patient was discharged home, asymptomatic after negative PCR.

### A 16-year-old boy with cough and fever in the era of COVID-19 [^e9642273]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

A 16-year-old white boy with a history of chronic lung disease of prematurity, cough-variant asthma, and incidental lung nodules presented to the emergency center in spring 2020 with acute onset dry cough, shortness of breath, and fever. An initial history, gathered from his mother because of the patient's respiratory distress, revealed no recent travel. However, his mother is a health care worker at a hospital, and sick contacts included ongoing contact with a friend with cold-like symptoms. He had a variety of animals at home, including a dog, cats, fish, rodents, and reptiles. He had a history of vaping tobacco products >6 months ago. Fever and respiratory symptoms were associated with fatigue, chest tightness, abdominal pain, and myalgias. On examination, he was ill appearing and had tachycardia, tachypnea, borderline hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 91% on room air, diminished breath sounds at the lung bases, and unremarkable abdominal examination results. A chest radiograph was consistent with the lung examination, revealing bilateral lower lobe hazy infiltrates. He showed initial improvement for 48 hours with antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, oxygen via nasal cannula, albuterol, and prednisone. Subsequently, he worsened with persistent high fever, increasing respiratory distress with pulmonary findings, and severe persistent epigastric pain, which added a layer of diagnostic complexity. As this patient's clinical course evolved and further history became available, pulmonary medicine and infectious diseases services were consulted to guide diagnostic evaluation and treatment of this patient early in the era of coronavirus disease 2019.

### Haemoptysis as the first presentation of COVID-19: a case report [^ddeb6fe8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing pandemic that profoundly challenges healthcare systems all over the world. Scientific evidence on this new virus is growing and the clinical characteristics are increasingly understood. Among COVID-19 patients, fever, cough and fatigue are the most commonly reported clinical symptoms. The main reason for hospitalisation is the onset of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Haemoptysis is rarely reported as a symptom of COVID-19. Only very few cases have been described in literature. Here, we report an unusual case of a man who presented with life-threatening haemoptysis as the first and unique symptom of COVID-19.

### Pragmatic recommendations for identification and triage of patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^f8cf6ed9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Effective identification and prognostication of severe COVID-19 patients presenting to healthcare facilities are essential to reducing morbidity and mortality. Low- and middle-income country (LMIC) facilities often suffer from restrictions in availability of human resources, laboratory testing, medications, and imaging during routine functioning, and such shortages may worsen during times of surge. Low- and middle-income country healthcare providers will need contextually appropriate tools to identify and triage potential COVID-19 patients. We report on a series of LMIC-appropriate recommendations and suggestions for screening and triage of COVID-19 patients in LMICs, based on a pragmatic, experience-based appraisal of existing literature. We recommend that all patients be screened upon first contact with the healthcare system using a locally approved questionnaire to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19. We suggest that primary screening tools used to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 include a broad range of signs and symptoms based on standard case definitions of COVID-19 disease. We recommend that screening include endemic febrile illness per routine protocols upon presentation to a healthcare facility. We recommend that, following screening and implementation of appropriate universal source control measures, suspected COVID-19 patients be triaged with a triage tool appropriate for the setting. We recommend a standardized severity score based on the WHO COVID-19 disease definitions be assigned to all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients before their disposition from the emergency unit. We suggest against using diagnostic imaging to improve triage of reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients, unless a patient has worsening respiratory status. We suggest against the use of point-of-care lung ultrasound to improve triage of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. We suggest the use of diagnostic imaging to improve sensitivity of appropriate triage in suspected COVID-19 patients who are RT-PCR negative but have moderate to severe symptoms and are suspected of a false-negative RT-PCR with high risk of disease progression. We suggest the use of diagnostic imaging to improve sensitivity of appropriate triage in suspected COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe clinical features who are without access to RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2.

### A clinical case definition of post-COVID-19 condition by a Delphi consensus [^16df79bc]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

People with COVID-19 might have sustained postinfection sequelae. Known by a variety of names, including long COVID or long-haul COVID, and listed in the ICD-10 classification as post-COVID-19 condition since September, 2020, this occurrence is variable in its expression and its impact. The absence of a globally standardised and agreed-upon definition hampers progress in characterisation of its epidemiology and the development of candidate treatments. In a WHO-led Delphi process, we engaged with an international panel of 265 patients, clinicians, researchers, and WHO staff to develop a consensus definition for this condition. 14 domains and 45 items were evaluated in two rounds of the Delphi process to create a final consensus definition for adults: post-COVID-19 condition occurs in individuals with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, usually 3 months from the onset, with symptoms that last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms include, but are not limited to, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction, and generally have an impact on everyday functioning. Symptoms might be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness. Symptoms might also fluctuate or relapse over time. A separate definition might be applicable for children. Although the consensus definition is likely to change as knowledge increases, this common framework provides a foundation for ongoing and future studies of epidemiology, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and therapy.

While the yield of repeat testing is low and therefore repeat testing is not suggested routinely, there may be situations where repeat testing might be considered, such as development of new or worsening symptoms in the absence of alternative explanations, timing of symptom onset that might drive a need for repeat testing, or a poorly collected specimen that could yield a falsely negative result. If performed, repeat testing should generally occur 24-48 hours after initial testing and once the initial NAAT result has returned as negative, and another specimen type, preferably a lower respiratory tract specimen if the patient has signs/symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection, should be considered for repeat testing.

1 BACKGROUND

Since December 2019, novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection, has widely spread to various countries and formed a global pandemic.By May 2020, 5 829 474 are confirmed all around the world and 360 776 died of COVID‐19.Pneumonia is the main manifestation with fever and cough, but critical subjects present dyspnea, reduced blood oxygen saturation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and shock.Upper respiratory tract sampling and real‐time reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (rRT‐PCR) were still routinely test to detect the virus.Convalescent patients with two consecutive negative results are considered to be no longer shedding the virus and can be discharged.However, some recovered patients have been retested positive after two negative test results,,leading to concerns that two consecutive negative results might be unreliable. This study aimed to determine the reliability of two consecutive rRT‐PCR tests.

### Case report: prolonged viral shedding in six COVID-19 patients [^275d4fd6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 has surfaced as a multi-organ disease predominantly affecting the respiratory system. Detection of the viral RNA through reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal or throat sample is the preferred method of diagnosis. Recent evidence has suggested that COVID-19 patients can shed the SARS-CoV-2 for several weeks. Herein, we report six cases of COVID-19 who had persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 on repeat RT-PCR testing reaching up to 9 weeks. The spectrum of cases described ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe COVID-19 pneumonia. A full understanding of the virus's transmission dynamics needs further research. Prolonged viral shedding currently has unclear implications on the management and isolation decisions-the role of the cycle threshold (Ct) value in guiding therapeutic decisions is yet to be clarified. More data on the relationship between Ct values and viral cultivation are needed, especially in patients with prolonged viral shedding, to understand the virus's viability and infectivity.

CT chest images showing changes before and after COVID-19 infection.

Central Message

The changes in our patient's CT scan are a direct result of lung parenchymal destruction in setting of ARDS due to COVID-19 pneumonia. Aim is to create awareness and help the discussion in management.

See Commentaries on pages 356 and 358.

The year 2020 saw the introduction of a new health crisis brought on by the newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus. As the world continued to understand this new disease process, its high infectious and mortality rate have been of much concern. Lung parenchymal changes associated this coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia have been described in the literature; however, the development of spontaneous pneumatocele has not been described. The aim of this article is to highlight one of the possible outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19 pneumonia or consequence of associated therapies.

A 66-year-old female patient with diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presented with cough, shortness of breath, and fever for 2 weeks before presentation. She had no recent travel or interaction with sick contacts. She presented to an outside hospital and tested positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal specimen. Due to hypoxemia, she was admitted to the hospital and was initiated on hydroxychloroquine. Her oxygen requirement increased from 5 L/min to 15 L/min oxygen flow by nasal cannula and was transferred to the intensive care unit for closer monitoring. She was transferred to our facility for greater level of care.

Upon arrival, oxygen support was optimized to high-flow oxygen at 40 L/min. Arterial blood gas revealed pH 7.48, carbon dioxide tension 43, arterial oxygen tension (Pa 2) 74, and HCO 2 32. Calculated Pa 2 /inspired oxygen fraction (F 2) ratio was 185. Ferritin level was 824 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase 265 U/L, and C-reactive protein level was 21.25 mg/dL. D-dimer level was 1.86 μg/mL. She received convalescent plasma as well as tocilizumab for cytokine release syndrome.

### Effect of dexamethasone on days alive and ventilator-free in patients with moderate or severe acute (...) [^b56353ed]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04327401 Three months after the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 1 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. 2 Estimates have suggested that up to 12% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have required invasive mechanical ventilation, 3, 4 with the majority developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. 5 Diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes, 6 hallmarks of ARDS, have been found on pulmonary histological examination of patients with COVID-19. Physicians, patients, and individuals who assessed the outcomes were not blinded for the assigned treatment. Each study center was encouraged to follow the best practice guidelines and their institutional protocol for the care of critically ill patients with COVID-19.

All clinical interventions, such as use of antibiotics, ventilatory strategy, laboratory testing, and hemodynamic management were left at the discretion of the ICU team for both groups. We assessed the consistency of the primary analysis results through prespecified sensitivity analyses considering the per-protocol population, patients who received corticosteroids vs patients who did not, patients with confirmed COVID-19, and patients with confirmed or probable COVID-19. The dexamethasone dose was chosen based on a previous11 trial showing the benefit of dexamethasone to patients with non–COVID-19 ARDS. Previous data suggest that high doses of corticosteroids in viral pneumonia may be associated with unfavorable outcomes. 33 However, there are no currently available data from patients with COVID-19 to determine if higher doses are harmful.

In the present study, the number of adverse events, new infections, and the use of insulin were comparable in both groups, in line with previous studies that did not demonstrate an augmented risk of adverse events with corticosteroids in non-COVID-19 ARDS. 10, 11, 19 This trial has several strengths. Bias was controlled by ensuring allocation concealment, all patients were analyzed according to their randomization group, and follow-up was complete. Also, adverse events data regarding corticosteroid use among patients with COVID-19 were provided, along with detailed data on ventilatory parameters, ARDS treatment, and laboratory and physiological variables.

### Pragmatic recommendations for identification and triage of patients with COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^0fae0cba]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Recommendations and suggestions (Table 1).

In LMICs, we recommend that all patients be screened upon first contact with the healthcare system using a locally approved questionnaire to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

Table 1 
Recommendations and suggestions on screening, triage, and severity scoring in COVID-19 patients in LMICs

In LMICs, we suggest that primary screening tools used to identify individuals who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 include a broad range of signs and symptoms based on standard case definitions of COVID-19 disease (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

In LMICs, we recommend that screening include endemic febrile illness per routine protocols upon presentation to a healthcare facility (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence).

Question 2: What validated triage severity of illness scoring systems are available to help determine appropriate level of care for COVID-19 patients in LMICs?

Rationale.

The clinical management of patients with COVID-19 can be informed by three key information-gathering and assessment steps: screening, triage, and severity scoring. Screening, discussed previously, serves primarily as a mechanism of isolating patients who are potentially positive cases of COVID-19 to reduce the spread of the virus within facilities. Triage is a systematic method of sorting patients by the severity of their clinical syndrome and matching patients with healthcare resources, regardless of their specific disease state. Severity scoring can then be used to prognosticate patients, although it is applied to a specific disease state, such as confirmed or suspected COVID-19; it is used to risk stratify patients and identify those likely to have poor outcomes such as admission to an intensive care unit or high dependency unit, or death. Like triage, severity scoring can aid providers in targeting limited resources toward those in greatest need.

The WHO has described the severity of COVID-19 cases as mild, moderate, severe, and critical.Mild patients have upper respiratory tract disease, moderate patients have pneumonia but do not require oxygen, and severe patients require oxygen, and critical patients have acute respiratory distress syndrome or sepsis/septic shock and often require ventilation. Multiple studies have described laboratory and imaging findings, symptoms, and comorbidities that are linked to the severity of COVID-19. Clear guidance on how severity indicators can be used to guide clinical management would enable early recognition and more targeted treatment of the most at-risk patients, improving outcomes even when resources are scarce.

### The impact of COVID-19 on the patient, clinician, healthcare services and society: a patient pathway review [^317628ee]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

The spread of COVID-19 infection has changed the world. Population-based studies of COVID-19 are limited because it is unknown why events happen or why certain outcomes occur. An alternative approach called the patient pathway review evaluates what happens to individuals in detail. In the "ideal" pathway patients with COVID-19 will seek medical attention and COVID-19 will be identified and they will either be admitted to hospital, managed in the community or they will self-care. However, in the "real-world" pathway, patients may delay seeking medical attention and it is variable who the patient decides to seek help from and some patients may be initially misdiagnosed. The eventual outcome will be recovery from the acute infection or death but there may be a spectrum of healthcare needs for patients from those who care for themselves in the community to those who are hospitalized and require intensive care. The patients may or may not have short- and long-term adverse effects. People infected with COVID-19 can take on different paths which depend on the patient's decision making, clinical decision making, and the patient's response to the infection. Desirable pathways are those where patients have good outcomes and also limit the transmission of the virus.

Over the last 2 years, there has been gradual and sustained progress toward our understanding of pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of large- and small-scale randomized controlled trials. Numerous new and repurposed treatments have been evaluated; some have demonstrated benefit in clinically important outcomes like mortality and hospitalization, and optimism for oral antiviral treatments is growing. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19 treatments, frontline clinicians should use treatment and management guidelines to guide their approach to each patient, with the individual's severity and location of illness in mind to appreciate the nuances in clinical evidence.

What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is caused by a virus called a coronavirus. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus.

COVID-19 illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that most COVID-19 illness is mild, serious illness can happen and may cause some of your other medical conditions to become worse. People of all ages with severe, long-lasting (chronic) medical conditions like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, for example, seem to be at higher risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19.

What are the symptoms of COVID-19?

The symptoms of COVID-19 may include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which can appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. Serious illness, including breathing problems, can occur and may cause your other medical conditions to become worse.

What is GOHIBIC?

GOHIBIC is an investigational medicine used for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults when initiated within 48 hours of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). GOHIBIC is investigational because it is still being studied. GOHIBIC is not FDA-approved to treat COVID-19.

### Understanding of COVID-19 based on current evidence [^5f2ab4ad]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on COVID-19 infection: 
- Definition: COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, a positive sense, single-strand enveloped RNA virus belonging to the family Coronaviridae.
- Pathophysiology: Person-to-person transmission primarily occurs through droplets generated during coughing and sneezing. Droplets can be transmitted directly through close contact, or via contaminated surfaces, where the virus may remain active for hours to days. Coughing and some airway management procedures can generate aerosols containing suspended viral particles, which can travel greater distances and be inhaled.
- Epidemiology: The inaugural COVID-19 outbreak was labelled a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020.
- Disease course: The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure. Cardiomyopathy has been described in a significant proportion of critically ill patients. Anosmia has been reported in association with presumed neuroinvasive disease.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: Mortality remains high in patients requiring intensive care.

### Review of burden, clinical definitions, and management of COVID-19 cases [^7b08fe66]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has caused a huge disease burden globally in the short time it has been recorded. A clear description of symptoms associated with the disease is crucial to establish the case definition for clinical management and for epidemiological purposes. Most of the patients are likely to remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Those that do develop clinical disease will most typically have fever and cough, but these remain absent in up to 59.4% and 41.6% of cases, respectively, creating challenges for disease detection and control. The presence of either of these symptoms should be a basis for suspecting a SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, because other respiratory viruses present with similar symptoms, a laboratory test specific to SARS-CoV-2 should be performed.

Nearly every country in the world has been affected by COVID-19. It is important to note that the definitions for COVID-19 cases vary between countries and territories affected by the disease, and this in turn may have affected the public health response. When defining cases, it is important that national guidelines account for the age distribution of the population and the presence of comorbidities including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer, which increase the risk of developing severe and/or critical disease, and increase the risk of fatality. Where transmission is still in the exponential phase of SARS-CoV-2 infections, it is critical that clinical cases are triaged to prioritize management and treatment without overwhelming the healthcare system.

Although several drugs are beginning to show promise in clinical trials, it may take months before these become sufficiently studied and available for widespread clinical use. Hence, it is important that quarantine and isolation measures are strictly enforced to control the disease outbreak. A major challenge, however, to controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission is how to identify the “silent spreaders” who are asymptomatic carriers of the infection.

Limitations of the study.

During the review period, the data on COVID-19 constantly changed with increasing amounts of literature, both peer-reviewed and non–peer-reviewed. COVID-19 data were dependent on country-level definitions and testing rates.

### Early differences in cytokine production by severity of coronavirus disease 2019 [^b251f1c5]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We investigated a total of 95 patients with COVID-19 (52 male and 43 female; median age [range], 50 [15–98] years) of different disease severities (16 asymptomatic, 49 mild, 11 moderate, and 19 severe) during the early phase of infection (ie, <10 days after symptom onset or after an asymptomatic patient’s notifiable contact with a positive case patient). Two of the 11 patients with moderate COVID-19 (18.2%) had mild disease when their blood samples were collected, but both eventually had moderate disease. Of the patients with severe COVID-19, 10 (52.6%) had mild and 3 (15.8%) had moderate disease when their blood samples were collected, disease that eventually became severe. The classification of disease severity was based on interim guidance on the management of COVID-19 from the World Health Organization.

COVID-19 diagnoses were based on polymerase chain reaction detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in nasopharyngeal swab samples. Symptomatic COVID-19 cases in patients without evidence of pneumonia or hypoxia were classified as mild. Cases in patients with clinical signs of pneumonia were classified as moderate (oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry, ≥90% with room air) or severe (respirations >30/min, severe respiratory distress, or oxygen saturation <90% with room air). All patients were treated at Hyogo Prefectural Kakogawa Medical Center, Hyogo, Japan, from July to September 2020 and were consecutively recruited to this study. We included 20 healthy controls (13 male and 7 female; median age [range], 57 [27–64] years), who were SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G–negative medical staff from the same facility.

### COVID-19 autopsies, Oklahoma, USA [^ae9666ee]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To report the methods and findings of two complete autopsies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive individuals who died in Oklahoma (United States) in March 2020.

Methods

Complete postmortem examinations were performed according to standard procedures in a negative-pressure autopsy suite/isolation room using personal protective equipment, including N95 masks, eye protection, and gowns. The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing on postmortem swabs.

Results

A 77-year-old obese man with a history of hypertension, splenectomy, and 6 days of fever and chills died while being transported for medical care. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on postmortem nasopharyngeal and lung parenchymal swabs. Autopsy revealed diffuse alveolar damage and chronic inflammation and edema in the bronchial mucosa. A 42-year-old obese man with a history of myotonic dystrophy developed abdominal pain followed by fever, shortness of breath, and cough. Postmortem nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2; lung parenchymal swabs were negative. Autopsy showed acute bronchopneumonia with evidence of aspiration. Neither autopsy revealed viral inclusions, mucus plugging in airways, eosinophils, or myocarditis.

Conclusions

SARS-CoV-2 testing can be performed at autopsy. Autopsy findings such as diffuse alveolar damage and airway inflammation reflect true virus-related pathology; other findings represent superimposed or unrelated processes.

Discussion

SARS-CoV-2 is a type of coronavirus that was first reported to have caused pneumonia-like infection in humans on 3 December 2019.As a group, coronaviruses are a common cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections (especially in children) and have been researched extensively since they were first characterised in the 1960s.To date, there are seven coronaviruses that are known to cause infection in humans, including SARS-CoV-1, the first known zoonotic coronavirus outbreak in November 2002.Coronavirus infections pass through communities during the winter months, causing small outbreaks in local communities, that do not cause significant mortality or morbidity.

SARS-CoV-2 strain of coronavirus is classed as a zoonotic coronavirus, meaning the virus pathogen is transmitted from non-humans to cause disease in humans. However the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicates human to human transmission is present. From previous research on the transmission of coronaviruses and that of SARS-CoV-2 it can be inferred that SARS-CoV-2 spreads via respiratory droplets, either from direct inhalation, or indirectly touching surfaces with the virus and exposing the eyes, nose or mouth.Common signs and symptoms of the COVID-19 infection identified in patients include high fevers, severe fatigue, dry cough, acute breathing difficulties, bilateral pneumonia on radiological imaging and lymphopaenia.Most of these features were identified in this case study. The significance of COVID-19 is illustrated by the speed of its global spread and the potential to cause severe clinical presentations, which as of April 2020 can only be treated symptomatically. In Italy, as of mid-March 2020, it was reported that 12% of the entire COVID-19 positive population and 16% of all hospitalised patients had an admission to the intensive care unit.

### COVID-19 infection in fingolimod-or siponimod-treated patients: case series [^aba496db]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a case series with descriptive summaries of confirmed COVID-19 reported to Novartis from the postmarketing setting or ongoing clinical trials. The Novartis safety database and cases from clinical trials were reviewed to identify confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in patients treated with fingolimod or siponimod reported to Novartis through December 27, 2020. The Novartis safety database is a system to collect, code, assess, and report adverse events to health authorities from the postmarketing setting (i.e. spontaneously reported to Novartis, from a postmarketing surveillance program or cases identified in the published literature), serious adverse events, and protocol-triggered events of interest from clinical trials in accordance with international guidelines. The database captures adverse events reported to Novartis from health care professionals (HCPs), patients, or other sources. COVID-19 cases were classified as confirmed if a SARS-CoV-2-positive test result was available or the patient was reported to have been diagnosed with COVID-19. Cases without a positive test or a definitive diagnosis were classified as suspected. Cases were considered “serious” based on the International Council on Harmonization regulatory reporting definition, which is “fatal, life-threatening, hospitalization, and medically significant.” The severity of cases were assessed using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)and World Health Organization (WHO)COVID-19 severity scales, and where data were available, categorization was done as follows: asymptomatic (infection without symptoms), mild (not requiring hospitalization, symptoms did not include dyspnea), moderate (hospitalization with pneumonia not reported to be severe and/or with respiratory rate [RR] >20 and/or oxygen saturation [SpO2] >90%, shortness of breath or dyspnea, and hospitalization less than 7 days without further details), severe (pneumonia reported as severe—RR ≥ 30, SpO2 ≤ 93%, and hospitalization 7 days or more without further details), or critical (respiratory failure and/or intubation). The severity of clinical trial cases was based on investigator-reported common terminology criteria for adverse events grade. If reported, the outcome status of each patient was noted to be recovered/recovering (including patients noted to be “stable” or “doing well”), condition unchanged, condition deteriorated, or fatal. We present data as mean or median with their range of dispersion or absolute number and percentage.

### Dexamethasone for inpatients with COVID-19 in a national cohort (...) [^c32912d7]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Notably, cohorts receiving higher levels of oxygen support had greater proportions of patients with 2 or more comorbidities. A total of 50 908 patients in our supplemental oxygen group required low-flow supplemental oxygen. A total of 25 200 patients were treated with remdesivir before initiating dexamethasone as specified, although this was much lower in the cohort without supplemental oxygen. Second, the results were directionally consistent regardless of oxygen support; however, there was no benefit or harm observed with dexamethasone use in hospitalized patients not receiving supplemental oxygen or NIPPV. Third, in a large US cohort, with overall lower mortality than seen in the RECOVERY trial, 2 dexamethasone still proved beneficial in hospitalized patients requiring respiratory support.

This analysis provides additional insight into the use of dexamethasone in specific patient subpopulations; notably, its use was associated with improved outcomes in older patients and in those with more comorbidities. Preexisting comorbidities are common in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and those with preexisting comorbidities are more likely to have severe COVID-19, as well as worse outcomes from their illness. 17-21 In our cohort, the distribution of preexisting comorbidities was consistent with previously published trends, 19-21 and patients with higher CCI score in the supplemental oxygen and NIPPV groups had the greatest benefit from dexamethasone. Several studies22, 23 have shown differences in the effects of antiviral medications, such as remdesivir, on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 on the basis of the level of respiratory support they are receiving, with most recent results showing no improvement in mortality in those requiring mechanical ventilation.

Although our study was not designed to assess the effect of remdesivir on the primary outcome, patients receiving MV and/or ECMO who received remdesivir saw greater benefit with dexamethasone. In addition, patients receiving supplemental oxygen who were not receiving remdesivir saw benefit with dexamethasone. Although these differences may be partially attributable to the effects of remdesivir, they may also reflect patterns of care and the distinct characteristics of patients who do or do not receive remdesivir in these 2 cohorts. In addition, dexamethasone was used so widely in this cohort that we had few control patients, and many of them later went on to receive corticostero.

SUMMARY

The evolving COVID-19 pandemic continues to have the highest impact on vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, persons with immunocompromising conditions, and incompletely vaccinated patients. Although SARS-CoV-2 mutations have resulted in evasion of previously effective monoclonal antibody therapies, available oral and intravenous antiviral therapies maintain activity and serve as key tools to reduce COVID-19 morbidity. Among high-risk individuals, antiviral drug access and patient profile determine optimal antiviral selection. These therapies serve as a complement to key ongoing nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce viral circulation in the community and vaccination strategies that maximize immunoprotection.

### Delayed positive COVID19 nasopharyngeal test, a case study with clinical and pathological correlation [^53b8c9c9]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was isolated in Wuhan, China at end of year 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) has become a global pandemic. In united states, the confirmed COVID 19 cases have surged over 38 million, accounting for 15–20% of the entire world counts. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly used laboratory test for SARS-CoV-2. When performed on upper respiratory swab samples, its sensitivity is reported to be in the range of 60–70%. A considerable proportion of COVID-19 patients may have an initial negative RT-PCR result. Besides the performance characteristic of assays, time of sampling and source of specimen significantly contribute to the “false” negative results. We present a case to discuss one possible pathophysiological explanation, which has not been reported before.

### A clinical case definition of post-COVID-19 condition by a Delphi consensus [^1f25951a]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on long COVID: 
- Definition: Long COVID is defined as a condition in patients with a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with symptoms that last for usually 3 months from the onset of COVID-19, not explained by an alternative diagnosis.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of long COVID is not fully understood, but it is speculated to involve persistent viral infection, immune dysregulation, and organ damage. Additionally, patients with long COVID have been found to have highly activated innate immune cells and elevated expression of type I and type III interferons that remain persistently high at 8 months after infection.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of long COVID in the US is estimated at 7.3%.
- Risk factors: Risk factors associated with long COVID include increasing age, pre-existing comorbidities, and the severity of the initial COVID-19 infection. Female sex, obesity, smoking, vaping, hospitalization with COVID-19, deprivation, and being a healthcare worker are associated with a higher probability of persistent symptoms.
- Disease course: The clinical course of long COVID is characterized by evolving, heterogeneous symptoms that can fluctuate or worsen over time. Common symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive impairment, and other symptoms affecting everyday functioning.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of long COVID can be chronic in nature. It can severely affect recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic for patients and society alike, impacting patients' QoL.

REMDACTA

REMDACTA was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with intravenous remdesivir (RDV) 200 mg on Day 1 followed by 100 mg once daily for a total of 10 days in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The study randomized 649 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result, pneumonia confirmed by radiography, and who required supplemental oxygen > 6 L/min to maintain SpO2 >93%. At baseline, 7% of patients were on low flow oxygen, 80% were on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen, 14% were on invasive mechanical ventilation, and 84% were on corticosteroids.

The primary efficacy endpoint was time from randomization to hospital discharge or 'ready for discharge' up to Day 28. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms with respect to time to hospital discharge or "ready for discharge" through Day 28.

Mortality at Day 28 was 18.1% in the tocilizumab + RDV arm versus 19.5% in the placebo +RDV arm (weighted difference (tocilizumab arm - placebo arm): -1.3% [95% CI, -7.8% to 5.2%]).

Mortality Across Studies in Patients Receiving Baseline Corticosteroids

A study-level meta-analysis was conducted on EMPACTA, COVACTA, REMDACTA and RECOVERY studies. For each of the four studies, the risk difference through Day 28 was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method in the subgroup of patients receiving baseline corticosteroids, summarized in Figure 2. Patients from the RECOVERY trial represent 78.8% of the total sample size in this meta-analysis. The combined risk difference showed that tocilizumab treatment (n=2261) resulted in a 4.61% absolute reduction in the risk of death at Day 28 (risk difference=-4.6%; 95% CI: -7.3% to -1.9%) compared to SoC (n=2034).

### The importance of diagnostic testing during a viral pandemic: early lessons from novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [^3cb0a63f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Around the world, COVID-19 responses have varied greatly. In particular, widespread viral testing has been much more available in some countries than others. In the United States, to date, tests have been in limited supply, with testing prioritized to hospitalized patients with respiratory disease, symptomatic healthcare workers, and contacts of known cases of COVID-19.

In a case report published in this issue of the Journal, a 56-year-old woman who traveled from the epicenter of the pandemic in Wuhan, China, to Thailand in late January 2020 presented 8 days after her husband was diagnosed with COVID-19 without symptoms but with concern for infection.She had been tested 4 days earlier by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, and results were negative. On the day of admission, she denied symptoms and was afebrile with normal oxygenation, but coughing was noted during examination. Chest X-ray showed an alveolar opacity suggestive of COVID-19, and the patient was admitted, with respiratory isolation. Repeat RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 of sputum on the day of admission was deemed inconclusive. The patient reported sore throat, mild cough, and diarrhea 2 days after admission. A third RT-PCR test, of sputum, 3 days after admission, was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient’s symptoms and chest X-ray infiltrates worsened, and chest computed tomography and ultrasound were abnormal, but findings subsequently improved, and the patient was discharged after two negative SARS-CoV-2 tests.

REMDACTA

REMDACTA was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg in combination with intravenous remdesivir (RDV) 200 mg on Day 1 followed by 100 mg once daily for a total of 10 days in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. The study randomized 649 adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result, pneumonia confirmed by radiography, and who required supplemental oxygen > 6 L/min to maintain SpO2 >93%. At baseline, 7% of patients were on low flow oxygen, 80% were on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen, 14% were on invasive mechanical ventilation, and 84% were on corticosteroids.

The primary efficacy endpoint was time from randomization to hospital discharge or ‘ready for discharge’ up to Day 28. There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms with respect to time to hospital discharge or “ready for discharge” through Day 28.

Mortality at Day 28 was 18.1% in the tocilizumab + RDV arm versus 19.5% in the placebo +RDV arm (weighted difference (tocilizumab arm - placebo arm): -1.3% [95% CI, -7.8% to 5.2%]).

Mortality Across Studies in Patients Receiving Baseline Corticosteroids

A study-level meta-analysis was conducted on EMPACTA, COVACTA, REMDACTA and RECOVERY studies. For each of the four studies, the risk difference through Day 28 was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method in the subgroup of patients receiving baseline corticosteroids, summarized in Figure 2. Patients from the RECOVERY trial represent 78.8% of the total sample size in this meta-analysis. The combined risk difference showed that tocilizumab treatment (n=2261) resulted in a 4.61% absolute reduction in the risk of death at Day 28 (risk difference=-4.6%; 95% CI: -7.3% to -1.9%) compared to SoC (n=2034).

### Diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia despite missing detection of viral nucleic acid and initially inconspicuous radiologic findings [^3a9d697d]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly based on a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result. PCR samples are obtained from upper or lower respiratory tract specimens. However, the sensitivity of PCR is known to have some limitations. We report on a patient who was admitted to our hospital with dyspnea, fever, cough, and history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected relative. The initial chest computed tomography (CT) showed only minimal changes and SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab sample was negative. PCR results obtained from further nasopharyngeal swabs, qualified sputum samples, and from a lower respiratory tract specimen also remained negative. At day 13 after admission, a second chest CT showed radiological findings suspicious for viral pneumonia. Finally, serologic results showed high levels of immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin A antibodies against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Pharmacologic treatment of critically ill COVID-19 requiring non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula—We strongly recommend systemic corticosteroids in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with a mortality benefit (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.54; 0.82). In critically ill patients, dexamethasone 6mg/day is preferred, but doses up to 20 mg/day can be used if indicated; hydrocortisone 50 mg IV Q6 hours is an alternative, and methylprednisolone or prednisone are reasonable alternatives at equipotent doses. In addition to corticosteroids, we recommend using either IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab preferred over sarilumab) or JAK inhibitors (baricitinib preferred over tofacitinib) in patients with elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP). Trials have not identified specific sub-populations of critically ill patients already receiving corticosteroids who would benefit with additional IL-6 or JAK inhibitors, and we do not recommend remdesivir since it has not shown a benefit in this sub-population.

### Case report: COVID-19 and lassa fever coinfection in an Ebola suspected patient in Guinea [^bd04715d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

In this case report, we describe a clinical presentation and therapeutic history of a unique case diagnosed with Lassa fever and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a 23-year-old man from Yomou prefecture in southeast Guinea identified with suspected Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the midst of an ongoing outbreak of that disease in the same region. On May 3, 2021, he was admitted to the Nzérékoré Epidemic disease treatment center where his clinical condition deteriorated significantly. Laboratory testing performed on the same day reveals a negative EVD polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Three days later, the patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and Lassa fever by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assays. Laboratory examination also indicated severe hematological and biochemical deteriorations in the patient. This case substantiates the need for systematic differential diagnosis during epidemic-prone disease outbreaks to better manage severely unwell patients.

### COVID-19: a UK children's hospital experience [^9812b6d6]. Hospital Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Reports from China relating to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children indicate a milder disease course compared with adults. Although a few pediatric COVID-19 reports from other parts of the world exist, there are none from the United Kingdom. We describe the clinical characteristics of children with COVID-19 admitted to a specialist children's hospital in United Kingdom.

Methods

Retrospective case-series of inpatients with a positive polymerase chain reaction test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, during a 6-week period from March 14 to April 24, 2020.

Results

Forty-five children tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the study period. Median (interquartile range) age was 3.5 (0.7-12) years, and 31 (69%) were male. Children with comorbidities constituted 64% (29 of 45) of the study population, including 44% (20 of 45) who were considered "extremely vulnerable." Fever (67%) and cough (55%) were the most common symptoms. High C-reactive protein (>10 mg/L) was observed in 68% (19 of 28). Lymphopenia (<1.2 × 10 9 /L) was observed in 23% (9 of 40) of children, but it was related to coexisting medical conditions in 6 children. Nine children required supplemental oxygen, two of whom received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen; one needed noninvasive ventilation and one child required invasive mechanical ventilation. Median length of stay of children with an admission outcome ( n = 42, 93%) was 3 (2-7) days. There were no COVID-19-related deaths.

Conclusions

COVID-19 had a relatively mild course of illness in majority of the hospitalized children that included a subgroup of vulnerable children with significant comorbidities. Confirmation of this in larger nationwide studies of children is required.

Case presentation

A 26 year old male with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with complaints of fever, dry cough, difficulty in breathing and chest pain of 15 days duration. Initial assessment showed an averagely built male with body mass index (BMI) 18.8 kg/m 2 (normal: 18.5-24.9 kg/m 2), fever (38.9 °C), tachycardia (heart rate 120/min, regular), tachypnea (respiratory rate 35/min), hypoxia (pulse oximetry: 85 % on room air, PaO 2 : 55 mm Hg) and normal blood pressure (126/76 mm Hg). Systemic examination was unremarkable other than reduced air entry at both lung bases. Blood investigations revealed an elevated white cell count of 14.2 x 10 9 /L (normal: 4.5-10 x 10 9 /L), predominantly neutrophilic; serum electrolytes, renal function, liver function, coagulation profile were within normal limits; lactate was 2.2 mmol/L (normal: <2 mmol/L) and procalcitonin was 0.6 ng/mL (normal: <0.5 ng/mL). Blood cultures, sputum for gram’s stain and nasal swab for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were collected. Chest x-ray showed bilateral middle and lower zone air space opacities (Fig. 1a). After oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula, fluid resuscitation and empirical antimicrobial therapy (ceftriaxone 2 gm i.v. once daily, azithromycin 500 mg i.v. once daily and oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily) patient was stabilized (PaO 2 80 mm Hg on oxygen 2 L/min through nasal cannula) and admitted to medical ward.
