## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the evaluation and management of epistaxis, presented in a structured, stepwise flow with explicit self-verification language throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment and triage to determine who needs urgent care. Then, I should verify the first-line local hemostatic measures, including nasal compression and the role of vasoconstrictors. Next, I will examine indications and techniques for nasal packing, especially in anticoagulated patients. After that, I should confirm how to identify the bleeding site and choose targeted interventions like cautery or topical agents. I will then consider advanced interventions for refractory cases, including ligation and embolization, and how anticoagulation influences those decisions. Finally, I need to address special populations such as HHT and children, and close with patient education, prevention, and follow-up requirements, making sure I cross-check each step against guideline-grade sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities and triage approach. At first contact, I need to distinguish who requires prompt management versus those who do not, because delaying care in severe or unstable cases risks morbidity and resource misallocation; red flags include hemodynamic instability, persistent bleeding despite 5–10 minutes of compression, bilateral bleeding, or blood in the mouth suggesting posterior epistaxis, and these features should prompt urgent evaluation and, when indicated, airway and hemodynamic stabilization and transfer to higher-acuity settings [^1149drRG] [^114vn9eq] [^117RtExB].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology and severity anchors to calibrate expectations. Epistaxis is common, affecting at least 60% of people at some point, with about 6% seeking medical attention and approximately 0.5% of ED visits attributed to nosebleeds; importantly, about 0.2% require inpatient management for severe bleeding, so most cases are manageable with local measures but a nontrivial minority need procedural escalation and inpatient care [^111t9GNZ].

> I will now examine first-line local control. For active anterior bleeding, firm sustained compression of the lower third of the nose for at least 5 minutes, ideally 10–15 minutes if needed, is recommended; a nose clip may be used if tolerated, but I should not delay compression to obtain a clip, and if bleeding continues or slows minimally, repeating compression and adding a topical vasoconstrictor such as oxymetazoline can be reasonable based on expert opinion and observational data, even though high-quality RCT evidence is limited [^114J6uta] [^1146Hjuq] [^1179YmgF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about when to escalate. If bleeding precludes visualization of the site despite compression, or if bleeding remains brisk, nasal packing is indicated; for patients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy or with suspected bleeding disorders, I should preferentially use resorbable packing materials to reduce mucosal trauma on removal, whereas nonresorbable packing typically remains 48–72 hours and carries risks such as infection, synechiae, and septal injury; antibiotics are not mandatory routinely but should be considered when infection risk is high or packing duration is prolonged [^111CCYZS] [^1155C1nG] [^112r4kfm] [^112THg3C].

> Let me consider site identification next. After clot removal, I should perform anterior rhinoscopy to localize the bleeding source, as identifying the site allows targeted therapy and improves outcomes; in recurrent cases or when unilateral bleeding persists, nasal endoscopy should be pursued, ideally by ENT, because it localizes the bleeding source in roughly 87–93% of cases and can uncover posterior sites or underlying pathology such as septal deviation or perforation that alters management [^112A8FnC] [^114z7xX1] [^117DuBnT] [^11666EXS].

> Next, I should review targeted interventions once a site is identified. Appropriate options include topical vasoconstrictors, chemical cautery with silver nitrate, and moisturizing or lubricating agents; if cautery is chosen, I need to anesthetize the site and confine cautery to the active or suspected bleeding site to minimize mucosal injury, and I should remember that 75% silver nitrate may be as effective as or more effective than 95% with less pain in children, though pediatric evidence is mixed and often low quality [^113LGX5X] [^115Zarjz] [^113e7wXK].

> I need to ensure I escalate appropriately for refractory bleeding. For persistent or recurrent epistaxis not controlled by packing or cautery, I should evaluate candidacy for surgical arterial ligation, commonly transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation with high success rates, or endovascular embolization, which achieves control in about 87% but carries a higher stroke risk than surgery; selection depends on patient factors, anatomy, and local expertise, and I should discuss risks, benefits, and preferences with the patient [^1176bGfN] [^112S85kN] [^114WxX8a].

> But wait, what if the patient is on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, I should prioritize first-line local measures before considering reversal or transfusion; for severe cases on VKAs, I should check INR and consider vitamin K or 4-factor PCC if indicated, while for DOACs I must remember that routine coagulation assays are unreliable and reversal decisions should be individualized; topical tranexamic acid can be a useful adjunct in antiplatelet users, with a small RCT showing improved early hemostasis, and I should avoid routine platelet transfusion unless there is a compelling indication given potential harm signals in the PATCH trial [^112eE697] [^114V68Lv] [^114U6g8E].

> I should double-check special populations, starting with HHT. In patients with recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history suggestive of HHT, I need to screen for nasal and oral mucosal telangiectasias and refer for HHT evaluation because early diagnosis enables screening for pulmonary and cerebral AVMs and institution of disease-specific therapies; HHT-related epistaxis often requires multimodal care including topical and systemic agents such as tranexamic acid, thalidomide, or bevacizumab in select cases, and patients frequently develop iron deficiency anemia requiring iron replacement [^111LjzbZ] [^111N59Ym] [^1151GV9D].

> Let me think about children specifically. Most pediatric epistaxis is anterior and self-limited, but recurrent idiopathic cases are common; evidence for preventive and interventional strategies is limited and mixed, with Cochrane reviews showing no clear superiority of antiseptic creams or petroleum jelly over no treatment, and a small RCT suggesting cautery plus antiseptic cream may improve subjective outcomes; if cautery is used, 75% silver nitrate may be preferred over 95% for less pain and better short-term resolution, though high-quality long-term data are lacking [^113e7wXK] [^116ckr3R] [^11754rjU].

> Next, I should review patient education and prevention because recurrence is common and modifiable. I need to counsel on avoiding digital trauma and vigorous nose blowing, maintaining nasal hydration with saline sprays or gels and bedroom humidification, and using acetaminophen rather than NSAIDs or aspirin for pain; after cautery or packing, I should advise avoiding nose blowing, heavy lifting, and strenuous activity for about a week and provide clear return precautions for recurrent bleeding, fever, or new symptoms [^111ZtVUK] [^115ydJ4S] [^112THg3C].

> I will now examine follow-up and documentation. After nonresorbable packing, surgery, or embolization, I should document outcomes within 30 days or ensure transition of care is recorded, because recurrence rates vary widely and early rebleeding after packing is common; routine follow-up is prudent after invasive treatments or when an underlying condition is suspected, and I should reassess for contributory factors such as anticoagulation, intranasal medications, and comorbidities during follow-up [^1115arvU] [^117SJKCb] [^116LLudQ].

> Hold on, I should verify a few nuances I almost glossed over. Hypertension is associated with epistaxis but causality is unproven, and routine blood pressure lowering during active bleeding is not recommended; instead, I should monitor and treat hypertension based on comorbidities and bleeding control status, and I should also remember that intranasal corticosteroids can increase nosebleed risk, so dose reduction or cessation may be warranted in recurrent cases [^114azjcB] [^115oWeGX] [^1166PdxB].

> Finally, let me reconsider the overall algorithm to ensure internal consistency. Triage severity and stability, apply sustained compression with optional vasoconstrictor, escalate to packing when needed with resorbable materials favored in anticoagulated patients, localize the bleeding site with rhinoscopy and endoscopy when indicated, deliver targeted therapy such as cautery or vasoconstrictors, and for refractory cases pursue ligation or embolization while preserving antithrombotic therapy whenever safe; throughout, I should screen for HHT, educate on prevention, and arrange appropriate follow-up to close the loop on quality and safety [^112xmPUC] [^111dQFTx] [^113qfMYQ].

Nosebleeds (epistaxis) are common and usually benign, but can signal serious disease [^117Star6] [^116LLudQ]. Most are anterior and stop with simple first aid [^113yyumZ] [^117Star6]; **posterior bleeds are rarer but more dangerous** and may need hospital care [^115aXhV4]. Persistent, recurrent, or severe nosebleeds warrant evaluation for bleeding disorders, anticoagulant use, hypertension, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) [^1164papw] [^115oWeGX] [^1166fVm1]. Management is stepwise: **firm compression, topical vasoconstrictors, cautery, and packing** [^114J6uta] [^113LGX5X]; for refractory cases, consider surgical ligation or embolization [^1176bGfN] [^112S85kN]. Educate on prevention and follow-up to reduce recurrence [^111TPeE8] [^117SJKCb].

## Epidemiology and risk factors

- **Lifetime prevalence**: ~60% [^113opqHd] [^112U2yxB].
- **Medical attention**: ~6% seek care [^113opqHd] [^112U2yxB].
- **ED visits**: 0.5% of all ED visits; up to one-third of ENT ED visits [^113opqHd] [^112U2yxB].
- **Hospitalization**: 0.2% require inpatient care [^113opqHd] [^117Star6].

### Risk factors

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Local factors | Trauma, dry air, nose picking, nasal infections, intranasal medications, nasal steroids, CPAP, nasal oxygen [^1148sTYH] [^1166PdxB] |
| Systemic factors | Hypertension, anticoagulants, antiplatelets, bleeding disorders, liver/renal disease, HHT [^1148sTYH] [^1166PdxB] [^111N59Ym] |
| Environmental factors | Dry climate, high altitude, heated indoor air [^114zQpov] |

## Clinical classification

Anterior epistaxis is common, originates from Kiesselbach's plexus, and is usually **minor and self-limited** [^111SzBs1]. Posterior epistaxis is less common, originates from sphenopalatine arteries, and is more often **severe and persistent** [^111SzBs1].

---

## Initial assessment and management

### Initial assessment

Initial assessment should determine severity, duration, and volume; identify **risk factors** (anticoagulants, bleeding disorders, HHT) [^117Star6]; and assess hemodynamic stability and airway compromise [^112xmPUC].

---

### First-line management

- **Compression**: Firm sustained compression of the lower third of the nose for ≥ 5 minutes [^114J6uta] [^1146Hjuq].
- **Positioning**: Lean forward to avoid swallowing blood [^115ydJ4S].
- **Adjuncts**: Topical vasoconstrictors (oxymetazoline, phenylephrine) can be applied with compression [^1179YmgF].
- **Education**: Teach home treatment and prevention [^111TPeE8].

---

## Advanced interventions

### Indications

Advanced interventions are indicated for persistent bleeding despite compression and vasoconstrictors, recurrent or severe epistaxis, or posterior bleeding [^112xmPUC].

---

### Options

- **Cautery**: Chemical (silver nitrate) or electrocautery [^116doJcS] [^113e7wXK].
- **Packing**: Anterior or posterior; resorbable preferred in anticoagulated patients [^111CCYZS] [^115aXhV4].
- **Surgery**: Endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation (TESPAL) or embolization for refractory cases [^112S85kN] [^1176bGfN].

---

## Complications and recurrence

Complications include airway obstruction, infection, mucosal injury, and, rarely, **septal perforation** [^112r4kfm] [^1155C1nG]. Recurrence is common, especially with packing; **follow-up and prevention are key** [^116BZt8C] [^117SJKCb].

---

## Special considerations

### Anticoagulated patients

Use **resorbable packing** and avoid routine reversal unless life-threatening [^111CCYZS] [^113MyRv7]. Tranexamic acid (topical or oral) can reduce rebleeding [^114U6g8E].

---

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)

Screen for **HHT** in recurrent bilateral epistaxis or a family history [^1166fVm1]. Management includes local therapies, antifibrinolytics, and antiangiogenic agents (e.g. bevacizumab) [^117YFzZM].

---

## Patient education and prevention

- **Humidification**: Use humidifiers and nasal saline [^111ZtVUK].
- **Avoidance**: Avoid nose picking, trauma, and irritants [^115ydJ4S].
- **Medication review**: Review and adjust nasal steroids or anticoagulants as needed [^1166PdxB].
- **Follow-up**: Document outcomes within 30 days after invasive treatment [^1115arvU].

---

Nosebleeds are common and usually benign, but persistent or severe cases need structured evaluation and stepwise care. Most respond to compression and topical therapy; **refractory cases may need cautery, packing, or surgery** [^111t9GNZ].

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^111t9GNZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥ 3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It focuses on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians via phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients-patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function-are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the guideline development group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based on their experience and assessment of individual patients.

Action Statements

The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include one or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome. (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation, about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy, was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

### Interventions for recurrent idiopathic epistaxis (nosebleeds) in children [^113e7wXK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent idiopathic epistaxis (nosebleeds) in children is repeated nasal bleeding in patients up to the age of 16 for which no specific cause has been identified. Although nosebleeds are very common in children, and most cases are self limiting or settle with simple measures (such as pinching the nose), more severe recurrent cases can require treatment from a healthcare professional. However, there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the different clinical interventions currently used in managing this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different interventions for the management of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 5 March 2012.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (with or without blinding) in which any surgical or medical intervention for the treatment of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment, a placebo or another intervention, and in which the frequency and severity of episodes of nasal bleeding following treatment was stated or calculable. The two authors reviewed the full-text articles of all retrieved trials of possible relevance and applied the inclusion criteria independently.

Data Collection and Analysis

We graded trials for risk of bias using the Cochrane approach. One author performed data extraction in a standardised manner and this was rechecked by the other author. Where necessary we contacted investigators to obtain missing information. We did not undertake a meta-analysis because of the heterogeneity of the treatments, procedures and quality of the included trials. A narrative overview of the results is therefore presented.

Main Results

Five studies (four RCTs and one quasi-randomised controlled trial) involving 468 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. The identified RCTs compared 0.5% neomycin + 0.1% chlorhexidine (Naseptin®) cream with no treatment, Vaseline® petroleum jelly with no treatment, 75% with 95% silver nitrate nasal cautery, and silver nitrate cautery combined with Naseptin® against Naseptin® alone; the quasi-randomised controlled trial compared Naseptin® antiseptic cream with silver nitrate cautery. Overall results were inconclusive, with no statistically significant difference found between the compared treatments upon completion of the trials, however 75% silver nitrate was more effective than 95% silver nitrate at two weeks following application. The group treated with 75% silver nitrate had 88% complete resolution of epistaxis compared to 65% in the group treated with 95% silver nitrate (P = 0.01). No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions, although children receiving silver nitrate cautery reported that it was a painful experience (despite the use of local anaesthetic). The pain scores were significantly less in those treated with 75% silver nitrate, the mean score being 1 compared to a mean score of 5 in those treated with 95% silver nitrate; this was statistically significant (P = 0.001). We carried out a 'Risk of bias' assessment of each study according to the Cochrane methodology and judged that two randomised controlled trials had a low risk of bias, two had an unclear risk of bias and the quasi-randomised controlled trial had a high risk of bias.

Authors' Conclusions

The optimal management of children with recurrent idiopathic epistaxis is unknown, however if silver nitrate nasal cautery is undertaken 75% is preferable to 95% as it is more effective in the short term and causes less pain. High-quality randomised controlled trials comparing interventions either with placebo or no treatment, and with a follow-up period of at least a year, are needed to assess the relative merits of the various treatments currently in use.

However, there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the different clinical interventions currently used in managing this condition.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different interventions for the management of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane ENT Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), CINAHL (January 1982 to August 2003), and reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

We identified all randomised controlled trials (with or without blinding) in which any surgical or medical intervention for the treatment of recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children was evaluated in comparison with either no treatment, a placebo, or another intervention, and in which the frequency and severity of episodes of nasal bleeding following treatment was stated or calculable. The full text articles of all the retrieved trials of possible relevance were reviewed by the two reviewers and the inclusion criteria applied independently.

Data Collection and Analysis

A meta-analysis was not undertaken because of the heterogeneity of the treatments, procedures and quality of the included trials. A narrative overview of the results is therefore presented.

Main Results

Three studies - two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and one controlled clinical trial (CCT) - involving 256 participants satisfied the inclusion criteria. One RCT compared Naseptin antiseptic cream with no treatment, the second RCT compared Vaseline(R) petroleum jelly with no treatment, and the CCT compared Naseptin antiseptic cream with silver nitrate cautery. Overall, results were inconclusive, with no statistically significant difference found between the compared treatments. No serious adverse effects were reported from any of the interventions, although children receiving silver nitrate cautery reported that it was a painful experience (despite the use of local anaesthetic).

Reviewer's Conclusions

The optimal management of children with recurrent idiopathic epistaxis is unknown. High quality randomised controlled trials comparing interventions either with placebo or no treatment, and with a follow-up period of at least a year, are needed to assess the relative merits of the various treatments currently in use.

The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥ 3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners.

(3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include 1 or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT). (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

### Nosebleeds in children [^117Fkxky]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to 9% of children may have recurrent nosebleeds, usually originating from the anterior septum, but many grow out of the problem.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for recurrent idiopathic epistaxis in children? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found six systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiseptic cream, cautery, petroleum jelly.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^117SJKCb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Supporting text — post-treatment follow-up for epistaxis emphasizes outcome tracking and specific revisit criteria: The purpose of this statement is to assist clinicians in evaluating and documenting 30-day outcomes after treatment for epistaxis, and documenting transition of care to another qualified clinician in the electronic medical record is sufficient to meet this recommendation. Clinicians should evaluate patients following treatment for epistaxis if (1) bleeding has not resolved, (2) invasive treatments were performed, or (3) additional evaluation and testing suggest a potential underlying condition that predisposes to more nosebleeds. Recurrence rates vary by technique and patient factors, ranging from an estimated < 10% after surgical artery ligation or arterial embolization to as much as a 50% recurrence for nasal packing, and many treated patients become lost to follow-up over time, complicating assessment of persistent or recurrent bleeding.

Epistaxis guideline — endoscopic evaluation, targeted therapy, escalation, and follow-up: For recurrent nasal bleeding despite prior packing or cautery, or recurrent unilateral bleeding, clinicians should perform or refer for nasal endoscopy to identify the site and guide management. When a site is identified, clinicians should treat with appropriate interventions, which may include topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents, and if cautery is chosen they should anesthetize the site and restrict application only to the active or suspected site(s). For persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or cauterization, clinicians should evaluate or refer for candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization. In the absence of life-threatening bleeding in patients using anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications, clinicians should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of these medications. Clinicians should assess or refer for assessment of nasal and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients with recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a relevant family history to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome, should educate patients and caregivers on prevention, home treatment, and indications to seek care, and should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care after treatments such as nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization.

Epistaxis — supporting data for advanced interventions: Although many cases of epistaxis will resolve with conservative management, approximately 6% of patients will require management more invasive than cautery or packing for recurrent and/or intractable epistaxis. Historically, prolonged posterior nasal packing (2–7 days) had mediocre hemostasis with recurrent bleeding in up to 52% of cases and was associated with prolonged hospitalization and significant discomfort. Transnasal endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation (TESPAL) is now the most commonly employed surgical arterial ligation technique with a reported success rate of up to 98%, and complication rates with TESPAL are relatively low, including postoperative hemorrhage (3.4%), with a similar reported mortality rate as compared with embolization; recent treatment algorithms employ surgical arterial ligation and/or endovascular embolization as second-line therapies for recurrent and/or intractable epistaxis.

Epistaxis — prompt management (Statement 1) directs that at the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not, and this is a Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The quality improvement opportunity is to identify those patients who need immediate diagnosis and treatment, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C, a Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, and policy level Recommendation. Benefits include prevention of morbidity and in rare cases mortality, increased likelihood of timely treatment, more efficient allocation of resources to patients in greatest need of treatment, reduction of patient and family stress, and avoidance of unnecessary interventions in patients who are not actively bleeding, while risks and harms include delayed treatment of patients who may actually need intervention, overtreatment of patients who are not actively bleeding, and increased patient anxiety; no costs are associated with this recommendation, and the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness is noted in that the actual appropriate timing for "prompt" management is not specified and assessment of bleeding severity may occur during telephone/electronic communications or during face-to-face patient encounter, and the purpose is to assist clinicians in determining the severity of a nosebleed as well as the appropriate clinical setting where the patient should be seen for management.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^111ZtVUK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nosebleed (epistaxis) — patient and caregiver education content and preventive measures: When the prevention of nosebleeds is discussed, it is important to understand that nose picking, trauma, infection, use of anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications, and hypertension are commonly associated with nosebleeds, and educating caregivers and patients that avoiding digital trauma or nose picking and use of simple nasal hygiene measures are primary strategies to avoid nosebleeds. While most experienced clinicians note that moisturizers and lubricants such as nasal saline, gels, and ointments and use of air humidifiers can help prevent nosebleeds, quality supportive evidence is scarce; in one study of children with recurrent nosebleeds, the nasal application of petroleum jelly twice a day did not reduce the number of nosebleeds. Patients who require nasal oxygen or CPAP should be encouraged to use humidification on their apparatus to decrease chances of drying the fragile mucosa of the nose and contributing to recurrent nosebleeds, and patients taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications are at an increased risk of recurrent epistaxis; thus, saline lubrication, as well as control of comorbidities, is recommended to prevent additional nosebleeds; preventive measures are also important following "first-line" therapies for management of acute nosebleed to prevent rebleeding and to avoid the need for more invasive interventions, and patients should be encouraged to restart saline and/or lubrication to moisturize the area and allow proper healing.

Epistaxis — severity of bleeding can be gauged by duration and episode frequency, noting that a standard definition of severe epistaxis does not exist. Bleeding duration > 30 minutes over a 24-hour period was considered severe, and a history of hospitalization for nosebleed, prior blood transfusion for nosebleeds, or > 3 recent episodes of nasal bleeding may indicate the need for prompt evaluation. When evaluating, evidence of or suspicion for prolonged or large volume bleeding, bleeding from both sides of the nose or from the mouth, or any signs of acute hypovolemia should warrant prompt management.

### A double-blind randomized controlled trial of management of recurrent nosebleeds in children [^11754rjU]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

To establish whether a treatment regimen of silver nitrate cautery and 4 weeks of antiseptic nasal cream is superior to antiseptic cream treatment alone in the management of pediatric epistaxis.

Study Design

Double-blind randomized controlled trial.

Subjects and Methods

Children with epistaxis and visible anterior septal vessels were invited to participate. Patients were randomized to receive treatment or control. Treatment patients received silver nitrate cautery, followed by antiseptic cream for 4 weeks. Control patients received sham cautery followed by antiseptic cream for 4 weeks.

Results

A total of 109 patients were randomized and results were available for 93 (85%). Of those receiving cautery, 21 (45.7%) of 46 had no bleeding in the 4 weeks before follow-up. Of those receiving only antiseptic cream 14 (29.8%) of 47 had no bleeding. (χ² = 2.49; P = 0.114). More children in the active treatment group had an improvement in their symptoms compared with controls (42 of 46; 91.3%) in the treatment group vs 33 of 47 (70.2%) controls (χ² = 6.626; P = 0.01; relative risk reduction = 71 percent, number needed to treat = 4.7).

Conclusion

When using subjective improvement in symptoms as the outcome measure, silver nitrate cautery with antiseptic cream twice daily for 4 weeks appears to give a small but statistically significant benefit when compared to antiseptic cream alone.

### Treatment of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia-related epistaxis [^116pW4o3]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease with an incidence of 1:5000. Recurrent, spontaneous epistaxis is the most common presenting symptom. Severity of epistaxis varies widely, from mild, self-limited nosebleeds to severe, life-threatening nasal hemorrhage. Treatment of HHT-related epistaxis presents a challenge to the otolaryngologist due to the recurrent, persistent nature of epistaxis often requiring multiple treatments. Treatment modalities range from conservative topical therapies to more aggressive surgical treatments.

### Management of recurrent epistaxis in an anticoagulated patient by temporarily closing the nares with sutures [^117EYade]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

We describe an unusual case of recurrent, refractory anterior epistaxis in an 86-year-old man with two mechanical heart valves who was on permanent warfarin therapy. His numerous episodes of epistaxis were incited by chronic nose-picking and strong nose-blowing, practices that he continued to engage in despite repeated medical advice to stop. Stopping his anticoagulation therapy was not considered as a management option because of an unacceptably high risk that this would lead to a thromboembolic event. Eventually, we temporarily sutured his nares closed, and his nosebleeds ceased. The suturing was performed in the ward with local anesthesia. This procedure was simple to perform, fairly well tolerated, easily reversible, and highly effective.

Medication-associated epistaxis risk — anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications "increase the risk of nosebleeds", and clinicians "should ask patients about the use of these medications" and "inquire about recent changes in dosage or medication type". For patients on warfarin, an international normalized ratio (INR) should be checked "to evaluate if they are in the therapeutic range of anticoagulation"; "Supratherapeutic INR results may require specialty consultation, discontinuation of medications, or administration of reversal agents" if bleeding is severe or refractory. Intranasal medications, notably nasal corticosteroids, "can increase the risk of nosebleeds"; a systematic review of "13 randomized controlled studies, including > 2500 subjects" found intranasal corticosteroids "substantially increased the risk of nosebleeds, with a relative risk of 2.74 (range, 1.88–4.00)". "Cessation of nasal corticosteroids should be considered in patients with recurrent or severe nosebleeds", and "Other intranasal medications and drugs of abuse can precipitate nosebleeds and should be assessed in the history".

### Hypertension and epistaxis: why is there limited guidance in the nosebleed clinical practice guidelines? [^113JXKm4]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension has long been thought to influence the risk and severity of epistaxis. However, evaluation of the relevant literature reveals articles with methodologic concerns or limited quality. In many instances, these studies are not adequately controlled, and lack of multivariate analyses calls into question any noted association between epistaxis and hypertension. The goal of this commentary is to explain why there is limited guidance about the management of hypertension and the possible association with nosebleed in the 2020 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation clinical practice guideline for nosebleeds. Background on the literature that describes the association between hypertension and nosebleeds is provided.

Epistaxis guideline — initial assessment and first-line measures: At initial contact, clinicians should distinguish patients needing urgent care, and for those with active bleeding requiring prompt management they should use firm sustained compression of the lower third of the nose for 5 minutes or longer. If bleeding obscures site identification despite compression, clinicians should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing and should use resorbable packing for suspected bleeding disorders or anticoagulation/antiplatelet use. Clinicians should educate packed patients about the type of packing, timing and plan for removal if not resorbable, postprocedure care, and symptoms warranting prompt reassessment; should document factors that increase frequency or severity of bleeding, including bleeding history, anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, or intranasal drug use; and should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present).

Nasal packing: FAQs for patients with nosebleed — packing typically "should be in place for no longer than 5 days", and "if your packing is resorbable, it may not need removal and will go away with time and the use of nasal saline sprays". Bleeding can still occur with packing; "apply pressure to the nose with pinching of the soft area, call your clinician, or go to the emergency department for further management". For nonresorbable packing, using it past the recommended time "can result in possible complications", therefore "strict adherence to follow-up directions is important". Reported risks include infection and pressure-related injury: "There is a low risk of infection spreading to the nose and sinuses or, in extremely rare cases, throughout the body", and pressure "may decrease blood flow to areas of the nose and result in injury". To reduce complications, "oral antibiotics will be used if the risk for infection is high", and "keeping the nose and packing moist with nasal saline (salt water) sprays throughout the day can reduce crusting and help resorbable packing melt away"; "strict adherence to follow-up instructions will allow for appropriate removal of packing when necessary and should make complications less frequent". Activity and medication guidance includes: "you should avoid straining, lifting over 10 pounds, bending over, and exercising", and "avoid over-the-counter pain medications that may increase bleeding, including aspirin and ibuprofen"; "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) does not increase bleeding and can be used", and "you should not try to blow your nose… If you feel the need to sneeze, sneeze with mouth open". Seek care urgently if any warning signs occur: "return of blood from nose or mouth, fever over 101°F, increasing pain, vision changes, shortness of breath or labored breathing, loss of color around the skin of the nose, swelling of the face, or a diffuse skin rash". After removal, "you may initially experience a small amount of bleeding… Keeping the nose humid with saline spray and moisturizing agents will prevent dry crusts and facilitate healing"; if nosebleeds recur, "apply pressure… and consider the use of a vasoconstrictor spray", and "if bleeding continues, call your medical provider, or go to the emergency department for further management".

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: from molecular biology to patient care [^115EzHVe]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Summary

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant vascular disorder characterized by severe and recurrent nosebleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectases, and, in some cases, life-threatening visceral arteriovenous malformations of various types, including pulmonary, hepatic, cerebral, and spinal. Gastrointestinal telangiectases are frequent and may cause severe bleeding. HHT type 1 results from mutations in ENG on chromosome 9 (coding for endoglin), and HHT type 2 results from mutations in ACVRL1 on chromosome 12 (coding for activin receptor-like kinase 1). Mutations of either of these two genes account for most clinical cases. In addition, mutations in MADH4 (encoding SMAD4), which cause a juvenile polyposis/HHT overlap syndrome, have been described, and recently, an HHT3 locus on chromosome 5 (5q31.3–5q32) has been reported. The mutated genes in HHT encode proteins that modulate transforming growth factor-beta superfamily signaling in vascular endothelial cells. Management of patients has changed considerably in the last 20 years, in terms of both treatment and the prevention of complications. The goal of this review was to describe the underlying molecular and cellular physiopathology, explore clinical and genetic diagnostic strategies for HHT, and present clinical management recommendations in order to treat symptomatic disease and to screen for vascular malformations.

### Can iron treatments aggravate epistaxis in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? [^117YFzZM]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) poses a substantial burden on otorhinolaryngological practice. Inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, HHT is caused by gene defects, most commonly in ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4, and leads to the development of nasal and gastrointestinal telangiectasia, in addition to visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). 1, 2 Recurrent epistaxis (nosebleeds) is the hallmark of HHT 1, 2, 3, 4, and results from fragile nasal telangiectasia, which are often lined by a single endothelial layer with no smooth muscles cells or pericytes, despite acting as conduits for blood at arterial pressure 5 (see Supporting Fig. 1 in the online version of this article). Nosebleeds often occur daily, and can be associated with acute hemodynamic disturbances 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and reduced quality of life. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Treatments include surgically based therapies such as cauterization, laser photocoagulation, 13 septal dermoplasty, 14 and Young's procedure, 15 and medical therapies such as antioestrogens, 16 tranexamic acid, 17, 18 and bevacizumab (Avastin). 19, 20 Therapeutics are generally graded according to the severity of epistaxis, 21 and many patients require more than one modality. Further treatment modalities are currently under evaluation in clinical trials.

The epistaxis that can be so difficult to manage in clinical practice also causes additional problems. HHT patients are commonly iron deficient and/or anemic because replacing iron lost through recurrent hemorrhage demands very high iron intakes, and it is difficult to meet the hemorrhage‐adjusted iron requirement by dietary intake alone. 22 The diverse detrimental consequences of iron deficiency 23, 24, 25, 26 include anemia and transfusional requirements that occur because iron deficiency restricts erythropoeisis, 27 leading to low hemoglobin, 28 and reduced arterial oxygen content. 29, 30 The development of iron deficiency predicts development of high output cardiac failure for HHT patients with severe hepatic AVMs. 31 Additionally, low serum iron is associated with venous thromboemboli, 32 paradoxical embolic stroke through pulmonary AVMs, 33 exuberant platelet aggregation to 5HT, 33, 34 and elevated coagulation factor VIII. 32

### Whole genome sequences discriminate hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia phenotypes by non-HHT deleterious DNA variation [^116wFf1D]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a well-defined endothelial vasculopathywith established clinical diagnostic criteria, known causal genes, and expert consensus informing clinical practice across general and subspecialty management. Estimated to affect approximately 1.5 million individuals worldwide, HHT usually results from a heterozygous null allele in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 and is transmissible as an autosomal dominant trait. Evidence from early family-based analyseshas been supported by decades of studies in patientsand animal models, confirming that loss-of-function causes abnormal vascular structures, including telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).

Telangiectasia and larger AVMs are characterized by defective vascular walls predisposing to hemorrhage. Individuals affected by HHT experience spontaneous, recurrent nosebleeds due to abnormal nasal vasculature and exhibit small, visible telangiectatic vessels that tend to develop on the lips, oral cavity, and finger pads. Many have long-term excellent health with modest hemorrhagic losses, although most experience nosebleeds sufficient to lead to iron deficiency anemia unless dietary iron intake is supplemented, and significant proportions require surgical interventional treatments and/or disease-modifying drugs such as antiangiogenic agents.-Patients are commonly found to have silent visceral AVMs, and screening/primary prevention strategies have led to improved life expectancy.

### Tranexamic acid for patients with nasal haemorrhage (epistaxis) [^114U6g8E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epistaxis (nosebleed) most commonly affects children and the elderly. The majority of episodes are managed at home with simple measures. In more severe cases medical intervention is required to either cauterise the bleeding vessel, or to pack the nose with various materials. Tranexamic acid is used in a number of clinical settings to stop bleeding by preventing clot breakdown (fibrinolysis). It may have a role in the management of epistaxis as an adjunct to standard treatments, reducing the need for further intervention.

Objectives

To determine the effects of tranexamic acid (oral, intravenous or topical) compared with placebo, no additional intervention or any other haemostatic agent in the management of patients with epistaxis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register (via CRS Web); Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via CRS Web); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 October 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tranexamic acid (in addition to usual care) compared with usual care plus placebo, usual care alone or usual care plus any other haemostatic agent, to control epistaxis in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were control of epistaxis: re-bleeding (as measured by the proportion of patients re-bleeding within a period of up to 10 days) and significant adverse effects (seizures, thromboembolic events). Secondary outcomes were control of epistaxis as measured by the time to stop initial bleeding (the proportion of patients whose bleeding is controlled within a period of up to 30 minutes); severity of re-bleeding (as measured by (a) the proportion of patients requiring any further intervention and (b) the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion); length of hospital stay and other adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included six RCTs (692 participants). The overall risk of bias in the studies was low. Two studies assessed oral administration of tranexamic acid, given regularly over several days, and compared it to placebo. In the other four studies, a single application of topical tranexamic acid was compared with placebo (one study) and a combination of epinephrine and lidocaine or phenylephrine (three studies). All participants were adults. Tranexamic acid versus placeboFor our primary outcome, control of epistaxis: re-bleeding (proportion re-bleeding within 10 days), we were able to pool data from three studies. The pooled result demonstrated a benefit of tranexamic acid compared to placebo, the risk of re-bleeding reducing from 67% to 47% (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.90; three studies; 225 participants; moderate-quality evidence). When we compared the effects of oral and topical tranexamic acid separately the risk of re-bleeding with oral tranexamic acid reduced from 69% to 49%, RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.96; two studies, 157 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and with topical tranexamic acid it reduced from 66% to 43%, RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.05; single study, 68 participants). We rated the quality of evidence provided by the single study as low, therefore it is uncertain whether topical tranexamic acid is effective in stopping bleeding in the 10-day period after a single application. No study specifically sought to identify and report our primary outcome: significant adverse effects (i.e. seizures, thromboembolic events). The secondary outcome time to stop initial bleeding (proportion with bleeding controlled within 30 minutes) was measured in one study using topical tranexamic acid and there was no evidence of a difference at 30 minutes (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11; 68 participants; low-quality evidence). No studies reported the proportion of patients requiring any further intervention (e.g. repacking, surgery, embolisation). One study of oral tranexamic acid reported the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion and found no difference between groups: 5/45 (11%) versus 6/44 (14%) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.48; 89 participants; low-quality evidence). Two studies reported hospital length of stay. One study reported a significantly shorter stay in the oral tranexamic acid group (mean difference (MD) -1.60 days, 95% CI -2.49 to -0.71; 68 participants). The other study found no evidence of a difference between the groups. Tranexamic acid versus other haemostatic agentsWhen we pooled the data from three studies the proportion of patients whose bleeding stopped within 10 minutes was significantly higher in the topical tranexamic acid group compared to the group receiving another haemostatic agent (70% versus 30%: RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.90 to 2.92; 460 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). Adverse effects across all studiesFive studies recorded 'adverse effects' in a general way. None found any difference between the groups in the occurrence of minor adverse effects (e.g. mild nausea and diarrhoea, 'bad taste' of gel). In one study a patient developed a superficial thrombophlebitis of both legs following discharge, however it is not reported in which group this occurred. No "other serious adverse effect" was reported in any study.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-quality evidence that there is probably a reduction in the risk of re-bleeding with the use of either oral or topical tranexamic acid in addition to usual care in adult patients with epistaxis, compared to placebo with usual care. However, the quality of evidence relating solely to topical tranexamic acid was low (one study only), so we are uncertain whether or not topical tranexamic acid is effective in stopping bleeding in the 10-day period after a single application. We found moderate-quality evidence that topical tranexamic acid is probably better than other topical agents in stopping bleeding in the first 10 minutes. There have been only three RCTs on this subject since 1995. Since then there have been significant changes in nasal cauterisation and packing techniques (for example, techniques including nasal endoscopy and more invasive approaches such as endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation). New trials would inform us about the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in light of these developments.

Nasal packing — complications, typical duration, and antibiotics: Packing duration typically ranges from 48 hours to 72 hours or even longer, and one retrospective case series of 147 nosebleed patients showed no correlation between recurrence of nosebleeds and use of shorter packing durations, noting an 85% nosebleed control rate with packing durations of 1 to 3 days. Several studies suggest that use of systemic antibiotics following nasal packing should not be mandatory; although the 1 available systematic review did not show a significant benefit to the use of antibiotics with nasal packing, the individual studies were underpowered, so the risks and benefits should be evaluated in each patient. Reported complications include airway obstruction if packs are malpositioned or become dislodged, synechiae with long-term nasal obstruction, and nasal septal perforation with bilateral nasal packings.

Statement 2 — nasal compression for active epistaxis specifies that the clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer, with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness notes that a nose clip is an alternative to digital compression if available and tolerated, the GDG felt that a minimum of 5 minutes was necessary to control bleeding and that longer or repeated compression may be helpful, and vasoconstrictors can be applied in conjunction with compression. Although there are no studies defining duration, 15 minutes of sustained compression was used in a single identified clinical trial; despite 1 randomized controlled trial (n = 61) suggesting a possible advantage for a nose clip, the panel judged evidence insufficient to recommend a clip over simple digital compression. Evidence grading indicates Grade C with medium confidence.

### Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^111N59Ym]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular dysplasia inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by loss-of-function pathogenic variants in genes encoding proteins of the BMP signalling pathway. Up to 90% of disease-causal variants are observed in ENG and ACVRL1, with SMAD4 and GDF2 less frequently responsible for HHT. In adults, the most frequent HHT manifestations relate to iron deficiency and anaemia owing to recurrent epistaxis (nosebleeds) or bleeding from gastrointestinal telangiectases. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the lungs, liver and the central nervous system cause additional major complications and often complex symptoms, primarily due to vascular shunting, which is right-to-left through pulmonary AVMs (causing ischaemic stroke or cerebral abscess) and left-to-right through systemic AVMs (causing high cardiac output). Children usually experience isolated epistaxis; in rare cases, childhood complications occur from large AVMs in the lungs or central nervous system. Management goals encompass control of epistaxis and intestinal bleeding from telangiectases, screening for and treatment of iron deficiency (with or without anaemia) and AVMs, genetic counselling and evaluation of at-risk family members. Novel therapeutics, such as systemic antiangiogenic therapies, are actively being investigated. Although HHT is associated with increased morbidity, the appropriate screening and treatment of visceral AVMs, and the effective management of bleeding and anaemia, improves quality of life and overall survival.

### Updates on diagnostic criteria for hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia in the light of whole genome sequencing of' gene-negative' individuals recruited to the 100 000 genomes project [^116aKWof]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2024). Medium credibility.

The important conclusion for the scientific field is that there is now no evidence for an independent HHT3 locus. Notably, 11% of the citations to Cole et al have been received in the past 2 years. While further detail on recent sequencing of the 'HHT4' family is awaited, it is suggested that reference to the old linkage papersshould be superseded by direct sequencing data, in keeping with the progress of the field with whole exome and now WGS able to solve causality for many families where earlier, less sensitive sequencing methods did not identify a pathogenic variant.

For the clinical field, the most important finding is that the linkage to chromosome 5 reported in this journal 18 years ago following negative gene sequencing for ENG reflected erroneous assignment of at least one positive clinical phenotype, and this has been since confirmed by further research-based sequencing. Thus, at least one of the individuals in this family clinically managed as 'HHT affected' meeting three Curaçao Criteria in fact is/are unaffected. The family have been informed, and further testing is being performed in the clinical sphere. We therefore suggest that alongside new awareness of the paucity of clinical signs in individuals with genetically confirmed HHT, it is also important to be cognisant of the potential lack of discrimination of recurrent nosebleeds and telangiectasia at characteristic sites in family members with HHT (figure 2). Similar comments were discussed in 1998 when the Curaçao Criteria were originally developed: HHT diagnosis at that time required only two criteria and there was concern this overdiagnosed in families with HHT, where 'an individual may be diagnosed as affected on the basis of epistaxis alone (when epistaxis is common in the general population), or an incorrect interpretation of cutaneous vascular lesions, leading to problems in clinical management and hampering research efforts'. n 2023, the 'HHT3' family indicate that this potential risk of overdiagnosis can also extend to three Curaçao criteria, and that nosebleed and telangiectasia phenotypes formerly considered to represent HHT, may be present in individuals without HHT, even where one or more other family members have clear-cut, molecularly confirmed HHT.

Level of confidence in evidence is Medium, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C, based on observational studies and 2 randomized controlled trials. Benefits include effective and prompt control of nasal bleeding, reduce morbidity, protect airway, reduce need for blood products, allow for additional assessment and management to control bleeding, while risks, harm, and cost include failure to control bleeding, delay in care, can make subsequent examination more difficult, patient discomfort, mucosal damage from packing insertion/removal, damage to intranasal structures, possible infection, possible antibiotic exposure, adverse respiratory effects of nasal obstruction, and cost of packing materials and procedure. Benefit-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit over harm, policy level is Recommendation, intentional vagueness notes the duration of packing is not specified but that long durations should be avoided, and the role of patient preferences is Small to moderate. Quality improvement opportunity is to promote effective treatment for nosebleed patients.

If no, label "Bleeding is Non-Severe" and: do not give additional anticoagulant/antiplatelet doses while bleeding is active, initiate appropriate local measures, if hospitalization or transfusion is required and on a VKA consider oral or IV Vitamin K, and do not reverse anticoagulation or transfuse platelets if bleeding can be otherwise controlled. At discharge, discuss with the patient's primary team regarding continuing or discontinuing anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication.

Management of vEDS in children

Following diagnosis of vEDS in childhood by the London EDS service, individuals are primarily referred to the Inherited Cardiovascular Disease Clinic at GOSH where cardiovascular management is discussed, and individuals are followed-up in joint vEDS clinics with the London EDS service team. The proposed treatment and surveillance is mainly a consensus between authors, and is also based on recommendations in the literature. To date, no standardised international guidelines for management and surveillance in children with vEDS have been published, however specialists involved in their clinical care recommend periodic surveillance, by scanning of the aorta and arterial tree, and some form of blood pressure lowering medication.

Management of vEDS also extends beyond cardiovascular care. In this cohort a frequent gastrointestinal symptom in childhood was constipation and subsequent perirectal bleeding. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal events, advice regarding diet and use of laxative medications to prevent constipation often form an essential part of condition management in individuals with these symptoms. Joint hypermobility and joint pain can have significant impact on physical activity, especially in children. This can be addressed by rheumatology assessment, physiotherapy, and orthotics. Furthermore, involvement of haematology teams has proven to be beneficial in children who experience excessive bleeding, recurrent nosebleeds, or menorrhagia, and who can benefit from expert advice which may include access to tranexamic acid when needed.

The impact of early diagnosis and effective management of vEDS in children is felt particularly by parents, who play significant roles in implementing supportive measures for their child such as suggesting appropriate moderate aerobic exercise, being aware of signs and symptoms that require medical attention, and ensuring necessary information is provided to nursery/school. To help alleviate some of the psychological burden diagnosis of vEDS can place on children and their family, additional support is provided by the London EDS service in the form of genetic counselling, information resources for patients/parents to provide health care professionals in both routine and emergency settings, and signposting to patient charities.

### Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may be the only clinical criterion present in genetically confirmed hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^116th8LZ]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinicians and patients might be aware that PAVMs can be a familial condition, most commonly due to hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). HHT is a multisystemic vascular dysplasia, inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, and important to diagnose early because screening and interventions have led to reduced morbidity and mortality. If HHT is diagnosed in an individual with PAVMs, broadly speaking, each of their first-degree relatives (child, sibling and parent) has a 50% chance of having HHT, and at least 50% of HHT-affected relatives are expected to have PAVMs. Establishing an HHT diagnosis in the family is therefore critical for optimal management of the greatest number of individuals.

A definite clinical diagnosis of HHT requires three of four Curaçao criteria, namely, recurrent spontaneous nosebleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectasia at characteristic sites, visceral involvement (such as gastrointestinal telangiectasia or pulmonary, hepatic, cerebral or spinal arteriovenous malformations) and a positive family history. Many consider that if HHT is present, these clinical features will be clearly evident and do not appreciate the importance of suspecting the diagnosis and offering HHT management to patients with one or two criteria as recommended(online supplemental data 1). This issue was exemplified by the April 2020 release of the National Health Service (NHS) National Genomic Test Directory (online supplemental data 1). For a patient who is the first of their family considered for HHT (the proband), HHT gene testing eligibility was contingent on them already having three Curaçao criteria, that is, a definite clinical diagnosis of HHT. Thus, patients with PAVMs were only eligible if they had two further Curaçao criteria from nosebleeds, telangiectasia and a family history of HHT.

### Epistaxis [^115fCA3f]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Epistaxis is a common occurrence. The estimated lifetime incidence of epistaxis is approximately 60% and it ranges in severity from a minor nuisance to a life-threatening hemorrhage. Evaluation of recurrent or severe cases includes a search for underlying causes, such as bleeding disorders and neoplasia. Many techniques, materials, and procedures treat nasal bleeding effectively and sometimes more than one treatment must be used. Otolaryngologists must be prepared to deal with severe or refractory bleeding through the use of medications, packing materials, and radiologic or surgical interventions. This article reviews nasal vascular anatomy, common causes of epistaxis, and treatments, including biomaterials and minimally invasive surgical techniques.

Introduction

Haemorrhage from the nose is formally referred to as "epistaxis". Haemostasis within the nose can be compromised by mucosal abnormalities, vessel pathology, or coagulation disorders. The aetiology of epistaxis is divided into groups: local and systemic factors. Local factors include the following: trauma, local inflammatory reactions, foreign bodies, postsurgical anatomical deformities, intranasal tumours, chemical inhalants, nasal-prong oxygen administration, and continuous positive airway pressure therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea. Systemic causes of epistaxis include the following: vascular disorders, especially hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT); blood dyscrasias; hematologic malignancies; and drugs affecting the normal clotting mechanism. Epistaxis arising from the anterior septal area (anterior epistaxis) is more common in children and young adults; it is the most common type of epistaxis and is more often venous in origin. This condition is usually responsive to treatment because it is readily accessible for nasal packing if bleeding does not resolve spontaneously. Therefore, endovascular therapy is usually not indicated for anterior epistaxis.

Approximately 5% of epistaxis episodes arise from the posterior and superior portions of the nasal cavity, and the majority of posterior epistaxis episodes arise from the arteries of the septum. Posterior epistaxis is more common in older patients than in children The most common factors associated with posterior epistaxis are hypertension, acetylsalicylic acid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, previous episodes of epistaxis, alcohol use, and anticoagulant use. However, the majority of these cases are idiopathic. Refractory epistaxis is defined as recurrent or persistent bleeding after appropriate packing or multiple episodes of epistaxis during a short period of time, each requiring medical attention. Embolisation for intractable epistaxis was first reported as an alternative to surgery and other methods by Sokoloff.

Epistaxis in HHT

HHT, a hereditary disease, is associated with skin and mucosal telangiectasias and arteriovenous shunts most commonly involving the lung, brain, and liver. It is easily recognised in individuals displaying the classic triad of epistaxis, telangiectasia, and a relevant family history.

Epistaxis is caused by spontaneous bleeding from telangiectasias of the nasal mucosa (Fig. 2 B). Recurrent epistaxis begins by the age of 10–21 years and the severity of the episodes increases with age.

Among numerous local and surgical treatments, transcatheter embolotherapy has been used with the intent of decreasing the number and severity of epistaxis episodes. Microparticle embolisation should decrease flow to the nasal mucosa, but care must be taken to leave the proximal arteries patent. Embolisation with coils should be avoided because the artery cannot be made again accessible distal to the proximal occlusion in recurrent epistaxis. Preventive embolisation is considered to have a questionable long-term effect.

Interventions for nosebleed — initial measures and packing utilization: The majority of nosebleeds originate from the nasal septum, although the lateral nasal wall has a rich vascular supply as well. Initial ("first-line") treatment can include combinations of direct nasal compression, application of topical agents including vasoconstrictors, cautery of the bleeding site with chemicals or electrocautery, or packing with a variety of absorbable and nonabsorbable materials. In the NEDS review, 19.7% of emergency room visits for epistaxis involved treatment with nasal packing; among those requiring packing, Fifty-two percent also had nasal cautery; 41% had anterior packing alone; and 7% had anterior and posterior nasal packing performed.

Epistaxis risk factors — conditions and exposures: Risk factors associated with nosebleed include prior nasal or sinus surgery, nasal or facial trauma, nasal cannula oxygen, CPAP use (continuous positive airway pressure), intranasal medication or drug use, use of medications that impair coagulation and/or platelet function, personal or family history of bleeding disorder, and chronic kidney or liver disease. Nosebleed may be the presenting symptom for patients with inherited or acquired bleeding disorders, and in a cohort study of 113 children with von Willebrand disease it was the presenting symptom in 31% and 56% of these patients have had nosebleeds at some point; large claims databases identified nosebleeds as one of the most common bleeding symptoms, with 5% of patients with immune thrombocytopenia having a nosebleed.

Pediatric epistaxis, posterior epistaxis, and comorbidities: In childhood, 3 out of 4 children experience at least 1 episode of epistaxis; across 4-state emergency department databases, children with epistaxis had a mean age of 7.5 years and 57.4% were male, and procedures to control epistaxis were required in 6.9% of these children, with 93.5% coded as simple anterior epistaxis control. About 5% to 10% of nosebleeds are posterior, and one series demonstrated that posterior epistaxis accounted for 5% of all patients with nosebleed treated in the emergency department or admitted to the hospital. Forty-five percent of patients hospitalized for epistaxis has systemic illnesses that likely contributed to the nosebleeds, and in the NEDS study 15% were on long-term anticoagulation, 33% had a history of hypertension, and 0.9% had an underlying coagulation disorder.

### Standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: International Consensus Report [^111tJqeV]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Prior to the recent advances in the understanding of HHT pathophysiology and therapeutics that have transformed the HHT therapeutic landscape, management of HHT‐associated bleeding was primarily procedural, largely through the use of local ablative procedures and more drastic surgical operations (such as nasal closure operations for recurrent epistaxis). These treatments were largely studied retrospectively and published in the medical literature as case series. However, the past decade has brought with it a paradigm shift in the management of bleeding in HHT from primarily procedural to primarily based in effective medical therapeutics. Along with this shift have come the first major randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials in HHT of antifibrinolytic and antiangiogenic drugs to manage bleeding. These pioneering studies and their promising results are responsible in large part for the paradigm shift in treatment and the emerging recognition from the pharmaceutical industry as well as government funding agencies of the serious unmet need in HHT. However, they have also highlighted a key deficiency in the field: a lack of standardized terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria that has made study interpretation, comparison between studies, and development of new study protocols unnecessarily challenging. As long‐overdue therapeutic development in HHT accelerates and the field matures with large, randomized, pivotal clinical trials paving the way for the first drug approvals from regulatory agencies, the standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria is a necessity. Such standardization and elimination of heterogeneity is certain to improve evaluation of patient characteristics, reporting of clinical outcomes, and assessment of the clinical benefit of therapeutics. Therefore, the Global Research and Medical Advisory Board (GRMAB) of the Cure HHT Foundation, the largest international patient advocacy organization in HHT, convened an international group to develop the first global standardization consensus report on bleeding in HHT.

Hypertension and epistaxis — evidence summary: A recent systematic review showed an association of hypertension with epistaxis (odds ratio [OR], 1.532; 95% CI, 1.181–1.986), but no study supported any causal relationship; the prevalence of hypertension in patients with epistaxis has been reported to be between 24% and 64%. Nosebleeds are also a recognized problem for patients with known inherited bleeding disorders and are common in patients taking anticoagulants, and new-generation anticoagulants appear to increase the risk of nosebleed.

Epistaxis management in patients using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications — The statement addresses "patients using anticoagulation medications… and antiplatelet medications" and notes they may "have a large volume of blood loss (> 250 mL)" and "require blood transfusion for treatment". Even for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or heparin users, "the first step… is the use of 'first-line' treatments, including nasal compression, vasoconstrictors, moisturizing or lubricating agents, nasal cautery, and/or nasal packing". Reversal carries risks: "overcorrection of a patient's INR can increase risk of thromboembolic events" and "4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant activated factor VII… may also induce hypercoagulability". For VKAs, "reversal strategy should be driven by the patient's clinical condition and bleeding severity as well as INR", and "Patients with an INR > 4.5 are more likely to require hospital admission and have prolonged hospital stays". For direct oral anticoagulants, "clotting assays such as prothrombin time/INR and partial thromboplastin time do not reliably reflect the degree of anticoagulation". Regarding antiplatelet therapy, the PATCH trial found transfusion recipients were "more likely to have an in-hospital adverse event and a higher 90-day mortality rate", and "Clinicians should balance the chance for benefit against the risk for harm when considering platelet transfusion". Adjunctive agents "do not specifically reverse… but they do improve hemostasis and are effective in treating mucocutaneous bleeding"; in a small randomized trial of antiplatelet users, topical tranexamic acid (TXA) achieved cessation within "10 minutes" with "73% vs 29%, respectively; P < .001" compared with standard anterior nasal packing.

Table 10. Patient FAQs for nosebleeds — self-care, escalation, and precautions are detailed as follows: Prevention measures include eliminating digital trauma and vigorous nose blowing, using proper nasal hygiene, nasal saline gels or sprays, and possibly a bedside humidifier. During an active bleed, leaning forward and pinching the soft part of the nose for at least 5 minutes is advised, and if the nosebleed slows continue holding for a full 15 minutes. Over-the-counter options include nasal saline gel or spray; oxymetazoline or phenylephrine may be used after blowing out clots by spraying 2 sprays in the bleeding nostril and holding pressure for 5 minutes, which may be repeated once. If bleeding does not stop, or is severe or persistent, or if feeling weak or lightheaded, patients should call a medical professional; seek immediate care at an emergency room department or call 911. After cauterization, patients should treat the nose with care and avoid nose blowing, strenuous activity, heavy lifting, and placing cotton or tissues in the nose for at least a week; saline gel or spray may be used 1 to 3 times a day. For those on blood thinners, promptly check with the prescribing clinician, and if the nosebleed is severe, do not take additional doses until evaluated and such evaluation should not be delayed.

Epistaxis — clinical setting and procedure for nasal packing specifies that anterior nasal packing can be performed by nonspecialist clinicians in the outpatient office or emergency department with resources to perform anterior rhinoscopy, ideally including illumination and specula, suction to clear blood and clot, and forceps placement with lubrication such as antibiotic ointments; patients with resorbable packing are often managed as outpatients, and uncomplicated anterior epistaxis controlled with packing can usually be managed safely as outpatients even after nonresorbable packing, whereas severe nosebleeds requiring posterior packing are usually managed in an emergency department or hospital and the care of most patients who require posterior packing should involve an otolaryngology consultant, with patients potentially requiring intensive cardiopulmonary monitoring due to reported major cardiopulmonary complications and a debated "nasopulmonary reflex".

Epistaxis — Nasal compression technique and adjunct vasoconstrictors: Digital compression to the lower third of the nose is depicted, and while performing nasal compression clinicians may concurrently obtain history from the patient or caregiver. Indications for more aggressive management, such as packing or cautery, include a failure to stop or slow bleeding with compression or a nosebleed judged to be life-threatening or unlikely to respond to further compression alone, and continued bleeding out the nose or into the posterior pharynx during compression may indicate a posterior bleeding site. The use of vasoconstrictors around the time of applying compression may be helpful but is based on expert opinion rather than randomized controlled trials; in a retrospective review of 60 patients, epistaxis control — defined as brisk bleeding slowed within 5 minutes and bleeding stopped within 30 minutes — was achieved in 65% by spraying the nose with oxymetazoline. A French guideline recommended vasoconstrictors if bleeding continued after nasal compression, and vasoconstrictors can be applied with nasal sprays or by intranasal insertion of cotton impregnated with these medications.

### Nosebleeds in children… [^114zQpov]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Although annoying, nosebleeds are generally not serious. They are very common, affecting about 30% of children younger than 5 years and 50% of children 5 years and older. The bleeding originates in the nose and may come out of one or both sides of the nose or the mouth. Bleeding from the front of the nose is called an anterior nosebleed. Bleeding from the back of the nose is called a posterior nosebleed. Dry air and crusting in the nose may make the nose even more likely to bleed. Anything that dries out or injures the inside of the nose can cause a nosebleed. This includes inflammation from an upper respiratory infection or allergies, use of decongestant nasal sprays, heated indoor spaces, high altitudes, dry climates, injuring your face or nose, and inserting anything into your nose. Most nosebleeds are anterior nose bleeds. Rarely, posterior nose bleeds occur from larger blood vessels in the back of the nose.

This may look like bleeding that mostly goes down the throat rather than out the nose, and it may be difficult to stop. Medical conditions that prevent blood from clotting may cause or worsen nosebleeds in children. After the bleeding stops, there may be large clumps of blood that come out of the nose or mouth. This is normal, as it is the body's way of stopping the bleeding. If the bleeding does not stop after 30 minutes, the volume of blood is more than 1 cup, or your child is having difficulty breathing or is vomiting from swallowing blood, seek emergency medical attention. To prevent nosebleeds, keep the skin of the nose hydrated to make it less prone to injury; use a saline nasal spray at least 1 to 2 times a day to moisturize the nasal passages; moisturize the air with a humidifier in the bedroom; gently apply a. Treatment depends on the cause of bleeding and is determined by your medical professional.

Nosebleeds often improve or stop with the prevention methods listed above. If a nosebleed does not stop with pressure, a doctor may put something in the nose called a nasal pack to put pressure on the bleeding. Sometimes a doctor will put a medication on the area of bleeding to cause the bleeding to stop; this is called cauterization. The inside of the nose is numbed, and the bleeding blood vessel is sealed.
